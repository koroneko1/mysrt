176
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,545
You guys want some?

177
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:44,836
Hey.

178
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:46,701
You got ice cream here.

179
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:48,656
What a mess.

180
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,182
You got ice cream too.

181
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,133
What should you do then?

182
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:54,293
Here.

183
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,095
You’re clean.

184
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,095
Get this!

185
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:00,012
Are you messing with me?

186
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:00,954
Stop it!

187
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:02,196
Stop cleaning it for me.

188
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,578
1, 2, 3.

189
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,179
What is this?

190
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:17,764
A heart.

191
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:19,938
Come on. Let’s take a photo.

192
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,952
Can we join?

193
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,056
What are you two doing?

194
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,071
What are you doing?

195
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,952
I’m taking you traveling but you’re messing with me.

196
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,026
I’m not messing with you.

197
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,218
Just giving you a drink.

198
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,465
As a thank-you for taking me out.

199
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:08,384
Okay.

200
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:11,977
Let me feed you.

201
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:15,983
I can feed myself.

202
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:17,965
If you don’t let me feed you,

203
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,910
I will…

204
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,726
You will what?

205
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,912
I will…

206
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:29,382
shout “Teacher Prince is so cute.”

207
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,694
Do you think I won’t do it?

208
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,335
Teacher Prince --

209
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:37,370
You!

210
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,080
What is this?

211
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,272
You’re blushing?

212
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,886
Can’t you tell if I’m blushing or annoyed?

213
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,131
Freakin’ cute.

214
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,705
Still have a headache?

215
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,016
Just a little.

216
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,368
Are you sure?

217
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,884
I have such a caring doctor here. Of course, I recover fast.

218
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:43,893
Here.

219
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,200
Next time, if you don’t feel well, let me know.

220
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,268
Don’t wait until it gets bad like this.

221
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:54,149
Roger that.

222
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:58,999
You always make me worry.

223
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:08,328
Hey!

224
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:12,762
Yeah!

225
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:15,575
This is a real paradise.

226
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,135
I will never leave this bed.

227
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,535
Mesa, what about our trip to Tha Chang?

228
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,955
Damn you!

229
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,788
My bed is still available.

230
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:39,826
Would you like to share it with me?

231
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:41,440
No.

232
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,007
Hey,

233
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,404
I’m not doing anything bad.

234
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:48,090
It’s not that.

235
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:50,964
I’m meeting my friends tonight.

236
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,466
I’m going home to freshen up.

237
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,033
You’re already cute.

238
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,022
No need to freshen up.

239
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,125
Shut up!

240
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:20,453
I’m leaving now.

241
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:24,007
Let me walk you out.

242
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:45,945
Yes, Mom.

243
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,672
Yes. I took them to the hotel already.

244
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,015
Dr. Fah just walked me to the car.

245
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:56,991
What?

246
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,135
Are you serious?

247
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:00,666
Okay.

248
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:01,814
Sure.

249
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,829
What is it?

250
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:09,222
My mom…

251
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:11,347
is inviting you to come over.

252
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,852
Really?

253
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:14,285
But

254
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,253
if you don’t want to, it’s fine.

255
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:19,671
I get it.

256
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,570
I do.

257
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,152
Let’s go meet your mom.

258
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,217
Hey.

259
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:32,883
My house is probably unlike any other house.

260
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,688
I don’t mind at all no matter what it looks like.

261
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,342
I’m even thankful you invited me.

262
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,213
This is it.

263
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,307
Wait.

264
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,678
Where are you taking me?

265
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,468
Hey.

266
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:29,231
Where are we?

267
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,858
Don’t tell me this is your house.

268
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:33,550
It is.

269
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,582
But it’s not the main residence.

270
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,829
The main one is being renovated.

271
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:03,506
Na Chiang Dao.

272
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,016
That sounds familiar.

273
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,948
The last name of the ancient monarch of the North.

274
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,397
The last name of the ancient monarch of the North?

275
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,924
Are you descended from the Northern royalty?

276
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:23,242
Why didn’t you tell me?

277
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:25,342
I could have dressed up more properly.

278
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,538
It’s fine.

279
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:29,290
We’re a laid-back family.

280
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:30,636
Have a seat.

281
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,807
You’ve finally come?

282
00:21:58,603 --> 00:21:59,352
What, Mom?

283
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,863
Do you think I can’t tell?

284
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,840
Every time you call me, you always say Dr. Fah this, Dr. Fah that.

285
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,274
When will you two become boyfriends?

286
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:06,235
Hey, Prince.

287
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,617
To be honest, I still miss you, Prince.

288
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:11,822
Is it okay if we get back together?

289
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,468
Hello, Mom.

290
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,500
Your house is very nice.

291
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,918
Prince,

292
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:53,828
didn’t you tell your friend we don’t speak the way other people do?

293
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:58,728
I’m terribly sorry, my lady.

294
00:22:59,027 --> 00:22:59,909
My apologies.

295
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:02,665
I’m not familiar with this kind of stuff.

296
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:04,503
I didn’t mean to.

297
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,689
I was just kidding.

298
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,793
Please speak normally.

299
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:14,907
Yes?

300
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,652
Don’t be shocked.

301
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,231
I said you can speak a normal language.

302
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:20,797
I was just messing with you.

303
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,263
Please make yourself at home.

304
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,226
Where did you get this outfit from?

305
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,245
It’s gorgeous.

306
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:29,916
I ordered it online.

307
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,066
There were lots to choose from.

308
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,334
Very easy to wear.

309
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,399
I’m going to get changed now.

310
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:36,520
Make yourself at home.

311
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,050
I’ll be right back.

312
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:43,616
What is this?

313
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,927
I’m so confused.

314
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:49,358
My mom loves to prank visitors.

315
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:52,202
I told you we’re a laid-back family.

316
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:08,142
This is my office.

317
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:12,126
I like to read and work here.

318
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,848
Wow.

319
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:18,713
So you literally are a prince.

320
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:21,833
I thought it was just your name.

321
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,546
Who would have thought ‘Prince’ was a real prince?

322
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,097
It’s not what you think.

323
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:30,803
I live a normal life.

324
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,110
That means the perfume and the designer bag are authentic.

325
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,648
I’m sorry.

326
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,647
It’s okay. I get you.

327
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:45,905
If I were you, I wouldn’t want people to know either.

328
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,473
Dr. Fah,

329
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:56,921
I have a photo album of Prince as a kid to show you.

330
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:57,576
Wanna see?

331
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,140
Of course, I do.

332
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,803
Look at this one.

333
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:04,299
Prince was walking around the house naked.

334
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,021
Mom!

335
00:25:06,258 --> 00:25:07,362
Not that one.

336
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,479
Not this one?

337
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,875
This one then.

338
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:13,664
He just peed his bed.

339
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:15,347
Look. He’s in a basket.

340
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,330
Mom, these photos are embarrassing.

341
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,289
Why are you showing them to him?

342
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,190
Don’t be embarrassed.

343
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,335
You guys are boyfriends. No need to be embarrassed.

344
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,171
Do you think I can’t tell?

345
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:31,034
Every time you call back from the mountain,

346
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:34,494
you always say Dr. Fah this, Dr. Fah that.

347
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:37,209
If you’re not boyfriends, then what are you two?

348
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,066
You’re misunderstanding.

349
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,094
How?

350
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:44,741
Help me correct her.

351
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,740
So…

352
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,652
What did he say about me?

353
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:56,720
He called and told me

354
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,782
“Dr. Fah helped get the spider off my hair.”

355
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:04,953
“Dr. Fah helped me when I passed out.”

356
00:26:04,953 --> 00:26:06,679
“And Dr. Fah–”

357
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,090
That’s enough, Mom.

358
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,779
Come on. I need to go somewhere else.

359
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,073
Fine. Let’s go then.

360
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:15,377
Are you shy?

361
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:16,826
Mom!

362
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,650
Dr. Fah, please take care of Prince up there.

363
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,383
Of course.

364
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:24,790
You too, Prince.

365
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:29,331
If you want any help up there, send someone to inform me.

366
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:38,833
Let me go get the car for you.

367
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:42,816
So mother and son can have more time to catch up.

368
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,313
You’re handsome and lovely.

369
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,593
Thanks a lot.

370
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,403
You can follow the butler.

371
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:52,815
Please, Mr. Kuafah.

372
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:55,575
Detch, not the truck.

373
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,586
Chot will need it for the farm work.

374
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:58,701
Of course, ma’am.

375
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,332
Let him lead the way.

376
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,055
You choose wisely.

377
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:10,768
What are you saying?

378
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,436
Dr. Fah.

379
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,508
I like him a lot.

380
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,524
When will you two become boyfriends?

381
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:21,285
Boyfriends what?

382
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,400
Don’t be shy.

383
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:28,516
Everyone can tell you guys are not just a ship.

384
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,042
You guys are real.

385
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,232
Mom!

386
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,753
I hope you two are boyfriends soon.

387
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,068
Yes?

388
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,343
Don’t be shy.

389
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:41,716
Wait! You have to meet up with your friends tonight, don't you?

390
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:42,778
Yes.

391
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:47,470
Knot just got back from the states so we’re gathering to welcome him home.

392
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:51,833
But you probably see Sincere there.

393
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,453
It’s all right.

394
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,913
Sincere and I have nothing to do with each other anymore.

395
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:15,664
Uncle Detch told me to take this car.

396
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:17,330
Are you sure about this?

397
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,464
I am.

398
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,631
Sorry. The other cars are at the car wash.

399
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,589
Drive safe.

400
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,017
I’ll see you later.

401
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,596
I missed you, Mom.

402
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,400
I missed you too.

403
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:32,201
Travel safe.

404
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,175
Please look out for him, Dr. Fah.

405
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:36,427
Absolutely.

406
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,505
Bye-bye.

407
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:43,310
Goodbye.

408
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,648
It’s just a time-killing meal.

409
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,979
You don’t need to take me to a fancy restaurant.

410
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,819
Consider it a treat.

411
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:00,654
Hey, Prince.

412
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:05,684
You’re coming to Knot’s party too?

413
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:11,772
Yeah.

414
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:13,562
Okay.

415
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,617
Very good then.

416
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:15,801
I can just talk to you here.

417
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,041
Do you mind leaving us so we can have a private talk?

418
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,807
You can just say it, Sincere.

419
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,563
You can stay.

420
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:30,922
Come on, Prince.

421
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,563
We haven’t met for so long.

422
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,233
I hope your friend won’t be so mean.

423
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:44,951
Of course.

424
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,963
Since old friends get to meet once in a while.

425
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,223
What is it?

426
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:07,439
Wow!

427
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:09,513
That’s harsh.

428
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,214
Just came to say hi.

429
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:15,112
My mom told me you’re a volunteer teacher up on the mountain.

430
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:17,702
Yeah.

431
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,200
How are you doing? Is the job okay?

432
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:22,941
Okay.

433
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,071
Nice weather.

434
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,045
Did you meet that guy up there?

435
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:32,966
Something like that.

436
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,359
I should go straight to the point.

437
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,486
To be honest,

438
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,679
I still miss you, Prince.

439
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,940
I have always missed you.

440
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,793
Is it okay if we get back…

441
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,365
You!

442
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,567
Let’s go.

443
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:17,045
Slow down.

444
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,629
What are you doing?

445
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,533
Getting us back together.

446
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,030
So you intended to make me jealous?

447
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:34,848
Are you jealous?

448
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,893
I’m so jealous that I doubt you’re able to make it up to me.

449
00:31:57,178 --> 00:31:59,437
Was it good enough?

450
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,027
My friends are expecting me.

451
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:21,476
I’m coming with you.

452
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:30,756
So that they know you have a doctor taking care of you up on the mountain.

453
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:35,287
Come on.

454
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:41,577
Hi, everyone.

455
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:43,132
I’m Kuafah,

456
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:45,392
Prince’s close friend.

457
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,808
Don’t worry.

458
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,473
I’m not trying to steal Prince.

459
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,113
I just want Prince to be with someone who has more time for him.

460
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:26,032
Prince, this way.

461
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:28,377
Hi, Prince.

462
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,013
Have a seat here.

463
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:40,145
Hi, everyone.

464
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:41,671
I’m Kuafah,

465
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:43,951
Prince’s close friend.

466
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,248
Hi. Cheers.

467
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,121
What a big entrance there.

468
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,917
Just want someone here to know

469
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,889
whom Prince is talking to.

470
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,875
Don’t worry.

471
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,490
I’m not trying to steal Prince.

472
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:37,045
Because someone like him needs a guy who has time for him.

473
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,185
What do you mean?

474
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,616
I heard you’re a doctor.

475
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:45,610
You must be very busy.

476
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:47,684
And?

477
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,184
It’s nice when you’re together.

478
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,446
But when you guys are apart,

479
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,350
you won’t have any free time at all.

480
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:59,174
I’m not judging or anything.

481
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:05,111
I just want Prince to be with someone who has more time for him.

482
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:09,216
I hope you understand.

483
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,016
Hey.

484
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,282
Hey.

485
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,162
Are you okay?

486
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:46,557
I am.

487
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,076
Enjoy your drink.

488
00:36:01,448 --> 00:36:03,448
Let’s drink.

489
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:05,671
For Knot who just got back

490
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:08,194
and for Prince who is taking a break from the mountain.

491
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:10,649
Until we’re drunk.

492
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,488
Cheers!

493
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,593
How’s your study?

494
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:18,619
Good?

495
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:19,217
Not really.

496
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,534
I should take this call.

497
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,078
Yes?

498
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:49,689
(Where are you?)

499
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:52,105
(JJ and I are dressing up for Tha Chang.)

500
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,604
You guys go ahead.

501
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,565
(What?)

502
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:56,429
I don’t feel like going.

503
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:58,191
(Where are you?)

504
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,278
Doesn’t matter where I am.

505
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:02,827
I’m going back to rest now.

506
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:05,724
Okay.

507
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:11,577
Hey!

508
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,322
Are you okay?

509
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:15,017
I…

510
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,392
can’t…breathe.

511
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,360
Waiter!

512
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:21,305
What is going on?

513
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,658
She can’t breathe.

514
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:26,257
We can take her inside.

515
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:27,494
There’s a first aid room here.

516
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,470
Damn! Prince is drunk already.

517
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,900
He starts dancing.

518
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,394
I’m not drunk.

519
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:40,728
Bottoms up!

520
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:48,091
Hey!

521
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:49,570
Doctor!

522
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,160
You can’t even walk.

523
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:56,640
Stay here.

524
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:59,674
But Kuafah…

525
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,378
I think that’s the real him.

526
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:06,366
Let him go.

527
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:11,227
Just drink.

528
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:12,892
Cheers!

529
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:18,994
You want more?

530
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:19,946
Yes.

531
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:21,704
Keep going, guys.

532
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,439
Cheers!

533
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,698
Your pulse rate is getting better.

534
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:51,084
Don’t drink so much next time.

535
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:52,048
And get a good rest.

536
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:54,169
Okay.

537
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,125
Thank you, sir.

538
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,597
We will take it from here.

539
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:58,833
Sure.

540
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,314
- Thank you.
- Of course.

541
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,484
Prince.

542
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,933
Prince.

543
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,179
You’re drunk.

544
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:11,419
Should we go home?

545
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:12,478
You can crash with me tonight.

546
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:16,487
Where is Fah?

547
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:17,569
Fah?

548
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:21,203
I guess he’s occupied.

549
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:24,001
Might be having fun with the girl over there.

550
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:30,578
You better not say what you don’t know.

551
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:34,398
Because if it’s not true,

552
00:39:35,337 --> 00:39:36,694
it’s shame on you.

553
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:42,577
Thank you for saving my life.

554
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:54,684
Prince,

555
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:56,316
let’s go.

556
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,359
Go?

557
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,333
I’m not going.

558
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:01,977
Don’t be stubborn.

559
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:02,947
Come on.

560
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,424
Not going.

561
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:08,235
May I please take Prince home?

562
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,645
Sure.

563
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:12,124
Come on. Get up.

564
00:40:15,837 --> 00:40:16,685
Bye.

565
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,737
Bye, guys.

566
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:22,288
Bye.

567
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:24,195
You all right?

568
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:25,620
I’m fine.

569
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,288
Why did you come back?

570
00:41:03,312 --> 00:41:05,198
Why didn’t you spend more time with the girl back there?

571
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,238
She couldn’t breathe so I gave her first aid.

572
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:13,314
But you suddenly changed.

573
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,025
I got something on my mind.

574
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:22,158
Don’t you think our relationship is weird?

575
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:24,387
Weird, how?

576
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:28,952
Today, I just learned about your family.

577
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:32,686
And you know nothing about mine.

578
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,959
You have no idea what I am or what I do.

579
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:38,758
When we both go home one day,

580
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:41,396
I might not have time to take care of you.

581
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:42,887
Can you handle that?

582
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:04,186
That’s hard to process.

583
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:05,679
I don’t follow.

584
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:17,288
I don’t think I make any sense now.

585
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:58,830
When I fall in love, I never have to do anything like this.

586
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:01,715
I've never felt the need to pursue anybody.

587
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:06,056
He must be the first prey to make a tiger like me fall.

588

Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul

589
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:37,632
Since you returned from Bangkok, you guys have been lovey-dovey.

590
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:38,853
Are you two boyfriends already?

591
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,303
I haven’t got a chance to say it yet.

592
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,701
I feel like things are going fast.

593
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,672
You two are not boyfriends yet?

594
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:47,954
You guys will leave this mountain in three days!

595
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:49,321
Fah, bad news.

596
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,800
The villagers are having bad diarrhea.

597
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,630
Hey, your hand is burning hot.

598
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,174
You’re burning up. Why didn’t you tell me?

599
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:57,528
Why are you here?

600
00:43:57,528 --> 00:43:59,049
To find the medicines for malaria.

601
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:01,460
If Prince doesn’t get cured now, he might be dead.

602
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,916
Let me take care of Prince.

603
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:05,530
We can see here that you can’t take care of him at all.
