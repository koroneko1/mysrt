1
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,833
Aod.

2
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,250
What's wrong?

3
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,125
Nightmare?

4
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,833
No.

5
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,166
What is it? Why don't you tell me?

6
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,000
-It's nothing.
-Aod.

7
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,708
Whoever takes what is mine

8
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,208
must die!

9
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,208
TOH MIN-JUN

10
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,083
Give me your hands.

11
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,250
It's already washed.

12
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,250
Is it true that your argument with friends
was the reason for the band's break-up?

13
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
I wouldn't ask that kind of question.

14
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,708
What is your channel?

15
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,250
Sky News.

16
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,708
Sky News?

17
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,333
-Sky News! Okay, go ahead.
-Sky News!

18
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,791
Very good. Great start.

19
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,916
Wait a second.

20
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,416
The company will announce this later.

21
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,833
Toh Min-Jun is very tired.

22
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,041
We really have to go.

23
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,125
-Come on, stay a little longer.
-No, he's very tired.

24
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,708
-He's very tired. She told you.
-We should leave now.

25
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,541
Please move.

26
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,125
Move. Make way.

27
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,833
Make way please, or I will spray at you.

28
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,916
-Don't push.
-I really will.

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,083
-No. Hold up.
-Please calm down. We'll announce later.

30
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,708
Go…

31
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,375
Where are you, Yot? Where is the van?

32
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,583
Hurry up.

33
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,666
An accident?

34
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,166
How are we going to get back?

35
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,458
Hurry up. Go.

36
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,875
No. Please. Stop!

37
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,833
Calm down!

38
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,416
Take it easy, keep your distance.

39
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,291
Please stop.

40
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,250
Hey! Why are you standing on the road?

41
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,041
You wanna die, you assholes? Huh?

42
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,250
What a chance!
Wait for me! Wait! Toh Min-Jun.

43
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,708
What the hell?

44
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,333
Just once, please take a picture.
Oh, please.

45
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop.

46
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,500
Stop.

47
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,166
Got you! I studied Korean, you see.

48
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,458
Awesome, First. Go get him.

49
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,166
Why? Just one selfie.

50
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,583
That is Toh Min-Jun.

51
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
I'm a Youtuber called Pampam.

52
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,333
I don't know.

53
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,541
Where are you going?

54
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,083
-You need a ride?
-Let's go!

55
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,041
Yes. Let's go!

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,583
Get in the van. Guard him.

57
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,291
Guard him…

58
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,291
Guard him!

59
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,166
Hurry up!

60
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,916
It was chaotic at the mall.

61
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,750
You won't pass the probation like this.

62
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,833
So many fans, Shon.

63
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,875
This place is worn-out.

64
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,875
-We tried our best.
-Are we staying here?

65
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,041
Here?

66
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,083
Wow!

67
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,875
Greetings, Luang Loong.

68
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,166
Be well.

69
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,958
We're here to visit Phra Nong

70
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,125
and attend Aod's ordination.

71
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,333
But…

72
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,791
we can't reach Phra Nong.

73
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,416
Phra Nong has gone to India
for about a month.

74
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,708
I'm taking care of everything now.

75
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,500
Didn't he tell you?

76
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,958
Yes, he did.

77
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,625
We were just on tours

78
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,625
and had just returned to Thailand.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,833
Hey, Fahlan.

80
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,041
Where are Aod and Novice Nott?

81
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,583
They would have been
standing here making noise.

82
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,875
If it weren't from Phra Nong,

83
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,375
we wouldn't have known
that he would be ordained.

84
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,791
Well…

85
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,708
we have to hold off the ordination.

86
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,333
The thing is…

87
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,333
Aod is not well.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,958
Will you watch your step?

89
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,291
Are you supposed to be a mom or a dad?

90
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,291
A mommy, of course.

91
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,083
We all have boobs and VJJs.

92
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,500
With a VJJ, you can't call us dads.

93
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,708
And that handsome man
behind you, is that your husband?

94
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,250
Don't say that in the temple.

95
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,416
No, Novice.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,083
-I'm the bottom.
-Hey!

97
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,875
Stop joking.

98
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,791
Actually, the three of us
were ordained here.

99
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,083
You sure are ugly when you lie.

100
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,041
Hey, Novice.

101
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,250
You better grow up soon
and leave the monastery.

102
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,958
-So then, you can be my man.
-Let me see if you're ready.

103
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,416
Is your junk ready?

104
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,625
-Let me see.
-Let me.

105
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,041
Just a little.

106
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,375
Let me see.

107
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
Help! Novice Nott!

108
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,666
Nott…

109
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,625
-Come here.
-Hey!

110
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,041
What are you doing?

111
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,666
You grow fast, big thingy.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,083
You said you'd die.

113
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,541
And here you are, Aod.

114
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,208
Hello.

115
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,458
Every time I meet you,

116
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,750
you always have a new nose.

117
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,750
My new series.

118
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,708
Beautiful, isn't it?

119
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:56,750
Did a shaman do it?

120
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,458
It doesn't go with your face.

121
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,833
Piss off.

122
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,083
And First,
how long do you have left to live?

123
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,083
You have the same old foul mouth.

124
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,916
I don't think you're ill at all.

125
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,375
But you're all still the same.

126
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,166
Cute as always.

127
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
Aww, aren't you sweet?

128
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,833
How have you been doing, Mr. Toh?

129
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,375
I'm fine.

130
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,083
Let me introduce you to someone here.

131
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,500
This is Shon, my manager…

132
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,958
and the boss of both First and Balloon.

133
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,791
I'm Min-Jun's friend.

134
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:30,750
We're friends.

135
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,875
-That's enough.
-We're friends.

136
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,291
That's enough. Keep your mouth shut.

137
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,166
Shut it.

138
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,333
Nott, these aunties were harassing me.

139
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,791
Who do you say were harassing you?

140
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,000
That would be enough.

141
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,958
Apologize to them.

142
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,833
Why should I?

143
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,833
Novice.

144
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,500
You should apologize when you did wrong.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,375
Apologize to them.

146
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,875
-Come on.
-I'm sorry.

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,416
This is Novice Namnua.

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,541
His parents got divorced
and his dad moved to the city to work.

149
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,083
He was left to be ordained here.

150
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,875
I assigned him to take care of Aod.

151
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,875
How about the other novices?

152
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,916
They left the monastery
to continue their education.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,958
Novice Nott just got accepted
at the Buddhist University in Bangkok.

154
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,875
Wait…

155
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,416
This is an ill person?

156
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,583
How? You don't seem ill at all.

157
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,833
What a crybaby.

158
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,166
Now he is really ill.

159
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,916
Yes, Aod is ill.

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Aod is ill.

161
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,583
-This is serious, Aod.
-I think it's serious.

162
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,541
This is serious.

163
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,541
You have a serious issue. Damn. Go.

164
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,458
Ever since I found this anklet,

165
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,666
I've had bad dreams.

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,041
And these scales

167
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,166
started growing on my chest

168
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,791
until last month.

169
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,708
It's painful.

170
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,041
It feels hot and it burns

171
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,083
so I always have a fever and feel ill.

172
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,416
No!

173
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,958
Don't touch it.

174
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,333
I'm just curious.

175
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,875
Will it disappear
if you just throw the anklet away?

176
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,250
Or leave it where you found it.

177
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,958
Bury it, so this would end.

178
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,416
Why would Aod keep it if it was that easy?

179
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You chatterbox.

180
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,625
Ouch! Luang Loong.

181
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,625
Aod found an anklet

182
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,416
and was cursed like Nak in the dream.

183
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,208
-Luang Loong.
-Yes?

184
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,458
What do you know about the anklet?

185
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,750
Giving anklets to Nak before ordination

186
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,166
has been the temple's tradition

187
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,375
since its establishment

188
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,833
which has been passed on
for hundreds of years.

189
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,375
Everyone, look closely.

190
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,916
What does it say?

191
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,583
I can't read it.

192
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,083
Looks like an ancient text.

193
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,833
-Pampam.
-Yes?

194
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,875
Can you blow up the image
and show it to Luang Loong?

195
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,666
Let me see.

196
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,458
You are the oldest here.

197
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,083
Can you read it?

198
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,625
I'm not that old to know this script.

199
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,250
I can't read it.

200
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,875
All right.

201
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,708
You stay together tonight.

202
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm going.

203
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,458
Please, sir.

204
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,208
Please, Luang Loong.

205
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,958
And he says he's not that old.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,666
ANCIENT PAMPHLET

207
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:45,750
"This ring which Nak takes off when…”

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,166
What's next?

209
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,750
The script on the back had already faded.

210
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,500
It can't be read.

211
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,750
I think the rest of the script

212
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,666
might give us a hint.

213
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,041
Novice.

214
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,250
Can you try to rub it?

215
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,625
You might see the rest at the back.

216
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,125
Can you?

217
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,041
There's nothing.

218
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,625
If we can't see it on this one,
let's look at the other one.

219
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,333
There's only one.

220
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,375
I agree with Novice Namnua.

221
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
If it's Nak's anklet,

222
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,291
it must be a pair.

223
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,916
The script might be perfect
on the other one.

224
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
Why is there only one then?

225
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,000
Aod, why is there only one?

226
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,416
It's just that.

227
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,583
I went back to dig many times
but didn't find anything.

228
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,333
Kiddee called me yesterday.

229
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,791
He said one of his relatives
went to ordination

230
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,083
at a temple by the Mekong.

231
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,916
At that temple,

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,208
their Nak also wears anklets
like we do here.

233
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,083
Aod and I decided to visit Kiddee in Ubon

234
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,833
and meet with his relative.

235
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,666
Let me go with you.

236
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,375
No, you can't.

237
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,583
And it's too risky.

238
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,958
What if someone takes
some footage of you again?

239
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,666
I have a van. I can take you there.

240
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,708
You are the worst and the weirdest.

241
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,916
You'd like to record
and post Min-Jun's clip on Youtube.

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,416
We have rules,
and you should respect them.

243
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,041
You can't keep filming everything.

244
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,250
It sounds strange
when you talk about rules.

245
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,416
We're professionals now.

246
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,291
Very well.

247
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,666
Song Hee.

248
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:55,791
I beg you.

249
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,125
Just a few days.

250
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,416
I'm really worried about them.

251
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,083
I'm sure you can handle it.

252
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,333
The sooner we go,
the sooner we can get back, right?

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,875
Please.

254
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,833
Okay.

255
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,083
But as a professional manager…

256
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,000
Take good care of Min-Jun.

257
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,583
If anyone attempts to record a video,

258
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,291
use extreme measures.

259
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,833
-Yes, madam.
-Yes, madam.

260
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,083
Stop that.

261
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:53,916
I wish this merit reaches
all the spirits in the world.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,208
I wish them to rest in peace.

263
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,166
I wish this merit reaches
all the animals in the world.

264
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,208
I wish all demons in the world
to rest in peace.

265
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,375
I wish the merit from this prayer

266
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,958
reaches all the spirits

267
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,541
that I have offended

268
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,583
from the past to the present

269
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,791
no matter where you are.

270
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,208
Please receive this merit,

271
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,125
forgive me for my sins,

272
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,125
and bless me with
the power of this good deed.

273
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,041
-Aod.
-Aod.

274
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,000
-Aod!
-Aod!

275
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,625
-What's wrong?
-What's happening?

276
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,416
Let's get him to bed.

277
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,958
Easy, Aod.

278
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:48,916
Does it hurt?

279
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,125
Be careful with his wounds.

280
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,250
Aod.

281
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,750
-Careful.
-Slowly.

282
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,500
I undertake the training-precept to
abstain from taking what is not given.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,916
Are you all right, Aod?

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,125
-Let's get you to bed.
-Take it easy.

285
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,291
-Aod.
-Aod.

286
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,958
-Aod.
-Aod.

287
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,958
What?

288
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,416
A ghost!

289
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,625
Ghost!

290
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,916
Aren't you a novice? Perform an exorcism.

291
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I can't.

292
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,500
I never succeed.

293
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,083
Who has stolen what's mine?

294
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,916
I'll kill you!

295
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,000
Shon, you bitch!

296
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,875
The anklet.

297
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,875
His ankle looks like mine.

298
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,000
-What the hell? I can't take this.
-I undertake…

299
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,250
-the training-precept
-Let's go…

300
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,500
to abstain

301
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
from taking what is not given.

302
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,458
Shit! Which way should we go?

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,083
Go this way!

304
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,375
Let him stand there like an idiot.

305
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,083
You come all the way from Korea,
and you're still stupid.

306
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,416
What the hell?

307
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,750
What should we do?

308
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,708
The door!

309
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,375
-Aod.
-Aod.

310
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,375
-Are you okay?
-Aod.

311
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,375
Luang Pee!

312
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,875
-Novice!
-Novice!

313
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,041
Luang Pee!

314
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,333
Novice!

315
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,291
Novice!

316
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,250
Balloon.

317
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,708
Novice.

318
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,458
Are you okay?

319
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,333
You want the anklet so bad, huh?

320
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,541
Come and take it!

321
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,541
Aod.

322
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,875
They have nothing to do with this.

323
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,291
Aod, what are you saying?

324
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,125
Aod.

325
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,000
You want this?

326
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,125
Aod, what are you saying?

327
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,875
Why would you risk yourself for him?

328
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,458
You're not a part of this.

329
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,541
I took the anklet. It's my responsibility.

330
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,875
You let them go
and you come take it from me.

331
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,500
The four of you…

332
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,583
You have stolen

333
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,500
what's precious to me.

334
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,458
I'll kill you!

335
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,875
Namnua.

336
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,250
Novice, what are you doing?

337
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,250
Novice, why did you get in?

338
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,583
Your heart is full of grudge.

339
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,541
Don't come closer.

340
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,500
Novice, come back.

341
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,750
It's pulling me.

342
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,666
First.

343
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,208
Everyone, it's open.

344
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,833
What are you waiting for? Go!

345
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,166
Novice, let's get out.

346
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,333
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Aod.

347
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,333
Aod, go.

348
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,625
Pampam, go.

349
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,041
I can't feel my legs.

350
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,458
Pampam, hurry up.

351
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,500
My anklet!

352
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,958
Novice.

353
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,250
Wake up, Novice.

354
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:08,708
Wake up.

355
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,791
Go and wake up everyone.

356
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,916
Wake up. It's morning.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,333
-First.
-Balloon.

358
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,291
No.

359
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,750
Balloon.

360
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,708
Balloon.

361
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,416
Shit!

362
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,250
In the chapel, really?

363
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,291
Well.

364
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,416
You were all over me last night, First.

365
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,583
Are you sure?

366
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,583
It's my period.

367
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,333
Let me ask you, Aod.

368
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,166
Is this Nak ghost
haunting you every night?

369
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,041
I can't do this every night.

370
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:43,083
No, it's the first time
since Aod found that gold anklet.

371
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,041
This is the first time I saw him.

372
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,750
It's the same ghost I saw in my dream.

373
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,791
And he mentioned all four of us.

374
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,250
Four of us?

375
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:55,833
Which four?

376
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,250
Is it me?

377
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,083
"Is it me?"

378
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,458
You're just a kitten.

379
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,000
Or is it me?

380
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,666
But I'm Korean.

381
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,458
You never know.

382
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,375
Where are you going?

383
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,083
I'm not involved in this.
It's my first time visiting this place.

384
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,041
"First time visiting this place."

385
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,000
That's what we thought.

386
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,250
And then?

387
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,916
Let me tell you this.

388
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,666
We are all here

389
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,541
because we might have met before

390
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,750
in the past.

391
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,333
We might have done something together.

392
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,041
I'm talking from experience.

393
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,416
Oh, there you are.

394
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,333
Luang Loong and I
looked for you guys everywhere.

395
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,541
-Luang Loong.
-Luang Loong.

396
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,083
Why do you look worn out?

397
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,791
A ghost, Luang Loong.

398
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,208
There is a new ghost.

399
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,833
And a dead Korean…
Does this have anything to do with this?

400
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,583
Are you still awake?

401
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,583
Bitch!

402
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,166
Yes, perfectly.

403
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,333
Still alive.

404
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:13,250
And the dead Korean you mentioned…
Who is it?

405
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,791
It's all done.

406
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

407
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,750
Is it Shon's body?

408
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:48,041
Can you call the office
and the police as well

409
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,458
to inform them about the body?

410
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,333
If news of this gets out,

411
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,541
it will be a big mess.

412
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,416
Hurry up, so we can go with Aod.

413
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,625
You still want to go with Aod?

414
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,291
That ghost just killed Shon.

415
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,625
That's right.

416
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,625
That ghost is evil.

417
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,916
He'd kill just about anybody.

418
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,333
I'm scared, Mr. Toh.

419
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,083
This is the reason

420
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,750
why I think it's best that
we stick together.

421
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,833
That way, we can help each other.

422
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,125
Give me that, Aod.

423
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,416
Here, one more.

424
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,250
I really think it's dangerous.

425
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,416
If Nak is looking for the anklet,

426
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,000
I should just go with Novice Nott.

427
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,875
It's dangerous everywhere.

428
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,625
Everybody might have something
connected to Nak.

429
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,333
We'll go together to support each other.

430
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,833
All right, everybody?

431
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:52,833
Yes.

432
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,458
When you said everybody,

433
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,666
can you leave me out of that?

434
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,875
You're in such a hurry to be excluded.

435
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,708
You were the first one who wanted to come

436
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,000
and now you want to leave.

437
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,916
You better be careful going alone,

438
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,500
or the ghost might just break your neck.

439
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,333
We still don't know

440
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:12,750
what he meant by "the four of us,"

441
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,000
like which among us are among those four.

442
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,083
Just come along so you can be safe.

443
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,333
Come down and film your stupid Oppa video.

444
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,291
Come on.

445
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,416
Let's go.

446
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,875
Please get off, Novice.

447
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:34,916
Novice!

448
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,041
I know!

449
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:38,916
Move.

450
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,291
Novice.

451
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,791
Get off.

452
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,041
No, I'm coming along.

453
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,041
Novice.

454
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,833
-Get off.
-Why not, Aod?

455
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,208
It'll be just a few days.

456
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,416
That's right.

457
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,958
It's dangerous and you know it.

458
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,125
Come on, Novice.

459
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,291
Wait.

460
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:05,125
Only you get off.
The Buddha statue stays there.

461
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,166
Novice.

462
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,458
They are taking my photos.

463
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,625
Yeah. Good morning.

464
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,375
I knew it.

465
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,708
-Pampam.
-Yes?

466
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:36,625
You posted about Mr. Toh
on social media, didn't you?

467
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,041
That's why everyone is staring at us.

468
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,166
Are you crazy? I've been driving all day.

469
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,125
Hold on.

470
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,166
I don't think they're Min-Jun's fans.

471
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,250
Is it me?

472
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,083
You and me?

473
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,708
They're pointing at something on the roof.

474
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,000
On the roof?

475
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,333
-Shit!
-Gosh!

476
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,166
-What?
-Are you possessed again?

477
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,291
-It's a leg.
-What?

478
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,500
Where?

479
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,458
-It's Novice.
-Careful.

480
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,041
-Novice.
-Novice.

481
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,083
Novice.

482
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,208
-Oh, my god.
-Novice.

483
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,375
How did you get here?

484
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,875
-Novice. Get up.
-Careful. Are you hurt?

485
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,791
-Novice.
-Get up.

486
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:18,791
My van. Wait.

487
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,125
Get down from there, Novice.

488
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,291
Get down from there, please.

489
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,250
Please get down from there.

490
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,166
I'm sorry.

491
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,916
Let me hang on to this, all right?

492
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,875
-Novice.
-Novice, get down here.

493
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,666
-Novice!
-Get him.

494
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,750
Go get him.

495
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,291
-It's crowded here. Get down here.
-Novice!

496
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,250
-No!
-Get down here.

497
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,916
-No!
-Get him.

498
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
-Get down now.
-No!

499
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,458
-It's crowded. Get down.
-No!

500
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,833
-Get down!
-No!

501
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,500
-No to you too!
-Novice, get down here.

502
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,541
Go away!

503
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,291
-Pampam. Hurry.
-Everybody.

504
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,291
Pampam, people are crowding around us.

505
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,958
Let's just take Namnua with us.

506
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,916
We can take him off our hands
once we get to Kiddee's house.

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,166
-Okay.
-Yay!

508
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,375
Thank you, Mr. Toh.

509
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,291
Be patient.

510
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,666
When we arrive at Wat Nak Nimit,

511
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,291
Luang Por can revoke the curse.

512
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,958
Who has stolen what's mine?

513
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,750
I'll kill you!

514
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,708
Klae, wait for me.

515
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:28,041
Aod?

516
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,208
What's wrong?

517
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,791
Calm down.

518
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,416
I had a bad dream.

519
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,250
I think you ate too much.

520
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,666
Aod's dreams are never good.

521
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,208
Hello, Kiddee. What's up?

522
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,583
Novice Nott, come on.

523
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,500
Why do we have to go to this cemetery?

524
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,666
It's spooky.

525
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,375
Kiddee's uncle just died,

526
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,833
so we have to meet him there.

527
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,041
Kiddee's uncle died?

528
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,125
What on earth is happening?

529
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,375
Under the seat, bitch.

530
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,708
I can't find it.

531
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,791
What do you usually ride?

532
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,708
I'm so tired. My VJJ is rocked.

533
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,791
Just a moment. Let me call Kiddee.

534
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,916
That kid?

535
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,375
Look.

536
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,458
It's fucking abandoned.

537
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,291
No…

538
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,958
Hello everyone.

539
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,291
Long time no see.

540
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,625
How are you, Mr. Toh?

541
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
I'm good.

542
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,458
And you, Aod?

543
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,791
You must be Pampam.

544
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,000
Annyeonghaseyo.

545
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,291
Nice to meet you.

546
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:43,416
Novice Nott.

547
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,625
Both of you

548
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,000
just forget it!

549
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:56,458
Did you know what we…

550
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,416
…were thinking?

551
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,875
Cute school boy.

552
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,458
I can hear your thoughts.

553
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,875
I'm single, here with friends on business.

554
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,125
You guys are brave,

555
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,833
risking yourselves to help Aod.

556
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,500
But I think
you're underestimating the situation

557
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,375
by coming here to fight Nak with nothing.

558
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,916
I think it's risky.

559
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,041
Yeah, he is worried about us.

560
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,166
I think he likes you. Don't blush.

561
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:25,791
One moment.

562
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,916
Why is he bending?

563
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,541
First, Balloon,

564
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,250
and Aod, please have a seat.

565
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,958
I think this is a really tough situation.

566
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,750
You guys should prepare
your bodies, minds,

567
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,000
and insurance policies
to guarantee your success.

568
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,958
I love you all.

569
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,958
I want you guys to be prepared.

570
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,125
But Kiddee, my friend--

571
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,416
Shut up, Balloon.

572
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,166
Go on.

573
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,250
This is what we're talking about,

574
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,125
getting a life insurance policy
so you can be insured.

575
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,791
But I don't have…

576
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,541
…a pen. You didn't prepare one. I know.

577
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,708
Here you go.

578
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,000
Go on.

579
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,125
-But I think it's quite…
-Quite dark?

580
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,250
Is this bright enough?

581
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,416
But I don't have…

582
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,416
…any cash.

583
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,750
Mobile banking.

584
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,333
That's satisfying.

585
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,125
Sign here.

586
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,166
It's done, First.

587
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,583
Now I think

588
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,833
you don't have to be worried about
getting hurt or dying.

589
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,083
Now you can die, First.

590
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,458
Come here.

591
00:34:56,416 --> 00:35:00,500
I heard that my uncle's mother
put all of his belongings in the coffin

592
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,791
because he was very possessive.

593
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,833
I think his phone was in it too.

594
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,833
Who would go to get it?

595
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,791
CHANGSHUI MOUNTAIN

596
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,541
Why do they howl at this hour?

597
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,875
Mama?

598
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,666
Mama!

599
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,041
These shitty lights every time!

600
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,958
You've been here before?

601
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,916
Every movie is like this.

602
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,208
Dogs howl, lights go out.

603
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:47,916
Typical.

604
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,083
Run!

605
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,708
First! This way.

606
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,333
We are the chosen ones.

607
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:02,875
Let's go.

608
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:04,916
Smile.

609
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,791
Wow!

610
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,708
Hey…

611
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,708
There's a mirror at the entrance.

612
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,541
This is not the time.

613
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,583
Come on, let's go.

614
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,375
Hey, here.

615
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,375
What?

616
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,791
Jungle!

617
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,083
Jungle my ass. Uncle!

618
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,041
I'm Chinese.

619
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,166
Stop fooling around.

620
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:37,958
I'm sorry.

621
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:39,500
We mean well.

622
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,416
What?

623
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,833
Your face, I'm not used to it.

624
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,250
Bitch.

625
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,458
Quite pretty.

626
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,833
I just got back from Korea.

627
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:52,916
Come on.

628
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,458
Careful.

629
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,458
You know how to open it?

630
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,125
I've never been in one, you know?

631
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,166
Help me push.

632
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,625
It will be all right.

633
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,125
Put your back into it, First.

634
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,250
One, two…

635
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,375
First!

636
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,708
You pull and I push.

637
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,333
No. I push. You pull.

638
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,625
Careful.

639
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,250
You pull. I push.

640
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,583
So you push. I pull.

641
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,708
No. You pull. I push.

642
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,041
Bitch!

643
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,125
Listen to me.

644
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,041
I pull and you push.

645
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,000
One, two, three!

646
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,041
Did we get it? Did we?

647
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,041
Who are you? What are you doing here?

648
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:41,083
We have to wait for the guests to leave

649
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,958
so we can cry with the body in private.

650
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,708
It hurts. It damn hurts.

651
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,958
I see. You seem very upset.

652
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,291
Don't cry.

653
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,333
That's right, Uncle.

654
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,833
Listen to me.

655
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,916
Great-grandma and great-granduncle

656
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,875
never loved us.

657
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:09,708
First Aunty also had that bitch.

658
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:10,875
That bitch.

659
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,333
She can't take it that we are queer.

660
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,666
And you know what?

661
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:20,541
Do you know?

662
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:26,041
Third Aunty never supported us
with money or tuition fees.

663
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,166
And what about that bastard?

664
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,666
Big Brother.

665
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,250
Big Brother.

666
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,125
Uncle!

667
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,791
So that means…

668
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,458
you must be Gim's children?

669
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,125
Yes.

670
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,041
It's okay. Don't be sad.

671
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,083
You can get changed into mourning attire.

672
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,833
All right, here.

673
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:57,000
The ritual is done.
Are you heading off now?

674
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:01,000
Can I stay with my dad

675
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,541
for the last time, Uncle?

676
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,625
I want to have a final moment

677
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,916
with my dad, Jungle.

678
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,250
Enough.

679
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,166
Take your time. I'll be right back.

680
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,625
You're so annoying.

681
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,291
Uncle!

682
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:25,625
Jungle!

683
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:38,500
Did you find the cell phone?

684
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:46,833
Did you?

685
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,166
Damn, he loved singing.

686
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,291
A pager? To call your fucking dad?

687
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,000
Dead people can't take anything.

688
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,916
Got it.

689
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,041
I got it, First.

690
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,208
Turn it on.

691
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,250
I can't.

692
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,583
Scan. Scan it now.

693
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,291
The newest model needs a retinal scan.

694
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,875
Open his eyes. Open them.

695
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,041
Then, you hold it!

696
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,375
Retina.

697
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:30,958
Pull him up.

698
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,750
Oh, shit.

699
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,333
First.

700
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,666
First. Hurry.

701
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,041
Hurry.

702
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,875
Take it.

703
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,166
Hurry. Help me pull him up.

704
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,958
Dad. I'm sorry.

705
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,125
Make sure they're open.

706
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:56,958
Got it?

707
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,375
Got it? Not too close. Damn it.

708
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,875
Not too close.

709
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,875
Are they aligned?

710
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,833
-Ready?
-Go!

711
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,041
One, two, three!

712
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,500
Enough! Close them!

713
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:14,416
Close them already!

714
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,583
Don't turn around.

715
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,958
What's going on?

716
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,166
What are you doing?

717
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,541
-Hey!
-Let's go.

718
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,708
Hurry, First!

719
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,250
Come on. Hurry!

720
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:26,791
What the hell were you lunatics doing?

721
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,375
-Stop. Don't run!
-Hurry.

722
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,875
Bring it back.

723
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:32,958
Damn these bitches.

724
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,083
Kiddee, here.

725
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,000
All right, First.

726
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,958
Why are you dressed like that?

727
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,208
To mourn your death.

728
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,416
Just drive. Stop asking.

729
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,291
Do we get the temple name? What is it?

730
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,666
Wait a second.

731
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,583
The temple's name, everybody…

732
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,500
What's the temple's name?

733
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,500
-Wat Nak Khum.
-Where is it?

734
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,041
Where is it?

735
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,250
Just a minute, Mr. Toh.

736
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,791
No, Kiddee. You have to find the location.

737
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,958
Okay.

738
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,500
Hurry up.

739
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,916
It's the fastest I can go.

740
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,750
Is that the fastest you can go, Pampam?

741
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,041
-It is.
-Guys.

742
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,083
I got the location.

743
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,041
I'll lead the way.

744
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,708
Okay, let's go.

745
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,291
Look. Here, Pampam.

746
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,291
Where are we going?

747
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,166
I'm looking at it.

748
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,875
-Stay away from it, Nott.
-What is it, Aod?

749
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,083
What?

750
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,500
-Stay away from it, Nott.
-What is it, Aod?

751
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:39,916
What?

752
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:41,666
What's that noise?

753
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,750
What's on the roof?

754
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,583
I don't know. What is it?

755
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,750
-A rock?
-What is it?

756
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,000
Pampam! Watch out!

757
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,791
Balloon!

758
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,500
Pampam! Watch out!

759
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,583
Pampam.

760
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,791
-Aod, are you all right?
-My nose.

761
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:17,250
-Your nose, Balloon.
-You okay?

762
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,333
-How are you?
-Is everybody okay?

763
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,250
Okay.

764
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:32,875
Guys.

765
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,208
There's a main road.

766
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,791
Let's go that way.

767
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,041
-Help me.
-Aod, hurry.

768
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,333
Anybody. Help me.

769
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,250
Anybody. Help me.

770
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,875
-Anybody.
-Calm down. Watch out for cars.

771
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,000
What?

772
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:53,541
Snake!

773
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,791
Snake!

774
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:55,708
Snake!

775
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,000
Snake!

776
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:07,416
Novice.

777
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,791
Can I have something to keep me safe?

778
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:16,458
Here.

779
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,291
A flashlight…

780
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,541
Why do you bring that?

781
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,458
Son,

782
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,500
come to Mama.

783
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,750
Who has stolen what's mine?

784
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,041
Aod.

785
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,125
Aod!

786
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,375
My anklet!

787
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,583
-Aod!
-Aod!

788
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,125
-Aod!
-Aod!

789
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,416
…must die!

790
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,041
-Aod, are you all right?
-Aod?

791
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,041
Aod?

792
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,500
-Aod?
-Aod?

793
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:44,958
Leave me alone.

794
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,333
Aod!

795
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,375
Aod?

796
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,250
Calm down, Aod.

797
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,333
-Aod!
-Aod!

798
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:12,666
Aod!

799
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,291
Help!

800
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,916
Aod!

801
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,875
-Aod, where are you?
-Aod.

802
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,666
-Everybody, this way.
-Aod.

803
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,166
-Aod!
-Aod!

804
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:31,291
Aod!

805
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,000
Aod.

806
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,333
Aod!

807
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,208
Novice!

808
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,625
First!

809
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,416
Balloon!

810
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,291
I'm here!

811
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,583
Is this the right direction?

812
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,625
-I think it is.
-Aod.

813
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,708
Aod, where are you?

814
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:48,791
Mama! Hurry up.

815
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,333
-Aod!
-Kiddee, wait.

816
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,416
Mama, quick.

817
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,666
Straight ahead, First, Balloon.

818
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,125
Help.

819
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,916
Wait.

820
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,083
Let me go.

821
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,875
Let me go.

822
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:53,458
They all left you.

823
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,125
Let me go.

824
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:06,916
Luang Por!

825
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:26,291
Aod?

826
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,250
Aod!

827
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,208
-Aod!
-Wait up.

828
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,166
Aod!

829
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,000
This is so strange.

830
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:36,500
What happened to him?

831
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,083
Why is he shaking?

832
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:41,833
-Aod.
-Novice.

833
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,541
-Novice.
-Aod. I'm tired.

834
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:47,708
Kiddee.

835
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:49,208
-Are you all right?
-Damn you.

836
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,791
Watch where you're going.

837
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:55,791
I'm sorry.

838
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,875
This is my flashlight, First.
I remember it.

839
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,208
It's mine. I've been holding it.

840
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,458
There. Yours is over there.

841
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,458
You're the youngest. Go get it.

842
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,666
I'm watching our backs.

843
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,958
It's calling for you.

844
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,625
Don't you love me that much? Bitch.

845
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,625
Do you see what I see, B1?

846
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,916
I don't, B2.

847
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,541
Aod.

848
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,750
-Aod.
-Aod.

849
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,791
What's happening?

850
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,666
Aod.

851
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,458
Aod.

852
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,291
What the hell is going on?

853
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,125
First.

854
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,416
Kiddee.

855
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,541
Hold on tight.

856
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,333
Don't let anyone take me.

857
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:34,750
Hold on.

858
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,125
Yes, Balloon.

859
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,708
There's nothing out there, First.

860
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,333
You stay out of this.

861
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:10,750
Aod.

862
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,166
Don't let him possess you.

863
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,125
You'll end up leaving me.

864
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,208
Nobody is going to leave you.

865
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,458
I, for one, won't.

866
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,458
You got accepted in the university.

867
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:24,250
You'll leave him.

868
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,000
Even if everyone leaves you,

869
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,458
I won't.

870
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,541
Novice!

871
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:30,500
-Aod!
-Aod!

872
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,583
Aod, get yourself together.

873
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,791
That's Novice.

874
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,541
Novice!

875
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:53,750
Novice!

876
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:54,833
Let go of him!

877
00:52:57,583 --> 00:53:00,083
Why are you fighting with him?

878
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,666
I have to take the anklet from him.

879
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,125
Or I have to put him out.

880
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,916
Pampam, help.

881
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,833
Aod.

882
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:17,875
Novice!

883
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,333
Novice! Catch!

884
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,625
Pampam, help Novice Nott.

885
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:37,875
-You stay here.
-It hurts.

886
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:38,916
Just a moment.

887
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,333
Do something.

888
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,708
-Easy, Novice.
-It hurts.

889
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:44,375
Your hip too?

890
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:47,916
First. Balloon.

891
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:49,250
Where is Pampam?

892
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:51,583
In the building.

893
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,625
What? Hey!

894
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,875
Where is my anklet?

895
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:02,833
It's not here.

896
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,291
Aod, what's the matter?

897
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,250
I saw that you took it.

898
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,291
-I said I don't have it.
-Aod.

899
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,541
-It has to be here.
-Aod.

900
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,541
Aod. The anklet is here.

901
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,833
I wrapped it up. Nobody touches it.

902
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:27,291
I used to call you guys

903
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,083
troublemakers.

904
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,875
But right now,

905
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,500
I'm the troublemaker.

906
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,458
Aod…

907
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,708
It's because the ghost possessed you.

908
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,125
You are also unwell,

909
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,875
so your mind becomes weak.

910
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:52,916
And the ghost found it easy
to possess you.

911
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,166
Aod.

912
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:58,625
Listen to me.

913
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:04,333
We'll are worried for you.

914
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,875
We won't leave you.

915
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:22,375
Aod.

916
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,000
Aod.

917
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:25,958
Don't worry.

918
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,666
Novice Namnua understands.

919
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,541
Novice.

920
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,458
You came back to your senses, Aod?

921
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,375
Do you feel better?
Does it still hurt anywhere?

922
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,583
Novice.

923
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,041
I'm sorry.

924
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,583
There's nothing to apologize for.

925
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:50,875
I broke your arm.

926
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,083
The ghost did.

927
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,208
Just worry about yourself.

928
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,125
Let's get going.

929
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,500
-Don't rush.
-Take it easy.

930
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,208
Stay still. Does it hurt?

931
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:07,166
Novice.

932
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,291
Kiddee called your mother.

933
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,041
She will be here soon.

934
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,083
But if I don't go,

935
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,416
who will help Aod?

936
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,791
I'll go with you guys.

937
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,291
Novice, it's too hard on you.
Don't push yourself.

938
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,166
If anything happens to you,

939
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,500
we'll be heartbroken

940
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:27,625
that we didn't stop you.

941
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,166
I'll come back to pick you up soon.

942
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,458
The sun!

943
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,083
Where is Mr. Toh?

944
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,625
He went to recover the van

945
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,333
with the old man who helped us last night.

946
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:50,500
It's Mr. Toh.

947
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,333
Hello, Mr. Toh.

948
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,000
Yes. Balloon…

949
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,375
Hello, Mr. Toh.

950
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,583
Your voice!

951
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,541
Yes.

952
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:05,708
Faster…

953
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,000
Yeah, almost.

954
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,166
Excellent!

955
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:15,500
Excuse me.

956
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,333
Can we really take this vehicle?

957
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,416
Yes.

958
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,583
This is my Cyclone 100.

959
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,583
I don't use it that often.

960
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,333
You guys can take it

961
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,875
while I find a mechanic to fix your van.

962
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,625
Whenever you're done with your business,

963
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:30,416
bring it back to me.

964
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,708
Consider it an exchange, okay?

965
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:32,958
Thank you, Uncle.

966
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,083
-Can I drive it? Guys, let me drive!
-Sure.

967
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:38,416
Go ahead. I'll call the mechanic.
Good luck.

968
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,416
Thank you.

969
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,333
Good bye.

970
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,041
Come on. Let's go.

971
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,625
Get on. Come on.

972
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:44,583
Everybody hop on.

973
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,958
Mr. Toh.

974
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,708
-Hurry up.
-Don't be stubborn.

975
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,458
You're stubborn. Hop on. Come on.

976
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,166
Come on. Let's go.

977
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,000
-Hop on.
-Why is he so hyped?

978
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,625
I'm a fast driver. Hold tight.

979
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,416
Pampam, come on.

980
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:58,791
Guys.

981
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:00,291
I'm not going.

982
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:01,958
What now?

983
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:04,375
I'm scared.

984
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:07,541
Why would I take a risk with you guys?

985
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,708
If we meet the ghost again,

986
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,333
you'll all just leave me.

987
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,916
Pampam, I know that you're scared

988
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,375
and you don't trust us.

989
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:21,125
But we want you to come
because we're worried for you.

990
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,208
We don't want you to end up like…

991
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:27,958
like Shon.

992
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,333
Hey.

993
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:32,708
Come with us.

994
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,833
We're already on the same boat.

995
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:39,750
Together, we'll survive, Oppa.

996
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,666
Come.

997
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,333
Ready. Go!

998
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,000
-That way, Mr. Toh.
-Sorry.

999
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:48,916
Is that okay?

1000
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:22,708
The temple is over there.

1001
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,666
WAT NAK KHUM

1002
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,791
Wat Nak Toom!

1003
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:34,708
Hey, Nak…

1004
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,541
That is Wat Nak Khum!

1005
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,583
The temple in Gim's phone.

1006
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,958
Thank heavens!

1007
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:43,958
We're finally here.

1008
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,333
Luang Por,

1009
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,500
is there a tradition at this temple…

1010
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,041
Look at how he said "Luang Por."

1011
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:55,000
Just speak with a normal accent.
People struggle enough without the accent.

1012
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:56,625
Don't bully him.

1013
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,041
Luang Por.

1014
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:02,625
Is there a tradition
about wearing anklets?

1015
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:04,916
Yes, we still wear them.

1016
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,000
We found a haunted anklet.

1017
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,166
And we're here to study the legends,
hoping to revoke the curse.

1018
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:18,041
Aod, show the anklet to Luang Por.

1019
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:22,541
This one.

1020
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:24,708
Luang Por!

1021
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,791
Don't touch it.

1022
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,583
It's cursed.

1023
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:34,833
If you touch it, burning scales will start
growing on your body.

1024
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:37,791
The ghost will come after you.
I'm warning you.

1025
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:42,416
So you bring it to Luang Por
to revoke the curse?

1026
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,250
Yes.

1027
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,125
Luang Por, please help us.

1028
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,666
Prin, bring the anklet for them to see.

1029
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,333
All right.

1030
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,041
Done.

1031
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,916
This anklet is similar to
the one from our temple.

1032
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:25,875
But…

1033
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:28,708
there is no script on them like Aod's.

1034
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,625
Wait a second.

1035
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,208
Can you look at this photo?

1036
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:49,750
Is there a temple
that has an arched entrance like this?

1037
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,833
Something ancient like this

1038
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,166
can only be found at the deserted temple

1039
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,916
called “Wat Nak Nimit”

1040
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,250
in the mountains.

1041
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:04,458
Old people say that the Naga built it.

1042
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:08,250
Now it's just a deserted temple.

1043
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,916
Don't go there. You won't find anyone.

1044
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,208
Mr. Toh, pull over.

1045
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,250
-Mr. Toh.
-Stop.

1046
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,333
-Stop.
-Let me find the location.

1047
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,458
What did you say, Aod?

1048
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:27,541
I think this is it.

1049
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,125
What is it?

1050
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:31,625
Just follow me.

1051
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,875
Aod, you always get me excited.

1052
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:37,916
Is there no better place to go?

1053
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,041
You have any sunscreen with you?

1054
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,166
-What else?
-This is it.

1055
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:49,708
That's the rock field

1056
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,833
where I saw Nak running
from something in my dream…

1057
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,250
before he jumped off the cliff.

1058
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,166
Be patient.

1059
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,833
When we arrive at Wat Nak Nimit,

1060
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,125
Luang Por can undo the curse.

1061
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,208
-Klae, wait for me.
-You stole what's mine.

1062
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,333
You must die!

1063
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,916
Jook was washed up here…

1064
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,541
and looked up the mountain…

1065
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:39,916
before he saw fire.

1066
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,250
Wait, guys.

1067
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,708
Luang Por said that there is
a deserted temple on this mountain.

1068
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,375
According to Google Maps,

1069
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,125
the mountain is quite high.

1070
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,500
From what I see,

1071
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,208
I think it's upside down.

1072
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,416
Sorry, First.

1073
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,583
It doesn't seem so high now.

1074
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,666
Quite low, actually.

1075
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:09,958
Are you all right, Aod?

1076
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:14,291
I think that in the past,
your anklet might have been around here.

1077
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Since we're already here,
let's try to find it.

1078
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:19,833
Let's go.

1079
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,791
All right, Aod?

1080
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,291
Yes.

1081
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,416
Aod.

1082
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,916
My anklet.

1083
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,083
-Aod?
-Aod?

1084
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,166
What's wrong?

1085
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,083
Nak is hurting me.

1086
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,583
That means the side where it hurts
is the direction where the anklet is.

1087
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,625
Let's hurry and find it.

1088
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,583
Pampam, take Aod to rest in the shade.

1089
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,416
The rest of us split up
and look for a recess.

1090
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,666
It should be quicker that way.

1091
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,208
The ghost chased me to
a recess in the high mountain.

1092
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,500
Let me go.

1093
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,083
I give up.

1094
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:13,458
I give up.

1095
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,583
And I died there.

1096
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:19,041
Do you remember that mountain recess?
What does it look like?

1097
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,041
That's too detailed.

1098
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,416
Just look for a mountain recess
with skeletons.

1099
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:26,958
Are you scared?

1100
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:29,541
Yeah.

1101
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:30,916
You want to hold this?

1102
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,958
Nah, you have an amulet.

1103
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,708
Careful.

1104
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,041
Get up, Mama.

1105
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,083
I'm sure.

1106
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:48,916
I'm sure.

1107
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,833
I know.

1108
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,291
Over there!

1109
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,166
Your nails are still beautiful, Mama.

1110
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,208
It's not about my nails.

1111
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,500
That skeleton right there.

1112
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,541
A dinosaur skeleton!

1113
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:17,791
We'll be rich, First.

1114
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,458
-We'll be rich.
-Oh, fuck!

1115
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,416
That's a human skeleton.

1116
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,000
Hurry up, Aod.

1117
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:28,458
Hey…

1118
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,833
Aod?

1119
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:31,833
Aod!

1120
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:32,875
Are you sure?

1121
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:35,708
Look at his eyes. Don't you remember?

1122
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:36,833
There are no eyes there.

1123
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:40,000
And that hairstyle
he wore when he was younger.

1124
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,583
He literally looks like a monk
with a bald head.

1125
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:46,291
Yes.

1126
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,291
See? Now you can't argue with me.

1127
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:49,750
You saw what I saw, First.

1128
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:50,666
I didn't.

1129
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,166
I just saw this. The anklet.

1130
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,083
Pick it up.

1131
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,833
You pick it up.

1132
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:56,750
I can't.

1133
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,500
You're closer to it.
How am I going to reach it?

1134
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:00,666
Okay, I'll get out of the way.

1135
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,708
You pick it up.

1136
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,875
-You saw it first. You pick it up.
-Why should I?

1137
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,125
-You saw it later. You pick it--
-You pick it, First.

1138
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,500
I got it.

1139
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,625
Get out! Novice! Hurry up!

1140
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:14,125
Hurry. Shit! Let him go.

1141
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,875
You stole what's mine.

1142
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,958
You must die!

1143
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,708
Hurry up.

1144
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,000
Come on, Novice. Get out.

1145
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,541
You must die!

1146
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,541
Hurry up! Novice!

1147
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:27,541
Novice!

1148
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:30,416
Let's go. Novice, come on.

1149
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,791
Hurry up.

1150
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,708
What happened?

1151
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,041
-Help!
-What's going on?

1152
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:38,333
-Help!
-What happened?

1153
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:41,291
-Go, Novice. Just leave. Let's go.
-What? What's going on?

1154
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,041
-My anklet!
-Let's go.

1155
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,958
Nak's ghost is here. Hurry up, Aod.

1156
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:45,958
Wait.

1157
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,083
Aod, come here.

1158
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,791
Let's go.

1159
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:51,958
Let's go.

1160
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,041
Is he following us? Let's go.

1161
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,958
Run, bitch!

1162
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,541
Who has stolen what's mine?

1163
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:27,208
I'll kill you!

1164
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:29,541
Aod!

1165
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,958
-Novice.
-Novice. Are you all right?

1166
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,750
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

1167
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,916
Aod?

1168
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,708
-Be careful.
-Are you all right?

1169
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,333
-I'm all right.
-Go.

1170
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:41,583
I think we should take a rest.

1171
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:43,833
Let's keep on moving.

1172
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:46,500
Before the ghost catches up.

1173
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,000
Don't worry, Novice.

1174
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:51,125
We have a Buddha statue.

1175
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,416
Pampam, show!

1176
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,666
Here you go!

1177
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,416
-The Buddha is gone!
-The Buddha is gone!

1178
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:58,875
Pampam!

1179
01:09:58,958 --> 01:09:59,875
Shit!

1180
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:01,375
Where did you keep it?

1181
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,625
Where did it go?

1182
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:04,208
Where did it go?

1183
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,541
How careless of you!

1184
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,125
Wait, where did it go?

1185
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,750
You stole what's mine.

1186
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,791
You must die!

1187
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,333
-Run!
-Wait for Aod.

1188
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:32,833
Aod! Hurry up.

1189
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,291
-Aod.
-I know.

1190
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,541
Wait for Aod.

1191
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,958
-Aod.
-Aod.

1192
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,541
-Aod.
-Aod.

1193
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:45,666
Wait for me. Hurry up.

1194
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,375
My anklet.

1195
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,625
There's fire, guys. The fire.

1196
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,291
Is that a ghost too?

1197
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,625
Let's get there first.

1198
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,625
-Go.
-Go, everyone.

1199
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,333
Guys.

1200
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:10,041
-It's the fire.
-Be careful.

1201
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,416
Is it this way?

1202
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:18,750
Balloon, be careful!

1203
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:22,125
Pampam, watch out for the fire.

1204
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,291
-Guys, let's go.
-Hurry up.

1205
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:32,666
Aod, careful.

1206
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:38,791
Aod, are you all right?

1207
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,625
-Yes, I'm all right.
-Aod.

1208
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,208
Come on, Aod. I'll help you.

1209
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,291
Hold my arm.

1210
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,458
Guys, this way.

1211
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,375
Aod, come on.

1212
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,875
It's itchy.

1213
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,291
I don't want to be at the back.

1214
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,083
Hey.

1215
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,541
-Is that a monk?
-Hey.

1216
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,958
I think you should ask, is that a human?

1217
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,333
Are you a human?

1218
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:17,958
I'm a monk…

1219
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,625
on a pilgrimage and staying here tonight.

1220
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,333
He really is a monk, First.

1221
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:26,000
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up. Luang Por!

1222
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,958
Luang Por! Please help!

1223
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,166
Luang Por! Please help us.

1224
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,291
A ghost has been following us.

1225
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:36,583
Very well.

1226
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,833
I think we should treat
that young man first.

1227
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,125
Aod.

1228
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,291
How are you?

1229
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:21,708
Is it better?

1230
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,041
I feel better.

1231
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,791
Can I have a look at your anklet?

1232
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:44,750
Just hand it over.

1233
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,541
It's all right.

1234
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,125
You know about this anklet?

1235
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,708
It belongs to
the big temple on the mountain.

1236
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,500
So, there is a temple on this mountain?

1237
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:16,125
Yes, there is.

1238
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,916
Long time ago,
there was a temple on the mountain.

1239
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,166
And this mountain…

1240
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,291
has been protected by the Naga.

1241
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:33,000
He was quite mischievous

1242
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,416
and had hurt so many people
until the villagers fled.

1243
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:38,833
Then,

1244
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,750
there came a monk

1245
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,875
who accepted the invitation
from the villagers

1246
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:46,375
to subdue the Naga.

1247
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,666
It took him seven days and seven nights.

1248
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,625
The Naga finally surrendered.

1249
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,958
He promised to turn his life around.

1250
01:14:56,958 --> 01:15:02,000
He redeemed himself for hurting humans
and harassing the monks

1251
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:07,291
by building a big temple
and dedicated it to that monk.

1252
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:11,583
He also made gold anklets for Nak

1253
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,333
as a merit to support Nak
to become a monk.

1254
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,166
Although the temple is deserted now,

1255
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,208
the Nak anklet tradition before ordination

1256
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:30,958
is still practiced by temples around here.

1257
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,041
Luang Por.

1258
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,375
The ghost is still in my head.

1259
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm afraid that I'll still be possessed,

1260
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:42,375
and that I won't be
strong enough to fight it.

1261
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:47,250
The strength you have
is not only from yourself,

1262
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:53,125
but also from your friends
for not leaving you.

1263
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:56,166
You're not fighting alone.

1264
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,000
But Luang Por,

1265
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:03,083
we once had
a Buddha statue to ward off ghosts.

1266
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,083
It's gone now, nowhere to be found.

1267
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:11,375
Can you give us something
to ward them off?

1268
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:13,958
You think the ghost is
scared of the Buddha statue?

1269
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,500
If it's not because of the Buddha statue,

1270
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:25,625
why doesn't it hurt us
when it sees the Buddha statue?

1271
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,083
Or is he scared of something else inside?

1272
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:41,375
All right.

1273
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,916
I don't think you should overthink it.

1274
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,583
Rest here tonight.

1275
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,583
This is a sacred place.

1276
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,125
No ghost will come across here.

1277
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,208
Yes, Luang Por.

1278
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:20,625
Aod, you have another story, don't you?

1279
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,416
I think we should tell Luang Por.

1280
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,250
I'll find Luang Por.

1281
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,666
Just a moment.

1282
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,583
Yeah, make yourself useful.

1283
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:30,750
Luang Por.

1284
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:36,375
Everyone!

1285
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,291
Luang Por isn't here.
His belongings are all gone.

1286
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,791
-All gone?
-All of it.

1287
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,791
Everything is gone.

1288
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:44,041
Everything is gone?

1289
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:46,708
No. Nothing. No candles.

1290
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:49,125
Luang Por, the temple, the monk…

1291
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:51,041
The cave!

1292
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,208
Are any of these real?

1293
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:53,458
Am I real?

1294
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,250
I'm sure you're real.

1295
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:56,500
But your nose is fake.

1296
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,208
That hurts, you asshole.

1297
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,291
I'm sorry, Mr. Toh.

1298
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,250
Well, you asked.

1299
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,916
Maybe Luang Por went out
to collect the alms.

1300
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You sleep like the dead,
like you're rehearsing when you die.

1301
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,291
Let's get Aod to the temple.

1302
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,333
Let's go.

1303
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,458
Go.

1304
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:18,666
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

1305
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,041
Do you know where we're going?

1306
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,875
Head north, Balloon.

1307
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,166
-You know the direction.
-North.

1308
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:32,625
What is it?

1309
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,333
This way, guys.

1310
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:39,791
You go ahead.

1311
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,541
-Mr. Toh.
-Are you all right?

1312
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,041
I lost all my energy.

1313
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,750
Guys, wait a moment for First.

1314
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,083
Balloon.

1315
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,291
Keep going.

1316
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,083
Hurry up, First, before we get lost.

1317
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,541
Keep going.

1318
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,250
Watch your hands.

1319
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,791
What about my hands?

1320
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,791
Balloon is so loud.

1321
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:03,041
I'm sure we can find them.

1322
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:07,875
Falling for someone.

1323
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,041
Not funny. Come on. Get up.

1324
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:15,041
Holy smokes.

1325
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,458
Oh, you do care about me.

1326
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:33,125
Kiddee, are we lost?

1327
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,958
This is the way, Balloon.

1328
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,541
It's a shortcut.

1329
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:38,875
Oh, gosh!

1330
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,958
I could hear you before you even got here.

1331
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:46,166
Hey First, how did you get here?

1332
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,416
Kiddee!

1333
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,458
What's the point of using a compass?

1334
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:53,791
I'm sorry, Balloon.

1335
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:57,250
I'm aching all over.

1336
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:04,375
Is my back dirty?

1337
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,416
Look, guys!

1338
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,625
This is laterite.

1339
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,833
It's not found naturally.

1340
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,416
What is it?

1341
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,166
Here, there's a block of it.

1342
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,083
First!

1343
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,291
You're so stupid.

1344
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:25,666
Don't you know what laterite is?

1345
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,166
Look at me.

1346
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:30,541
I don't have a geologist for a husband.

1347
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:32,125
That means

1348
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,208
there must be an ancient site hidden here.

1349
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:53,916
Is this the ancient arched entrance?

1350
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:13,250
This is what I saw in my dream.

1351
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,916
It looks like the entrance to our temple.

1352
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:23,166
it's exactly the same.

1353
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,541
Annyeong!

1354
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,708
Can you revoke a curse?

1355
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:35,125
Any promos? Like revoking the curse
with free exorcism?

1356
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:37,625
-We'll take one.
-We'll take one.

1357
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,958
Why are you fooling around?

1358
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,375
Look at him.

1359
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:43,083
-Aod.
-Aod.

1360
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,333
-Let me help you.
-I'm okay.

1361
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:46,791
Let's get inside.

1362
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,208
Let's go.

1363
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,500
Balloon, come on.
What are you waiting for?

1364
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,375
Hurry up, guys.

1365
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,041
-You play football?
-Let's go.

1366
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,916
First, there are some people here.

1367
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,125
Make sure they are humans.

1368
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,291
Maybe they can help Aod.

1369
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:15,750
Go.

1370
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:17,708
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1371
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:18,708
Please help.

1372
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,958
Our friend is ill.

1373
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:22,166
Can you help him?

1374
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,875
How did you get here?

1375
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,375
Here he is.

1376
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,500
Aod.

1377
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:34,291
The curse of the Naga's anklet.

1378
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:36,291
-Nak Kham!
-Nak Kham!

1379
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,375
How are you?

1380
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:52,583
-Is that the same monk?
-Yes.

1381
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:54,375
Does the ghost still bother you?

1382
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:56,500
Not anymore.

1383
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,083
But my wounds still hurt.

1384
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,875
It's like he's still somewhere near.

1385
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:05,833
What's the deal
with the anklet, Luang Por?

1386
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:09,833
And about someone called "Nak Kham"?

1387
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,125
The deserted temple you saw

1388
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,750
used to be a big temple.

1389
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:18,166
It's called Wat Nak Nimit.

1390
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,666
The villagers along the Mekong

1391
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,708
celebrate their ordination

1392
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:29,791
by having the monk at that temple
perform for them.

1393
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:34,333
Nak Kham was an orphan.

1394
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:37,500
Phra Kru.

1395
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,500
Kham is burglarizing again.

1396
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:44,250
I have to bring him in this time.

1397
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,458
I'm an orphan. Who do I turn to?

1398
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,708
Can you spare me some,
even just this much?

1399
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:54,666
Phra Kru took you in and raised you.

1400
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,583
And you still dare
to call yourself an orphan?

1401
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,333
You bastard. Look at what you did.

1402
01:24:58,416 --> 01:25:00,083
You have no respect for him.

1403
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,166
Please spare him.

1404
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,458
I'm asking you.

1405
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:12,541
I might not have taught you well enough.

1406
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,041
That's probably why you're greedy.

1407
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:20,666
To commit sins and make yourself
an excuse that you did it

1408
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,458
because you don't have as much as others

1409
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:26,000
does not give you the reason to do so.

1410
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,333
It makes you go down even deeper.

1411
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:32,041
Phra Kru,

1412
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,041
we'll bind him with a plank

1413
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,875
and drag him to the authorities later.

1414
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,250
No, Phra Kru. Please.

1415
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,125
During the next crescent moon,

1416
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:44,458
there will be a big ordination
at the Naga temple.

1417
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:47,416
Let me be ordained to repay
for what I did.

1418
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,916
He is right.

1419
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:58,458
For the sake of Buddhism,

1420
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:01,125
let the Naga discipline him.

1421
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,375
I think

1422
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,791
it's better than convicting him.

1423
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,916
But it didn't come from
his heart to become a monk.

1424
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,250
He wanted to go to the capital

1425
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:17,625
so he planned to steal
the gold anklets and run away.

1426
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:20,958
That's why he was cursed

1427
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,375
and it caused his skin to grow "scales"

1428
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,083
as he suffered until his death.

1429
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:32,625
This young man must have been cursed
for the wrongful possession.

1430
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:37,125
Is there a way to revoke the curse?

1431
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:38,916
There is only one way.

1432
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,833
Return the anklets to the Naga.

1433
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:45,333
How do we do it?

1434
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:48,416
Isn't it written on the anklets?

1435
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,666
Is there anything written on
the other anklet we found?

1436
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:56,166
Yes.

1437
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,041
-What does it say?
-What does it say?

1438
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:02,750
"The anklets that Nak is wearing,

1439
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:05,083
when they are removed,
you'll become a monk."

1440
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:08,916
The ghost has been harassing Aod

1441
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:13,208
because it doesn't want
Aod to become a monk.

1442
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:15,666
Because if Aod succeeds,

1443
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,458
it will revoke the curse.

1444
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:19,583
How about this?

1445
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,041
Aod wears the anklets, becomes a monk,

1446
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:25,500
-and revokes the curse.
-Yeah.

1447
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:26,458
That is not possible.

1448
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,333
You still have ties with him.

1449
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Ties of karma that you committed
with him in the past life.

1450
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:40,833
If you can't remove those ties,
you can't be a monk.

1451
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:47,791
The anklets are a symbol of
ties in the mundane world,

1452
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,208
both good karma and bad karma.

1453
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:54,291
If you can't let go of these ties,

1454
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,916
you can't be prosperous in Dharma.

1455
01:27:58,708 --> 01:27:59,791
So that means

1456
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,916
to take the anklets off,

1457
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:04,916
we must let go of
the ties in our mind first

1458
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:07,958
and be a monk?

1459
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,666
No ties, no concerns.

1460
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:15,583
Then you can be a monk.

1461
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:19,500
I see.

1462
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,750
At a cliff near the back of the village,

1463
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,250
there is a holy reservoir.

1464
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,750
Put on Nak's attire and the anklets.

1465
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:33,916
Go wash your body there.

1466
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:40,125
May you be victorious, as Buddha defeated
demons at the base of the Bodhi tree.

1467
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:45,708
May you reach the apex of Buddhist bliss

1468
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:48,125
and be content on the throne
where no demons could reach.

1469
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:11,458
May all the righteous benefits
come to you.

1470
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:44,625
Awesome.

1471
01:29:56,791 --> 01:30:01,291
Why don't we just go to the flower market?

1472
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,333
It's an eight-day walk.

1473
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,250
Excuse me.

1474
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:10,250
Yes?

1475
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,791
Please take this yellow robe
to make merit.

1476
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,375
Of course.

1477
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,166
Thank you.

1478
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:28,833
We will pray for you. Sathu.

1479
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:40,000
I have some gossip.

1480
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,916
Don't you think this village is weird?

1481
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:47,375
There are only young people

1482
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,833
and no elderly people.

1483
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:55,000
There is only one
that looks like a village chief.

1484
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:58,708
On top of that, there are no kids.

1485
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,500
That's good.

1486
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:05,666
When Mama sees them,
like the Korean-looking guys around here,

1487
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,125
I just love it.

1488
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,708
Don't make me suspicious. Just stay put.

1489
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:12,875
How are you?

1490
01:31:13,416 --> 01:31:15,375
Did you wash yourself in the reservoir?

1491
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:18,375
I did.

1492
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:21,000
That's good.

1493
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:25,125
But it can relieve the curse
for just a while.

1494
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:28,500
Aod.

1495
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:32,125
Do you know
how we can take the anklets off?

1496
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:35,166
I don't know.

1497
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:40,375
But I feel sorry for Nak Kham.

1498
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,416
Without you guys…

1499
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,083
I might be just like him.

1500
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:50,708
Hey, Aod.

1501
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:53,875
He lived by taking advantage
and stealing from others,

1502
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,500
so he's no different
from selfish criminals.

1503
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,375
He only blames others

1504
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,541
and never looks at himself.

1505
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:02,791
Yeah.

1506
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:05,666
I think those who
only think of the benefit

1507
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:08,166
won't get sympathy from other people.

1508
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:16,958
That's right.
We should not forgive ourselves,

1509
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,125
but we should ask for forgiveness.

1510
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:23,625
That's true. Even during the ordination,

1511
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:26,291
there is a part that deals with
apologies to all vengeful spirits.

1512
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,333
Right, apologize to a ghost then.

1513
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:31,583
You'll get your neck broken
before you know it.

1514
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:47,875
Why do you take it off?

1515
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:51,875
If we are willing to apologize to him,

1516
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,500
we should let him see our true intention.

1517
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:05,750
I, and everybody here…

1518
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,750
want to apologize
for stealing what's yours,

1519
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,750
as I will be ordained.

1520
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,500
I won't let you!

1521
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,583
We are here in good faith.

1522
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,333
We are aware of our wrongdoings.

1523
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:27,208
You…

1524
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:30,875
stole what's mine.

1525
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:34,750
You will be like me!

1526
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:39,541
But the anklets don't belong to you.

1527
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,125
The anklets are mine!

1528
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:44,125
You took them off from my ankles.

1529
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,375
Don't you remember?

1530
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,458
The Naga anklets.

1531
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,166
Nak…

1532
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:24,791
you should let go of those anklets.

1533
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:27,500
Wherever you took them from,

1534
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,875
take them back.

1535
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:31,791
No.

1536
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:35,375
I won't.

1537
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:37,583
I will die…

1538
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,458
with my precious anklets.

1539
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,041
The anklet curse…

1540
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:52,041
Nobody can help you

1541
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:55,708
if you won't help yourself.

1542
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,125
Remember that.

1543
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:01,958
I ask for permission
to leave the monkhood.

1544
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:04,750
Please recognize

1545
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:06,916
that I'm now a layman.

1546
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,000
Jook, Klae.

1547
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,291
Are you stealing from corpses again?

1548
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:20,791
We're not.

1549
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:21,750
We're not.

1550
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,958
Let's go then. Get the boat.

1551
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,208
-Yes.
-Yes.

1552
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:31,541
What are you waiting for?
Get the other one.

1553
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:38,041
You have stolen what's mine.

1554
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,250
Whoever took what's mine must die!

1555
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:51,125
You're already dying. Don't be stingy.

1556
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:54,291
That thing on your ankle, give it to me.

1557
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,833
Give it back to me.

1558
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:56,916
Novice.

1559
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,416
The anklet.

1560
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,375
Jook.

1561
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:01,416
Just give it back to him.

1562
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:07,500
Give it to me.

1563
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:09,958
-No.
-It's mine!

1564
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:13,333
-Get up.
-Give it back to me.

1565
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,291
The anklet is mine.

1566
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,083
Jook!

1567
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,875
Take it.

1568
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:30,791
Hey.

1569
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:34,833
Hey.

1570
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:39,791
How come the events from the previous life

1571
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:42,125
affect us in this life?

1572
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,416
Luang Por,

1573
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,166
it's a different life.

1574
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:55,083
What do you think about
yesterday, today, and tomorrow?

1575
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,083
How are they connected?

1576
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:58,541
They are all connected.

1577
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:04,916
That's right.

1578
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:07,791
It's like the same piece of fabric.

1579
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,708
All connected.

1580
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,041
Today is yesterday's future.

1581
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,916
And the consequences of our actions today

1582
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,250
affect tomorrow.

1583
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,333
We have to accept the consequences

1584
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:28,208
because you can't go back in time
to fix yesterday.

1585
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,833
I won't let you

1586
01:37:37,666 --> 01:37:38,791
take off my anklets!

1587
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,958
Please forgive us.

1588
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:44,166
Please let Aod go.

1589
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:45,500
No.

1590
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:47,125
-Aod.
-Aod.

1591
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,666
All of you have to die like I did.

1592
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:57,125
Aod has admitted his wrongdoings.

1593
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:03,916
We are asking for forgiveness
with good faith

1594
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,541
-and we should--
-Stop it!

1595
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:13,083
-We are asking for forgiveness--
-I said stop!

1596
01:38:18,333 --> 01:38:20,208
I will kill him

1597
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,916
and make him suffer.

1598
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:25,625
Stop this, Nak.

1599
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,333
-Luang Por!
-Luang Por!

1600
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:31,208
-Aod.
-Luang Por.

1601
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,458
Luang Por.

1602
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:35,666
When they are asking for your forgiveness,

1603
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:38,583
why don't you let go of the ties
and forgive them?

1604
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:43,125
Why am I the only one
who has to become like this?

1605
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:47,375
Why do you help them…

1606
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,916
but not me?

1607
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:54,625
And you…

1608
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:58,041
you performed the ordination for me.

1609
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:10,791
I have helped you

1610
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:14,083
but you didn't help yourself.

1611
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:18,958
Please stop.

1612
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:30,208
I'm asking to hold back
the extreme punishment.

1613
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:34,791
Please give him a chance to repent

1614
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:37,166
the same way it happened to you.

1615
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:06,750
And you,

1616
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,208
if you really accept your mistake

1617
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:11,083
and apologize to the anklets' owner,

1618
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,000
you will survive.

1619
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,208
No.

1620
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:18,708
I'm not giving them back.

1621
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,083
You are unjust.

1622
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:34,791
This one is real, First!

1623
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:38,833
Those who wear anklets

1624
01:41:39,916 --> 01:41:42,333
who dedicate themselves to Buddhism,

1625
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:45,041
the Naga will protect them.

1626
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:08,583
Those who wear anklets…

1627
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:11,375
if they ever dare to become
an enemy of Buddhism,

1628
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:14,416
the Naga will destroy them.

1629
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:20,000
Like how you've declared yourself
as a protector of Buddhism…

1630
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:30,125
My anklet!

1631
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:34,208
A long time ago…

1632
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:39,416
the Naga accepted his mistake.

1633
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,583
That's why he created these anklets,

1634
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:43,625
to remind the later generations

1635
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:48,416
to accept their mistakes in the past.

1636
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:50,875
As for you…

1637
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,666
after you take off the anklets,

1638
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:57,041
you can become Nak, then a monk.

1639
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:08,416
Come, the spirit of Nak.

1640
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,125
Don't go around

1641
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:13,458
admiring the beautiful mountains
high up in the clouds

1642
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:15,500
and the goddess Mekhla,

1643
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:25,750
or the writer at the base of
tall candle trees

1644
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:31,666
aligning through the woods.

1645
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:12,875
For the merit of my ordination this time,

1646
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:17,083
I want to dedicate it to every Naga

1647
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,583
and Nak Kham.

1648
01:44:54,666 --> 01:44:56,500
No ties, no concerns.

1649
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,458
Be prosperous in Dharma.

1650
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:01,833
And everyone too.

1651
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:03,666
-Sathu.
-Sathu.

1652
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:43,041
Hello, I'm Pampam Oppa.

1653
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:47,500
You are now at
the Wat Nak Khum temple fair.

1654
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,041
Where's mine?

1655
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,375
Here.

1656
01:45:50,458 --> 01:45:51,541
That's my boyfriend.

1657
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:52,750
Sure.

1658
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:53,958
Yummy.

1659
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,083
So delicious.

1660
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,541
Oops! Here you go. Thank you.

1661
01:45:57,041 --> 01:45:58,875
-Thank you.
-This one is delicious.

1662
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:04,083
What are you doing?

1663
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:06,500
Whose drone is this?

1664
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:08,541
It's Kiddee's dad's. He brought it today.

1665
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,500
-What is this?
-Grilled rice crisps.

1666
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:12,833
Grilled rice crisps?

1667
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:14,458
Can I try to make it?

1668
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:15,416
Sure.

1669
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:19,000
-I keep flipping it?
-Yes.

1670
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,416
Oh, gosh! Marvelous!

1671
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:25,166
Like you've never been to a temple fair.
What's so marvelous about it?

1672
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,625
That guy eating meatballs there.

1673
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:28,625
Where?

1674
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:30,375
The grilled rice crisps are cuter.

1675
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:32,500
First, this is why I'm here…

1676
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:34,958
to see real Naga fireballs.

1677
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:36,916
Why are you excited?

1678
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,416
Fireballs, not guys.

1679
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,708
Really. I want to see them too.

1680
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:48,666
What?

1681
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:50,000
-They're trying to commit suicide.
-What?

1682
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:51,708
-They're trying to commit suicide.
-Where?

1683
01:46:51,791 --> 01:46:52,916
At the rock field we went to yesterday.

1684
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,916
Yeah.

1685
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,291
Why are they doing this? Why?

1686
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:57,416
Let's go help him.

1687
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,666
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1688
01:47:03,666 --> 01:47:04,541
Calm down, everyone.

1689
01:47:04,625 --> 01:47:07,125
-Don't get down there. It's dangerous.
-It's dangerous.

1690
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:10,125
-Guys.
-Calm down. No.

1691
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:14,791
Old man.

1692
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:32,166
See you.

1693
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,041
-Again?
-Again?

1694
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:51,250
Here, my brother.

1695
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:53,750
I give it to you.

1696
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:55,250
Are you sure?

1697
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:05,083
I don't feel comfortable.

1698
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:07,041
You should give it to him.

1699
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,416
Take it, my brother.

1700
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,708
Here, Pampam. Keep it.

1701
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:34,916
Before you leave, bring this to Phra Aod

1702
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,750
to pay homage to
the Buddha image at the entrance.

1703
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:38,833
Yes.

1704
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:01,291
Told you he's not old.

1705
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:03,833
Luang Pee…

1706
01:49:03,916 --> 01:49:04,791
Novice.

1707
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:07,000
Cut!

1708
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:16,083
-Let's go.
-In my face.

1709
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:17,375
What's in your face?

1710
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:25,125
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1711
01:49:26,166 --> 01:49:27,166
You're not.

1712
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:33,625
Go. Come on.

1713
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:37,416
Like that.

1714
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:43,750
Okay.

1715
01:49:54,458 --> 01:49:55,291
Good.

1716
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,458
-Novice.
-Novice.

1717
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:00,958
-Novice.
-Novice.

1718
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:02,416
-Novice.
-Novice.

1719
01:50:09,166 --> 01:50:10,541
-Are you hurt?
-No.

1720
01:50:17,666 --> 01:50:18,875
You want to see a snakefish?
