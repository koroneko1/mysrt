00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.069
<i>Okay, you're probably going, "Is this
a Noxzema commercial or what?"</i>

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.717
<i>But seriously, I actually have
a way normal Iife for a teenage girl.</i>

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.313
<i>I get up, I brush my teeth,
and I pick out my school clothes.</i>

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.995
<i>Daddy's a Iitigator.
Those are the scariest kinds of Iawyers.</i>

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.913
<i>Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him.</i>

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.920
<i>And Daddy's so good, he gets
$500 an hour to fight with people.</i>

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.310
<i>He fights with me for free
because I'm his daughter.</i>

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.913
-Daddy.
-Cher, please don't start

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.469
-with the juice again .
-Daddy, you need your vitamin C.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.550
Where's my briefcase?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.632
It's been a couple of months now,
so I said we'd go out to Malibu .

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.917
Don't tell me those brain-dead lowlifes
have been calling again .

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.118
They are your parents.
And don't try sneaking out of the office.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.396
Dr. Lovett's coming by
to give you a flu shot.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.437
Josh is in town , he's coming for dinner.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.511
-Why?
-He's your stepbrother.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.956
You were hardly even married to
his mother and that was five years ago.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.874
-Why do I have to see Josh?
-You divorce wives, not children .

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.798
-Here.
-Forget it!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.149
<i>Did I show you the Ioqued-outjeep
Daddy got me?</i>

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.030
<i>It's got four-wheel drive, dual side
airbags, and a monster sound system.</i>

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.876
<i>I don 't have a Iicense yet,
but I needed something to Iearn on.</i>

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.430
<i>Boy, they came out of nowhere.</i>

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.480
<i>Here's where Dionne Iives.</i>

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.995
<i>She's my friend because we both know
what it's Iike</i>

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.400
<i>to have people be jealous of us.</i>

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.550
Dude !

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.315
Girlfriend !

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.791
<i>And I must give her snaps
for her courageous fashion efforts.</i>

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.995
Hey, Cher.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.118
<i>Dionne and I were both named
after great singers of the past</i>

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.157
<i>who now do infomercials.</i>

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.230
So?

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.118
Go shopping with Dr. Seuss?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.714
At least I wouldn't skin a collie
to make my backpack.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.074
It's faux.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.036
-Hello ! That was a stop sign .
-I totally paused .

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.440
Yeah . Okay.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.040
It's not even 8: 30
and Murray is paging me.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.958
-He is so possessive.
-Tell me about it.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.390
This weekend he called me
and he's all , "Where were you?"

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.675
I'm like, "I'm at my grandmother's. . ."

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.071
<i>Dionne and her boyfriend Murray
are in this dramatic relationship.</i>

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.629
<i>I think they've seen
that Ike and Tina Turner movie</i>

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.677
<i>just too many times.</i>

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.518
<i>Now I have to say to her...</i>

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.353
De, why do you put up with it?
You could do so much better.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.919
I know. Here he comes.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.036
Woman , why don't you be answering
any of my pages?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.714
-I hate when you call me "woman ."
-Where you been all weekend?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.473
-You jeeping behind my back?
-Jeeping?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.551
Jeeping . Know what I'm saying?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.551
No, but speaking of vehicular sex

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.598
perhaps you can explain
how this cheap K-Mart hair extension

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.911
-got into the back seat of your car.
-I don't know where that came from .

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.231
That looks like one of your little stringy
things you got up in your hair.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.152
I do not wear polyester hair, okay?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.914
U nlike some people I know,
like Shawana.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.559
-De, I'm Audi .
-Bye.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.234
-Why do you gotta go there?
-That's it! I've had it with you !

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.675
Is it that time of the month again?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.878
<i>I don 't know why Dionne's going out
with a high-school boy.</i>

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.155
<i>They're Iike dogs.</i>

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.117
<i>You have to clean them
and feed them and...</i>

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.111
<i>They're just Iike
these nervous creatures</i>

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.350
<i>thatjump and slobber all over you.</i>

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.559
Get off of me.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.749
As if!

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.991
Should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in America?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.310
Amber will take the con position .
Cher will be pro.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.673
Cher, two minutes.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.714
So, okay.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.513
Like right now, for example, the Haitians
need to come to America.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.591
But some people are all , "What about
the strain on our resources?"

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.674
But it's like, when I had this garden
party for my father's birthday, right?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.599
I said RSVP
because it was a sit-down dinner.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.629
But people came that, like, did not
RSVP. So, I was like totally bugging .

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.237
I had to haul ass to the kitchen ,
redistribute the food ,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.118
squish in extra place settings,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.477
but by the end of the day
it was, like, the more the merrier.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.359
And so, if the government could just
get to the kitchen ,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.320
rearrange some things, we could
certainly party with the Haitians.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.789
And in conclusion ,
may I please remind you

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.953
that it does not say "RSVP"
on the Statue of Liberty.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.998
Thank you very much .

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.914
Amber, a reply?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.310
Mr. Hall , how can I answer that?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.314
The topic is Haiti
and she's talking about some little party.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.677
Hello ! It was his 50th birthday.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.478
Whatever. If she doesn't
do the assignment, I can't do mine.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.995
Ladies.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.912
So, does anyone have
any further thoughts on Cher's oration?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.593
Elton , comments?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.513
Yeah , I can't find my Cranberries CD.
I gotta go to the Quad

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.877
-before somebody snags it.
-I'm afraid I can't permit that.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.953
-Any further insights?
-I had an insight, Mr. Hall .

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.514
I'm all ears.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.276
Okay. Like, the way I feel
about the Rolling Stones

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.838
is the way my kids are gonna feel
about N ine Inch Nails,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.196
so I really shouldn't torment my mom
anymore, huh?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.114
Yes. Well , it's a little off the subject
of Haiti

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.033
but tolerance is always a good lesson .

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.238
-Thank you .
-Even when it comes out of nowhere.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.874
And with that in mind ,
I'm going to distribute your report cards.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.998
Now, is there a Christian Stovitz
in this class?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.034
Mr. Hall , the buzz on Christian is
that his parents have joint custody,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.590
so he'll be spending one semester
in Chicago and one semester here.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.071
I think it is a travesty
on the part of the legal profession .

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.390
Thank you for that perspective, Cher.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.915
Now, could all conversations
please come to a halt?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.077
And could the suicide attempts

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.993
please be postponed
till the next period?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.511
<i>Suddenly, a dark cloud
settled over first period.</i>

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.797
<i>I got a C in Debate?</i>

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.869
-De?
<i>-What's up?</i>

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.271
-Did you get your report card?
<i>-Yeah. I'm toast. How did you do?</i>

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.876
I totally choked .
My father is gonna go ballistic on me.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.871
<i>Mr. Hall was way harsh.</i>

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.113
He gave me a C-.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.830
He gave me a C,
which drags down my entire average.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.559
-Bye.
-I'll call you , okay?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.630
Yeah .

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.752
<i>Isn 't my house classic?</i>

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.873
<i>The columns date
all the way back to 1972.</i>

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.790
<i>Wasn 't my mom a Betty?
She died when I was just a baby,</i>

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.679
<i>a fluke accident
during a routine Iiposuction.</i>

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.276
<i>I don 't remember her, but I Iike
to pretend she still watches over me.</i>

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.716
Ma, 98 in Geometry. Pretty groovy, huh?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.470
<i>Yuck.</i>

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.518
<i>The maudlin music
of the university station ?</i>

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.559
What is it about college
and crybaby music?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.592
Who's watching the galleria?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.239
So, the flannel shirt deal ,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.311
is that a nod
to the crispy Seattle weather

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.313
or you trying to stay warm
in front of the refrigerator?

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.710
Oh , my, you're filling out there.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.749
Wow. Your face is catching up
with your mouth .

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.116
-I went by Dad's office.
-He is not your dad .

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.918
Why don't you torture a new family?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.718
J ust because my mother
married someone else

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.199
doesn't mean he's my father.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.510
Actually, Kato,
that's exactly what it means.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.750
I hope you're not thinking
of staying here.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.638
-I sure want to.
-I'm sure you do.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.950
I got a place in Westwood near school .

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.951
Shouldn't you go to school
on the East Coast?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.078
I hear girls at NYU
aren't at all particular.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.794
You're funny.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.473
<i>What's your problem, Beavis?</i>

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.876
<i>...infantry furiously trading
machine gun fire.</i>

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.759
You just got here and already
you're playing Couch Commando.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.958
In some parts of the universe,
maybe not in Contempo Casual

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.829
but in some parts, it's considered cool
to know what's going on in the world .

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.197
Thank you , Josh . I so need lessons
from you on how to be cool .

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.999
Tell me that part about Kenny G again .

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.950
Come on , you chuckleheads,
get in here.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.792
Josh , are you still growing?
You look taller than you did at Easter.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.279
I don't think so.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.034
-Doesn't he look bigger?
-H is head does.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.959
Josh , have you given any thought
to our little discussion

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.075
about corporate law?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.391
Yeah , but I think I'd really like to
check out environmental law.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.598
What for? You want to have
a miserable, frustrating life?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.069
Josh will have that
no matter what he does.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.151
At least he knows what he wants to do

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.120
and he's in a good college. I'd like
to see you have a little bit of direction .

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.079
-I have direction .
-Yeah . Towards the mall .

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.232
Which reminds me,
where's your report card?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.789
-It's not ready yet.
-What do you mean , it's not ready yet?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.633
Well , some teachers
were trying to lowball me, Daddy.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.155
And I know how you say
never accept a first offer,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.154
so I figure these grades are just
a jumping off point to start negotiations.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.594
Very good .

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.029
Whose is that?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.150
De?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.231
Hello? Yeah , Jake, what?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.875
No, not the afternoon !

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.394
You are such a brownnoser.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.233
And you are
such a superficial space cadet.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.199
What makes you think you'll get
teachers to change your grades?

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.636
Only the fact that I've done it
every other semester.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.790
<i>I told my P. E. teacher
an evil male had broken my heart,</i>

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.356
<i>so she raised my C to a B.</i>

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.589
-Miserable.
-They're horrible.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.751
-I can't eat, I can't sleep.
-Don't feel bad . I know.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.478
And you see, they're all like that.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.472
<i>Then I promised Miss Geist
I'd start a Ietter-writing campaign</i>

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.313
<i>to my congressman
about violations of the CIean Air Act.</i>

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.476
<i>But Mr. Hall was totally rigid.</i>

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.392
<i>He said my debates
were unresearched</i>

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.517
<i>unstructured, and unconvincing.</i>

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.480
<i>As if!</i>

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.796
<i>I felt impotent and out of control,
which I really hate.</i>

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.631
<i>I needed to find sanctuary in a place
where I could gather my thoughts</i>

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.631
<i>and regain my strength.</i>

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.475
Dude, what's wrong?

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.870
Are you suffering
from buyer's remorse or something?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.236
God , no, nothing like that. It's just that

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.075
we've been shopping all day and I still
don't know what to do about Mr. Hall .

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.073
I tried everything to convince him
of my scholastic aptitude

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.833
but I was brutally rebuffed .

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.719
Get over it. He's a miserable little man
who wants to make

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.757
everyone else miserable, too.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.353
De, that's it.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.354
We've got to figure out a way
to make Mr. Hall sublimely happy.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.831
<i>Here's the 411 on Mr. Hall.</i>

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.630
<i>He's single, he's 47, and he earns
minor ducats at a thankless job.</i>

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.432
<i>What that man needs
is a good, healthy boink fest.</i>

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.510
<i>Unfortunately, there was
a major babe drought in my school.</i>

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.480
<i>The evil trolls from the
Math Department were actually married.</i>

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.989
<i>Snickers.</i>

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.156
<i>And in the grand tradition
of P. E. teachers</i>

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.119
<i>Miss Stoeger seemed to
be same-sex oriented.</i>

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.238
<i>Of course,
there was always Miss Geist.</i>

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.513
<i>Something told me not to discount
Miss Geist.</i>

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.712
<i>Sure, she has runs in her stockings
and her slip is always showing</i>

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.394
<i>and she has more Iipstick on her teeth
than on her mouth.</i>

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.598
Popular uprisings from Estates
to the general assembly.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.718
<i>God, this woman is screaming
for a makeover.</i>

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.279
<i>I'm her only hope.</i>

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.838
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.549
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade"

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.313
Phat! Did you write that?

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.194
-Duh ! It's like a famous quote.
-From where?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.799
<i>CIiffs Notes.</i>

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.719
I know you're going to be
doing better, Travis.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.755
No, if you run along ,
I'll see you third period .

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.992
And we'll try to remember to bring
our textbooks.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.710
Okay.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.869
My God , she actually looked happy!

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.189
Classic.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.433
-Paroudasm Banafshein .
-Here.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.677
Sixteen tardies to work off.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.471
Janet Hong , no tardies.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.117
Travis Birkenstock, 38 tardies.
By far the most tardies in the class.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.918
Congratulations.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.235
This is so unexpected ,
I didn't even have a speech prepared .

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.959
But I would like to say this:

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.038
Tardiness is not something you can do
all on your own .

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.794
Many people
contributed to my tardiness.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.958
I'd like to thank my parents
for never giving me a ride to school .

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.635
The LA City bus drivers for taking
a chance on an unknown kid .

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.832
And last, but not least,
the wonderful crew at McDonald's

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.309
for spending hours
making those Egg McMuffins

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.676
without which I might never be tardy.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.959
If Mr. Birkenstock
has no political messages

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.236
to include in his speech , I'll go on .

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.951
Cher Horowitz, two tardies.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.030
I object.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.509
Do you recall the dates
of these alleged tardies?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.477
One was last Monday.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.676
Mr. Hall ,
I was surfing the crimson wave.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.637
I had to haul ass to the ladies'.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.157
I assume you're referring to women's
troubles and so I'll let that one slide.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.637
Thank you , Mr. Hall .
Miss Geist was right about you .

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.870
What do you mean?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.318
She said that you were the only one
in the school with any intelligence.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.633
Cher, get in here.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.479
Yes, Daddy?

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.917
Would you tell me what the hell this is?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.231
A second notice
for three outstanding tickets.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.351
I don't remember getting a first notice.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.953
The ticket is the first notice.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.600
I didn't even know you can get tickets
without a license.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.557
Sure you can .
You can get tickets anytime.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.870
Is that so? Not around here, you can't.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.072
From this moment on ,
you will not drive, sit,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.711
do anything in that jeep
without a supervised driver present.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.592
No cruising around with Dionne,
all right?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.469
Two permits do not equal a license.
Do I make myself clear?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.870
Yes, Daddy.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.351
I expect you to become a good driver.
I wanna see you apply yourself.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.910
-I will . I'm gonna practice real hard .
-Okay.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.517
<i>A Iicensed driver with nothing to do?
Where would I find such a Ioser?</i>

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.434
Granola breath ,
you got something on your chin .

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.431
-I'm growing a goatee.
-That's good .

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.717
You don't wanna be the last one
at the coffee house without chin pubes.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.519
I can't tell you how much I enjoy
these little chats of ours

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.275
but in the interest of saving time,
why don't you tell me what you want?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.430
Okay.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.477
So, actually

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.638
I have a permit and I can drive and all

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.957
but Daddy says I can't take the jeep out
without a licensed driver.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.951
And since you're not doing
anything and all ...

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.317
What are the chances of you
shutting up till you get your way?

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.437
Slim to none. Come on !

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.669
James Bond , in America we drive
on the right side of the road .

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.320
I am . You try driving in platforms.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.189
I got to get back to school .
Wanna practice parking?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.518
What's the point?
Everywhere you go has valet.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.319
What class are you going to?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.960
Actually, I'm going
to a tree people meeting .

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.232
We might get Marky Mark to plant
a celebrity tree.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.754
How fabulous.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.789
Getting Marky Mark to take time from
his busy pants-dropping schedule

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.279
to plant trees?

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.158
Josh , why don't you
just hire a gardener?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.199
Well , maybe Marky Mark wants to use
his popularity for a good cause.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.032
Make a contribution .

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.149
In case you've never heard of that,
a contribution is the giving of...

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.870
Excuse me, but I have donated
many expensive Italian outfits to Lucy.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.995
...time and funds.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.675
And , as soon as I get my license,
I fully intend to brake for animals.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.231
And I've contributed many hours helping
two lonely teachers find romance.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.353
Which , I'll bet, serves your interests
more than theirs.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.832
If I ever saw you do anything
that wasn't 90OIO selfish , I'd die of shock.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.318
That'd be reason enough for me.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.517
-Would you call me selfish?
-No, not to your face.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.955
Really?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.350
Is Josh giving you shit
'cause he's going through

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.351
his post-adolescent idealistic phase?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.317
Look, there's Mr. Hall .

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.754
Mr. Hall .

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.954
Do you drink coffee?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.156
Not from this cafeteria.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.709
But, yes, under normal circumstances.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.156
I am such a retard . When I was packing
Daddy's lunch this morning

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.274
I gave him my lemon Snapple
and I took his sucky Italian roast.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.393
Do you want it?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.120
-Are you sure you don't want it?
-It might stunt my growth .

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.589
And I wanna be 5' 1 0"
like Cindy Crawford .

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.071
I thought maybe you
or Miss Geist might like it.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.151
Maybe you could share it.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.633
-Thanks.
-Sure.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.113
-Miss Geist.
-H i , girls.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.793
Did you sign up
for the environmental fair?

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.915
Yeah , we will .

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.798
You have such pretty eyes.
Don't hide them .

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.917
-These clips are so cute.
-This top is so '80s.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.832
And this tiny little waist.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.079
You girls are sweet.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.397
Don't forget to sign up
for the environmental fair.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.751
Not a total Betty,
but a vast improvement.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.069
We did our best.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.033
We gotta book
if we're gonna make it to P. E.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.514
Come on , De.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.511
I feel like bailing , dude. Come on .

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.195
I know what you mean , but at least
it's exercise. I feel like such a heifer.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.432
I had two bowls of Special K,
three pieces of turkey bacon ,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.876
a handful of popcorn ,
five peanut butter M&amp;M's

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.793
-and like three pieces of licorice.
-My God . Look.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.316
Is that a photo op or what?

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.353
Would you look at that body language?

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.479
Legs crossed toward each other.
That's an unequivocal sex invite.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.194
-Cher, he's getting her digits.
-Look at Geist. She's so cute.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.800
Old people can be so sweet.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.910
<i>The entire student body was
utterly grateful for the improvement</i>

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.593
<i>in their grades.</i>

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.792
-Cher, what's this all about?
-My report card .

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.911
The same semester?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.830
What'd you do,
turn in some extra-credit reports?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.955
No.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.550
Did you take the midterms over?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.240
You mean to tell me
that you argued your way

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.880
from a C+ to an A-?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.118
Totally based on my
powers of persuasion . Are you proud?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.353
Honey, I couldn't be happier
than if they were based on real grades.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.709
-Fabulous.
-Thank you .

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.829
<i>I felt so satisfied,
I wanted to do more good deeds.</i>

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.550
De, when your allergies act up,
take out your nose ring .

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.314
Follow through . There you go.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.199
All right, Cher.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.149
Earth to Cher! Come in , Cher!

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.993
Miss Stoeger.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.190
I would just like to say that physical
education in this school is a disgrace.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.031
I mean , standing in line for 40 minutes
is hardly aerobically effective.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.349
I doubt I worked off the calories
in a stick of Carefree gum .

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.034
Well , you certainly exercised
your mouth , Cher. Now hit the ball .

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.789
Miss Stoeger, that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen !

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.996
Thanks for the legal advice.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.560
Dionne, you're up.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.393
Miss Stoeger, I have a note
from my tennis instructor

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.638
and he would prefer it
if I didn't expose myself to any training

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.711
that might derail his teachings.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.552
Fine. Amber?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.433
Miss Stoeger, my plastic surgeon
doesn't want me doing

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.478
any activity where balls fly at my nose.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.475
Well , there goes your social life.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.199
Miss Stoeger.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.279
Got another one.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.679
Ladies, we have a new student with us.
This is Tai Fraiser.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.439
Tai , you don't have time to change, but
you can hit a few balls in those clothes.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.239
She could be a farmer in those clothes.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.677
-All right, Amber, that's enough .
-De, my mission is clear.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.276
Would you look at that girl?
She is so adorably clueless.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.512
-We've got to adopt her.
-Cher, she is tore up.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.671
Our stock would plummet.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.116
De, don't you want to use
your popularity for a good cause?

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.793
-No.
-Come here.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.439
Yeah , come here.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.870
-Hang with us.
-Thank you .

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.558
-How do you like California?
-Man , I'm freaking .

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.316
I could really use some sort of
an herbal refreshment.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.438
We do lunch in 1 0 minutes.
We don't have any tea

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.399
-but we have Coke and stuff.
-No shit! You guys got coke here?

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.551
-Yeah .
-Yeah , this is America.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.273
<i>So we decided to show Tai the ropes
at Bronson AIcott High School.</i>

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.319
That is Alana's group over there.
They do the TV station .

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.869
They think
that's the most important thing on earth .

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.519
And that's the Persian Mafia.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.194
You can't hang with them
unless you own a BMW.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.033
And there's Elton in the white vest.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.953
And all the most popular boys
in the school .

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.714
-Including my boyfriend . Ain't he cute?
-Yeah .

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.189
If you make the decision
to date a high-school boy

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.759
they're the only acceptable ones.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.638
Cher, which one of them's
your boyfriend?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.710
As if!

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.950
Cher's got attitude
about high-school boys.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.476
It's a personal choice every woman
has got to make for herself.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.915
Woman , lend me $5.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.391
Murray, I've asked you repeatedly
not to call me "woman ."

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.073
-Excuse me, Miss Dionne.
-Thank you .

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.879
Street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression .

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.190
Most of the feminine pronouns
do have mocking

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.840
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertones.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.031
You guys talk like grownups.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.680
Well , this is a really good school .

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.911
I'm gonna go get a soda.
You guys want?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.832
-Yeah , sure.
-All right.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.159
She's nice.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.835
Project.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.478
That's disgusting .

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.478
That's nice representation there.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.552
Thanks. Those are really nice stickers.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.349
You like them?
I was thinking it was too cluttered .

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.317
I wanna wipe all this out
and concentrate

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.950
on one main decorative statement,
like Marvin the Martian right there.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.634
Get out of town !
I can do Marvin the Martian .

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.869
Really?

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.874
I mean ,
there's not really a lot to him , but

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.633
-you wanna see?
-Yeah .

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.790
Here.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.315
-Wow. That's really cool .
-Thanks.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.553
-You drew that?
-Yeah . And wait, I got

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.274
-one here.
-You didn't trace this?

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.480
No. Here's another one over here.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.716
And lots of little guys.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.312
-That is so cute.
-I love to draw.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.595
You're really good at it.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.591
-No.
-No, really, you are.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.393
-No.
-Yeah .

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.390
-Are you sure that's fat-free?
-Yes.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.075
And you lose weight by doing it like this,
cutting it really small .

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.913
-I met a really cool guy.
-Describe.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.469
All right, he's got long hair,
he's really funny.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.552
Straight off, right, he offers me
some smoke.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.599
There he is.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.554
-Are you talking about drugs?
-Yeah .

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.513
-Tai , how old are you?
-I'll be 1 6 in May.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.155
My birthday's in April ,
and as someone older

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.436
can I please give you some advice?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.512
It is one thing to spark up a doobie
and get laced at parties

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.750
but it is quite another to be fried all day.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.797
Do you see the distinction?

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.038
-Yeah .
-Loadies generally hang

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.872
on the grassy knoll over there.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.429
Sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.709
and we all laugh , of course

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.713
but no respectable girl
actually dates them .

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.871
You don't wanna start off
on the wrong foot now, do you?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.598
I've got an idea.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.797
Let's do a makeover.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.235
No.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.559
Come on , let us. Cher's main thrill
in life is a makeover, okay?

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.234
It gives her a sense of control
in a world full of chaos.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.515
Please?

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.233
Sure. Why not?

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.316
Shit, you guys.
I've never had straight friends before.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.033
<i>Now squeeze your buttocks
when you come up.</i>

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.879
-Squeeze here.
-Cher.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.473
I don't wanna do this anymore.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.712
And my buns,
they don't feel nothing like steel .

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.390
Okay, it will get easier, I promise.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.711
J ust as long as we do it every day,
not just sporadically.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.269
How do you know
if you're doing it sporadically?

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.558
That's another thing , Tai . We've got to
work on your accent and vocabulary.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.520
See, "sporadic" means once in a while.
Try and use it in a sentence today.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.113
-All right.
-Okay, from now on

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.830
we're alternating Cindy Crawford's
<i>Aerobicize</i> and <i>Buns of Steel</i>

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.718
and reading
one non-school book a week.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.195
My first book is <i>Fit or Fat.</i>

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.554
Mine is, <i>Men are from Mars,
Women are from Venus.</i>

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.157
Good . That takes care of our minds
and bodies.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.153
But we should do something good
for mankind or the planet

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.674
for a couple of hours.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.194
Hey, brainiac.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.994
The dreaded ex. Tai , this is Josh .

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.833
N ice to meet you .

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.918
You know about this stuff.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.594
I wanna do something good
for humanity.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.711
How about sterilization?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.270
-What do you think?
-I'm amazed .

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.040
That I am devoting myself so generously
to someone else?

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.190
No.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.557
That you found someone even more
clueless than you are to worship you .

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.553
I am rescuing her from teenage hell .
Do you know the wounds

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.711
of adolescence
could take years to heal?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.191
And you've never had a mother,
so you're acting out on that poor girl

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.554
like she was your Barbie doll .

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.075
Freshman psych rears its ugly head .

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.037
-I am not taking psych .
-Whatever.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.398
I'm going to take that lost soul in there
and make her well-dressed and popular.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.111
Her life will be better because of me.
How many girls can say that about you?

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.031
<i>Mentos better, Mentos fresher</i>

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.239
<i>Fresh goes better with Mentos
fresh and full of Iife</i>

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.390
<i>Mentos.</i>

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.550
The freshmaker.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.712
-Be seeing you .
-Yeah , I hope not sporadically.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.120
My God , do you see how boys
are responding?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.477
-My heart is totally bursting .
-I know. I'm kvelling .

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.317
-Cher, you have Diemer, right?
-Geist.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.437
Tai , did you get a flyer?

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.315
Thanks.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.670
A party.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.116
It's in the Valley. The cops usually
break them up in less than an hour.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.716
-It takes that long to get there.
-Besides, it's just local loadies.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.871
Do you guys think
that Travis is gonna be there?

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.271
-Tai , I thought we moved on from there.
-Don't sell yourself short now.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.113
You've got something going
that no one in this school has.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.270
I'm not a virgin .

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.636
I mean mystery.
As far as everyone's concerned

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.677
you were the most popular girl
in your school .

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.831
And the fact
that you hang with De and I , well ...

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.672
Speaks very highly of you .

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.270
If you strike while the iron is hot,
you can have any guy that you want.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.953
-Yeah .
-Like who?

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.915
Let's see, who's available?
There's Bronson , Brandon . I got it!

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.151
-Elton . He just broke up with Valette.
-Yes !

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.310
Who's Elton?

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.916
My God , he's way popular.
He's like the social director of the crew.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.037
And his dad
can get you into any concert.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.634
And I noticed him scoping you out.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.678
-He was looking at me?
-Says you gave him a toothache.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.795
How'd I do that?

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.394
It's an expression .
It means he thought you were sweet.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.470
Yeah?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.040
-Is that true?
-No.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.633
You are so bad .

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.269
Okay, you guys, let's all get together.
That is great.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.109
Smile.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.397
Tai , get a little closer.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.599
Closer, Tai .

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.833
Elton , why don't you put your arm
around Tai?

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.594
All right.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.633
Yeah , that's good .

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.235
Okay.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.556
Okay. Tai , come here.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.313
-Hold that.
-Okay.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.954
Cool picture.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.839
-Doesn't she look classic?
-Yeah , she's beautiful .

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.878
She looks
like one of those Botticelli chicks.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.793
Why don't you make me
a copy of this, okay?

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.790
Sure.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.632
-H i , Daddy, this is my friend Tai .
-Get out of my chair.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.189
Thank you , Lucy. It looks great.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.760
What is this crap?

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.116
Daddy, it's from
the <i>Cut Your Cholesterol</i> cookbook.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.158
Dr. Lovett says you've got to get down
to 200.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.239
-No calls tonight.
-But it's Dionne.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.913
-I'm sorry.
-It might be important.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.560
We're gonna have a nice family dinner.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.310
So, what did you do in school today?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.391
Well , I broke in my purple clogs.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.954
Yeah , hello?

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.678
Jake. Yeah . No.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.875
De, what up?

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.590
So check it. Murray's Geometry class
is right by Elton's locker

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.479
and taped up inside was
the picture you took of Tai .

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.073
-My God !
-What?

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.515
Elton's got a picture of you
hanging up in his locker.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.999
Oh , no shit!

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.315
Hello !

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.514
So anyway, the whole crew is going
to this party in the Valley.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.715
Bye.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.400
Looks like we're gonna have to make
a cameo at the Val party.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.199
I told you I wanted it in the morning ! No !

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.440
J ust look at the top of the map.
Sun Valley is north .

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.511
No. All I see is Bel Air, okay? That's it.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.194
-Then you're on the wrong map.
-I'm not on the wrong map.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.475
Look at the number on the top.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.797
There are no numbers on the top.
There's letters.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.510
-Murray, shut up.
-Do you think it's gonna frizz out?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.194
Listen , Tai , when we get there,
make sure Elton sees you

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.634
but don't say hi first.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.473
Look like you're having fun
and you're really popular.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.949
Talk to someone in his eye line,
preferably a guy.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.474
Make him come to you .

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.871
And find an excuse to leave
while he's still into the conversation .

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.634
The key is always have him
wanting more. You got it?

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.755
-I got it.
-Okay.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.830
Heads up !

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.479
Did you just see that?

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.120
God , skateboards.
That is like so five years ago.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.158
You guys came. That's great.
You want a beer? I'll get you one.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.310
All right.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.798
Yeah . This shit is whack.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.513
This is raging .

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.632
Let's do a lap before we commit
to a location .

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.679
Who was that?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.350
Cher, ain't that the same dress
that you were wearing yesterday?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.633
Say, Ambular.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.110
H i !

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.598
Was that you going through my laundry?

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.750
As if.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.117
Like I would really wear something
from J udy's.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.756
Do you prefer "fashion victim"
or "ensemble-y challenged?"

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.789
A clone.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.151
Cher, you look much better in that dress
than she did .

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.195
Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you?

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.270
I'm sorry.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.112
Excuse me, my shoe.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.994
This is so not fixable.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.039
It's a small price to pay to
the party gods. Look, I'll make amends.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.270
How about some chronic shit?

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.950
-It's the least you can do.
-Okay.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.114
Spark it.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.469
Elton is over there.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.995
Act like Travis is saying
something funny.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.594
Sorry.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.591
-What's so funny?
-Nothing .

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.195
-Here.
-Hey, everyone.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.351
Let's play Suck and Blow.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.350
God , Elton , can't you suck?

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.678
It's De. Come on .

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.678
What have you done?

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.194
My God .

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.393
-Why did you do this to your head?
-'Cause I'm keeping it real .

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.199
What? Look what he's done to his head .

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.829
-Can you believe this?
-Look at Lawrence's head .

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.594
-It's the bomb.
-Know what I'm saying? You look good !

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.795
As will you .

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.077
What do you care what he thinks?
I'm the one that has to look at you !

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.118
That was a big mistake !
What am I gonna do with you now?

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.909
And right before the yearbook pictures.
What am I gonna tell my grandchildren?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.470
You know what? Okay. That's it.
You wanna play games?

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.473
-I'm calling your mother.
-No, wait, hold on . No.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.154
-Wait, don't call my mom .
-Come on . Chill , man . Chill !

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.395
Don't call my mom !

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.357
The same thing happened
at the spring dance.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.670
She spent the entire after-party
in the bathroom .

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.990
That almost destroyed my buzz.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.078
I'm still baked .

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.640
What do you say
we go bump into people?

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.797
Yeah , I'm cool with that.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.679
Tai , wait up.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.515
-Are you okay?
-Yeah .

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.274
Where's your sense of pit hospitality?

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.592
That was so cool the way you did that.
I wish I could do it.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.870
-No, don't.
-Why not?

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.271
'Cause if girls did it, what would guys do
to impress them?

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.359
I don't know, like, stuff.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.876
-You know?
-What kind of stuff?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.116
-Tai , I need you .
-Okay.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.952
Elton's over there.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.680
Tai . Elton , help me !

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.155
-You guys should use ice.
-No, Travis, we've got it under control .

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.390
Tai , are you okay?

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.030
Travis, Tai would have wanted you
to enjoy the party.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.389
If it's a concussion , you have to keep
her conscious, okay? Ask her questions.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.313
-What's seven times seven?
-Stuff she knows.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.797
-That's some bump you've got there.
-Yeah .

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.759
-You ready to go back out there?
-Yeah , I am .

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.478
All right. You sure? Can you do this?

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.110
<i>Rolling with the homies</i>

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.316
Yeah , let's do it. You're ready.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.269
<i>I had to give myself snaps
for all the good deeds I was doing.</i>

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.239
<i>It was so great. Love was everywhere.</i>

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.230
<i>Even though I was alone,
I was really happy for Tai.</i>

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.553
<i>It's Iike that book I read in ninth grade
that said,</i>

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.395
<i>"'Tis a far, far better thing doing stuff
for other people."</i>

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.991
-Hello?
<i>-Do you know what time it is?</i>

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.276
A watch doesn't really
go with this outfit, Daddy.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.549
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.029
I'm just having a snack
with my girlfriends.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.509
<i>-Where, in Kuwait?</i>
-Is that in the Valley?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.036
<i>Cher, I expect you to walk in this door
in 20 minutes.</i>

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.318
Well , it might take
longer than that, Dad .

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.080
<i>Everywhere in LA takes 20 minutes.</i>

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.195
Sorry to make you leave.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.955
Dionne's bucking for
Best Dramatic Actress at a Val Party.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.555
Hey, Summer.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.992
H i . Pretty random fiesta.
Do you need a ride home?

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.832
-That'd be great. Thanks.
-No, I got her.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.752
I'm right below
Wilshire and Linden , so...

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.400
That's right near me.
I'm above Olympic.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.831
Great. Then , Tai , you'll go with Summer
and , Cher, you'll come with me.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.073
Actually, you could take Wilshire
to Canon and that turns into Benedict.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.233
Well , then she'd have to go back south
and I'm already going north .

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.274
But you could take Tai on your way
up to Sunset.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.196
-Yeah .
-That doesn't make any sense.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.357
I'd have to get off the freeway.
I hate that. Tai , go with Summer.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.954
Cher, you'll come with me.
Watch your feet.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.757
Didn't Tai look cute tonight?

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.274
<i>Turn away</i>

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.069
<i>Turn away</i>

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.478
<i>Turn away</i>

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.316
I really love her hair
when it's all wild , you know.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.797
It's also very pretty when it's all up
with that curly tendrils

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.518
like in that picture I took.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.591
You know,
you're one of my best friends.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.196
And I do not have friends that are girls.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.791
Well , I'm glad because your happiness
means a lot to me.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.995
It does?

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.357
Sure. I saw how hard your breakup
with Valette was.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.673
Yeah . I think we both know
what it feels like to be lonely.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.829
Whatever. The thing is
I'd really like to see you settled already.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.672
Where are we going?

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.880
I knew it.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.679
You knew what?

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.189
-That you were totally sprung on me.
-Hello ! Don't you mean Tai?

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.749
-Tai?
-You have her picture in your locker.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.309
I have the picture you took in my locker.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.313
I'm having a <i>Twin Peaks</i> experience.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.070
-I knew it. I knew when you kissed me.
-Suck and Blow is a game, Elton .

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.753
No, it's not.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.109
Stop it.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.633
Fine. You know, I don't get you , Cher.
I mean , you flirt with me all year.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.040
As if.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.915
I have been trying to get you together
with Tai .

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.435
Tai? Why would I go with Tai?

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.679
-Why not?
-Why not? Why not?

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.080
Don't you even know who my father is?

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.197
You are a snob and a half.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.716
Cher, listen to me. Me and Tai .

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.590
We don't make any sense. Right?

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.914
Me and you .

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.594
Well , I mean , that makes sense.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.396
-Cut it out!
-Come on , Cher.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.755
Stop it!

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.076
Cher. Where you going?

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.996
You're only hurting yourself here, baby.
Come on .

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.913
You gonna walk home?
Get back in the car, please.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.629
Get back in the car.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.279
Leave me alone.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.630
Fine.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.432
Where are you going?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.510
Shit.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.869
<i>Valley Information.</i>

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.712
Do you have the number
of a cab company?

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.875
<i>Which one?</i>

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.520
I don't know which one.
What do you have out here?

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.557
<i>-We have Valley Cab.</i>
-Hand it over.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.439
Give me the phone. Okay.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.076
Your bag , too. Come on !

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.311
All right. Now, get down on the ground .
Face down .

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.274
-Come on !
-Oh , no. You don't understand .

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.993
This is an Alaia.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.639
An A-what?

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.918
It's like a totally important designer.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.753
And I will totally shoot you in the head .

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.469
Get down .

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.157
That's good . That's good right there.
All right.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.032
Count to 1 00. Thank you .

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.278
One, two...

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.113
<i>The evening had turned into
a royal mess.</i>

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.069
<i>Sexually harassed. Robbed.</i>

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.432
<i>I didn 't know the number of the party,
so I couldn 't call Dionne.</i>

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.200
<i>And Daddy would kill me
if he knew where I was.</i>

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.078
<i>There was just one person Ieft to call</i>

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.720
<i>and I really, really didn 't want
to call him.</i>

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.834
Come on .

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.351
-Hello?
-Josh , you busy?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.477
-Who is it?
-It's Mel's daughter.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.439
So, okay, I was at this party
and my designated driver

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.670
tried to attack me,
so I got out so he'd stop.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.320
<i>But then he drove off and deserted me.</i>

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.756
And then this guy with a gun
held me up, took my money

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.158
and my phone and he yelled at me
and he forced me to ruin my dress.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.711
Okay. Look, where are you?

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.759
Sun Valley.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.593
Man , you owe me.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.558
Look, the man is ridiculous.
He doesn't have one unique thought

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.631
in his little, puny brain .

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.599
I think that there's some merit
in learning forms straight off.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.514
Josh , please. He's taken our minds
at their most fecund point.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.557
-What?
-And restrained them before they've

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.109
wandered through the garden of ideas.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.034
It's just like Hamlet said ,
"To thine own self be true."

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.589
No, Hamlet didn't say that.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.073
I think
that I remember Hamlet accurately.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.198
I remember Mel Gibson accurately
and he didn't say that.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.277
That Polonius guy did .

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.839
I'm gonna walk Heather to her door.
Try and stay out of trouble.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.391
<i>My Iife is turning into a bigger disaster
than Malibu.</i>

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.997
<i>I didn 't know
what I was going to say to Tai.</i>

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.912
<i>I felt really nervous.</i>

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.638
<i>And even Fabianne, my masseuse,
said I had a Iot of tension in my back.</i>

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.911
It's my hips, isn't it?

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.232
-No, of course not.
-Yes.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.118
Don't be stupid .
You could do so much better.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.919
-He thinks he's all that, Tai .
-Yeah , God's gift.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.195
You're too good for him .

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.836
If I'm too good for him ,
then how come I'm not with him?

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.878
I have got an idea.
Let's blow off seventh and eighth

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.840
go to the mall , have a calorie fest,
and see the new Christian Slater.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.995
Yes !

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.357
You guys.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.594
Look at him .

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.155
Baby!

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.956
Break me off a piece of that.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.277
-Survey says?
-Doable.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.357
Puny. I like them big .

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.233
I hate muscles.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.512
You know what,
I don't really care either way.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.834
J ust as long as his you-know-what
isn't crooked . I really hate that.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.390
What?

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.916
-Don't scare her.
-Why, what's wrong?

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.274
Cher's saving herself for Luke Perry.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.433
Cher, you're a virgin?

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.352
God , you say that like it's a bad thing .

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.796
Besides, the P. C. term
is "hymenally challenged ."

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.194
I am just not interested in doing it
until I find the right person .

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.557
You see how picky I am about
my shoes, and they only go on my feet.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.670
Yeah .

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.116
-God , you're one to talk, De.
-Wait a minute here. Wait.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.910
I thought that, like,
you and Murray were...

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.436
My man is satisfied .
He's got no cause for complaints.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.838
But technically, I am a virgin .
You know what I mean .

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.400
Oh , God .

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.313
-What's wrong , Tai?
-They're playing our song .

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.600
You know, the one that Elton and I
danced to.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.796
<i>Rolling with the homies</i>

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.439
-Tai . Don't cry.
-I'm sorry.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.229
Oh , God .

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.075
Stop !

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.075
<i>I could tell Tai's grieving period
would be considerable</i>

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.750
<i>unless I found someone
to take EIton 's place right away.</i>

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.991
<i>So, okay, I don 't want to be a traitor
to my generation and all</i>

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.435
<i>but I don 't get how guys dress today.</i>

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.273
<i>I mean, come on,
it Iooks Iike theyjust fell out of bed</i>

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.876
<i>and put on some baggy pants
and take their greasy hair</i>

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.113
<i>and cover it up with a backwards cap
and, Iike, we're expected to swoon ?</i>

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.398
<i>I don 't think so.</i>

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.190
<i>Searching for a boy in high school is
as useless as searching for meaning</i>

<i>in a Pauly Shore movie.</i>

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.118
So this must be the elusive Christian .

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.918
-Where should I park?
-There's one, third back.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.759
<i>Okay. Now I know I said I'd find
a guy for Tai</i>

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.434
<i>but I suppose there's no harm
in finding one for myself also.</i>

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.394
N ice stems.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.874
Thanks.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.513
-Cher?
-Present.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.195
I guess we established that
during attendance.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.432
-It's time for your oral .
-Excuse me?

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.831
Your original oral .
The topic is violence in the media.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.594
So, okay.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.114
The Attorney General says

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.352
there's too much violence on TV
and that should stop.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.479
But even if you took out all the violent
shows, you could still see the news.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.111
U ntil mankind is peaceful enough
not to have violence on the news

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.114
there's no point in taking it out of shows
that need it for entertainment value.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.150
Thank you .

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.311
Any comments? Elton?

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.789
My foot hurts. Can I go to the nurse?

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.550
Travis?

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.156
Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
Fine holiday fun .

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.591
Hello ! Was I the only one listening?

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.990
I mean , I thought it reeked .

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.311
I believe that was your
designer imposter perfume.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.229
I dug it.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.395
<i>During the next few days,
I did what any normal girl would do...</i>

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.392

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.919
<i>and flowers and candy...</i>

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.960
<i>just so he'd see how desired I was,

-Yes?

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.594
You rationed this weekend?

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.709
Like Saturday.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.634
I'm new, but I thought maybe
you had an in on the heavy clambakes.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.952
My ex-stepbrother's friends
are having a party.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.475
Solid .

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.036
<i>Suddenly Daddy had a case
that had to be solved right away</i>

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.318
<i>so some clerks and Josh came to help
him go through a gazillion depositions.</i>

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.796
-Daddy!
-What?

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.111
I can't just open it,
I have to make him wait a while !

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.793
Then he can wait outside.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.076
Josh , please?

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.557
Come on , Josh !

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.075
Come on !

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.513
What do you hear?

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.599
She's not ready.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.909
Hey, man .

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.431
N ice pile of bricks you got here.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.239
-You drink?
-No, thanks. I'm cool .

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.909
I'm not offering .
I'm asking you if you drink.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.277
You think I'd give alcohol to
teenage drivers taking my daughter out?

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.192
Hey, man , the protective vibe, I dig .

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.679
What's with you , kid?

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.510
You think the death of Sammy Davis
left an opening in the rat pack?

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.319
Christian .

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.434
Doll face.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.029
Handsome.

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.674
Stunning .

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.035
You're not letting her go out like that,
are you?

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.151
-Cher, get in here.
-What's up, Daddy?

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.675
-What the hell is that?
-A dress.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.637
-Says who?
-Calvin Klein .

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.156
It looks like underwear!
Go upstairs and put something over it!

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.390
I was just going to.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.149
Hey, you !

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.831
Anything happens to my daughter,
I got a .45 and a shovel .

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.878
I doubt anybody would miss you .

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.229
Bye, Daddy.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.034
Come on .

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.113
-It's so killer.
-Thank you .

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.755
-Your dad is pretty scary.
-Isn't he?

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.234
-You like Billie Holiday?
-I love him .

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.589
Right.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.714
-I didn't like him .
-What's to like?

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.436
-Maybe I should go to the party.
-If you feel like you should go.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.551
-You don't need me, do you?
-No.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.116
-I mean , unless you want me to stay. . .
-Josh , go to the party. Go.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.190
Okay.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.111
-I'll watch her for you .
-Okay.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.359
You do that.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.355
Tai !

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.680
Oh , my God !

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.034
Tai , are you okay?

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.236
God , shit, that is so embarrassing .

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.276
No, no one saw.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.830
Good . Now all night long I'll be known
as "that girl who fell on her butt."

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.955
Tai , no one noticed .

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.475
Wow, are you okay?
That looked really bad .

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.755
Yeah , thanks.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.113
Oh , my God , Cher, look.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.151
He's going with Amber?

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.114
No, he's probably just dancing with her.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.997
-Do you think she's pretty?
-She's a full-on Monet.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.555
-What's a Monet?
-It's like the paintings, see?

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.473
From far away it's okay,
but up close it's a big old mess.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.789
Let's ask a guy.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.837
Christian , what do you think of Amber?

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.351
-Hagsville.
-See?

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.070
Dig this, they're charging for brewskies.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.280
-Pass me a fin , I'll pay you back?
-Sure.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.749
Thanks.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.078
Oh , he is so cute.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.439
Oh , my God , do you see
how he's falling in love with me?

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.479
Excuse me.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.597
I mean , look how he ignores
every other girl .

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.991
What's it all about?
What am I gonna do with that?

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.275
I wouldn't know.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.913
Oh , God , look. There's Josh .

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.315
I didn't even see him come in . But it's
like he finds the only adult in here.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.710
Like he's deliberately trying
to not have fun .

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.835
Cher, I have a question .

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.355
What should I do with this,
should I tie it around

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.869
-or put it over my shoulders?
-Tie it around your waist.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.792
-Ready to slide?
-Thanks.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.109
Let's go.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.035
<i>The band was kicking
and Christian was the hottest guy there.</i>

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.995
<i>But my enjoyment was put on pause
when I saw how unhappy Tai was.</i>

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.553
-H i .
-H i .

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.080
When I see a beautiful girl ,
I think we were born to move.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.190
What?

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.270
Look! Josh is dancing with Tai !
He never dances.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.555
I can see why.

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.235
No, he's doing her a prop
so she won't be left out.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.799
Oh , I dig you .

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.273
-How are you guys holding up?
-I'm so ready to leave.

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.475
Tired .

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.949
Let's get Christian and go. Christian

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.033
-you wanna go?
-Now?

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.238
These guys right here got the skinny
on the happening after-hours.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.880
My trainer's coming really early
this morning .

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.719
-Look, I could take the girls home.
-No, that's all right.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.155
-No, it's fine, stay.
-You sure?

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.310
Yeah , sure.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.073
Thanks, man . You got my marker.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.115
You are a down girl .
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.553
It was really decent of you
to dance with Tai tonight.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.675
My pleasure.

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.956
Did you notice
any positive changes in her?

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.075
Yeah .

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.917
U nder your tutelage, she's exploring
the challenging world of bare midriffs.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.190
So you didn't want to make a night of it
with the ring-a-ding kid?

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.273
Yeah , Daddy wouldn't go too ballistic.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.873
It's not like he's going to sleep.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.156
No. Not if they're going
to finish those depos.

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.718
Hey, you know what would be so dope?
If we got some really delicious takeout.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.677
I bet they haven't eaten all night.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.274
Yeah , that would be pretty dope of us.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.835
Let's do it.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.629
<i>The midnight snack totally revived the
Iawyers and Daddy was way grateful.</i>

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.710
Meat.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.030
Eat oranges, you get a lot of vitamin C.
Daddy, no !

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.236
-You know you can't have that.
-Cher, come on !

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.276
Don't be silly.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.555
<i>I know it sounds mental</i>

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.599
<i>but sometimes I have more fun
vegging out than when I go partying.</i>

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.717
<i>Maybe because my party clothes
are so binding.</i>

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.995
Look, I'm just curious.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.754
How many hours a day do you spend
grooming yourself?

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.919
Some people are not lucky enough
to be as naturally adorable as you are.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.911
Stop it, you're making me blush .

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.990
Hello.

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.593
<i>Hi, Cher, how are you?</i>

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.875
H i , Gail .

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.349
<i>Is my son there
cleaning out your refrigerator?</i>

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.909
No, he's not here.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.513
You should try the dorms.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.829
<i>AII right. Bye, hon.</i>

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.990
Bye-bye.

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.670
What was that all about?

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.592
She wants me to come home
for spring break.

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.637
What's the big deal?
Nobody will be in school .

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.836
Yeah , but H usband N umber 4
is at home

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.753
and his whole idea
of acting like a family is to criticize me.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.151
So what, you're gonna roam around
campus for two weeks all by yourself?

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.275
I don't mind .

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.036
That is stupid .
Why don't you just come here,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.351
you can have your old room , and
there are gonna be some great parties.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.875
-No.
-Why not?

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.429
You got your whole social world
going on . I don't want to get in the way.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.079
You won't be in the way.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.118
How much fun would it be
having a brother-type tagging along?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.952
Josh , you are not my brother.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.879
Look, you know what I mean .

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.550
Come on , you need some excitement
in your life.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.677
It will replenish you for your finals.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.557
-Okay.
-Good .

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.197
I can't believe I'm taking advice
from someone who watches cartoons.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.149
<i>Be quiet, you idiot!</i>

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.833
That's <i>Ren and Stimpy.</i>

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.312
They are way existential .

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.597
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.069
No. Why, do I sound like I do?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.630
<i>Christian said he'd call the next day,
but in boy time that meant Thursday.</i>

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.393
<i>You can imagine my astonishment</i>

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.437
<i>to hear from him
while I was packing Daddy up.</i>

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.590
Hello?

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.316
<i>He said he'd come over with
some videotapes and we'd watch them.</i>

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.399
<i>A night alone with Christian ?
I sent for reinforcements.</i>

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.470
De !

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.631
<i>Then De and I
had to design a Iighting concept.</i>

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.839
<i>And costume decisions.</i>

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.157
<i>I don 't rely on mirrors
so I always take Polaroids.</i>

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.796
<i>Whenever a boy comes, you should
always have something baking.</i>

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.873
Oh ! I'm still all red !

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.032
I'm trying to make you
as white as I can , Cher.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.397
Look, you're all flushed .
You have to calm down . Okay, calm .

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.193
You know, I am so glad I never did it

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.749
with someone
I had lukewarm feelings for

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.912
'cause Christian is brutally hot.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.397
And I am gonna
remember tonight forever.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.515
Blot.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.830
H i .

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.835
H i .

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.989
Something burning?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.439
Oh , my God !

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.200
Oh , honey, you baked .

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.909
I tried .

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.153
Come on . Show me the rest of your pad .

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.991
Your father
has a well-rounded collection .

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.753
Daddy says it's a good investment.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.719
He's absolutely right. Claes Oldenburg .

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.552
Oh , he's way famous.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.712
But this is older, see? Transitional .

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.793
A very important piece.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.518
You want to go swimming?

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.636
-Let's watch the movies.
-Oh , okay.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.277
<i>Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis</i>

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.478
<i>so he brought over</i> Some Like It Hot
<i>and</i> Sparaticus.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.279
<i>Singer of songs.</i>

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.710
<i>For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?</i>

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.634
<i>For the children of my master
whom I also taught the classics.</i>

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.029
<i>CIassics, indeed?</i>

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.675
<i>What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?</i>

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.837
<i>You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.</i>

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.354
<i>AII ofyou, come with me.</i>

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.118
My feet are cold .

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.910
Thanks.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.077
Oh , watch this part. This is good .

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.069
Are you okay?

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.559
I'm fine.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.352
Do you want something to drink?
You know, I could get you some wine.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.430
No.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.391
You notice how wine makes people
want to feel , like sexy?

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.074
That's okay.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.158
I'm actually getting tired .

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.470
But I can make you some coffee
if you'd like.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.120
Oh , no, thanks. Got the ulcer.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.596
You had all those cappuccinos before.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.960
Well , you know, that was, like, foam .

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.799
You're great. We're friends, right?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.714
Knock me a little kiss.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.870
I'll see you .

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.751
<i>I don 't get it. Did my hair get flat?</i>

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.516
<i>Did I stumble into some bad Iighting?</i>

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.394
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.074
Nothing ! Maybe he really was tired .

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.233
I suppose it wasn't meant to be.
I mean , he does dress better than I do.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.072
What would I bring to the relationship?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.913
Get back into the right lane.
What's the first thing you do?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.037
The first thing I do is I put on my blinker.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.713
Oh , wait, shit.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.519
-Watch the road !
-All right! Stop !

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.830
Then I look in my mirror.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.670
Okay. Then I glance at my blind spot.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.716
You glance with your head
not the whole car!

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.870
I swear to God ...

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.679
I swear to God , woman ,
you can't drive for shit!

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.070
-I'm not trying to hear that. No.
-Hear me ! You ...

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.949
Actually, going all the way
is like a really big decision .

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.190
I can't believe
I was so capricious about it.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.989
De, I almost had sex with him .

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.593
You almost had sex with who?

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.869
Christian .

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.035
What?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.519
Look, are you bitches
blind or something?

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.479
-Your man Christian is a cake boy.
-A what?

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.949
He's a disco-dancing ,
Oscar Wilde-reading ,

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.917
Streisand ticket-holding ,
friend of Dorothy.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.149
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.398
-No way.
-He's gay.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.596
-Not even .
-Yes, even .

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.437
He does like to shop, Cher.
And the boy can dress.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.114
Oh , my God , I am totally bugging .

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.870
I feel like such a bonehead .

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.114
What the hell?
You're getting on the freeway!

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.430
-What?
-No, turn right! Get out of the lane !

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.080
No ! Forget procedure,
just get out of the lane !

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.319
A truck!

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.677
We're on the freeway!

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.909
What do I do, Murray?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.719
J ust go straight! Go straight! Go !

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.835
Oh , shit!

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.514
J ust relax and drive, baby.
J ust relax and drive.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.590
Okay.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.872
I'm here with you .

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.037
Shut up !

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.353
Whatever you do, keep your hands
on the wheel at all times !

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.515
Oh , my God !

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.150
J ust go !

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.992
-Turn to the right!
-Okay.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.432
Oh , there it is. All right, we're off.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.839
You did wonderful .

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.117
-It's all right, baby. Relax.
-You did it, De.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.789
Honey, relax. Baby, relax.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.918
Breathe, breathe in .
Breathe and let it out.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.674
Breathe, honey, breathe. Relax.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.513
<i>Boy, getting off the freeway makes
you realize how important Iove is.</i>

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.958
<i>After that, Dionne's virginity
went from "technical" to "nonexistent"</i>

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.471
<i>and I realized how much
I wanted a boyfriend of my own.</i>

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.799
<i>Not that Christian wasn 't a blast
to hang out with,</i>

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.878
<i>he was becoming one of my favorite
shopping partners.</i>

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.638
The black one was, but so is the red .

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.070
Where's Tai?

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.231
She met some random guys
at the Foot Locker

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.231
and escorted them right over there.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.754
Oh , my God , did you?

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.070
I don't know where she meets
these Barneys.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.231
-I have a question , all right?
-What?

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.279
The jacket, is it James Dean
or Jason Priestley?

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.399
<i>Carpe diem,</i> okay? You looked hot in it.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.550
Really?

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.759
-If I fall . . .
-Don't worry.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.114
-...would you guys catch me?
-Yeah !

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.151
Could they please be more generic?

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.590
Stop it! Please !

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.115
Put me back up ! Please put me back!

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.316
Put me down !

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.869
Thank you .

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.795
-You asshole !
-Hey, man , we're just joking .

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.440
Oh , really? Somebody could get killed .

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.477
-Oh , my God .
-It's okay.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.955
Cher, you don't understand ,
I was sitting there

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.475
and I was talking to those guys
and all of a sudden

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.994
we were laughing and they were...

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.514
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah .

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.193
-You sure?
-I'm fine.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.152
-Let's get you home for some R and R.
-What's that?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.554
<i>Boy, considering
how clueless she was</i>

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.996
<i>Tai certainly had
that damsel in distress act down.</i>

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.152
<i>Meanwhile, back at school,
everyone was talking about</i>

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.436
<i>Tai's brush with death at the mall.</i>

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.955
Was it like a montage of all the scenes
in your life?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.230
Not exactly a montage.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.830
Cher, is it true some gang members
tried to shoot Tai in the mall?

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.876
No.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.633
Well , that's what everyone is saying .

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.949
Whatever.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.671
When I was 9, I fell off this jungle gym .

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.229
That G-spot
that they talk about in <i>Cosmo...</i>

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.029
Wait, move down for Cher.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.190
H i .

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.679
Tell me more.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.795
Where was I?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.076
You were thinking
about what was really important.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.150
Right.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.197
Okay, right before you die,
your mind just sort of gets very clear.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.350
It's a very intense spiritual feeling ...

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.670
I know when I was held at gunpoint...

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.671
-Excuse me. You were saying?
-It's spiritual .

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.276
I don't know, I can't pinpoint
the spirituality of it for you

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.317
if you've never experienced
anything quite...

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.870
Tai , I was planning on going to Tower
and getting something for Christian .

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.112
You know, like some kind of present
or something . You want to come?

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.953
Sure. I mean , I owe him my life.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.189
So I'll get you after school .

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.239
Yeah . You know, not today,
I'm going over to Melrose with Amber.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.994
We're going to Melrose.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.600
How about tomorrow?

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.432
Do you think
we could do it next Monday?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.557
I mean my week's filling up
pretty fast here.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.714
So when we got back from the I HOP
it was 8: 00.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.553
Oh , swoon . Here comes your boyfriend .

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.352
Hey, Tai , check it out.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.432
Could you shove down a little bit?

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.555
No.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.349
Hello, don't the slackers
prefer that grassy knoll over there?

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.629
Tai .

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.314
-Well , so anyway. . .
-What?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.879
Have you ever done it in water?

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.394
-Oh , yeah .
-Really?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.669
Does the sponge work in water?

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.273
<i>What was happening?</i>

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.273
<i>Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?</i>

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.392
<i>Tai being the most popular girl
in school?</i>

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.714
<i>It was Iike some sort of
alternate universe.</i>

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.549
<i>On top of everything else,
I was going to take the driving test.</i>

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.596
<i>So I had to find
my most responsible-Iooking ensemble.</i>

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.355
Where's my white collarless shirt
from Fred Segal?

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.031
-Lucy, where's my shirt?
-Probably at the cleaner.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.791
But today's the driving test.
It's my most capable-looking outfit.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.440
Okay, I call them .

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.434
It's too late now.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.790
We got another notice
from the fire department

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.473
saying we have to clear out the bush .

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.312
You said you were gonna get
Josė to do it.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.636
He's your gardener,
why you don't tell him?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.916
Lucy, you know I don't speak Mexican .

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.151
I not a Mexican !

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.392
-Great. What was that all about?
-Lucy's from El Salvador.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.995
So?

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.713
It's an entirely different country.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.154
What does that matter?

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.709
You get upset if someone thinks
you live below Sunset.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.270
Okay. So everything is all my fault.
I'm always wrong , right?

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.350
You're such a brat.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.159
<i>I had an overwhelming sense
of ickiness.</i>

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.995
<i>Even though I apologized to Lucy,
something was still plaguing me.</i>

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.838
<i>Like Josh thinking I was mean
was making me postal.</i>

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.399
Move into the right lane.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.070
<i>Anyway, why should I care
what Josh thinks?</i>

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.754
<i>Why was I Ietting it
throw me into such turmoil?</i>

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.478
-Watch out for the bike rider!
-Hey!

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.551
Oops, my bad .

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.111
What are you doing?
You can't take up both lanes.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.873
Get in the right lane.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.639
Not so close !

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.478
Should I write them a note?

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.070
Pull over up here
and turn off the engine.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.558
Yeah , right there.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.199
Are you gonna take me somewhere
to make left-hand turns?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.953
We're going back to the DMV.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.236
-It's over?
-It's over.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.950
-Well , how did I do?
-How'd you do?

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.077
Well , let's see, shall we?

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.320
You can't park. You can't switch lanes.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.518
You can't make right-hand turns.
You've damaged private property

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.874
and you almost killed someone.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.554
Offhand , I'd say you failed .

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.989
Failed?

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.557
Well , can't we just start over?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.392
I'm kind of having a personal problem .

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.993
My mind was somewhere else.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.754
You saw how that biker
came out of nowhere, right?

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.557
I swear I'll concentrate.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.517
I drive really good usually.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.911
Isn't there somebody else I can talk to?
A supervisor or something?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.039
You can't be the absolute and final word
in drivers' licenses.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.757
Girlie, as far as you're concerned ,
I am the messiah of the DMV.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.352
Now get out of the car.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.317
<i>I can 't believe I failed.</i>

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.199
<i>I failed something
I couldn 't talk my way out of?</i>

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.999
All right. Put your legs into me.
Thank you .

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.115
Okay.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.470
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.029
-You're home.
-How does it feel to have a license?

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.194
I wouldn't know. I failed .

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.634
Oh . Bummer.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.273
And , Josh , spare me your lectures

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.556
on how driving
is such a big responsibility

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.671
you can't B. S. your way through it, okay?

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.594
I didn't say anything .

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.034
I know what you're thinking .

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.560
I got to tell you something .

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.597
I'm really sorry about your test and all .

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.954
I'm so glad you're here.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.431
There's something I got to do and
I need you here with me while I do it.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.318
-Does this thing work?
-Yeah . Sure.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.635
What is this stuff?

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.360
This is a bunch of junk
that reminded me of Elton .

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.398
But I want to burn it
because I am so over him .

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.597
-Well , what stuff?
-All right.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.469
Do you remember
when we were at the Val party

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.394
and the clog knocked me out
and Elton got a towel of ice to cure me?

01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.470
Yeah .

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.957
I didn't tell you at the time,
but I took the towel home as a souvenir.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.598
-You're kidding .
-No.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.956
And then , do you remember that song
that was playing when we danced?

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.953
Remember that?
You know, the <i>Rolling with the Homies?</i>

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.433
Anyways, I got the tape, right?
I listened to it like every single night.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.079
Don't burn that. Okay.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.517
Tai , I'm really happy for you

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.194
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment?

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.555
It's like

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.151
I met this guy
who's so totally amazing

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.231
that he makes Elton look like a loser.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.799
That is so great.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.270
Look, you've got to help me get Josh .

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.439
Get Josh what?

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.553
You know what I mean .

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.955
I like him .

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.157
Do you think that he likes you?

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.310
Yeah .

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.715
How do you know?

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.873
Like little things, you know?

01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.079
He always. . . He finds some sort of way
to touch me or tickle me.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.398
Do you remember the time at the frat
when I was totally depressed

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.950
and he asked me to dance with him
and he was really flirty?

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.795
You okay?

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.110
Yeah .

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.636
Actually, I was really bad today.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.155
I had two mochaccinos.
I feel like ralphing .

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.750
I know exactly how that feels.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.310
Like, the other day,
I was talking to Josh

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.879
and we were discussing the difference

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.395
between high-school girls
and college girls.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.353
College girls wear less makeup
on their face

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.153
and that's why guys like them more.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.994
But, Tai , do you really think
you'd be good with Josh?

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.594
I mean , he's like a school nerd .

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.555
What, am I some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead?

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.276
No, not even . I didn't say that.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.954
What, I'm not good enough
for Josh or something?

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.591
I just don't think you'd

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.480
mesh well together.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.989
You don't think that we mesh well?

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.038
Why am I even listening
to you to begin with?

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.194
You're a virgin who can't drive.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.717
That was way harsh , Tai .

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.075
All right. Look, I'm really sorry.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.315
Let's just talk when we've mellowed ,
all right? I'm Audi .

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.393
<i>What did I do?</i>

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.875
<i>I've created some sort of a monster.</i>

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.636
<i>I could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat.</i>

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.799
<i>I had to get out.</i>

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.591
<i>Everything I think
and everything I do is wrong.</i>

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.390
<i>I was wrong about EIton,
I was wrong about Christian...</i>

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.238
<i>now Josh hated me.</i>

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.592
<i>It all boiled down
to one inevitable conclusion:</i>

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.349
<i>I was just totally clueless.</i>

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.878
<i>Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing
was wigging me more than anything.</i>

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.078
<i>I mean, what was my problem?
Tai is my pal.</i>

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.516
<i>I don 't begrudge her a boyfriend.
I really...</i>

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.069
<i>I wonder if they have that in my size.</i>

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.235
<i>What does she want with Josh anyway?</i>

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.551
<i>He dresses funny,
he Iistens to complaint rock</i>

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.235
<i>he's not even cute
in a conventional way.</i>

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.559
<i>I mean, he's just Iike this slug</i>

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.956
<i>who hangs around the house
all the time.</i>

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.510
<i>And he's a hideous dancer.</i>

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.837
<i>Couldn 't take him anywhere.</i>

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.958
<i>Wait a second,
what am I stressing about?</i>

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.634
<i>This is, Iike, Josh.</i>

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.636
<i>Okay, so he is kind of a Baldwin.</i>

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.637
<i>But what would he want with Tai?</i>

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.472
<i>She couldn 't make him happy.</i>

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.759
<i>Josh needs someone with imagination,
someone to take care of him.</i>

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.710
<i>Someone to Iaugh at his jokes,
in case he ever makes any.</i>

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.233
<i>Then suddenly...</i>

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.793
Oh , my God !

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.918
I love Josh .

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.631
<i>I am majorly, totally,
butt crazy in Iove with Josh!</i>

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.915
<i>But now I don 't know
how to act around him.</i>

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.072
<i>Ordinarily, I'd strut around him
in my cutest Iittle outfits</i>

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.720
<i>and send myself flowers and candy</i>

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.317
<i>but I couldn 't do that stuff with Josh.</i>

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.156
-What's with you?
-What do you mean?

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.670
You're so quiet.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.350
Haven't made me watch
<i>The Real World.</i>

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.114
I care about the news.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.072
-Since when?
-Since now.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.516
<i>...retaliation for recent government
successes in central Bosnia.</i>

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.275
You look confused .

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.035
Well , I thought they declared peace
in the Middle East.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.834
-Cher, get in here.
-What's up, Daddy?

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.190
What are you doing
dancing in front of my office?

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:11.030
Nothing . I just wanted to see
if you need any help with anything .

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.636
Yeah , you could help me
with something .

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.515
Come over here.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.110
All right.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.391
Every time that you see
a telephone conversation

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.471
that took place on September 3,
highlight it.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.233
-J ust September 3.
-Okay.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.720
It's fun?

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.069
Yeah .

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.675
Okay.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.389
Daddy, did you ever have a problem
that you couldn't argue your way out of?

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.438
Tell me the problem
and we'll figure out how to argue it.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.752
-I like this boy. . .
-Yes?

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.319
...and he likes someone else.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.392
-How could that be?
-I don't know, but I feel wretched .

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.233
Obviously this boy is a complete moron .

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.472
You are the most beautiful girl
in Beverly H ills.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.269
To tell you the truth , I'm not sure
I want you with a stupid fellow like that.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.553
Actually he is a smart guy

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.315
and , you know,
he's one of those do-gooder types

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.075
and now I feel like all my after-school
commitments are just not good enough .

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.434
How can you say that?

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.950
Who takes care of everyone
in this household?

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.191
Who makes sure that Daddy eats right?

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.792
To tell you the truth ,
I have not seen such good doing

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.275
since your mother.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.836
-Really?
-Really.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.474
Now get back to work.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.156
<i>Later, while we were Iearning
about the Pismo Beach disaster</i>

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.034
<i>I decided I needed
a complete makeover.</i>

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.392
<i>Except this time I'd make over my soul.</i>

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.830
<i>But what makes somebody
a better person ?</i>

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.239
<i>And then I realized all my friends
were really good in different ways.</i>

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.598
<i>Like Christian, he always wants things
to be beautiful and interesting.</i>

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.479
<i>Or Dionne and Murray,</i>

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.275
<i>when they think no one is watching,
are so considerate of each other.</i>

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.634
<i>And poor Miss Geist</i>

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.031
<i>always trying to get us involved,
no matter how much we resist.</i>

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.999
Oh , this is just...

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.392
That doesn't even show, every
single possession , every memory

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.950
everything you've had your whole life,
gone in a second .

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.596
Can you imagine
what that must feel like?

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.239
-Elton?
-Can I use the pass?

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.555
Yeah .

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.156
We'll be collecting blankets,
disposable diapers,

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.639
canned goods.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.795
Miss Geist?

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.197
-Cher?
-I want to help.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.799
That would be wonderful .

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.798
<i>I felt better already.</i>

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.517
-Daddy?
-What?

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.638
You didn't like that red caviar, did you?

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.598
What's she talking about?

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.558
Cher, what are you doing?

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.314
I'm captain
of the Pismo Beach disaster relief.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.152
I don't think they need your skis.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.629
Daddy, some people lost
all their belongings.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.400
Don't you think
that includes athletic equipment?

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.232
This is your influence, Josh?

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.436
Hey, come here, sign up.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.995
It's gonna be really fun .

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.758
And these beans, it's so great.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.353
-Shall I leave the blanket here?
-No.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.397
Could you please bring it to bedding?

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.437
-Sure.
-Yes, thank you very much .

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.752
Miss Geist, I need more boxes,
they're all filled up.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.955
Already? Great!

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.919
I divided them into entrėes
and appetizers.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.356
Okay. I'll have them picked up.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.430
Okay.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.798
-Hey.
-Proper.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.712
This is really decent of you , Travis.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.835
Sure.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.475
I wasn't sure about that.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.996
I don't need it anymore, but far be it
from me to deny anyone else.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.838
I wanted to tell you something .

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.151
-I'm sorry about your shoes.
-What shoes?

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.716
The red ones with the strappy thing .

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.111
Those are so last season .
What even made you think of them?

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.993
It's one of my steps.
See, I joined this club

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.594
and they have all these steps.
There's like...

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.590
Twelve?

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.393
Yeah , 1 2. How'd you know?

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.990
Wild guess.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.671
Wow, that's a good guess. Also, here.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.910
ASL?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.638
Amateur Skateboarding League.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.395
This clarity thing , it's brought me to
a whole new level and my skating is...

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.391
You got to see it.
Would you come Saturday?

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.550
Sure.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.750
Cool .

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.318
Well , I guess, kitchenware?

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.193
That's where I used to keep it.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.510
-H i .
-H i .

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.877
Cher, can I talk to you a minute?

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.594
Sure.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.276
I have been in agony the past week

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.829
and I can't even believe
that I went off the way I did .

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.434
No, I have been going down
a shame spiral .

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.956
I cannot even believe I was so
unsupportive of your feelings for Josh .

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.475
No, you are entitled to your own opinion ,
all right?

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.959
I'm the tard here.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.554
Cher, you've been nothing
but super-duper nice to me.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.233
Not even . If it wasn't for me

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.470
you wouldn't even have liked
that loser, Elton .

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.439
I'm so sorry, Tai .

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.511
Cher, I'm really sorry.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.116
Oh , shit,
now I'm gonna go ahead and cry.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.316
-Let's never fight again , okay?
-Oh , totally.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.075
<i>Next up, Number 14,
Travis Birkenstock.</i>

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.399
There he is, he waved to you .

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.471
All right, Travis !

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.515
I had no idea he was so motivated .

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.591
Oh , I did .

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.559
<i>When I saw the sparks
between Tai and Travis</i>

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.950
<i>I knew Josh was out of the picture.</i>

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.791
You look like Pippi Longstocking .

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.911
You look like Forrest Gump.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.759
Who's Pippi Longstocking?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.832
Someone Mel Gibson never played .

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.115
You're funny.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.631
What happened to the August 28 files?

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.076
What?

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.629
Mel wanted them tonight.
There were twice as many.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.436
He's gonna go ballistic.
Where are they?

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.311
I think I checked them
for the September 3 conversations.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.437
-What?
-Where'd you put them?

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.431
I divided them into two piles.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.590
Is that wrong?

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.752
My God ! I have to redo all that.
What are you , some kind of idiot?

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.114
Hey, she didn't know.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.554
She just set us back a day.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.519
Who cares about the September call?
Now we're screwed .

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:41.995
I'm sorry.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.673
J ust forget it, okay?

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.990
J ust go back to the mall or something .

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.752
What's your problem , man?
She didn't mean any harm .

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.478
I'm gonna get killed ,
'cause she's a moron .

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.755
She's not a moron .

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.434
If you were paying attention ,
it wouldn't have happened .

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.955
If you hadn't been playing footsie
with the dumb kid

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.110
she wouldn't be bothering .

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.679
What the hell are you talking about?

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.478
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:06.791
This is a multi-million dollar lawsuit,
not some excuse for puppy love.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.917
We've been working our butts off
on this case.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.035
I'll tell you what,

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:13.192
you do whatever you want
with your butts. I'm calling in sick.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.870
Did I really ruin Daddy's lawsuit?

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.715
No.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.554
Of course not.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.197
Did I set him back?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.750
There's so much work to be done
and he can't afford to lose that time.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.076
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.238
Your father won't lose any time.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.231
Can you imagine the nerve of that guy?

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.835
I mean , making you worry like that.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.959
He's the one that screwed up,
and then he goes and blames us.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.953
I mean , imagine saying we were...

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.310
you know.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.917
That's right.
You've been very dedicated to this case.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.235
Yeah , it was a good
learning experience, at least for me.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.754
I want to be a lawyer.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.557
But you , I mean ,
you don't need to be doing this.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.193
Go out and have fun . Go shopping .

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.512
You think that's all I do?
I'm just a ditz with a credit card?

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.350
No, that's not what I meant.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.359
It's...

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.435
You're young and beautiful

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.355
and ...

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.115
And?

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.518
And , well , what?

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.273
You think I'm beautiful?

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.110
You know...

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.310
You know you're gorgeous, all right?

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.437
And popular and ...

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.193
But this is not why I , you know,
I come here.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.794
This is a good learning experience
for me.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.429
You already said that.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.870
Mel . I want to help out Mel .

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.989
He's the only one who cares about me.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.999
That's not true.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.989
He's not?

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.115
No.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.832
Are you saying you care about me?

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.955
Josh ...

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.639
<i>Well, you can guess
what happened next.</i>

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.755
Therefore...

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:46.719
<i>As if! I am only 1 6...</i>

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.757
<i>and this is California not Kentucky!</i>

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.393
You may kiss the bride.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.234
I know that when I have
my own wedding ,

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.233
I want this, like,
this whole entire floral motif,

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.197
like very floral garlands...

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.352
No. When I get married ,
I'm gonna have a sailor dress

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.635
but it's gonna be a gown .

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.791
All my bridesmaids are gonna wear
sailor hats.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.279
-That sounds so cool .
-With veils.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.317
My God , they're planning
our weddings already.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.279
Could you all stop all that
"till death do us part" mumbo-jumbo?

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:37.035
-I'm telling you , I'm completely bugging .
-Jeez, I'm bugging myself.

Girls, she's about to throw the bouquet.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.274
We got a pool going
to see whose girl gets the bouquet.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.839
It's up to $200.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.879
It's in the bag .

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.590
All right, come on , girls.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.591
