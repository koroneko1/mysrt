1
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,600
Q, are you awake?

2
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,840
MY SECRET LOVE

3
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,300
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,070
Nothing.

5
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,070
Nothing, brother.

6
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,990
Why don't you take them off?

7
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,240
Do I need to?

8
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,930
Yeah.

9
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,540
Quickly!

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Wait, wait!

11
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,870
What are you doing?

12
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,230
You said I need to take them off?

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Not that.

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,960
I mean, the shoes!

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,640
You'd take the shoes off
when you come into other people's house!

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,930
Do it. Quickly!

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,810
So cute.

18
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,360
Stop watching BL series.

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
And eat quick!

20
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,470
Otherwise, you'd go to school late.

21
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,140
Brother Kim, I can't not watching it.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,450
It's #1 on-trend BL series daily.

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,340
I can't miss the trend!

24
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,200
Aren't you afraid of missing your school bus?

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,860
It's the first day of this semester.
Don't act like you know the way to school like a pro.

26
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,190
Spare some time.

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,190
Before we moved here, I have planned all my routes.

28
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,490
Everything will be perfect. I won't be in school late.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,220
Don't let me find out later that you're late!

30
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,820
Otherwise, I'm gonna phone mum overseas!

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,480
The one who'd be late now is you!

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,110
Look at the time. What time is it now?

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,380
You said you're gonna go early.

34
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,960
Why don't you go already?

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,440
How do I look?

36
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,860
Good. Just go.

37
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,970
If you don't want to clean the dishes, just put them there.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,140
I'll clean them later.

39
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,910
Sure.

40
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,710
Also, don't forget to lock the door.

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,090
Noted.

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,360
Just hurry.

43
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,450
Alright.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,700
Just don't come home too early.

45
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,910
[WHEN EARTH SHAKES AND BRINGS THEM TOGETHER]

46
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,500
Hello. My name is Kimhan Thirathana.

47
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm a sophomore at Faculty of Liberal Arts.

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,510
But people knew me as Kim the student club president.

49
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,650
It is the position I'm mostly proud of.

50
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,210
This is one of the goals that I've planned for.

51
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,210
Someone like me cannot live my life without a plan.

52
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,870
What's up?

53
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,910
What are you doing?

54
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,240
For someone like him,
he's working for the club, of course.

55
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,130
This is just first day and you already work so hard?

56
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,660
I work hard everyday, don't I?

57
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,470
Whoa!

58
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,150
Be serious you guys.
We have Say No SOTUS project to present today.

59
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,990
Are you two ready?

60
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,210
I already did the presentation for you.

61
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,780
I ensure you the chancellor must be very pleased.

62
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,760
Great job, Lee!

63
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,250
Bomb.

64
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,800
Bomb!

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,380
What?

66
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,120
Are you ready?

67
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,230
You watch Thunderous Sky again?

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,290
It's fun.

69
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,140
Don't tell me you also watch it?

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,900
No.

71
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,170
Is it weather forecast channel?

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,120
Kim! How come you didn't know Thunderous Sky channel?

73
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,000
Come here. I'll bring you to hailstone fandom.

74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
Thunderous Sky that I'm about to tell you..

75
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,750
is a channel with good content.

76
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,070
They'd hide camera and prank people creatively.

77
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,160
It's led by Mek, no.1 founder of the channel.

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,090
His charm is at the top that
people don't mind being pranked by him.

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,800
Next is Park.

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,080
An editor whose personality is gentle and quiet.

81
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,410
But his editing skill is the best.

82
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,990
The last one is..

83
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,280
Bare. My bias.

84
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,200
He's playful and friendly.

85
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,350
He always keeps cool but a bit clumsy and very cute.

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,520
So, now you can choose your bias?

87
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,150
Nah. I'll pass.

88
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,580
Me too.

89
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Pranking people is good content?

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,180
What's your good content then?

91
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,630
Like..

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I gotta go.

93
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Who is that?

94
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,510
They scream so loud I thought
they're running away from zombie.

95
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,090
Don't you guys know Brother Tim?

96
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,320
No.

97
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,470
If I have to compare..

98
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,420
The Thunderous Sky channel that Bomb likes

99
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,860
is hell!

100
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,300
And Absolute Tim channel by Brother Tim which..

101
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
gather all the men's grooming content

102
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,960
is heaven.

103
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,190
He's so handsome and so cool.

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
He's also rich and neat.

105
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,870
Why is he so perfect?

106
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,480
You know a lot about him.

107
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,930
So you like someone handsome and cool like him?

108
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,600
Better than your Thunderous Sky channel!

109
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,540
Enough you two.

110
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,170
Pack your things and let's go.

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,680
We might be late for the presentation.

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,140
Bomb, take this.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,500
This is yours?

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Yeah.

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,000
It is so interesting.

116
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,350
I think this job fits perfectly with Tim.

117
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,700
Please send the details to me via e-mail.

118
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,370
And I'll be in touch. Thank you.

119
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,320
We have new job, Tim.

120
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,750
We have a lot of clients lately?

121
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,450
We have some but don't worry.

122
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,910
I can handle it for you.

123
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,740
Wow, you're good, Mr. manager.

124
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,100
You dare saying that.

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
You're the one who forces me to do it.

126
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,660
No one knows me well like you.

127
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,970
Perhaps. Who'd have known you're so clumsy.

128
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,400
Right?

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,660
This year, our student club has a project to propose.

130
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,570
That is..

131
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,150
Say No SOTUS project.

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,630
We must say no to cruel activities for first-year students.

133
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,100
And let people know negative impact of those activities.

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Here are the ideas from me and my team.

135
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,100
Actually, SOTUS is an activity to break the ice..

136
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Brilliant! Very brilliant!

137
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,920
I never thought that your idea and my idea will connect.

138
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,710
A round of applause for Kimhan!

139
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,000
This project is in line with this year's policy.

140
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,240
Let's say this together.

141
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,690
Elevate ideas, conquer young gens, be conscious about technologies!

142
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,050
Say it louder this time.

143
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,110
Elevate ideas, conquer young gens, be conscious about technologies!

144
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,350
Bravo!

145
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,790
Kimhan.

146
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,270
I think if you continue to do great like this,

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,620
your recommendation letter'd be brilliant!

148
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,170
You take that to any big company, you'll receive a warm welcome!

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,530
Another round of applause for Kimhan.

150
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Bravo!!

151
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,690
I knew the chancellor'd like it.

152
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,640
You're worried too much.

153
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,200
You knew he didn't want to fail.

154
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,460
You can say anything now.
I'm in a very good mood.

155
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,880
Alright.

156
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,580
We have class, right? Let's go. We'll be late.

157
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,060
You go first. I have things to do at registration room.

158
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,430
You're a lot of work.

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Just hurry.

160
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,110
Later. Later.

161
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,040
Let's go.

162
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,710
Hello, friends and hailstone fandom.

163
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,350
You're now with Thunderous Sky.

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
I'm sure you're gonna love me like a bang!

165
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,280
We're now in a common classroom to make some great content!

166
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,080
Let's see how it goes!

167
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,150
Park, can you wait here and watch out for us?

168
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,850
Okay.

169
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,910
What's that smell?

170
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,050
So stink!

171
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,320
Everybody! Please calm down!

172
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,640
Who's the one who farted?

173
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
This guy! This guy!

174
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,170
Who did it!?

175
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
So stink!

176
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,600
So cool! The smell was so bad!

177
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,930
I'm still feeling goosebumps.

178
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,750
I think our audiences would love it.

179
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,280
We should gather thousands of views!

180
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,150
I was outside and still smell it.

181
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,720
Should we add more sound effect?

182
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,490
Or should we cut some not-so-good scenes out?

183
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,280
Was it too much?

184
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,390
I think I lost my wallet.

185
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,380
Wallet?

186
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,920
You forgot it in the classroom?

187
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,820
Yeah.

188
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,810
Are you searching for this?

189
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,680
Do I still smell bad?

190
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,560
The smell hits me once you walk in.

191
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,000
I met some guys pranking me like young kids.

192
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,880
If you do BL content, I might watch it.

193
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,175
Are you searching for this?

194
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:25,815
Yes!

195
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:27,295
Thank you so much, brother!

196
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,155
Are you trying to piss me off!?

197
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:34,575
Do you have any problem?

198
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:35,885
You can tell me.

199
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,025
I should ask you what's your problem?

200
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,565
Do you think it's funny pranking people?

201
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,675
Ouch! I was wondering where did bad smell come from?

202
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:45,945
It's coming from you!

203
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,355
Did you realize you're going to be famous?

204
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:55,965
When I edit, I'll make it as funny as I can.

205
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,285
I'll tell professor.

206
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,815
Why are you saying this? You have evidence?

207
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:04,925
Evidence? When you post your clip, we'll see.

208
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,715
Wait, you know my channel?

209
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:13,055
Actually, you are member of the hailstone fandom!

210
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:14,005
Hailstone my ass!

211
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,195
It's the name of their fandom.

212
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:19,875
Being my fan club, you don't have to be shy.

213
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,335
Shy my ass!

214
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:23,805
Your channel name is awful.

215
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,635
And the content you produce is rubbish!

216
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,385
Hey, what did you say, you pale face?

217
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,535
what did you just say!? You..

218
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,725
Come! Come!

219
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,905
Come and I'll tell professor that you invade my privacy.

220
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,635
And also being violent.

221
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:41,985
Enough!

222
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:43,285
Just calm down.

223
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,685
If you want this to end, just apologize to me.

224
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:49,855
And erase the clip too.

225
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,205
I think we haven't done anything that wrong.

226
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:56,275
Instead of an apology, can we do a selfie?

227
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,025
I can give a selfie for you only.

228
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,185
Which phone should we use?

229
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,435
Your phone or my phone?

230
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:03,785
You can use mine.

231
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:04,825
Okay, sure. Let's do it.

232
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:05,745
Perfect!

233
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,945
Come, come! Let's stand close.

234
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:10,915
Get off me!

235
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:13,595
Kim, let's go.

236
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,145
Brother, I apologize.

237
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,154
Mek, Bare, enough already!

238
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,065
Good chance like this comes only once, brother!

239
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:24,395
Mek, Bare! You two please calm down.

240
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,555
Please beware that small thing like this can go big.

241
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,815
But he said our channel is awful!?

242
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:36,065
You're okay with that?

243
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,255
Yeah, Park. Why did you tolerate it?

244
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:41,705
This guy can really tell professor.

245
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,515
I think it's best not to post this clip.

246
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,005
What about our fans? What are they going to watch?

247
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,605
What if he really tells professor?

248
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,025
Can you handle that?

249
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,205
Just erase it.

250
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:58,815
Okay, okay.

251
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:01,555
I won't post it.

252
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:02,145
What?

253
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:04,675
I take it as a farsighted thing to do.

254
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,105
You two shouldn't forget that..

255
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:09,995
We are in our senior year.

256
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,785
If you can compromise on things, just do it.

257
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:13,955
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

258
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,995
You complain like an old dude.

259
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,515
Alright, let's go.

260
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,055
You acted like a child.

261
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,155
I hate all those Thunderous Sky guys!

262
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:38,245
Why did it have to be me who's been pranked?

263
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,275
What did your friends do to my friend?

264
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,715
Are you gonna tell me!?

265
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,885
Ouch, ouch!

266
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,625
I'm sooo sorry.

267
00:16:56,665 --> 00:17:00,515
If I knew he's your friend, I'd stop them.

268
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,705
Usually, he has a lot on his mind.

269
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,535
But you still annoy him.

270
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,615
You know that Mek and Bare

271
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,655
always carelessly prank people.

272
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,385
You pranked Kim, you should beware.

273
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,245
If anything bad happens, I'll say you deserve it!

274
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,545
I'm already tired with work at the club
now I have to be annoyed with you guys.

275
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:28,535
You're tired?

276
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,945
If you're tired, just sit still.

277
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,815
Be relaxed. Be chilled.

278
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:47,105
I'll drive as smooth as the bed in our room.

279
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,115
Enough!

280
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:49,925
Stop pampering me!

281
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,775
Just go back to our place, I'm hungry.

282
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:56,695
Yes, sir.

283
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:02,495
Alright, darling.

284
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,345
Stop! Have you fallen into the toilet?

285
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:17,395
Do I still smell bad?

286
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,055
The smell hit me once you came in.

287
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,485
What did you do to smell this bad?

288
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,675
there was some guy pranking me.

289
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,355
he pranked people like kids that didn't want to grow up.

290
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,675
And he called me pale face too!

291
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,415
Pale face? haha.

292
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,015
Now I want to know who was that person?

293
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,085
If this happens in BL series,

294
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,215
You will meet him again.

295
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,385
After that, you fall for each other.

296
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:41,675
Next step is..

297
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:42,895
Okay, stop!

298
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:44,095
Don't be so imaginative.

299
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:48,435
I'll pray to god not to meet him again!

300
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:50,665
Okay, okay, okay, it's up to you.

301
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,475
But now, just go take a bath and change clothes.

302
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:54,855
I can't stand it anymore.

303
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:01,715
Just hurry!

304
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,085
You think our neighbor is okay?

305
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,235
They screamed so loud.

306
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,395
Since they moved here, this is the first time I heard them.

307
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:26,265
Hey, why don't you watch my channel?

308
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,905
Please help increase more viewership.

309
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,275
No. I don't like it.

310
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,845
Why!? I want to know.

311
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:34,685
It's non-sense. Lots of cliche and boring stuff.

312
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:36,125
You only do the same joke.

313
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,395
One more thing. There's not many thing to watch.

314
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,185
If not for you, brother, who did it, I'd..

315
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,125
Stop!

316
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:45,945
Thank you for telling me.

317
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,455
But this is your own brother.

318
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,045
Ever been interested in doing sort of BL content?

319
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,605
It's very popular.

320
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,335
Lots of people are fan clubs.

321
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,645
Perhaps it might be even better than
those rubbish things you're doing.

322
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,235
I won't do it!

323
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:11,045
No matter what happens, I won't do it!

324
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,345
Bare, Park and I are so committed to this channel.

325
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,235
It becomes part of our lives.

326
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,645
I won't do it just to gain more fame.

327
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,795
Who knows.

328
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:29,585
At first, you liked gardening.

329
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:32,315
You even wanted to study landscape.

330
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:36,205
But now, you study communication arts

331
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:37,885
being content creator.

332
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,115
Anything can happen.

333
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:45,045
You're so genius!

334
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:46,705
Especially with other people's business.

335
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:49,505
Just eat quickly and I'll take garbage out.

336
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:31,735
What if Kimhan disappoint chancellor?

337
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:33,625
If something like that happens..

338
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,355
Do you think what I think, B2?

339
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:38,655
If you want to be part of our faculty, just sit up 100 times. Do it!

340
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,545
Please join Say No SOTUS project with us!

341
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:09,085
Please join together.

342
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,285
Bomb, do you still have a lot?

343
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,155
I don't have much left.

344
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:19,035
People seemed excited and interested in our project.

345
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:21,185
Our student club this year is the best.

346
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,035
Certainly, my friend.

347
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:26,935
Where's Lee?

348
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:29,335
He told me he had things to do.

349
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,265
And I didn't ask him what was it.

350
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,615
After we're done here,

351
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,445
I think I'm gonna go checking on each faculty.

352
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:35,755
You think it's okay?

353
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,415
I think it's good idea. So, we'll know..

354
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,085
if our project works or not.

355
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,825
Okay, I'll do it fast.

356
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,565
Then, I can go eat.

357
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,185
This morning, I woke up so early.

358
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:49,315
But the traffic was so bad.

359
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,955
Why don't you spare some time?

360
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:52,595
You already know traffic is bad.

361
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:54,335
What did you do with your time?

362
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,765
I watched..Thunderous Sky channel.

363
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:58,995
Bomb!

364
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,145
Just take this and please take care of it.

365
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,175
I'll just go.

366
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,135
See you later.

367
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,085
Okay, okay.

368
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:06,865
See you in the evening.

369
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:08,775
I'll find someone else to help.

370
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,055
Sister, could you help?

371
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:13,355
Thank you.

372
00:23:16,705 --> 00:23:18,515
Please join Say No SOTUS project with us!

373
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,015
Please join Say No SOTUS project.

374
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,515
Here. Please join our Say No SOTUS project.

375
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:28,435
Please join our Say No SOTUS project.

376
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:29,395
What is this?

377
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:33,665
It's a project we campaign against cruel activities with first-year students.

378
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:36,725
The project is called Say No SOTUS.

379
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:38,965
This project is cool.

380
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,125
Who came up with it?

381
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,555
It's Kimhan's idea. He's this year's student club president.

382
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:43,835
That one!

383
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:48,935
That guy is student club president?

384
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:52,085
Yes. He's the chancellor's favorite too.

385
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:53,375
Well..

386
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,165
What if Kimhan disappoints chancellor?

387
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:59,225
No way! Kimhan is always cautious.

388
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,545
But if something like that happens..

389
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:03,605
I just don't want to say it.

390
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,995
Chancellor's reputation is at stake too.

391
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:10,005
I'll just go. Don't forget to have a look on Say No SOTUS project.

392
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,615
Do you think what I think, B2?

393
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,045
I think the same, B1!

394
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,285
What are you guys thinking?

395
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,655
It's gonna hurt, you fart bag.

396
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,565
Hahaha.

397
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:34,085
Faculty of Engineering, no.

398
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,735
Faculty of Education, no.

399
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,515
Faculty of Arts, okay.

400
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,235
There's Comm Arts left?

401
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:45,375
Okay, let's go.

402
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,415
Thunderous Sky invites all hailstones to watch live!

403
00:24:57,635 --> 00:25:00,135
And let's make fun content exclusively.

404
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:03,215
Meet at Comm Arts building at 2pm. See you!

405
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,405
Student club work can be done later.

406
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:08,035
Thunderous Sky first!

407
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,055
Hello, everybody!

408
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,885
I invite you all today to join and create content together.

409
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:25,585
It's a great moment we will have.

410
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,395
And now, we will have hidden camera.

411
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:31,695
Every word coming out of my mouth, you need to follow.

412
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:32,665
Understood?

413
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:33,475
Yes!

414
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:34,765
Understood!?

415
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:36,155
Yes! Yes!

416
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,865
If you're ready, and..action!

417
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:54,375
Get up. Stand up! Quick!

418
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:56,815
Stand in line! In line!

419
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:58,935
In line!

420
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,075
You want to be a part of the faculty?

421
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,475
Yes, we want!

422
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,125
You want to be a part of the faculty?

423
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:09,025
If you want it, just squat up 100 times. Do it!

424
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:10,294
Do it fast!

425
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:10,994
Squat and up!

426
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,535
One, two, three.

427
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:15,865
Can you go on!?

428
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:17,835
Do it fast!

429
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:23,045
Fifty one. Fifty two. Fifty three. Fifty four.

430
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:29,055
Fifty five. Fifty six. Fifty seven. Fifty eight.

431
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:37,745
Are you still okay?

432
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,155
Oh crap!

433
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:53,015
My life as a fan is complete!

434
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,585
I'm able to make video with Brother Bare.

435
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:57,915
Even squat up 1,000 times, I can do it!

436
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,455
Let's do it together, brother!

437
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,815
A friend is fainted! Just go help him!

438
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:22,275
Stop!

439
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:23,675
This is....

440
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:28,215
a fake first-year activity from Thunderous Sky!

441
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,665
Thank you everyone for joining the fun.

442
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:42,975
Brother, can I take a selfie with you? / Sure!

443
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:45,455
You want this angle?

444
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:47,405
Thank you so much!

445
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:49,515
Me too! / Sure.

446
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:53,175
Thank you so much!

447
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,455
See you later, everybody.

448
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:01,095
No matter how cruel, I obey and let you prank me!

449
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,215
Bye, bye.

450
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,165
Brother, wake up!

451
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:07,495
Everyone goes out already.

452
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,525
Wow, the hailstones are so strong!

453
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:15,605
Brother, just wake up now.

454
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:16,685
Brother!

455
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:19,875
My viewership'd increase because you act so good like this!

456
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:21,685
Brother, wake up.

457
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:22,945
You expect to be nominated for an Oscar?

458
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,625
You two hired someone to be fainted here?

459
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:26,945
Is this too real?

460
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:28,435
I didn't hire anybody!

461
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:29,695
Bare, did you?

462
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,075
A joke like this is yours, right?

463
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:33,175
No, I didn't do it.

464
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:35,265
You said you're going to manage.

465
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:41,025
Brother. Brother. Brother.

466
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:45,185
Brother. Brother.

467
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:48,445
This is bad, you guys!

468
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:49,975
He's fainted for real!

469
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:52,565
Crap!

470
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:54,595
Brother. Brother. Wake up!

471
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:55,905
Brother. Brother.

472
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:58,735
Let's check up on him.

473
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:01,935
Here. Let's drink first.

474
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:03,205
You're feeling better now, right?

475
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:04,735
You want me to call your friend?

476
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,285
Why do you know his friend?

477
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:10,635
Yeah.

478
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,725
I just wanted to help. That's all.

479
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:19,805
You couldn't do it. Why didn't you tell us?

480
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:22,265
You didn't have to do it for us like that.

481
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:28,045
Yeah. I know your love for us is huge!

482
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:30,845
But you have to take care of yourself too.

483
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:31,715
Alright?

484
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:36,935
I don't have anything to give unless..

485
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,665
This! An inhalant.

486
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:56,895
Just take it and inhale into your lung!

487
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,915
Freshen yourself up.

488
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:01,945
This is not the time.

489
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,625
He's not in good condition.

490
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,235
I'm totally fine.

491
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,225
I'm okay now.

492
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:11,955
I haven't had breakfast this morning.

493
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:14,215
That's why I was fainted.

494
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,765
We're sorry.

495
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:19,325
Next time I'll invite you to do a video with us again.

496
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:20,285
Yes.

497
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:21,985
How about we go eat something together?

498
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,684
I'll pay!

499
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,485
Yes, I'd love to!

500
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:28,735
Just a moment.

501
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,304
Bomb, what happened?

502
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:34,725
Why don't you go to work?

503
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:36,515
A senior at work can't contact you.

504
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:41,825
Brother, I can't go with you.

505
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,215
Let's do it next time.

506
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:45,395
I have to go.

507
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:51,025
Hey, wait!

508
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,265
He looked familiar though.

509
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:04,775
My name is Dao.

510
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:05,765
I live next door.

511
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,515
Why did this incident happen, Kimhan?

512
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,375
How could you make Say No SOTUS project work?

513
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:43,331
At first, I thought it's going to die.

514
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:44,981
Suddenly, it's in full bloom.

515
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,711
And it looks young and new.

516
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,581
Hi! My name is Dao. I live next door.

517
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,991
My name is Q.

518
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:57,711
Nice to meet you, Q.

519
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,981
So glad to have people same age live next to each other.

520
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:02,661
I'd be a little less lonely.

521
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:05,401
If there's anything I can help, please tell me.

522
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,341
Yes. Thank you.

523
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:08,301
Okay. I gotta go. Bye.

524
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,391
Hey, wait!

525
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,811
I have a question.

526
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,421
Hey, guys. You wait here long?

527
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,201
Where did you go yesterday?

528
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,161
I didn't go anywhere.

529
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:34,051
I was checking the work in several faculties.

530
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:35,701
Then, I was off to work.

531
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:38,481
Also, my phone's battery was empty,

532
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:39,911
so I could't contact anyone.

533
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:40,931
What happened?

534
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:45,811
Bomb went off to other faculties and just gone.

535
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,891
And a senior at work called me.

536
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:49,761
You don't have to be serious with him.

537
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,041
He's just lazy!

538
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,461
What do you guys think I am?

539
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:55,711
A lazy ass, of course!

540
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,331
It's okay. You must be tired.

541
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:05,001
You can be lazy but don't waste your time
watching Thunderous Sky channel.

542
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:09,681
Water?

543
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:12,211
Are you okay now?

544
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,041
I'm okay.

545
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:17,401
How's the project?

546
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:19,091
We did great.

547
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,571
It's surely better than the chancellor has expected!

548
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:24,561
Chancellor just texted me.

549
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:26,711
Be prepared for her compliment.

550
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:28,841
I think this year, our student club..

551
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:32,881
will be remembered as the best student club in many years.

552
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:33,991
Let's see.

553
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,141
Are you brother Bare?

554
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:42,521
I'm actually your fan club. Can I have your autograph?

555
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,611
You guys! Do they really want my autograph?

556
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:49,821
Unbelievable!

557
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,591
Sign your autograph for them first.

558
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:11,731
So cute.

559
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:16,851
Guys!

560
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:19,591
The viewership for this clip..

561
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:20,671
already reaches hundreds of thousands.

562
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:25,621
No surprise we gather a lot of hailstone members.

563
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,761
But I was wondering..

564
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,141
If the student club would react to this.

565
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:34,361
This means the university becomes more famous because of us?

566
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,011
Yes, of course!

567
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:39,541
The chancellor doesn't need the student club
to gain good reputation for the university.

568
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:44,591
Announcement: Mr. Meka, Mr. Komkrit and Mr. Atikorn.

569
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:46,881
Senior students from Faculty of Communication Arts.

570
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:51,321
Please urgently join a meeting with the chancellor
at the student club's meeting room.

571
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:55,091
I think..they want to give us compliment!

572
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:56,601
Or..

573
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:59,571
Are we going to become university presenters?

574
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:01,901
I'm gonna ask my mom money for botox.
Where should I inject?

575
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:04,941
Let me see. Here and there and there.

576
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,271
I'll go with you, my friend.

577
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:08,561
You're trouble again!

578
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:29,121
Hello. I'm Sao Kanchiang. And this is Fame Hunger!

579
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:34,711
This program will recap all drama stories
of fame hungers out there.

580
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,831
If you want fame, I can give it to you!

581
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,520
And what we will talk about today is..

582
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,871
The story happening in a famed university.

583
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,601
Owner of Thunderous Sky channel just wanted more fame.

584
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,401
They decided to conduct a fake first-year activity.

585
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:54,611
But it caused real drama. There's a student being fainted for real.

586
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,241
What do you guys think?

587
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,751
Let's see some comments from social media.

588
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:03,571
It's 2022 now and you still did something like this?
Are you nuts!?

589
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,651
Since you're handsome, I don't mind being pranked!

590
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:13,341
The university should take some action.
You shouldn't let this happen.

591
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:18,301
We must wait and see if the university'd take any action

592
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:20,831
on such terrifying incident like this.

593
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,241
But if the university takes no action,

594
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:26,231
I can tell you right now that the university'd be damned!

595
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:29,101
We're damned! Damned! Damned!

596
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,751
Why did this incident happen, Kimhan?

597
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:35,551
And how could you make Say No SOTUS project work?

598
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,681
I have a bad feeling about this.

599
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,781
You too! You're nearly done with your senior year.

600
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,031
Why are you still pranking people like kids?

601
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:46,641
Don't you see..

602
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:49,321
how people on social media talk about us?

603
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,391
But they said we're very funny.

604
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:59,351
They also said we're handsome.

605
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,511
Yes, yes!

606
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,061
I know..that you are handsome.

607
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:06,031
But what you did..

608
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:09,201
Not only harmful to his heart.

609
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:10,581
It can possibly threaten his life!

610
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:12,551
Have you any idea about that?

611
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,681
If he's not just fainted.

612
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:18,511
If there's something more, who would be responsible for it?

613
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:21,611
Can you all handle that?

614
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,631
It's already 2022.

615
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:29,781
Why are you still using violence!?

616
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:31,091
Why!?

617
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,201
They deserve a punishment, right?

618
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:38,771
Suspended

619
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:41,141
or expelled.

620
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,351
Your bad mouth should be slapped!

621
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,211
Thunderous Sky go!

622
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,891
Stop!

623
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:13,821
Seeing this, I feel extremely hurtful.

624
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:20,201
So is it going to work, your Say No SOTUS project?

625
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,301
Since you all continue to fight like this.

626
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,711
I have consulted with the committee.

627
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:34,691
You three will be suspended!

628
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:37,831
But don't worry.

629
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:39,751
I also find you a solution.

630
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:44,051
In a way that modern chancellor would do!

631
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,501
Since you are content creator,

632
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:58,331
You must do a music video for Say No SOTUS

633
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:01,021
to publish on university channel.

634
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,641
We don't get suspended now!

635
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,011
It's so easy! You don't have to worry.

636
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,961
We're experts in what we do.

637
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:14,571
But this project is Kimhan's.

638
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,141
Kimhan and friends,

639
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:19,311
you must help Thunderous Sky team create this MV.

640
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,681
What!?

641
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,191
Why not?

642
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:26,221
It's for the sake of unity between you all.

643
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,571
This is the only way out

644
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,871
if you want to graduate.

645
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:38,831
And if you still want to be student club president.

646
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,631
I know this might not be a good time to say this but..

647
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,171
I want to say it anyway.

648
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,101
Because it sounds so grand!

649
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:55,571
Allez Cuisine!!

650
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:57,401
Let's get started!

651
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:10,001
Urghhhhhh!

652
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:11,981
What's wrong!? You gave me a fright!

653
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:16,991
What's wrong? What happened to you?

654
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,771
You looked so upset the past two days.

655
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:27,671
It's about the university project.

656
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,301
It seemed great at first.

657
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,641
And then there's this annoying guy messing it up.

658
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:33,541
Just calm down, brother.

659
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,201
I'm sure everything will turn out great in the end.

660
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:40,131
But now, you need to be back in the good mood, okay?

661
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:43,831
How about..you cook some food?

662
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:45,271
Perhaps it calms you down.

663
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,251
I'm actually hungry too.

664
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:49,351
Hungry

665
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:52,631
What do you want to eat?

666
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:57,161
Truly, whatever you cook, I can eat.

667
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:58,471
Because it's all delicious!

668
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,461
Have you done something wrong?

669
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,391
Nothing at all! Just cook.

670
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,401
You have something suspicious.

671
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,101
I just wanted you to be in a good mood.

672
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:07,981
Hurry!

673
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,941
Just talk slowly. Chewing first.

674
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:43,531
Brother Kim, you're the best.

675
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:46,701
Now I feel better.

676
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,851
Oh, the plant that looks like dying in front of the house.

677
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:52,341
Now it's in full bloom.

678
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:55,831
From what I remember, it really looks like it's about to die?

679
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:57,261
Yeah. And I was surprised too.

680
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:59,471
So I asked and found out that a guy next door

681
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,901
has been taking care of it until it blooms.

682
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,471
What fertilizer did he use?

683
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:16,911
I don't know but it's interesting to know.

684
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:18,111
I'll ask again.

685
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:21,041
Perhaps I'll bring some food

686
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,021
to say thank you to him.

687
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,521
Since he's taking care of our plants.

688
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,531
It's done now!

689
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,931
Dao Salon guaranteed!

690
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:34,531
Can I trust this?

691
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,731
How long should I do this?

692
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,361
Two days perhaps. Since your face is too thick.

693
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:44,111
Why does everyone being sharp-tongued today?

694
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:45,761
Who taught you to say such a thing?

695
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:46,961
Someone nearby obviously.

696
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,261
Why aren't you born first and be my big sister then!?

697
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:55,311
I heard that!

698
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,491
Mek, can you open the door?

699
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:09,021
Who'd come at this hour?

700
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:14,751
Brother, thank you for taking care of my plants.

701
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:17,991
I want to share my food with you.

702
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:40,961
You fart bag!

703
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:42,301
What the heck!?

704
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:47,711
I'll go first. / I came here first!

705
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:49,111
Are we going to survive all this?

706
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:51,511
One, two and three!

707
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,431
You don't have to be in the center.

708
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,471
If you perform well, you'll have a lot of air time.

709
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,491
I actually don't want to help that much.

710
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:01,121
But I'm afraid you might not get better
on time for the MV production.

711
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,221
And I'd be screwed too!

712
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:03,281
Just rehearse well.

713
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:05,561
Because as you stand still, it already look funny!

714
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:08,261
When this is all done, I hope not to see you again!

715
00:44:08,511 --> 00:44:10,231
I also don't want to work with someone like you!

716
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:13,391
Do you realize what you have done?
