1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,640
Bravo! You look great out there!

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Sexy!

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
I don't know
what came over me or what I was thinking.

4
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.

5
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,759
Please come and hear me out.

6
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
-I never got that message.
-It looks like it was sent to me.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,200
I never got that message, I'm telling you!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
'Cause it's not the same at all.

9
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,280
Why isn't it the same thing? Go on.

10
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,599
-Why?
-Because it was only sex for you.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,400
So now you're hooked on him?
That's the deal?

12
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,439
No fuckin' way.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,359
No fuckin' way, Omar.
Are you fuckin' kidding me right now?

14
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,239
Look, Ander… No. I… I mean-- No, no.

15
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,560
This can't be.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,079
Please, man.
I'm fucking confused as hell. Ander!

17
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,599
-Let's go to the lake and talk, please.
-To talk about what?

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,319
What's there to talk about?

19
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,080
Rebeka's sleeping,
so go the fuck back home, okay?

20
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,800
-What are you doing? What's up? Hi.
-Hi.

21
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,280
Please move.

22
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,479
Believe me. I had no idea
what I was getting myself into.

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,000
You did it enough times.
You'd think you'd figured it out.

24
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,639
Rebe, I can't change something
that's already happened.

25
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,280
You know I desperately wish I could,
but that's not an option.

26
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,280
I can change my behavior from now on.

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,919
You serious right now?

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,960
Do you really think
I'd fall for that shit, huh?

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,759
When I got home,
I made up an excuse

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
they never even asked for

31
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,719
because you and I both know
they didn't care what I'd been doing.

32
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,039
They were just relieved to see you.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,240
Well, yes.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,159
And I liked feeling… that sense of relief

35
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,080
because it's the same relief I felt
in that hotel room when you hugged me,

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,639
even after everything you saw.

37
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,479
No, wait up.

38
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,240
Come here.

39
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,240
Don't ever do that to me again.

40
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
Have you seen Ari?

41
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,279
She told me
she would meet me here.

42
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,600
I would start
with a more personal approach,

43
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,319
then I'd go to the data.

44
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,199
Because data is boring.

45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,000
It's really our emotions
that transcends it all.

46
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,319
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

47
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
How was your weekend?

48
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
-Uh, good. It was pretty nice out.
-Yeah.

49
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,279
How's Mencía? Did she open up?

50
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,600
-No. With her, it's best not to talk.
-Right.

51
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,560
Okay.

52
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,160
-All right, show me what you got.
-Okay.

53
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,439
No, no. Stay right there.
You're fine where you are.

54
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,560
I can go first if you want.
I'm really eager to.

55
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,319
Very well.

56
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,319
Prisoner reentry is just a utopian ideal.
Experience has proven it.

57
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,560
It all depends on the prisoner's will
and choices, not on institutions.

58
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,279
I'd like to point out, we are the country
with the biggest percentage of prisoners--

59
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,759
-Not the most crime. They're not related.
-Whoa. This isn't casual barroom banter.

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,279
Wait your turn to respond,
and please don't raise your voice again.

61
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,720
We're the highest in all of Europe.

62
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,240
A hundred and twenty-six prisoners
for every 100,000 citizens.

63
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,000
And that, Samuel, is a fact.

64
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,439
A hundred twenty-six prisoners

65
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,079
with 126 families,
friends, and loved ones.

66
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,720
Prisoners have people close to them.
You've thought about that?

67
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,600
Of course I thought about it,
but that's not what we're talking about--

68
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,439
We are. It's not the kind of thing
you can just gloss over.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
What's your focus? People or numbers?
What?

70
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,879
Numbers, so you can distance yourself
and dehumanize them.

71
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,560
I mean, imagining myself,
Samuel García, being dragged into jail.

72
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,000
Looking at a bunch of years ahead of me.

73
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,600
And imagining every Samuel García in jail.

74
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,879
My family and friends
might be able to help me,

75
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,279
but the system won't let them.

76
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Because after a stint,
all you'll ever be seen as is a felon.

77
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
And that's what happens
when you reduce people to labels.

78
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,040
You erase their humanity
in a single stroke.

79
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,000
Same with numbers.

80
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,560
On that note, uh, I'm done.
Thanks for listening.

81
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, we need to refine it a bit.

82
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,399
But keep up the good work.

83
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,560
What on earth did you do all weekend?

84
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,079
It's best
that Samuel thinks he can beat me.

85
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, I'm pretty sure
we just saw that he can.

86
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,120
And if that happened, well,

87
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,040
I would be extremely disappointed,
to say the very least.

88
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,440
You! Where were you Friday afternoon?

89
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,200
-Excuse me?
-Mm…

90
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,879
I said,
"Where were you Friday afternoon?"

91
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Wow. Envy really isn't a good look on you,
Ivanka.

92
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,440
Isn't it enough for you to be fought over
by two guys already?

93
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,840
-I was with her.
-From what time to what time?

94
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,840
I don't know off the top of my head.

95
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,759
Um, yeah. Why the inquisition?

96
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,960
My sister had bruises on her body.

97
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
-"What time period?" I asked you.
-I have no idea.

98
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,600
He just told you we were together.

99
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,240
Well, just in case, don't go near Mencía.

100
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Are we clear? Not at all.

101
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,440
No idea. Who knows what that was.

102
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,039
PHILLIPE VON TRIESENBERG ABUSE

103
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,120
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR YOUR SEARCH

104
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,200
Ari,
you shouldn't make false accusations.

105
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,799
I have my reasons.

106
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,639
Oh, well, if you're so sure he did that
to her, why don't you report him, then?

107
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,559
That's precisely why, Cayetana.
'Cause I don't have real evidence yet.

108
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,480
And I don't normally report people
without it.

109
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,720
-That's the kind of girl I am.
-Hmm.

110
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,960
Well, the girl
from his country didn't have evidence,

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,679
so I guess the both of you
must be the same kind of girls.

112
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,799
Honey.

113
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,120
Look, I totally get
that you're really into Phillipe and all,

114
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,039
and I never for a moment
said he doesn't like you back.

115
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,120
The thing is, it's not the same.

116
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Because you always expected a no
from a guy like that,

117
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,320
while he expected a yes.

118
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,840
People like Phillipe
don't understand the concept of no.

119
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm sticking my nose
in someone else's business,

120
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,120
but if I were you,
I wouldn't wait to have proof with him.

121
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,080
Maybe once you have proof,
it'll be too late.

122
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,039
If there's one thing
you and I have in common,

123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
it's that we're both women, honey.

124
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,519
And if women don't lend each other a hand,
who will?

125
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
I understand
that, right now, you're mad at me.

126
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
I just wanted to say
I'm here for you if you need it,

127
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,039
if you want.

128
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,919
Nobody forced anyone.

129
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,600
You don't need my forgiveness.

130
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah, but I'm just--

131
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,279
I'm sorry about what I said
and how I told you,

132
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,639
so forgive me for that.

133
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
Okay.

134
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,240
If you need me to forgive you
for something, then sure, I forgive you.

135
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,879
Cool.

136
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,440
Uh, thanks.

137
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,720
Ander…

138
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,159
just a reminder, you spent a whole year
tied to a machine, doing chemo.

139
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,000
No one should make you feel
like you have to beg or feel guilty

140
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,799
or ask permission.

141
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,559
OMAR, I NEED TO SEE YOU.

142
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,000
What's the matter now?

143
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,440
Without you,
I wouldn't have survived cancer.

144
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,600
What you did was incredible, and, um…

145
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,080
I won't ever forget it, but…

146
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,799
No, don't say it.

147
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,240
Omar…

148
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,039
maybe the cancer took its toll on us.

149
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
Please, no.

150
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,559
Not on me, no.

151
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,919
I mean, okay, yes,

152
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,799
I've been in a fucking mental fog,
but I'm not anymore.

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,320
When I thought about losing you, I--
Listen, uh…

154
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
I only love you, Ander.

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Listen, though.

156
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm not talkin' about Patrick now.

157
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm… talking about me.
I thought I'd die, but here I am somehow.

158
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
I mean, I just wanna live.

159
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,600
There's a ton of things
I still have to do. A ton.

160
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
But… you can do them with me.

161
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,440
It's me, dude.

162
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,320
It's Omar.

163
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,679
It's me.

164
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,440
-I know. I know.
-Omar.

165
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,200
And you have to keep being Omar.

166
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,960
But that's why I'm thinking
it's best we end this here

167
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,440
because I don't want this
to become something else entirely.

168
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,639
Thank you.

169
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Thank you, Omar.
From the bottom of my heart.

170
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,240
And I'm sorry too. I really am.

171
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,480
I was thinkin'
of taking you out to dinner tonight,

172
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,720
so you can clear your head a bit.

173
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,600
You sidetracked me last weekend already.

174
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,639
Rather be at the library
with him on Saturday?

175
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,679
Come to dinner at my place.

176
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,200
We can hang out together a while.

177
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,679
With your dad?

178
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,039
Not what I had in mind, to be honest.

179
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah, but after that,
everything goes smoothly.

180
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,000
Hmm.

181
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Ari, García's gonna be coming over.

182
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,000
That way,
I can go over both of your arguments.

183
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
-How's it goin'?
-All good, thanks.

184
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm goin' to your place for dinner.

185
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,279
SHARE MY LOCATION

186
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
DID YOU BLOCK ME?

187
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,559
What's the matter?

188
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Armando.

189
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,880
Wait, what?

190
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,680
What the fuck does that asshole want?
We're calling the police now.

191
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,759
Hey, hold up.
Want my family knowing about it?

192
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,359
Oh, so you care about your family now?

193
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,039
I mean, yeah,
my family and the entire school

194
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,519
and kinda the whole world.

195
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,920
Just relax, okay?

196
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's all good.

197
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,200
I can handle this guy.

198
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,880
Do you know that, until the age of three,
all I ate was chocolate?

199
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,279
Oh really?

200
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,640
Psst, hey!

201
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,160
Some dumbass guy sure as hell
isn't gonna spoil our…

202
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,039
…chocolate party.

203
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,160
No, Mencía, I said--

204
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,440
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
You know I just can't help myself.

205
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,680
Mencía.

206
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
-Thanks.
-Samuel?

207
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
No, I don't want any, thanks.
Gotta stay sharp for tomorrow's debate.

208
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,319
Hmm.

209
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,400
The winner's going
to the European debate competition,

210
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,359
where they'll have to present
but have to do it in French, right?

211
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
Hmm. Well, yes.

212
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
What would you do?

213
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,079
Don't you speak French?

214
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,279
I have a decent grasp of it.

215
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,880
Yeah, for a local yokel, maybe.

216
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,319
What?

217
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,880
But don't worry.

218
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Because since Ari's gonna win,
that won't be a problem, right?

219
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,839
You know, you should thank him, Samuel.

220
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,680
Why?

221
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Because people like us rise
to the challenge when we're questioned.

222
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
I'm sorry. People like you?

223
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, people who studied on scholarship.

224
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,839
Ah, right.

225
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
And haven't been as fortunate
as the three of you here.

226
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm the one who's competing with Samuel,
Guzmán, not you.

227
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,440
-Me?
-Yeah.

228
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,759
I wasn't. I'm not worried.

229
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,799
I don't see you spending Christmas
with his family

230
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,359
in some shithole in Morocco.

231
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,759
-What?
-Yeah.

232
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,279
His brother ran off there.
His mom went as well.

233
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,720
I was told he'd been exonerated, though.

234
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,279
More like he didn't wait
to get the verdict.

235
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,359
So you're saying his brother
fled the country while on probation?

236
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,759
Just so you know
the gem of a brother-in-law you'd have.

237
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,559
See you tomorrow.

238
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,799
Mencía!

239
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,400
-What are you doing here?
-I'm trying to have a conversation.

240
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,400
-You're following me.
-I saw your Instagram.

241
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Mencía, please.

242
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,599
I just wanted to apologize.

243
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,440
What for?

244
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,279
I found out what happened… and I'm sorry.

245
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,920
Son of a bitch is done.

246
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,359
He can forget about his career
and basically everything.

247
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Can I drive you home?

248
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,039
I gave it up.

249
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,000
Maybe you should get a new cell phone.

250
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,279
-Why?
-Doesn't that guy have your number?

251
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, but I mean, I blocked him, so…

252
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,079
Yeah, but he might give it
to someone else, harass you, whatever.

253
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,200
Right. I hadn't thought of that.

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Well, thanks.

255
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,039
Where are we?

256
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,440
It'd be nice for us to have a drink
before heading home.

257
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,720
No, uh, I don't think my girlfriend
would think that's a very good idea.

258
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,079
I'm sorry.

259
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,319
All right, but at least
let me take you home-- Mencía.

260
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,079
Mencía, please.

261
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,200
Mencía.

262
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,799
I'll take you home. I will.

263
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,400
Hey.

264
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,519
I'm here to get all my stuff.

265
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,400
Right. Yeah, Omar let me know.

266
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,119
Do you want me to help you out?

267
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,000
No, I can do it alone.

268
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,720
Okay.

269
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Wanna check to see
if everything's there? Nothing's missing?

270
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,079
You okay?

271
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,599
It's just that…
No, no, this can't be real.

272
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,559
I mean, okay,
yeah, it's true I had doubts about it,

273
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,799
but I don't anymore.
I know what I want now.

274
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,720
I can't believe this hurts so much.

275
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,799
And if it hurts this much,
it's because I really love him, isn't it?

276
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,119
This is the worst part.

277
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,279
I can't breathe.

278
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,559
You think that knot
in your stomach will never go away.

279
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,920
But one day,
the knot starts to loosen up,

280
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,559
and it hurts less and less…
until you suddenly realize that…

281
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,880
…you haven't thought about him all day.

282
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,359
You can't even remember
why it once hurt so much.

283
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,319
But there's no way I can forget him.

284
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,400
I can't, and I don't want to.

285
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
Shit, I mean, it's Ander.

286
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,039
It's Ander.

287
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Oh yeah. He came looking for me.

288
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
Why the fuck did you tell me you quit
and then lie to me?

289
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,759
-He came to apologize to me.
-Yeah.

290
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,519
Look, this video shows your mother's POV.

291
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,400
But what do you see?

292
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,400
'Cause it seems like you only see
what you wanna see.

293
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,759
Haven't you asked yourself
why your mother knows this guy?

294
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,359
Why he might've been
at the door of her place? No.

295
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Because all you see is I'm lying to you.

296
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
What the fuck are you tryin' to say
about my mother?

297
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,920
Your mother saw us together
for the first time

298
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,960
when the two of us went to her spot.

299
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,519
We went there to have a drink and, um…

300
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,839
also, so your mom could…
sell him some coke.

301
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,960
No.
No, no way. That's impossible.

302
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,839
-My mother quit that for me.
-No, Rebe. I quit that shit for you.

303
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,839
I quit for you,
and you still trust your mother,

304
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,279
who, ironically,
is the only one here who's lying.

305
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,559
Patrick.

306
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah?

307
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,799
Uh…

308
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,839
why don't we skip classes today
and go out somewhere?

309
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,000
How come?

310
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,319
Don't know. I wanna treat myself.

311
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,960
Plus, they're having
that freakin' debate thing.

312
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,480
They won't notice we're gone.

313
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,200
Okay.
What sort of plan do you have in mind?

314
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:09,079
Hmm.

315
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
Was hoping you'd come up with it.

316
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
-Mencía, have you seen Ander?
-Sorry.

317
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
-Have you seen Rebe?
-No.

318
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
FYI, I'm ditching class.

319
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm throwing a thing at the house,
so cover for me. Pretty please?

320
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,519
Fine. I'll text when the debate's over.

321
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,480
Listen, don't trash the house, all right?
Don't wanna invoke the wrath of Benjamín.

322
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,720
Okay, love you.

323
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,359
DEBATE DAYS

324
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,079
Hey.

325
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,559
The dress code is topless.

326
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,799
That's the spirit.

327
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,759
Hey, what's goin' on?

328
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,839
Yeah, good stuff.

329
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey. Where's the bathroom?

330
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,640
Well said, Samuel. Thank you.

331
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,799
Ariadna, when you're ready.

332
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,240
Thank you kindly.

333
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:45,359
Reentry depends
on the prisoner's willpower,

334
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,599
not on institutions.

335
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,119
Some may say, after jail,
they have been conditioned

336
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,680
to relapse into criminal behavior.

337
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,480
But maybe change isn't what they want,
or change isn't possible.

338
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,119
Recidivism rates speak for themselves,
not to mention concrete examples.

339
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,559
On this matter, I'm sure my opponent
is intimately familiar

340
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,639
with the case of a man accused of murder
only two years ago.

341
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,360
And the accused
spent several long weeks in jail,

342
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,519
then decided to flee while on probation,

343
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,559
thus breaking the law
and adding to his previous offenses.

344
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,559
My opponent is familiar with this case…

345
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,800
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

346
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,559
…because that man is his brother.

347
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,400
-Why did she say that?
-Why'd you use that?

348
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
It's best to put a name to the data.
Simple as that.

349
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,199
Mentioning my brother
is completely inappropriate.

350
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
His case is well known
to everyone at the school.

351
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,440
I don't think
I'm revealing any state secrets here.

352
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,559
I'm sorry, Samuel,
but I think Ariadna's right.

353
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,079
Samuel's brother--

354
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,559
-Samuel. Samuel!
-He'll come back.

355
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,199
-What's with the childish tantrum?
-Maybe we're not that similar.

356
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,960
-I'm over being questioned every day!
-This is how you live your life?

357
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,199
You wallow in misfortune
and use it as an excuse

358
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,199
to stay stuck in the exact same place.

359
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,599
Don't give me another Jedi master speech,
'cause I'm over it.

360
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,639
No, you wanna hear from the Jedi master?
You're gonna love this one.

361
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,519
Know why I have so much respect
for the art of debate?

362
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,519
Because like all other arts,
it represents life itself.

363
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,760
And you can load up on arguments
and reasons.

364
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,960
You can…

365
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,800
…prepare to the point of exhaustion.

366
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,000
You can feel superior and indestructible.

367
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,199
But without fail,

368
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,800
something unexpected comes up
without warning

369
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
and can shatter your protective armor.

370
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,519
Without fail.

371
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,639
And that…
is when you discover how weak you are.

372
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,880
When you realize everything
you thought about yourself,

373
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,039
that everything you had prepared…

374
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,119
is absolutely useless.

375
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,159
-I was looking for you.
-Oh, hi.

376
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,480
Uh, wanna come sleep over
at my place tonight?

377
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,480
Um…

378
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,519
Sure. Yeah, okay.

379
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,159
So you can… either run away,
playing the victim

380
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,960
and hiding behind a series of excuses
that aren't even yours,

381
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,079
like that thing with your brother…
or you can choose to rise up

382
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,400
and fight to bring out
what you would like to become.

383
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,760
Let me know what you decide.

384
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,639
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

385
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,840
And then poor Samuel just walks out,
right in the middle of the debate.

386
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,719
Ari didn't know what to do.

387
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,599
-She was stunned.
-Hmm.

388
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,559
Um, any chance you're hungry?

389
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,199
-Yeah, a little, yeah.
-Yeah?

390
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,559
I'll see if they can make something.
We can have it here.

391
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,840
-Okay? Okay.
-Okay.

392
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,079
Oh, I have to grab my cell pho--

393
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,880
What are you doing?

394
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,599
Nothing.
I just wanted to put on some music.

395
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,719
I thought we would trust each other.

396
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,639
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm so sorry. I don't know.

397
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,960
Ari's been doing a number on me all day,
and I just…

398
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,679
Yeah, but Ari has no idea
where I was on Friday.

399
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
-I know.
-You do 'cause I was with you.

400
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,559
-Wasn't I? Don't you get it?
-It's just… Please, I'm sorry.

401
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,440
You have so little self-esteem

402
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,360
that you can't understand
how someone like me would be with you.

403
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,119
And you look for any excuse
to ruin a good thing… all the time.

404
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,320
Will you always remind me of my station?

405
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,119
Looking for flaws
under some kind of microscope.

406
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,800
Closer and closer each time
till you no longer see me.

407
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,360
-You're wrong. I do see you.
-No.

408
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,039
Okay? I see you, and I like you.
I like you so much it hurts me.

409
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,440
I-- I'm not like those girls from before.

410
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,360
I'll go tell the driver
to come pick you up.

411
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,039
If you want, you can check
that I deleted your video.

412
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,239
Snoop around as much as you like.

413
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,440
Honey? Can you not hear me?
I've been hollering at you forever now.

414
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,199
-Are you alone?
-Oh shit.

415
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,719
The house stinks of testosterone.

416
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,960
-Does it really?
-No.

417
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Thank you.

418
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,440
What's this?

419
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,320
Don't know.
It came while we were partying.

420
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,320
A NEW NUMBER SO YOU CAN START
FROM SCRATCH. BIG KISS, ARMANDO.

421
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,360
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

422
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,159
I didn't tell you about Nano
so you'd use it against him.

423
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
And, Ari,
that whole winning-at-any-cost thing?

424
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,199
-It wasn't cool.
-Well, you're the one to talk.

425
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm not the only one who's obsessed
with competing with Samuel.

426
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,639
No one would ever guess you're friends.

427
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,400
Well, we are. Seriously.

428
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,599
Samuel's a cool guy.

429
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,239
He's the best thing I've gotten
out of these past two shitty years.

430
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,000
And it's true that when he got here,
yeah, I looked down on him.

431
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,800
But look,
the guy had everything against him,

432
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,559
and he's beaten the odds every time.

433
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,440
But be real.
You still look down on him a little.

434
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,320
Not anymore, honestly.

435
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,480
In fact,
that's why he makes me so jealous.

436
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:08,239
And maybe, well,
he makes me scared I might lose you.

437
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,280
You're scared of losing me?

438
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,119
I mean, okay,
not like scared scared or terrified.

439
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:17,119
A little scared.

440
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,760
What?

441
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,920
What?

442
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,679
Do you like that I'm scared of losing you?

443
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,199
I like that you're not afraid to say that.

444
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:49,719
I don't know
what came over me or what I was thinking.

445
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,719
I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.

446
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,719
Please come and hear me out.
