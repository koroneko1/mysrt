00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.320
Hey, why are you sitting here alone?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.320
Not really.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:42.940
I don't believe you. I can see from your face.

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.113
Where is Ion?

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:46.700
Why?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
Are you waiting for Ion?

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:52.080
Just in case you know.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:58.740
I can help you even I'm not your close friend like Ion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.320
But I'm Tan's close friend.

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:06.335
Did Tan say anything to you?

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.979
No, he didn't.

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:12.700
I know nothing.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:22.400
I just want to tell you that using your brain for mathematics but your heart for love.

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:24.995
That's all I want to say. See you.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.760
Hey, where are you going?

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:07.097
Our faculty's building is over there.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.140
You're just a distracted. Come here and take a seat.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:21.015
Please don't hold my hand.

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:24.380
What's wrong with you?

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:25.919
I'm fine.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380
Please tell me...

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.380
I want to know if I have to do anything for you.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.149
I don't know...

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.611
I really don't know what's wrong with me.

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:42.524
I've never felt like this before.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:58.380
Are you jealous?

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.380
No, I'm not!

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.220
I'm serious about the Calculus examination.

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:05.335
i don't know about today's quiz.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.335
I've not read the book.

00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:12.701
Have you read the book?

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.220
I have not.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.165
Have you thought about me all night long?

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.339
Drivel!

00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:28.745
Here you are. You will feel better.

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.240
You will think of me while you're doing the test.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.240
Nonsense!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.240
Please try.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.240
Do you like it?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.240
Good!

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.292
I will get zero score If I think of you.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.480
Where are Ion and Tik?

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:31.080
They need to go back and help their grandmother.

00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:42.263
How about your surprise for Tan's birthday last night?

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.984
You surprised him at the shop.

00:04:45.358 --> 00:04:46.608
Yes, I did.

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:49.016
It was good.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
It was good?

00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:09.077
Atom, do you know about the relationship between Tan and Sine?

00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:12.139
Tan and Sine?

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:18.300
They're close friends since their secondary school.

00:05:19.368 --> 00:05:20.300
Why?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.224
I think when they're together,

00:05:28.454 --> 00:05:39.129
they're so happy. I don't know why but I'm happy too when they're together.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.190
And then?

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:53.300
I think my thought is right.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.120
They have not opened their heart to each other.

00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:15.740
Has Tan never told you about his feeling for you?

00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:24.734
Tan has never shown his feeling for me.

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:37.625
But it's okay if he still care for me as usual.

00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:52.776
I see. Are you sure?

00:06:54.132 --> 00:06:56.132
Yes, I am.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.620
Leo, do you have class?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.764
Take a seat, please.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.486
How about your surprise last night?

00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:28.453
Newton - Sir Nueng's son told you, right?

00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:33.260
Yes, of course.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.040
But... there's no surprise from You and Atom.

00:07:39.905 --> 00:07:41.649
You just invited me only for alcohol drinks.

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:43.649
Don't change the topic.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:50.340
Which one do you prefer, Tan-Lin or Tan-Sine?

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.180
or Tan-Lin-Sine, Bermuda triangle?

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.180
Leo!!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.199
Don't worry.

00:08:02.488 --> 00:08:06.736
There's no secret about you. I and Atom can find out.

00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:12.207
I don't know what to say...

00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:20.460
It's natural, normal, and basic...

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.880
about mass and gravity.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:36.340
Or you can think in the mathematics way about Classical logic - yes or no, clear answers.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:43.720
which is different from Fuzzy logic - several possible choices.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.580
I hope you will understand what I'm talking about.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.760
Thanks for helping me.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.760
You're welcome.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.680
Hello, Lin.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.420
Tan, are you free for tomorrow tutoring?

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.420
Sure.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.400
I made the appointment with you, I won't forget it.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.140
Time flies. When is your examination date?

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:39.283
I think after Chemistry major's examination date.

00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:43.220
Good for you. My examination date is too early.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.180
See you tomorrow.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.320
Okay. See you at the Chemistry's building.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.480
Okay, bye.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.480
Okay, bye bye.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.920
What's up?

00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:36.497
You look bright.

00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:38.497
Why not?

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.439
Why are you starring at me?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920
Why?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920
There's something on my face?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.920
No. But why he's starring at us?

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.920
Now I understand.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.920
It's so good.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.380
That's what I've told you.

00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:23.240
If you drink daily, you will have brighter skin.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.440
Newton - Sir Nueng's son will follow you. Would you let me call him?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.478
Tan, stop!

00:11:30.998 --> 00:11:32.380
You have the appointment with Lin, don't you?

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.365
Yes, I have.

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:37.407
I have to go now.

00:11:37.407 --> 00:11:39.407
Hurry!

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.407
See you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.200
Lin, this is for you. I'm afraid you maybe hungry.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.680
Thank you.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.780
Have you waited for me so long?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.463
Just few minutes before you came.

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.538
Tell me which parts that you don't understand.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This question, right here.

00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:11.346
I see.

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:14.238
And which reports?

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:17.920
This one?

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.910
Yes.

00:12:19.689 --> 00:12:25.020
This question requires Theory 2.4

00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:26.732
Right here.

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:30.145
It's about Trigonometry.

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:38.885
First, you need to know sine, cos, and tan. After that cosec, cot, sec.

00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:09.745
It's easy. Can you do it?

00:13:13.131 --> 00:13:18.429
This page is similar to this question, you just change this value.

00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:20.660
I hope you understand more

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.660
because of Teacher Tan.

00:13:25.468 --> 00:13:26.660
What time is it?

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.480
I'm hungry now. Please allow me to open the snacks.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.336
Sure.

00:13:32.336 --> 00:13:34.971
I bought the flavor you like.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.320
and I like it too.

00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.421
Do you like it?

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:22.220
[If you don't love me, just tell me clearly.]

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.282
[Don't cheat on me.]

00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:33.327
[Don't break my heart by your pretense]

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:42.363
[If you think I'm not your special, don't make me think I'm special.]

00:14:42.853 --> 00:14:50.260
[If you don't love me, just let me go...]

00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:53.620
You're always the same, Lin.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:59.540
Your mouth is so messy while you enjoy eating. Be careful. 

00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:02.027
Hi, Sine.

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:07.700
Please join us. We're tutoring for the examination.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.931
No thanks. I forgot my stuff at the building.

00:15:09.931 --> 00:15:11.498
So I come back to get it.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.016
Where? Let me help you find out.

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:16.362
No thanks. You need to help Lin for the examination preparation. 

00:15:18.997 --> 00:15:20.997
I can find it on my own.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:35.140
Tan, you should go with Sine. I understand all you taught and I can review by myself at home.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.718
Do you want me to take you home?

00:15:40.718 --> 00:15:42.892
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.642
Okay.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.000
Let me know when you're at home safely.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
What I've done!

00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:20.873
Sine... Sine...

00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:22.931
Where are you going?

00:16:30.498 --> 00:16:32.498
You should take Lin seriously.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.172
What's wrong with you?

00:16:38.383 --> 00:16:41.049
Why do you want me to love the one that I don't love?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.626
Can I love someone that I really love?

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.980
Please stop!

00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:04.326
You shouldn't do this to me.

00:17:05.047 --> 00:17:06.268
It's not funny.

00:17:06.268 --> 00:17:07.600
I'm serious about you.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.600
I don't believe you.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.613
You should take someone seriously.

00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:15.440
You talk with Lin everyday.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.559
But when you're with me. You always act like this. It's unfair.

00:17:22.203 --> 00:17:31.214
I really don't know what you have done to me, just for fun or for real.

00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:37.096
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:40.740
I'm so confused.

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:44.800
How I'm feeling for you right now is totally different from the past.

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:49.354
I'm very happy when I'm with you...

00:17:49.354 --> 00:17:51.902
more than when I'm with my family members.

00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:53.700
Don't you feel the same?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.700
Or you just pretend that you don't feel.

00:17:57.513 --> 00:18:02.517
I pretend that I don't feel anything because I don't want to lose my best friend like you.

00:18:04.103 --> 00:18:09.620
We have been friends a long time. I don't want to be your friend anymore. I want to be your love, Sine.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.208
How about Lin? You talk with her everyday. What do you mean by this, Tan?

00:18:32.568 --> 00:18:37.065
Today I don't know If I will lose my friend or the one I love.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.180
But I've thought carefully.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.920
And I want to tell you the truth.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.388
I need you. You are my love.

00:19:04.174 --> 00:19:10.734
Is it too difficult for us to find the answer and learn each other?

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:17.512
It's over now.

00:19:21.512 --> 00:19:23.718
We need to change the problem?

00:19:24.814 --> 00:19:26.776
I think this problem can not be solved.

00:19:27.872 --> 00:19:34.093
[If you don't love me, just tell me clearly.]

00:19:34.093 --> 00:19:39.101
[Don't cheat on me.]

00:19:39.707 --> 00:19:45.327
[Don't break my heart by your pretense]

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:54.007
[If you think I'm not your special, don't make me think I'm special.]

00:19:54.613 --> 00:20:01.163
[If you don't love me, just let me go...]

00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:09.951
[If you don't love me, just tell me to let me go...]

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.140
Hi, Lin.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.140
I'm going home.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.919
Okay, sure.

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:50.457
See you.

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:23.020
Actually I want to meet you.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.020
Yes?

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:32.488
I know what you're feeling.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.200
Can I hold your hand?

00:22:14.956 --> 00:22:17.400
I think it's good...

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.980
if I can hold your hand as the loved one,

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.980
take care of each other, 

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.663
look after of each other,

00:22:35.528 --> 00:22:36.980
for good time and bad time, 

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.730
side by side.
