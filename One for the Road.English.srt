1
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,083
Good evening my dear listeners.

2
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,291
You're listening to Midnight Riders.

3
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,291
I'm DJ Charnwut Chantarachoke,
keeping you company tonight.

4
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:45,041
It's midnight on Friday.
Where are you guys right now?

5
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,208
If you're spending time
with your special someone,

6
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:54,333
I hope you're having a very
romantic evening.

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:02,208
But for those of you who are by yourself,

8
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,166
remember that I'm sitting
right here with you.

9
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:13,583
Good company and lovely music…

10
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:19,666
will make your journey of life
feel less lonely.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,833
But before we hear our
first song for tonight,

12
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:31,958
let's take a quick commercial break.

13
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,333
I'll return back to you soon.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,750
And I'll stick around
all the way until 3 a.m.

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,625
So don't go anywhere.

16
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,375
May I talk to Boss, please?

17
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,791
Hello? Can you hear me?

18
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,000
Fuck you, Aood.

19
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,833
You recognize my voice.

20
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,875
What's your deal, man?

21
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,333
Is it bad timing?

22
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,625
C'mon, spill it.

23
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,208
What is your fucking emergency?

24
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
Seriously, can this wait?

25
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,541
Did you forget what time
it is in New York?

26
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,791
No, but running a bar means
you work the night shift, right?

27
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,500
Are you busy with a customer?

28
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,833
A female customer, maybe?

29
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,500
Just tell me why you called.

30
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,166
I need to ask you a favor.

31
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,291
Shoot.

32
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,250
You know my dad died of cancer.

33
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,666
Yes, and?

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,458
I have it too, just like him.

35
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,166
Come again.

36
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,166
Are you serious?

37
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,375
Who jokes about having cancer?

38
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,125
Leukemia. The doctor said
it runs in the family.

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,375
I inherited it.

40
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,750
And you…

41
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,458
There's something
I want to do before I die,

42
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,083
and I need a favor from you.

43
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,833
Sure.

44
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,791
Tell me how I can help.

45
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,791
First of all,

46
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,125
can you come back to Thailand?

47
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:41,375
CHANTARACHOKE RECORDS

48
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,666
Aood.

49
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,833
Hey.

50
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,583
You really came.

51
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,458
Sure. I…

52
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,875
Your breath stinks, man.

53
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,333
-Long flight?
-Very.

54
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,666
You have to bring that up now?

55
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,666
What?

56
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,250
Shit. It feels like ages.

57
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,708
I'm speechless.

58
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,083
Come.

59
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,291
I'll get you some water,
your breath's awful.

60
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:19,666
Why don't you just get me a toothbrush?

61
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,708
You want one? You can use mine.

62
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,916
No, thanks.

63
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,375
I don't want to catch cancer.

64
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,000
If you don't want to do chemo,
why do you want me here?

65
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,916
What about…

66
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,750
Skydiving?

67
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,333
Rock climbing? Bungee jumping?

68
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,625
A threesome, maybe?
You haven't done it, have you?

69
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,791
Not my thing.

70
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,000
Seriously, what do you want to do?

71
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,750
I want to return some stuff.

72
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,125
Return what? To whom?

73
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,583
To Alice.

74
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,833
Alice the bitch? Your ex?

75
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,583
Why can't you just mail it?

76
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,583
Nope.

77
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,583
I want to see her.

78
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,125
Return stuff to your ex. Checked.

79
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,125
What else?

80
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,750
Nothing else.

81
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,666
That's it.

82
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,833
Then why did you make me
come all the way here?

83
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,416
The doctor said I shouldn't drive.

84
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,958
Do I look like a cab driver?

85
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,458
Catch.

86
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,916
Don't slam the door. This is my dad's car.

87
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,583
Too late.

88
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,708
Now you're doing it.

89
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,208
-Sorry. I'll be gentle with it.
-Boss isn't happy.

90
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,833
Good evening, Midnight Riders.

91
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:11,708
You're still here with me, DJ Charnwut
Chantarachoke, your late-night friend.

92
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,291
DJ Charnwut?

93
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,125
Your dad's show?

94
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,083
Cassettes.

95
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,375
I got them from the station.

96
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,333
You love golden oldies.

97
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,250
Now I know…

98
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,750
-why you want to see your ex.
-Why?

99
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,250
You want a farewell fuck, right?

100
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,166
C'mon, you want me to join you?

101
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,583
So, did Alice dump you?

102
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,708
Let's turn this up.

103
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,083
You have something to tell me?

104
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,916
Yes.

105
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,625
Why the hell
are you going back to Thailand?

106
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,625
Well…

107
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,333
Alice wants to open
a dance school in Korat.

108
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,958
A dance school?

109
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,458
Fuck, you can't even dance!

110
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,208
What about our bar?

111
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,458
I'm meeting your friend tomorrow
about renting his place.

112
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,291
-How can you ditch me like this?
-Stop.

113
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,625
Stop what?

114
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,250
How many years
have you talked about this bar?

115
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,291
I can't live like this anymore.

116
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,791
Like not having to pay a dime
to live in a penthouse?

117
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,958
I told you he'd say this.

118
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,500
It's none of your fucking business.

119
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,333
Are you sure you want to
drag my friend home?

120
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,166
It's better than being here with you.

121
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,958
-Hey, calm down.
-Fuck you.

122
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,083
Hey fucker, you drive like shit!

123
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,250
What's up with you?

124
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,958
-What's your problem?
-Easy, man.

125
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Love her much?

126
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,333
You've know her longer than me?

127
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:49,875
NAKHON RATCHASIMA

128
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,083
You're full of shit.

129
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,000
You didn't even return
for your dad's funeral.

130
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,500
Looks like a haunted mansion.

131
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,750
Does she have any students?

132
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,750
Carry it yourself.

133
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,458
Take this.

134
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,166
What's this?

135
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,083
-Give this snack to her for me.
-Why?

136
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,416
So you can tell her
that I'm here to see her.

137
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,041
Why don't you just call her?

138
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,375
I already did.

139
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,166
-She didn't answer.
-Then text her.

140
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,250
Tell her why you're here.

141
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,083
You're sick and dying.

142
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,875
Not a word about my health.

143
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't want her to know.

144
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,750
Like she'd never figure it out.

145
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,625
I'll deal with that later.

146
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,166
Just walk in there and give it to her.

147
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,833
Use your chick-baiting tricks.

148
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,125
What tricks?

149
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,500
-You're a smooth talker.
-Like I'm dying to talk to her.

150
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,333
You haven't seen her in a long time.
She must miss you a lot.

151
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,958
You son of a bitch.

152
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,208
Please, I'll wait at the food court.

153
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,958
Call me when the coast is clear. Okay?

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,291
Break a leg.

155
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,416
I don't want to see him.

156
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,833
Just leave.

157
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,541
I have a class.

158
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,583
Come on, don't be so mean.

159
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,291
Just go see him.

160
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,458
Getting dumped hurts real bad,
you know that.

161
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,000
Shut the hell up.

162
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,333
I just…

163
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,833
An asshole like you
has no right to preach.

164
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,375
How many girls have you dumped?
Don't be so righteous.

165
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,083
-But I never dumped Aood.
-Yes, you did.

166
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,291
Playing dumb?

167
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,875
Don't give me that look.

168
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,666
You treated him like shit.
Told him you would open a bar together.

169
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,833
-You gave him a dream.
-Shut up.

170
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,541
You can't blame it all on me.

171
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,416
You're no different from me, bitch.

172
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,625
I'll be honest.

173
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,291
I don't even want to be here.
It's got nothing to do with me.

174
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,208
Then get lost.

175
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,541
If it wasn't for…

176
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,708
Listen.

177
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,833
He just wants to return something to you

178
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,250
before going back to New York with me.

179
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,041
This may be the last time you'll see him.

180
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,291
Just go see him. Is it too much to ask?

181
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,958
Sorry, man. The E Train is suspended.

182
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,875
BALLROOM NIGHT

183
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,708
Good evening.

184
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,833
-Hi, I'm Aood.
-Hi.

185
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,333
I'm Alice.

186
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,416
Nice to meet you.

187
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,750
-Sorry, I'm late.
-Buy me a beer then.

188
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,041
You got it.

189
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,541
Thanks for coming.

190
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,791
You look so thin.

191
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,000
Your hair…

192
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,875
I've seen it on Facebook,

193
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,541
but it looks better in person.

194
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,750
It does?

195
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,291
It looks good on you.

196
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,291
It just takes some getting used to.

197
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,333
But cool…

198
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,000
I prefer red, actually.

199
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,583
Such a hassle to keep dyeing it.

200
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,333
And…

201
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,666
there's no need to be
that stylish in this town.

202
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,625
Things are slow here.

203
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,416
And the school?

204
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,625
It's going fine.

205
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,958
Like… Back when you were here with me

206
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,250
our students used to be teenagers.
Remember that?

207
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,791
Now the target has shifted.

208
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,041
I only have old people in class.

209
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,333
They're all my students.

210
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,583
So it's going pretty well.

211
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,291
I'm here to return this.

212
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,500
Sorry for keeping it all this time.

213
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,791
But I've cleaned it.

214
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,291
Well…

215
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,791
I don't even remember when you took it.

216
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,375
Right when we broke up
and I moved back to Bangkok.

217
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,416
I packed my stuff in it when I left.

218
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,708
-I…
-Never mind.

219
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm giving it back now.

220
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,250
You can keep it. I don't mind.

221
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,500
No, thanks.

222
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,375
All right.

223
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,791
Thanks for the trouble.

224
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,000
Is that all? You came all the way
just to return the bag?

225
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,708
That's it?

226
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,000
I had no idea you took it.

227
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,666
Never mind.

228
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,791
I noticed…

229
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,500
you changed your Facebook status

230
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,666
to single.

231
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,083
Stalker much?

232
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,750
Yeah, we broke up. After only two months.

233
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,875
I was doing a spin
and completing a hand-to-hand step.

234
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,000
But he didn't catch me.

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,958
I fell and twisted my knee.

236
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,291
I went to see a doctor.

237
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,458
He told me to take a long rest.

238
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,458
Then…

239
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,708
He ran away

240
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,416
to find a new dance partner.

241
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,041
Just like that.

242
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,083
I…

243
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,458
I miss you.

244
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,500
I thought I would play it cool

245
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,666
and act like I was so strong.

246
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,291
But sitting here with you, I just can't.

247
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,125
Your students will see
you're such a cry-baby.

248
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,958
It's your fault. Why are you here!

249
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,125
Dance with me tonight.

250
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,708
-For real?
-Yes.

251
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,500
Still remember the steps?

252
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,583
Okay.

253
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,541
Closer.

254
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,166
Music, please.

255
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,125
Ready?

256
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,458
Three, two, one.

257
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,833
One, two, three, four.

258
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,583
Two, three, four.

259
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,875
Yes.

260
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,750
Excuse me.

261
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,291
Yes?

262
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,541
You're in Teacher Alice's class, right?

263
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,916
Yeah, I guess.

264
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,833
Do you have a dance partner?

265
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,500
Depends on who's asking.

266
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,708
So you're available?

267
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,958
For you, I'm always available.

268
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,041
Thank you.

269
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,625
Mom! He's available.

270
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,458
Can you dance with my mom?

271
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,125
Come, son.

272
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,541
Good night, ma'am.

273
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,833
-See you.
-See you.

274
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,166
See you.

275
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,583
I'll go check on my students.

276
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,125
You okay?

277
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,708
What is it?

278
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,333
I'll drop you off at the hotel.

279
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:12,250
Then I need to follow up with that girl.

280
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,583
We'll have to drive to
Samut Songkhram tonight.

281
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,333
Samut Songkhram?

282
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,916
-To see Noona.
-What?

283
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,625
Let's get this straight.

284
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,458
Noona? That's not part of the deal.

285
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,458
I told you…

286
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,375
I want to visit my ex-girlfriends…

287
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,875
Girlfriend with an 's'? That's unfair!

288
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,250
Don't be tricky, man.

289
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,750
-So how many exes do you have to visit?
-Calm down.

290
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,875
Let's talk in the car. Okay?

291
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:57,375
-Samut Songkhram chicks are cute.
-So you insist?

292
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,541
Just look at yourself.

293
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,375
Look.

294
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,583
When my dad died,
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

295
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,958
So I know how sad it is
for the one who's left behind.

296
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,375
And you know I didn't even
fly back for his cremation.

297
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,541
When I found out I had leukemia,
I started calling people.

298
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,083
To thank them,

299
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,666
or to say sorry.

300
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,666
Then I deleted each number
after I made the call.

301
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,708
Until finally,

302
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,125
I only have the numbers
of those I want to see in person.

303
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,000
If you insist, I'll drive you.

304
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,833
But on one condition.

305
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,583
I told you I won't do chemo anymore.

306
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,291
If so, I'm going back to New York now.

307
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,958
You can go see
all your dozen exes or whatever.

308
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:04,000
Return their sentimental
knick-knacks and shit. Go ahead.

309
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,666
Once done, you have
to come with me for treatment.

310
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,291
How hard is that?
I'll take care of everything.

311
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,041
All you have to do is survive.

312
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,583
Okay.

313
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,291
Seat belt.

314
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,500
It doesn't matter

315
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,125
how your paths crossed…

316
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,916
I said seat belt.

317
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,250
or how long you will be together.

318
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,958
The song may be brief, but its melody

319
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,375
will linger for a long time in your mind.

320
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:05,500
This song is dedicated to everybody
who lingers in our thoughts.

321
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,541
Then, now, and forever.

322
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,041
Inside turn and back to basic steps.

323
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,375
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

324
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,916
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,708
I'm sorry too.

326
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,416
I didn't try hard enough
when we were together.

327
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,541
For me, you did the best you could.

328
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,125
Finally,

329
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,916
this day has come.

330
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:28,666
The time we spent together
was not in vain.

331
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,083
I know what I'm going to say

332
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,166
may sound like a corny line
from a soap opera.

333
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,875
But I thank fate,

334
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,708
for bringing us back together.

335
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,250
Yes.

336
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,416
I thank fate…

337
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,541
…for bringing me here,

338
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,125
to this moment,

339
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,791
with this feeling…

340
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,041
What feeling? I can't feel anything.

341
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,291
You droned on like a robot.

342
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,750
Do you even feel anything?

343
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,166
I don't think you do.

344
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,333
How do you expect the audience
to feel something that you don't?

345
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,083
This is a dramatic scene, get it?

346
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,125
I didn't want this in the first place.

347
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,166
Isn't it cool that your ex is a superstar?

348
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,708
Cool my ass.

349
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,666
I don't see how we can approach her.

350
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,916
If you can't make me feel it,
we'll keep shooting.

351
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,625
You're doing fine.
Sorry we have to keep reshooting.

352
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,875
No worries.

353
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,208
From the start.

354
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,458
All right, one more take.

355
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,583
No way we can get close to her.

356
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,833
-She's not as pretty as on TV.
-She's cute.

357
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,208
Not bad at all.

358
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,458
Get ready for your love scene.

359
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,833
Quiet, please. On your mark.

360
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,500
HOSTAGE OF THE HEART

361
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,125
Ready, speed…

362
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,166
What's going on?

363
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,625
Who let them through!

364
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,083
Come here kiddos!

365
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,416
One hundred baht apiece!

366
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,875
Stop! We'll take a break!

367
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:58,291
Calling yourself Nunar
is a brilliant move.

368
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:06,708
Why are you here?

369
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:13,000
I came to congratulate you.

370
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:20,208
I'm so happy to see
you're living your dream.

371
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:28,000
-It's a huge set.
-Are you being sarcastic?

372
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,625
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

373
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,125
You're back early.

374
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:06,125
We're auditioning.
This is Nigel, Boss's friend.

375
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,708
He's a film director.

376
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,666
-Aood.
-Hello, I'm Aood.

377
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,541
I'm her part-time manager

378
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,208
-and full-time fucking boyfriend.
-Aood. Aood!

379
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,541
Can you just leave?

380
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,000
Well…

381
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,750
-I just want to say goodbye.
-Okay.

382
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,250
I'm going back to New York with Boss.

383
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,458
Are you done?

384
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,083
And I brought you this.

385
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,000
-You forgot it when you moved out.
-I didn't forget it.

386
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,875
Just leave, please.

387
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,583
I need to focus on the script.

388
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,333
Just hear me out.

389
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,041
Let me say something,
then I'll leave you alone.

390
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:40,958
Noona…

391
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:43,708
I'm sorry.

392
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,583
I didn't support you back then.

393
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,791
I didn't help you when you struggled.

394
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,458
How many times have we talked about this?

395
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,416
Too many.

396
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,708
-So?
-You're not ready for an audition.

397
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,583
Why? I have to grab every chance.

398
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,541
Why do you think I came to New York?

399
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,041
I didn't come here to wait tables.

400
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,416
This is my dream.

401
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,166
This is my life. It's what I want to do.

402
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,625
Let me give you this award again.

403
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,291
You're awesome to have
come this far by yourself.

404
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,291
Don't listen to what that director says.

405
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,541
No one can judge you.

406
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,625
You never trust me.

407
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,791
You never believe I can do it.

408
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,416
You're already great without them.

409
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,958
You want to hear the truth?

410
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,041
-Do you?
-Yes, say it!

411
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,833
They never care about your acting skill.

412
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,375
Just ask Boss.

413
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,083
They think you're gullible
and just want to screw you.

414
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,958
I'm ready now.

415
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,041
We can start.

416
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:50,583
Come on. Hurry up.

417
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,583
Everyone!

418
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,416
-Nunar…
-No need!

419
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,791
Okay. Ready and…

420
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,500
action!

421
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:07,958
I must thank fate…

422
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,250
for bringing me here,

423
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,000
to this moment,

424
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,916
with this feeling.

425
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,166
Hey.

426
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,333
Are you blushing on one cheek?

427
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,041
The love that you have for me

428
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,708
was once a shining light.

429
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,666
My smile used to…

430
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,166
mean happiness.

431
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,916
But your love has turned into a cage…

432
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,958
Fuck you, I told you to
put the phone down!

433
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,625
…that imprisons my dreams,

434
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,375
my life,

435
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,541
and my smile.

436
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,916
If this is the last time
we're seeing each other,

437
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,375
look me in the eyes…

438
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,541
and remember who I've become today.

439
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:33,000
No matter how much I may regret it,

440
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,250
these bullets…

441
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,500
Mutita, what are you doing?

442
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,416
They will set us free from our past.

443
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,416
Thank you…

444
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,625
and goodbye.

445
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,291
And cut!

446
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,291
Brilliant!

447
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,791
-Thank you.
-Incredible.

448
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,625
Let's go.

449
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,291
You're perfect for the role.

450
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,291
Give her a big round of applause.

451
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,875
Let's change the setup and take a break.

452
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,583
-Give me the same in the next scene.
-I'll catch up.

453
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,083
Are you sure you want to keep going?

454
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,250
I have to.

455
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,625
Excuse me.

456
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,791
Yes?

457
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,625
Bring my friend
the strongest poison in your bar.

458
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,666
Bed Breaker, Boner Forever…

459
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,708
Stomping Horse, Dragon's Dick,
what do you fancy?

460
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,791
Which one will make me feel alive?

461
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,958
-All of them.
-I agree, everything is great

462
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
if you'll drink with me.

463
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,125
Sure.

464
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,791
Bring your glass and sit with us.

465
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:14,000
God damn it, if her husband
comes and beats you up,

466
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,041
don't count on me to help you.

467
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,000
No need, nothing's going to happen.

468
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,166
She knows I'm only joking.

469
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,583
Still the same Boss, you're already 30.

470
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,208
Still younger than you.

471
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,791
Yes, but you're 30.

472
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,833
You should get your act together.

473
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,875
For what?

474
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,000
Look who's talking.

475
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,666
Getting your act together.

476
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,000
Having a serious relationship.

477
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,083
And look at you now.

478
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:50,208
I'm telling you,
relationships are like drinking.

479
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,708
You go with the flow,

480
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:55,500
and you'll be drunk as a skunk.

481
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,875
Look at me, I run a bar

482
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,208
but I never get drunk.

483
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,333
I'm too busy entertaining
pretty customers.

484
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,708
Are you sure you've never been drunk?

485
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,291
Dragon's Dick.

486
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,375
Long and strong.

487
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,083
Your snake will dig this snake.

488
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,208
Enjoy.

489
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,291
Fuck.

490
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:37,208
What's that? You only drank water.

491
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,666
Aood!

492
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,208
Aood!

493
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,041
He should stay here for a few days.

494
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:10,083
He needs a good rest. Not a road trip.

495
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,333
-Who did the driving?
-His friend.

496
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,458
-Is your dive open tonight?
-Not sure.

497
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,958
-You're coming?
-Yeah.

498
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:23,791
I'll tell my husband then.

499
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,666
Are you okay?

500
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm fine.

501
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:48,291
Good guys die hard. Look.

502
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,333
Let's go.

503
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,541
Did you pay?

504
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,250
Yeah.

505
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,583
What are you doing?

506
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,791
We're going to see Roong in Chiang Mai.

507
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,541
The doctor ordered you to rest.

508
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,208
-No.
-We can go tomorrow.

509
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,583
I told her I'd be there today.

510
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,541
Tomorrow her hubby
will be back from abroad.

511
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,375
Fuck him.

512
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,708
You need to rest.

513
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,333
I'm fine.

514
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:25,958
I'm all good.

515
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,666
-No need to rest.
-Shut up, look at yourself.

516
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,125
Right.

517
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,541
I've looked at myself.

518
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,708
That's why I have to hurry.

519
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,583
I will regret not saying goodbye.

520
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:58,833
A new year is here upon us once again.

521
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,708
To my audiences,

522
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,291
I hope you'll find all
that you're dreaming of.

523
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:24,916
Are you Aood? Boss's roommate?

524
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,458
I'm sure Boss is downstairs
exercising his charm.

525
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,833
-Am I blocking your shot?
-No. I'm shooting you.

526
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,791
C'mon, pose for me.

527
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,375
It's the last picture.
Let me shoot a person.

528
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,958
It's the New Year. Smile.

529
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,083
One…

530
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:56,416
Two…

531
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,333
I have to go back to
Thailand in three months.

532
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,541
I know…

533
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,291
you've promised Boss about opening a bar…

534
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,750
but I want you go back with me.

535
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,208
You're here already.

536
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,333
Hi, Roong.

537
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,083
Okay, okay.

538
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:39,958
It's been ages.

539
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:53,500
Come on in. Take off your shoes.

540
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,875
Take off your shoes, please.

541
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,416
So what's it like living in Chiang Mai?

542
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,041
It's okay.
Every day is pretty much the same.

543
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:09,000
I wake up, I cook.

544
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,791
Pack her lunch box.

545
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,416
Take her to school.

546
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,041
Pick her up.

547
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,875
Help with her homework.

548
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,041
Draw pictures.

549
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:28,416
And play a princess.

550
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:33,208
I can't imagine myself as a father.

551
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:39,750
If you hadn't chosen
to stay with Boss and open a bar,

552
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,500
do you think we would be together now?

553
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,416
Yes, I guess.

554
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:49,125
But instead of living
in this big beautiful house,

555
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:51,083
you'd have ended up in a shabby apartment.

556
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:52,958
And…

557
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,666
Lola wouldn't have been this cute.

558
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:05,083
Can you still develop film?

559
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,208
Thank you for coming to see
my daughter for the first time.

560
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,791
And to see me…

561
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,875
for the last time.

562
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,458
Aood, we're here.

563
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,458
Sleeping or dead?

564
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:13,083
-Hello?
-Roong, I'm here.

565
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,125
You are? Sorry, the plane just landed.

566
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,708
Landed where?

567
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,833
I'm in Singapore.

568
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,166
Singapore? Why?

569
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:36,500
I told you my husband
and I had a fight, right?

570
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:40,708
We made up and took this trip.

571
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,125
I'm sorry.

572
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,041
Hi, Roong.

573
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,916
Boss?

574
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,333
Yes, it's Boss.

575
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,583
Where the hell are you?

576
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,416
Aood arranged this with you weeks ago.

577
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,333
I'm sorry, it was kind of unexpected.

578
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:00,750
Bullshit.

579
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,500
I didn't drive across Thailand
so you could tell me that?

580
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,625
Hey, calm down.

581
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,291
I'm really sorry.

582
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,375
I had no idea he would be here.

583
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,916
He wants to make up with me.

584
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,833
I know you've driven a long way, but…

585
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,333
it's not my call.

586
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,083
Hello Roong.

587
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:24,041
It's good you made up with your husband.

588
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:28,333
See you next time. Okay?

589
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:29,916
Sure.

590
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,541
I'm sorry again.

591
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:47,916
Next time then.

592
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,416
Are you hungry by the way?

593
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,708
There's a good curry noodle
place near the house.

594
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,208
Hey, Roong!

595
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,041
Let's talk face to face.

596
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:24,250
Listen, Aood is…

597
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,583
He's going back to New York with me.

598
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,833
This is probably
the last time you'll see him.

599
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:47,041
Why don't you ask me if I want to see him?

600
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,791
Why don't you stop for a second
and ask how I feel?

601
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,708
What are you doing?

602
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,666
Come on. Let's go.

603
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,875
NAKHON SAWAN HOTEL

604
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:24,375
You go check in first.

605
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:37,500
LAST TAPE

606
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:48,166
We've come to our last break of the show.

607
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,291
DJ Charnwut Chantarachoke
is keeping you company.

608
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,416
As I told you at the start of the show,

609
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,791
tonight is my last night as your DJ.

610
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,000
That's life, ain't it?

611
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,708
We meet at some point.

612
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,916
We get to know each other,

613
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,208
bond with each other.

614
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,625
Then we part, that's the way it is.

615
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,291
To my audiences
who are tuning in from abroad,

616
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:33,000
we may not have a chance
to say goodbye in person.

617
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,500
But I hope with all my heart

618
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,750
that you will live your
life to the fullest.

619
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,666
Dream far…

620
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,250
and fly high.

621
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,500
So this old man…

622
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,666
who sits alone in a small, dark room

623
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:55,708
by himself

624
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,291
would be proud.

625
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,000
CHARNWUT CHANTARACHOKE
1953-2021

626
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,541
Till we meet again.

627
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:19,083
I've already asked the monk
to let me take it.

628
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,125
I can't leave him like this.

629
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,416
I'd like to say goodbye to all of you

630
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:34,541
with this very last song.

631
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:40,375
The final song…

632
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:45,708
from a radio show that has
lasted as long as my life.

633
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:54,625
Now…

634
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,125
it's time to say goodbye
to DJ Charnwut for real.

635
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:05,250
Thanks again for always listening.

636
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:12,250
Have a safe journey.

637
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,291
Goodbye.

638
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,166
Hey.

639
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,000
Let's go to Pattaya.

640
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,500
Let's go see my family.

641
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,833
Sure. Pattaya sounds good.

642
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:49,000
I've always wanted
to see Mr. Boss's big house.

643
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,166
A hell of a place…

644
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,500
You haven't been home in ten years.
Didn't you miss it?

645
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:07,708
Why can't it just be the two of us?

646
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,500
I know it's too much to ask.

647
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,958
But trust me.

648
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:22,208
I do it for our own good.

649
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,791
I promise when this photo shoot is over,

650
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,333
we'll go celebrate, just the two of us.

651
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,041
Sister.

652
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,291
Your sister is marrying my dad.

653
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:27,541
So, do I now call you Uncle?

654
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:30,375
No need, just call me by my name.

655
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,791
It's "Ball"?

656
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,541
It's Boss.

657
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,541
Boss as in "chief".

658
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,208
Right?

659
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:45,875
Yes.

660
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm Poom.

661
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,416
Well…

662
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,916
Welcome.

663
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,333
Next one with the children.

664
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,708
Kids, let's take some pictures.

665
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:59,750
-Get over here.
-Come, come.

666
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,333
-Poom, come here.
-Yes, ma'am.

667
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,166
Boss…

668
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,458
if you're bored, go wait at the bar.

669
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:08,625
Order what you want and put it on my tab.

670
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:10,625
We're ready.

671
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:11,833
Look at the camera, please.

672
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,708
One, two…

673
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,583
Great. One more shot.

674
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:36,958
Come.

675
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,708
Give me a sec.

676
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,500
A new order just came in.

677
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:50,291
No?

678
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53,083
You don't like carrots?

679
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:58,583
-Hey.
-Hi.

680
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,625
Didn't know you were back.

681
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,208
Just arrived.

682
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:08,583
I came back to see a friend and thought…

683
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,750
I might drop by to see my sister.

684
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:12,125
Is she here?

685
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:16,583
You didn't see our group chat?
They're in Europe.

686
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,208
Won't be back till next week.

687
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,625
Have a seat.

688
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,000
Later.

689
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,958
-I'll go get a room.
-Sit.

690
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,208
I need to talk to you.

691
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,541
You know what I want to talk about?

692
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,083
What about?

693
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:40,708
About the bar.

694
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,125
Told you I've come back to see a friend.

695
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:50,791
What about your already tight cash flow?

696
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:53,041
It's not professional
to close for a month.

697
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,750
-What do you know?
-And what do you know?

698
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,541
-Shut up!
-You shut up!

699
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,166
I work my ass off over there,
I need a break!

700
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,083
This is the high season.

701
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:10,583
Other hotels are fully booked,
but it's deserted here.

702
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:13,416
So you're blaming my sister?

703
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,000
-Really?
-Hey!

704
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:18,291
Gigi!

705
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,041
I'm sick of cleaning up your shit.

706
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:28,125
Slow economy, stingy customers,

707
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,416
or mismanagement, you can blame anything.

708
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,375
The question is,
why must Tak keep propping up your bar?

709
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,875
-It's her money.
-It's my dad's money.

710
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:40,041
Your sister works for my dad.

711
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:46,958
Tell me, how much have
you lost in three years?

712
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:53,208
Next month
I'll take over from your sister.

713
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,750
If you can't turn the bar around
in three months, I'll shut it down.

714
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,458
What now?

715
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,833
You look stressed out. Need a drink?

716
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,000
Man, I do want to visit your bar,

717
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,291
and try your drinks.

718
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,083
Come.

719
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,916
A bar is not a place.

720
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,708
A bar is the bartender.

721
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,833
This is my last drink, man.

722
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,666
Don't let me down.

723
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,166
Last drink my ass.

724
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,416
We'll celebrate again
when you've recovered.

725
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,125
Like a pro!

726
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:23,750
What's it called?

727
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,125
Alice.

728
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,125
How is it?

729
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:57,000
Great.

730
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,458
Next…

731
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,458
Noona's Tears.

732
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:15,791
And the best girlfriend award
from the Aoodscar…

733
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:19,791
goes to… Noona!

734
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,500
After The Rain.

735
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,041
Our first roll together in New York.

736
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:42,916
Keep it with you and don't develop it yet.

737
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,958
Which one is your favorite?

738
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,666
What about yours?

739
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,166
My what?

740
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,833
Drinks based on memories of your exes.

741
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:14,708
We'd be here till the morning
and all this booze wouldn't be enough.

742
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:18,416
I want you to taste
your most important drink.

743
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:23,791
Prim.

744
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,541
This is where you met her, isn't it?

745
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,666
Give me a drink.

746
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,916
The most expensive one.

747
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:58,166
Neat or on the rocks?

748
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,500
I…

749
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,375
Can I see your ID?

750
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:33,250
Your thumb is on your birthdate.

751
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,625
I can't serve you. You're underage.

752
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,000
Hold on, boy.

753
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:02,666
Having a hard time?

754
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,208
Heartbroken?

755
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,041
No more questions then.

756
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,166
Sit down.

757
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:16,333
I'll make one for you.

758
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,416
Since it's your birthday.

759
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,083
Just one, okay?

760
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:25,125
Let's see…

761
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:17,791
Why this?

762
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:22,291
It was the first drink I learned to make,

763
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:26,083
and I guess it'll be
the first drink of your life.

764
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,166
-Does it taste…
-Wait a sec.

765
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,458
Go on, it's hot!

766
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,625
Hope you like it.

767
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:26,375
So how's your new school?

768
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,333
Is Teacher Samorn still there?

769
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,125
-I haven't met her.
-Really?

770
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:37,291
-What's her class?
-Thai language. She's very strict.

771
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:53,291
-You're going in?
-Come with me.

772
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,708
In this outfit?

773
01:14:57,791 --> 01:14:58,916
Why not?

774
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,916
We'll dry up riding home.

775
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:04,250
Do you know why I became a bartender?

776
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,916
I saw my dad
mixing drinks when I was a kid.

777
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:11,041
And the first thing I could do…

778
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:12,541
was shaking.

779
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:17,833
My dad liked experimenting with new
cocktails and I begged him to let me help.

780
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:27,791
Tasting a cocktail is like
discovering a new world.

781
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:38,291
You put incompatible things together
and try to make them work.

782
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:49,166
That's how I fell in love
with making cocktails.

783
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,541
I've been training really hard,

784
01:15:57,291 --> 01:16:00,000
because I want to spend
my whole life doing it.

785
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,708
Imagine if I get to
go to New York like my dad…

786
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:09,041
to live in a new world
and meet new people.

787
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:13,833
Wouldn't it be awesome to own a bar there?

788
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,583
I already have a name.

789
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,541
-Meaning?

790
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:24,000
The last drink before heading home.

791
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,541
Let's start a bar!

792
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:27,250
-Why not?
-Tomorrow then!

793
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,875
Of course. I got this.
You want to? Tomorrow?

794
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,500
Yeah! Tomorrow!

795
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:32,541
You got it!

796
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,125
Hi, Mom.

797
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:37,041
Let's open it next door
so you don't have to go anywhere.

798
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,875
Are you full?

799
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,083
-Honey?
-Yes?

800
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:56,333
-Can we discuss Boss's future?
-Sure.

801
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,916
Where does he want to go?

802
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,583
Maybe Sydney.

803
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:03,083
The school fees are reasonable.

804
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:05,250
Miss Tak is so beautiful.

805
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:07,416
Are you protective of your sister?

806
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,875
I never said I wanted to go.

807
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:21,208
Don't be afraid.

808
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,541
You can take a language course first.

809
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,875
See if you like it there.

810
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:26,916
Give it a try.

811
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,208
Don't make him go if he doesn't want to.

812
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,500
Looks like he's happy
enjoying free stuff at the bar.

813
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:37,000
Aren't you? Is she tasty?

814
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:42,750
Let me have a sip, will you?

815
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,041
Actually she's not my sister.

816
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,708
She's my mother.

817
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,375
Go back to your room.

818
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:18,250
It's fucking weird.

819
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,375
Suddenly my mom turned into ''my sister''.

820
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,833
She wants me to study abroad.

821
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,958
She says it's for my own good.

822
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,083
But she just wants to get rid of me.

823
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,583
If I were you, I would leave.

824
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,166
Look at this shitty town…

825
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,041
I grew up here,

826
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,500
but I hate it.

827
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,208
So if I had a choice,

828
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:28,625
I'd leave.

829
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,875
I don't like it here either.

830
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,583
I just want to be with you.

831
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:10,625
Remember what I told you about going
to work in New York like my dad?

832
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:15,083
Yeah.

833
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,666
What if I told you I've been saving up.

834
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,125
Go.

835
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,333
I'll ask my mom to send me
to school in New York.

836
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:45,833
It's huge!

837
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:51,125
Your mom really got this place for us?

838
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:53,750
-Like it?
-I love it.

839
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,083
You're messing up my hair.

840
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,416
Here's our bar.

841
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,000
Sorry.

842
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,916
Here comes your favorite.

843
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,958
Yes!

844
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:28,791
Only Thai restaurants hire Thai people
without work permits.

845
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,291
-I see. Thank you.
-All right.

846
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,958
I haven't seen Prim in like…

847
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,250
ten years.

848
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:40,041
We lost touch.

849
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:47,208
Actually, I…

850
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,541
I didn't just want to see you.

851
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,833
I also wanted to return something to you.

852
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,500
I wanted to return Prim to you.

853
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:26,250
It's rare to see a clear sky
in the monsoon season.

854
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:31,000
You can change the station if you like.

855
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:32,500
No, it's okay.

856
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:35,916
Hey.

857
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:39,500
-Prim?
-Yes.

858
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:43,208
You like this show?

859
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,166
Yes, you too?

860
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,250
-No one listens to it.
-True.

861
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:55,041
None of my friends do,
and my boyfriend says it's boring.

862
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:57,916
It's for old people.

863
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,416
-Yeah.
-So I'm surprised you like it.

864
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,875
My mother liked it back home, that's why.

865
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,750
What's your name again?

866
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,375
-Aood.
-Right.

867
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,333
-Sorry I forgot it.
-No problem.

868
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,500
Anyway,

869
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,625
I still believe

870
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:23,958
that good things will come
to those who have patience.

871
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,833
We just have to keep our hopes up.

872
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,250
Because…

873
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,916
"Time Is On My Side."

874
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,375
Get hot sauce from the bar.

875
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:56,125
-A soda for this table.
-Okay.

876
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:58,875
Americans eat lots of carbs
but not enough vegetables.

877
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,375
I was always constipated
when I first got here.

878
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,458
You sweep here and the dust goes there.

879
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:06,750
There is no way you can
make it completely clean.

880
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:12,333
Aood.

881
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,041
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

882
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:18,958
Aood, let me out.

883
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,041
Aood! I'm getting mad!

884
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:23,750
-Give me five bucks.
-Go buy new shoes.

885
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,791
Okay, quick.

886
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:39,083
-Shooting a music video?
-It's my first snow.

887
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,583
See you.

888
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,666
Prim!

889
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:59,000
Gotta go home right now?

890
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:01,666
Sort of.

891
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,375
Let's go check out a bar.

892
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:07,458
-Which bar?
-My friend's bar.

893
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:10,875
It's brand new.
He's looking for a bartender.

894
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,708
Interested?

895
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:24,833
Neat. Nice balance.

896
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:28,791
Great, come work for me.

897
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,666
Are you kidding me?

898
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,416
Come every night,

899
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,875
and when you get better,
I'll enter you into a Vegas competition.

900
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:41,625
That's great.

901
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,750
-But you have to come every night.
-Absolutely.

902
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,333
-Don't get bored of me first!
-I won't.

903
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,458
Why didn't you answer my calls?

904
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,125
I called a hundred times.

905
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,083
I didn't hear it.

906
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:10,250
-I was worried.
-Why didn't you wait at home?

907
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:18,833
I've got a job. I'm working my way
to becoming a real bartender.

908
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:22,708
Coming home late is part of the job!

909
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:24,791
We hardly spend time together.

910
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,583
I have time for you on my days off.

911
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,916
Aren't you asking too much of me?

912
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,458
Why don't you do something
useful for yourself?

913
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:02,375
What are you doing here? I'll get scolded.

914
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:10,541
That's my order. I'm a customer here.

915
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,041
We only have beer.

916
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,416
-Want it?
-Yes.

917
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:27,333
-Something to eat?
-No.

918
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,958
My shift ends late.

919
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:34,083
-And I have to work at Joe's after this.
-I can wait.

920
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:06,875
Hey.

921
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,250
What the hell are you doing?

922
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,125
Drinking beer, obviously.

923
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,833
Chugging it down like that?

924
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:14,916
-How else?
-Don't make a scene.

925
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,083
With a straw?

926
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Boss!

927
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:19,458
You'll get me into trouble.

928
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,500
What do you want?

929
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:26,750
-No.
-Get me another one.

930
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:28,375
-No.
-I'm a customer.

931
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:36,416
What's your problem?

932
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,625
My problem?

933
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:45,875
My problem is why the hell do you have
that much money in your savings?

934
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,666
I found the bank slip in the trash.

935
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,750
So I came to see what kind of work
you do to bring in that much.

936
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,583
-Does this restaurant pay that well?
-Hey.

937
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:55,541
-Who should I ask?
-Let's talk outside.

938
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:57,541
Hey you.

939
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:00,541
Do you get huge tips here?

940
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:03,833
-Do you?
-Let's talk.

941
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:14,166
We're outside, so talk.

942
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:16,125
Talk.

943
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:20,625
Go on.

944
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:25,125
You've saved up over million baht
just from working here?

945
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:26,708
What's that supposed to mean?

946
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:28,208
What do you think I mean?

947
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,208
I don't know what the fuck you mean!

948
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:35,333
Exactly, I don't know either.

949
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:39,500
I have no idea what kind of work
my girlfriend is doing.

950
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:42,416
Shaking drinks alone
won't bring in this much.

951
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,541
What are you implying?

952
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,458
Say it. How did you get the money?

953
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,583
Cat got your tongue?

954
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,958
-You want me to guess?
-Please…

955
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:57,708
You want me to guess what you've done?

956
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:59,666
-No.
-You like that?

957
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,291
-Please listen!
-Listen to what?

958
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,625
We never used to have any secrets.

959
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:10,500
I'm not trying to hide it from you,
but please…

960
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,333
Why do I have to squeeze it out of you?

961
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:17,208
You want me to be like this?

962
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:21,625
Be honest with me.

963
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,500
Where did you get the money?

964
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:41,208
I got it from your mom.

965
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,208
I'm sorry.

966
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:52,250
I can explain.

967
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:57,291
She asked me to bring you here.
I thought it'd be a win-win for everyone.

968
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,166
This way we could
have a new life together.

969
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,250
You're just another greedy bitch.

970
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:05,375
-You know I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

971
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:08,208
-I really love you.
-Love me?

972
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:10,000
Then why are you doing this?

973
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,458
Do you think I could have
afforded it by myself?

974
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:16,875
Okay.

975
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,791
You got money from my mother.

976
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,375
That means you're working for me too.

977
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,416
So this is what I want you to do.

978
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:32,125
Quit all your fucking jobs.

979
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:35,375
From now on your job is to make
drinks for me. And only me.

980
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,958
-Got it?
-Are you nuts?

981
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:40,166
I can't, I have to work
to pay your mom back.

982
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:43,750
If you can't do that, you're fired.

983
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:47,375
And I don't want to see you again.

984
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,958
Fine. Let's break up then.

985
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,000
-You okay?
-Yeah.

986
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:43,916
Air freshener, in case my bed stinks.

987
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:49,750
So what's your plan?

988
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:01,083
Could you tell the manager
I'm taking a month off?

989
01:34:03,916 --> 01:34:05,000
Why?

990
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:08,000
I need to focus on the Vegas competition.

991
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:11,958
Sure.

992
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:15,666
I'll talk to her about
covering your shifts.

993
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:18,333
One more thing.

994
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:22,166
Could I crash here for a while?

995
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,791
If you and your friends wouldn't mind.

996
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:29,875
They won't mind, I'm sure.

997
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:36,000
Thank you.

998
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:45,416
I'm off to bed.

999
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,375
-Get some sleep.
-Okay.

1000
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:49,458
Good night.

1001
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:12,375
So when will you propose to her?

1002
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:15,416
-When I have enough money.
-No need.

1003
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,458
That's not good, man.

1004
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,333
Did you know they're
bumping up the rent next month?

1005
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:32,333
-Can I leave now?
-What's wrong?

1006
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,125
I'm not feeling well.

1007
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,250
Prim!

1008
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,666
Why are you back early?

1009
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,041
It was a slow night, so they let me leave.

1010
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,250
-What time is your flight?
-2 a.m.

1011
01:35:57,916 --> 01:35:59,916
Then you must leave around midnight.

1012
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,083
Wow!

1013
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:03,250
-Don't tease me.
-Red-cheeked girl!

1014
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,625
Stop it!

1015
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,125
-Got room in your bag?
-Why?

1016
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:16,333
What's that?

1017
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:18,916
Shit.

1018
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:25,083
-Do you know this brand?
-Of course, you do too?

1019
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:28,416
Joe told me Japanese shakers
are better than American ones.

1020
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,041
-True.
-So I bought one for you.

1021
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,250
For me?

1022
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:34,500
What's the occasion?

1023
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,791
It's Vegas, right?

1024
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:40,750
You need a decent shaker.

1025
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:44,041
In case you make it to the final round.

1026
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,291
Do you like it?

1027
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,208
Fancy.

1028
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,583
I'll finish this, then go.

1029
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:05,666
Don't get drunk.

1030
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:10,916
I'm really happy for you.

1031
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:13,000
For what?

1032
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,875
You have a dream and you're going for it.

1033
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:18,625
That's cool.

1034
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:22,625
You're a sentimental drunk.

1035
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:25,250
I'm not being sentimental.

1036
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:29,208
-Look at me.
-Why?

1037
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:30,750
I have nothing.

1038
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:33,916
-No dreams, no passion.
-Not true.

1039
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,916
It's true.

1040
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:40,666
You're a selfless person.

1041
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,416
And you make people around you happy.

1042
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,666
Like how you work hard
and save up for your father.

1043
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:50,750
I'm happy when I'm with you.

1044
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:54,375
Really?

1045
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:02,708
Happier than when you were with Boss?

1046
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:18,625
Aood…

1047
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:22,333
You…

1048
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,458
What?

1049
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,583
Are you okay?

1050
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:32,875
Look…

1051
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:36,916
No.

1052
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:43,125
I still love Boss and I need more time.

1053
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:50,833
You moved in here and slept on my bed.
What's that all about?

1054
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:54,916
Because I thought you were my friend.

1055
01:38:57,041 --> 01:38:58,666
-Wait.
-So you're not my friend?

1056
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:02,458
-Of course I am.
-Right.

1057
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:05,083
But I have feelings for you.

1058
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:08,833
Don't tell me you didn't know that.

1059
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,041
Let me ask you something.

1060
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:16,916
You're still in love with Boss.
How is he better than me?

1061
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:21,833
You broke up with him
over a month ago now.

1062
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,083
Boss and I have
gone through a lot together.

1063
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:26,791
But you already broke up with him!

1064
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:29,958
He's not a bad person.

1065
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:32,250
I'm not saying he's a bad person.

1066
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,875
I'm not.

1067
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:38,250
I'm asking in what way
is he better than me?

1068
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,458
You're just not him.

1069
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:19,416
I have to go.

1070
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,958
Not yet.

1071
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:26,083
I'm not him?
Because he's rich and I'm not?

1072
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:30,083
Because I'm poor
and I live in a fucking basement?

1073
01:40:30,166 --> 01:40:32,208
How could you say that to me?

1074
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,500
Why can't I?

1075
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:37,208
Didn't you tell me his mom
paid you to come here?

1076
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:41,333
-The whole restaurant knows!
-Stay out of this!

1077
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:43,083
I won't stay out of this!

1078
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:45,750
I've supported you in every way.

1079
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,333
-I took you to Joe…
-And I'm grateful.

1080
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:49,666
and he is sending you to Vegas.

1081
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:50,625
-You are?
-Yes, I am.

1082
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:52,083
I thought we were friends.

1083
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:54,500
Friends are supposed to help each other.

1084
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,583
If you need help, I'll be there.

1085
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,708
I know you have feelings for me.

1086
01:40:59,791 --> 01:41:03,000
Don't tell me I'm just a friend. It hurts.

1087
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,625
You do have feelings for me.

1088
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,666
Take me to Prim.

1089
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:13,791
I want to apologize to her.

1090
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:21,083
Should I tell you this?

1091
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:25,083
You do have feelings for me.

1092
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:28,750
If you don't, just say it to my face.

1093
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,125
I don't have feelings for you.

1094
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,208
What is it?

1095
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:54,083
Prim has a new boyfriend.

1096
01:41:57,791 --> 01:41:59,166
Some white guy.

1097
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:07,541
They are very much in love.

1098
01:42:14,291 --> 01:42:17,000
-Fuck you, Aood.
-I bought it for you.

1099
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:18,625
It's fucking expensive.

1100
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:21,125
Take it with you.

1101
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,708
Prim left with him this morning.

1102
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:27,625
They moved to another state.

1103
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:33,166
I'm sorry.

1104
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:48,375
The truth is…

1105
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,541
Prim didn't have a new boyfriend.

1106
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,833
But she did…

1107
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,333
move to another state.

1108
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:01,291
To train for the bartending competition.

1109
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:04,875
It's illegal to drink on the sidewalk.

1110
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:07,750
I didn't really know you at the time.

1111
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,333
I wasn't even your friend,
so I lied to you.

1112
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:29,291
Give it back.

1113
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:45,875
Give it back.

1114
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:51,375
My watch.

1115
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,583
I said give it back!

1116
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:36,250
Then you thanked me
by inviting me to stay with you.

1117
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:53,083
If I'd had a conscience,

1118
01:45:53,791 --> 01:45:55,208
I would've said no.

1119
01:45:56,333 --> 01:45:57,208
Hello.

1120
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:58,791
There's a room…

1121
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:01,375
We're pals now, right?

1122
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:03,625
-Yeah.
-This is your room, dude.

1123
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:05,833
The living room, the kitchen…

1124
01:46:08,166 --> 01:46:11,958
I wanted to know what it was like
to live like a boss like you.

1125
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,791
-Why did you come to New York?
-I just came.

1126
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,791
I thought it'd be better than this.

1127
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,250
Still want me here?

1128
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,125
I told you I am going back.

1129
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:43,250
I don't know what you're thinking.

1130
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:49,291
But I want you to know
that you're so lucky to have all of this.

1131
01:46:49,375 --> 01:46:50,625
Nope.

1132
01:46:56,833 --> 01:46:59,750
No mother wants to push her child away.

1133
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:02,583
Never.

1134
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:10,958
Prim returned all my money.

1135
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:18,000
You have a great life. Make it count.

1136
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:29,750
My dad had a classic car.

1137
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:33,958
I told him to sell it
so he could buy me a plane ticket.

1138
01:47:35,125 --> 01:47:39,958
He said no. I was so desperate
because my dad didn't give me any money.

1139
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:41,458
As days and weeks passed,

1140
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:46,750
seeing you waste your life away,

1141
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:51,625
I was dying to confess everything to you.

1142
01:47:52,875 --> 01:47:54,291
But I'm such a coward.

1143
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:59,458
I kept telling myself
that you were doing great.

1144
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:05,750
Until one day, she came back to New York.

1145
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:15,333
Joe told me she asked
to work at the bar for a week.

1146
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:19,166
At first I wanted to tell you.

1147
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:24,125
But then I thought you didn't deserve her,

1148
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,666
so I never said a word.

1149
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,208
I was a real asshole back then.

1150
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,333
Now I want to bring you back to Prim.

1151
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:35,625
Boss, listen to me.

1152
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:41,625
All this time I tried to find
someone to replace Prim.

1153
01:49:44,583 --> 01:49:47,750
Now that I don't have much time left,
I want to say sorry to everyone.

1154
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,916
Most of all, to you.

1155
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:58,666
And your way of saying sorry

1156
01:49:59,666 --> 01:50:01,750
is to drag me halfway across the world

1157
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:04,750
-to listen to all this crap?
-I wanted to tell you face-to-face

1158
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:07,333
that your life's gone off the rails

1159
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,458
-because of what I did to you.
-What?

1160
01:50:12,208 --> 01:50:14,041
What's wrong with wasting my life away?

1161
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,458
It's my fucking life!

1162
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,000
It's none of your fucking business.

1163
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:24,250
I'm happy like this.

1164
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:26,541
I don't need anyone, asshole.

1165
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:30,000
You need Prim.

1166
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,666
Am I right?

1167
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:43,750
-I want to return Prim to you.
-What the fuck does ''return'' mean?

1168
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:46,916
She's a person, not a bag.

1169
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,458
Fuck you.

1170
01:50:50,333 --> 01:50:51,875
I'm going to tell you straight up.

1171
01:50:53,875 --> 01:50:55,708
All these shitty things happen

1172
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:59,416
because you're dying,

1173
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:02,416
and you're desperate to find an excuse

1174
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:06,541
to force your way back
into everyone's life.

1175
01:51:07,916 --> 01:51:10,541
You lugged yourself
all over to see your exes,

1176
01:51:10,625 --> 01:51:13,083
so you could open up their wounds
and make them worse.

1177
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:15,291
You're hurting everyone.

1178
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:19,916
You're so fucking selfish.

1179
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:28,041
I'm sorry, pal.

1180
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:30,458
Pal?

1181
01:51:35,416 --> 01:51:37,083
Why did you do all of this to me?

1182
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:46,333
I did it because…

1183
01:51:51,083 --> 01:51:52,416
I envied you.

1184
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,416
I wanted to be you.

1185
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:12,916
-Prim's waiting for you.
-Get out.

1186
01:52:16,583 --> 01:52:17,916
Get out.

1187
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:28,000
I'll leave it here.

1188
01:52:51,916 --> 01:52:54,791
The waiter told me you're a nasty drunk.

1189
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:58,041
Three months, man.

1190
01:52:58,125 --> 01:52:59,708
Three months.

1191
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:01,833
Prim.

1192
01:53:01,916 --> 01:53:04,083
He's on his way to see you.

1193
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:09,875
Hey…

1194
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,875
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1195
01:53:22,625 --> 01:53:24,250
See you around.

1196
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:33,375
AIRPORT

1197
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,375
Why are you here?

1198
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:38,333
Poom sent you to collect his debt?

1199
01:54:40,333 --> 01:54:42,500
You shouldn't worry,
just look at the crowd.

1200
01:54:43,166 --> 01:54:44,791
Fix me something, son.

1201
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:48,583
What do you fancy?

1202
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:50,750
I don't know.

1203
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:55,458
-Whatever you think I'll like.

1204
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,416
You're talented.

1205
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,041
There you go.

1206
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,250
What's it called?

1207
01:55:17,416 --> 01:55:19,083
I don't have cancer.

1208
01:55:26,583 --> 01:55:28,458
You can still enjoy the drink anyway.

1209
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:34,291
It's new. I came up with it recently.

1210
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:36,833
You'll be the first to try it.

1211
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,041
Do me this favor.

1212
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:57,958
It's bitter.

1213
01:56:06,083 --> 01:56:07,625
I'm sorry about Aood.

1214
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,125
Before he died, he came to see me.

1215
01:56:14,916 --> 01:56:16,375
He asked me to give you this.

1216
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:22,958
Poom will take over my job soon.

1217
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:26,208
If you need a bookkeeper,

1218
01:56:27,291 --> 01:56:28,708
I'm good with numbers.

1219
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:30,583
I can come work for you.

1220
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:35,291
I'm glad you came.

1221
01:56:37,458 --> 01:56:38,583
I'm thinking…

1222
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:40,458
I'll close down the bar.

1223
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:42,458
I've turned around the loss.

1224
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:46,333
If Poom wants to turn this place
into something else, fine.

1225
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:52,166
The drink's on me.

1226
01:56:55,416 --> 01:56:57,041
We're even now.

1227
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:01,541
I'm sorry.

1228
01:57:10,708 --> 01:57:12,041
I'm sorry.

1229
01:57:26,458 --> 01:57:29,166
Now start dressing like you're the boss.

1230
01:57:54,625 --> 01:57:57,750
LISTEN TO THIS, MY MAN.

1231
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:09,083
Hello there,
my die-hard fan in New York City.

1232
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:11,750
This is DJ Aood speaking.

1233
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:16,166
This is my first and final show.

1234
01:58:17,375 --> 01:58:19,666
Exclusively for you, Mr. Boss.

1235
01:58:22,958 --> 01:58:24,125
Thank you.

1236
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:26,833
Thank you, sincerely,

1237
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,625
for giving me a chance
to have a taste of your life.

1238
01:58:42,125 --> 01:58:43,208
One more thing.

1239
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:46,166
I want to thank you again

1240
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,458
for always being by my side.

1241
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:56,833
And I… want to say I'm sorry

1242
01:58:56,916 --> 01:58:58,041
for hurting you.

1243
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:02,833
I'm sorry for…

1244
01:59:02,916 --> 01:59:04,291
hurting everyone.

1245
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:15,833
I deserve to die alone.

1246
01:59:39,458 --> 01:59:40,625
But wait…

1247
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:43,791
I'm not giving up so easily.

1248
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:51,583
The new soap series
Hostage of the Heart has begun filming.

1249
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:55,041
Producer Lek Sitthiwong
is giving the audience a treat

1250
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:58,875
by unveiling his new star, Nunar Montarat.

1251
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:05,750
Nunar, this is your first TV drama.
Any acting tips to share?

1252
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:11,250
Like they say, good acting
comes from bad experiences.

1253
02:00:12,583 --> 02:00:18,458
So I have to thank everything and everyone

1254
02:00:18,541 --> 02:00:20,916
that came into my life.

1255
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,125
You know what,

1256
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:26,166
I've given myself a new mission.

1257
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,208
I'm going back to do chemo.

1258
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:41,125
The thing is,

1259
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:44,375
I've got to get back on my feet…

1260
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:48,916
Daddy!

1261
02:00:49,791 --> 02:00:52,291
…so I might have a chance
to redeem myself

1262
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:55,208
and to start over.

1263
02:01:02,416 --> 02:01:04,625
-Checking out?
-Yes.

1264
02:01:04,708 --> 02:01:06,333
Boss left this for you.

1265
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:29,125
And this is super-important…

1266
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:32,458
I might get to go to New York again,

1267
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:41,666
and drag you back to see Prim.

1268
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:22,875
Hi there.

1269
02:02:51,041 --> 02:02:52,166
I'll have my usual.

1270
02:02:53,583 --> 02:02:55,291
New York Sour, please.

1271
02:03:05,916 --> 02:03:07,291
Want to see my ID?

1272
02:03:19,375 --> 02:03:20,750
Coming right up.

1273
02:03:37,208 --> 02:03:38,541
When the time comes

1274
02:03:44,916 --> 02:03:46,791
and when you're ready to forgive me,

1275
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:58,208
I'll be the one driving you.
