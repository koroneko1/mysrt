‎My good old friend Bob!
‎How wonderful to see you!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.700
‎And you've brought
‎little Xavier Yves with you, too!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.900
‎Uh, my peeps call me XY,
‎if you don't mind, Mr Mayor.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.940
‎-Xavier Yves sounds way too--
‎-XY! Of course! Famous DJ XY!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.220
‎Ha, ha! It's an honour for the Palace
‎to receive such a fantastic artist

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.100
‎-and his father!
‎-Does that mean dinner's on the house?

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.220
‎Uh...

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.300
‎Ha, ha, ha! I'm joking!

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.060
‎Ha, ha, ha! You're too much, Bob!
‎Always the comedian!

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.460
‎Enjoy your meal. Bon appétit!

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.500
‎Eh! I tried. OK. We need to talk about

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.980
‎this special TV appearance
‎you'll be making.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.540
‎This'll be a major
‎promotional event for you.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.740
‎Got any new material to premiere?
‎New ideas?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.540
‎Course not, Dad.
‎You know I never have any ideas.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.420
‎So, let me hear what you've ripped--

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.460
‎I mean,
‎what you've come up with this year!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.780
‎Isn't it a bit similar
‎to what you were doing last year?

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.940
‎Oh, yeah. I guess I ripped off
‎my own music! Ha, ha, ha!

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.700
‎Ha, ha! Never mind.
‎No one will know the difference.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.420
‎Image is king!
‎What kind of visuals you got going?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.340
‎-Any concepts?
‎-Any what?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.220
‎Forget it. I'll use the same plan
‎that's made me the rich man I am today.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.140
‎If you're short on great ideas,
‎"borrow" someone else's!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.580
<i>‎We're looking for new talent.</i>

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.820
<i>‎Stunning musical</i>
<i>‎and visual skills are a must,</i>

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.540
<i>‎with a brand new style</i>
<i>‎that everyone will die for!</i>

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.060
<i>‎You have two weeks</i>
<i>‎to send in your videos!</i>

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.620
‎It's an opportunity
‎to showcase Kitty Section!

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.460
‎And the stage clothes you designed,
‎Marinette!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.740
‎If we all pitch in,
‎two weeks is enough time

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.980
‎-to make an awesome video! Everyone in?
‎-Here we go!

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.780
‎Kitty Section!

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660
‎Wow! This is so awesome.
‎We're so in the moment!

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.700
‎The song's fun and totally sincere.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.340
‎Hey, Marinette!
‎Still no news about the contest?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420
‎Maybe they didn't like our song.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.420
‎They must have received a ton of videos.
‎They probably haven't made their pick yet.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.020
‎Uh-oh! You'd better
‎take a look at this, guys.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.860
‎Oh!

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.700
<i>‎Wow! Loving the new look, XY!</i>

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.900
<i>‎You've really outdone yourself this time!</i>

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.060
<i>‎How did you come up with a style</i>
<i>‎that's so... original?</i>

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.860
<i>‎-It's all in here!</i>
‎-But that's our original style!

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.860
‎Your unicorn and your masks!

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.100
‎That's your melody! It's your music!
‎That's not fair!

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.820
‎That should be you guys up there on TV!
‎There'd better be a good explanation!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.420
‎We have to have it out
‎with Bob Roth and XY!

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.940
‎-They're not here right now.
‎-Seriously?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.780
‎-They're on the live screen!
‎-You're not allowed in.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.060
‎You're not invited
‎and the show's started.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.460
‎-But it's our show!
‎-Not our problem, Miss.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.100
‎Aaah! Help! Our friend's been akumatised

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.420
‎and Ladybug and Cat Noir
‎aren't here to save us! Quick!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.980
‎Stop messing around, kids,
‎it's not gonna work.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.580
‎We've got work to do. So get outta here
‎and go watch the show at home!

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.740
‎Wow! Awesome, XY!
‎Such a 180 from your last record.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.220
‎This might be your best yet!
‎So, tell me,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.460
‎where did you get the inspiration
‎for all this?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.340
‎Oh, it's nothing really. I came up
‎with that whole song within five minutes.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.540
‎He couldn't even sing it
‎the way it's supposed to be sung!

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.580
‎And his mask isn't even a good rip-off!

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.060
‎ Mr Roth!
‎My name's Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.020
‎I sent you the Kitty Section video.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.460
‎Video? What video? I don't know
‎what you're talking about, kid.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.220
‎Maybe I can jog your memory. Look!
‎The costumes, the masks,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.180
‎the music, the moves... all the same!

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.140
‎There's no comparison!
‎This here is some amateur garage band.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.660
‎My son is a solo artist. You guys play
‎instruments. His music is all digital.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.060
‎Our unicorn is much cooler
‎and our masks are nothing like yours.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.620
‎That's not true!
‎You copied Marinette's costumes!

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.220
‎And it's the exact same song!
‎You stole Luka's music!

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.820
‎Oh, come on! Let's not exaggerate now.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.980
‎We may have just been a little bit...
‎inspired, that's all.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.580
‎Inspired? You flat out stole!

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.060
‎You didn't design this mask,
‎Marinette did!

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.820
‎Listen,
‎it's not too late to do the right thing.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.820
‎Just tell the truth
‎and let Kitty Section appear on the show.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.340
‎-That's all we're asking.
‎-Yeah.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.140
‎First they'll want to be in the show,
‎then they'll want a cut of the profits!

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.980
‎No way!
‎Never saw or heard of Kitten Division!

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.860
‎Forget it, Marinette. It's no big deal.
‎Let's just go.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.820
‎No! It's not fair! I won't stand by
‎and let my friends' work get stolen.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.380
‎If you won't tell the truth, then I will.
‎Right now, on the air, live!

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.220
‎If you do that, I'll tell them
‎you're the copycats, not me!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.780
‎I've got all of the music biz
‎eating out of my hand.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.860
‎So who do you think they're gonna
‎believe? Me or a group of nobodies?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.460
‎You'll never have a future
‎in this business!

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.220
‎You'll never make another costume!

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.860
‎And there'll be no more music
‎for your buddies!

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.260
‎Because as far as everyone's concerned,
‎you'll be the rip-off artists!

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.260
‎Ah! I'm detecting the echo
‎of a very rare emotion,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.060
‎the anger of a creator
‎whose work has been stolen,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.340
‎who also cannot bear to see
‎the one he loves suffer.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.260
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise this pure soul!

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.940
‎Ha, ha! Not quite so cocky now, are we?

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.780
‎Silencer! I am Hawk Moth.
‎This man is the voice of evil.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.820
‎I'm giving you the power
‎to silence him for good.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.300
‎All I ask of you in return
‎are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.380
‎Do we have an agreement, Silencer?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.860
‎I'll take your silence as a "Yes."

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.260
‎Do you have any idea how much work
‎it took me to copy your costumes?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.780
‎Shh.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.180
‎-I'm the best! I'm famous!
‎-Aaah!

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.020
‎-I'm the best!
‎-What's that?

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.700
‎Don't worry, Marinette.
‎I'd never hurt you.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.260
‎I will use the power Hawk Moth
‎has given me to restore justice.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.900
‎I will force Bob Roth to admit what
‎he has done to you and Kitty Section.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.100
‎Don't do that, Luka!
‎That's revenge, not justice!

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.220
‎And if you team up with Hawk Moth,
‎you'll have to face Cat Noir and Ladybug.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.140
‎Cat Noir and Ladybug?
‎Where were they when we needed them?

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.980
‎As of now, Silencer is laying down
‎the Law of Silence!

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.940
‎You're the most extraordinary girl,
‎Marinette. As clear as a musical note,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.820
‎and as sincere as a melody.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.540
‎You are the music that's been playing
‎inside my head since the day we met.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.660
‎I won't let anything happen to you.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.620
‎Wh... wh... what?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.380
‎Did that sound like a declaration of love?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.100
‎I think so. Which is kinda weird,
‎coming from a villain!

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.980
‎-Perhaps Luka feels the same way!
‎-Do you think?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.060
‎Stay focused, Marinette!

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.900
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.340
‎Ha!

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.740
‎You can't get away from me, Bob Roth!
‎I'll make you tell the truth, live on TV!

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.500
‎Don't touch me! I'm well-connected!

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.140
‎One call to Mr Bourgeois
‎and he'll bring the police for me,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.940
‎-the whole army if he has to!
‎-Shh!

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.660
‎I can't let you do this, Silencer.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.220
‎And about time too!

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.820
‎What are you waiting for? Get to work!

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.020
‎Listen, Luka... uh, Silencer!
‎You don't know what you're doing!

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.420
‎Hawk Moth is evil! You think
‎you're doing good, but you're wrong!

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.380
‎Oh, come on!
‎Stop mincing around and protect me!

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.460
‎No more evil-doing for you, akuma!

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.660
‎Sorry, Ladybug! Occupational hazard,
‎I guess! No hard feelings! Bye!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.780
‎You shouldn't have stood in my way,
‎Ladybug!

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.420
‎No lucky charm this time, Ladybug!

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.300
‎You'd need your voice for that.
‎And I'm the one who's got it!

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.980
‎You can run, Ladybug,
‎but you can't get away from me for long!

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.540
‎Don't let her escape you, Silencer!
‎She's vulnerable!

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.740
‎Don't worry, Hawk Moth.
‎Now that I've got Ladybug's voice,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.780
‎I have a plan to get hold
‎of her and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.100
‎But first, revenge!

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.500
‎-Adrien, come see this!
‎-What is it?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.580
‎Ladybug?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.740
‎Looks like we've got a problem.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.460
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.820
‎Miaow! Milady sent me some messages!
‎I bet she misses me!

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.820
‎Where are you hiding, Bob Roth?
‎You're definitely good at hiding.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.380
‎But you won't get away from me.
‎I've got plans for you, too.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.980
‎I'm right here, Milady.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.020
‎Uh... I'm here now,
‎so go ahead and fill me in!

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.980
‎Ah! Of course!
‎I should have thought of that.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.540
‎Hey! That's not very nice!

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.580
‎You're right! We'll get your voice back
‎and talk ourselves out of this mess!

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.620
‎I don't wanna be catty,
‎but I don't know what you mean.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.700
‎"We've got a major problem.
‎I can't call out my Lucky Charm

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.220
‎or say "Miraculous Ladybug.""
‎Ah, you've definitely got a point there!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.700
‎The magic ladybugs won't be able to fix up
‎all the damage caused by Silencer!

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.100
‎And you can't say
‎the detransformation words,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.060
‎which means you'll be a mute
‎Ladybug for the rest of your life?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.660
‎But it has its advantages, in a way.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.140
‎Now you'll never be able
‎to pick on my jokes!

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.620
‎I'm kidding, Milady! Don't worry!
‎You always get us out of the worst fixes!

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.940
‎Meanwhile, I'll be able to babble
‎to my heart's content!

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.740
‎Get away from me, you filthy critters!

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.900
‎André! André, it's me!
‎I need you to send in the troops!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.660
<i>‎No problem, Bob. I'll take care of it.</i>
<i>‎Where are you?</i>

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.660
‎The one place in Paris you've probably
‎never stepped foot in, the sewers!

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.140
‎Don't worry.
‎I'll send the police in right away!

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.580
‎Mayor Bourgeois here.
‎Get me Officer Roger.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.980
‎Maybe I could imitate your voice.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.740
‎Lucky Charm! Lucky Charm!
‎Lucky Charm! Lucky Charm!

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.460
‎Uh... Yeah, OK. I'll shut up now.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.340
‎Uh... cat got your tongue?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.220
‎No. A night at the opera?

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.340
‎You want to make Silencer
‎say "Lucky Charm"

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.180
‎with the voice he stole from you.
‎Very smart!

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.940
‎Now let's hear how you're gonna do that!

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.620
‎Don't even think about it.
‎It'll never work!

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.740
‎You're right, though.
‎We don't have much of a choice.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.980
‎Thank you, Officer Roger. Thanks for
‎looking out for your fellow citizens.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.060
‎-Mr Roth, you are under arrest.
‎-What?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.140
‎This is a big misunderstanding!

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.060
‎-Where are you taking me?
‎-Mayor's orders.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.740
‎Mr Bourgeois and I have been friends
‎for a very long time, and--

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.860
‎Yes, we're nearly there, Mr Mayor.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.940
‎-Thank you, officer!
‎-Who are you?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.220
‎Shh!

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.020
‎At your command, Mr Mayor. What
‎I wouldn't give for another croissant!

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.980
‎-No! Let me go!
‎-I can take your voice, Bob Roth,

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.980
‎and make you say whatever I please.
‎But that's not what I want.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.140
‎I want you to admit
‎what you did to Marinette and her friends

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.700
‎-with your own voice!
‎-Never! I'd rather be silent!

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.100
‎You really think I can't make you?
‎Listen, I can ruin your reputation,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.860
‎just like you threatened to do.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.020
‎Everyone in showbiz knows me.
‎I'll make sure you lose

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.700
‎-every one of your friends.
‎-I'll put you in prison!

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.180
‎I'll never sing for you, Dad!

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.420
‎You'll never make
‎another dime from my music!

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.700
‎We'll make your life a nightmare,
‎Bob Roth!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.220
‎Wait, stop! OK!
‎I'll do it! I'll tell the truth!

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.340
<i>‎Dear viewers. We're back on the air</i>
<i>‎for an exclusive interview with Bob Roth.</i>

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.420
‎Wait, Milady. It might be too early
‎to pull off your crazy plan.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.540
‎We could wait for Bob Roth
‎to tell the truth.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.180
‎Then justice would be served
‎for Kitty Section.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.540
‎"It would be revenge, not justice.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.460
‎And being coerced
‎into telling the truth is meaningless."

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.500
‎You're right, Milady. You're not much fun,
‎but you do have a point! We must save him!

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.300
‎Come on!
‎We've got all the time in the world.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.940
‎-We might as well have fun.
‎-Keep your nose out of things,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.260
‎-or I'll silence you!
‎-That would be a shame. I'm hilarious.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.420
‎Where did he go?

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.380
‎You'll have to do better than that,
‎Ladybug,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.500
‎if you're gonna defeat this supervillain.
‎Isn't that you and Cat Noir's job?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.100
‎This is all that band's fault,
‎those Kitty Whatchamacallits.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:52.180
‎This wouldn't have happened if they'd
‎not made such a fuss about their ideas!

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.540
‎Oh, no! I can't find Ladybug anywhere!

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.940
‎How will I ever
‎get out of this mess without her?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.260
‎Cat Noir, I'm over here!

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.500
‎Milady! If you've gotten your voice
‎back, then you've defeated Silencer!

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.820
‎-It's safe to come and find you!
‎-Yes, yes! There's no danger now!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.980
‎Meet me outside the studio!
‎I'll wait!

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.420
‎OK! I'm coming.
‎I'll meet you outside the studio door!

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.180
‎You've got to be
‎the dumbest superheroes ever!

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.100
‎How could you let him in on your plan?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.260
‎And what's with this fake Lucky Charm?

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.580
‎I thought it was supposed to be magic,

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.860
‎but it's actually
‎just some crafty special effects!

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.980
‎You took your time!
‎Did something hold you up?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.220
‎Ha, ha! You thought you had us,
‎didn't you, Silencer?

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.220
‎But you're wrong!
‎Ladybug still has her superpowers!

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.580
‎That's impossible!
‎I took your voice from you!

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.140
‎How could you possibly
‎have summoned up your Lucky Charm?

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.940
‎I don't see how this is gonna work
‎better than a lamp,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.300
‎but at least you got yourself
‎a real Lucky Charm!

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.340
‎I'm warning you,
‎you haven't heard the last from Ladybug!

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.620
‎Catch this, Milady!

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.460
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.180
‎You don't scare me. Cats have nine lives!

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.900
‎-We've gone Gold again, Dad!
‎-At your command, Mr Bourgeois!

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.900
‎-I'm asking you to stop! Lucky Charm!
‎-Cataclysm!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.260
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.660
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.260
‎Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.380
‎You're right.
‎This does have its advantages.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.460
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.260
‎Give us back our voices!

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.860
‎Ah! Much better!

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.740
‎-What happened?
‎-You were akumatised,

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.420
‎but everything's fine now.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.260
‎This is outrageous, Ladybug! You tied me
‎up and imprisoned me in a dressing room!

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.820
‎Me? I did that?
‎That doesn't sound like me at all!

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.820
‎The ladybug and cat got you!
‎Serves you right! What did you think, kid?

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.660
‎That I was gonna tell the truth?

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.340
‎That I stole Kitty Section's song
‎and your girlfriend's costumes,

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.900
‎so I could give them
‎to my talentless son? Huh?

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.660
‎You didn't think that superheroes
‎would come to save me, huh?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.180
‎That's right, they work for me now!

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.900
‎What's up with you guys?
‎Why are you all smiling like that?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.580
‎We're smiling
‎because you're on the air, Mr Roth.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.380
‎Everything you just said
‎was broadcast live.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.500
‎-Yeah!
‎-Boo!

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.940
<i>‎Precisely!</i>
<i>‎It was all just a big joke!</i>

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.300
<i>‎I actually happen</i>
<i>‎to love the band Kitten Division.</i>

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.220
‎In fact, I love them so much

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.820
‎that I was just about to sign them
‎to their first record deal!

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.900
‎And now, they're gonna finish off
‎this show with their very own song!

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.780
<i>‎I didn't mention it earlier,</i>
<i>‎to keep it a surprise,</i>

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.860
<i>‎but it was my idea from the start!</i>

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.380
‎We usually save the good guys
‎from the baddies.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.380
‎But I've got my doubts about this one.
‎You sure he hasn't been akumatised?

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.580
‎Nope. He's like that all the time.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.660
‎Gotta go. I'm about to transform back.
‎See you soon, my kitty!

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.220
<i>‎I love it when she calls me that!</i>

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.100
‎You broke the Laws of Silence, Ladybug!

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.380
‎But I'm preparing an act of vengeance
‎for you that will leave you speechless!

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.700
‎And now, please welcome
‎the next big thing in town, Kitty Section!

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.380
‎Luka, did you really mean those things
‎you said when you were akumatised?

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.060
‎I'm sorry, Marinette,
‎but I don't remember. What did I say?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.660
‎Uh... Oh! Nothing. It was nothing at all.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.740
‎-You were possessed by Hawk Moth's akuma.
‎-I don't know what I could have said.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.620
‎I just hope it wasn't anything mean,

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.500
‎because you're the most
‎extraordinary girl.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.380
‎As clear as a musical note,
‎and as sincere as a melody.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.500
‎You are the music that's been playing
‎inside my head since the first day we met.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.740
‎That was declaration of love,
‎right, Tikki?

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.060
‎One of the most beautiful ones
‎I've ever heard!
