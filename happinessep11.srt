1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,719
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,680
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,183
Why didn't you tell us that
Andrew was a murderer?

4
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,602
I thought we were just going
to threaten them a bit!

5
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,689
You said you didn't care about
anything as long as we got the food.

6
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,650
I just opened the door because
the building representative asked me to.

7
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,695
I had no idea
that it was something like this!

8
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,197
I didn't know, either.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,449
Mr. Oh suggested this plan.

10
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,253
Who are you?

11
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,038
I'm Andrew. I've always wanted
to have superpowers.

12
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,754
Sae-bom!

13
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,675
Jung-kook, wake up!

14
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,055
Good luck treating him.

15
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,599
I'll protect Seo-yoon.

16
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,118
I'll come to get you. Just wait a bit.

17
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,804
You don't have a scar on your face.

18
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,514
All of you, go to the gym.

19
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,891
I'll bring those two later.

20
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,518
Can't we take the food now?

21
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,188
There are people in there.

22
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,861
Let's go wait there.

23
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,947
It's not a pretty sight for us to see.

24
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,869
This is a bad environment
to be in with a kid…

25
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,292
Mr. Lawyer.

26
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,377
Stay here for a moment.

27
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,718
You heard that noise, right?

28
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,266
Is your brother all right?

29
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,893
It seems you go see him often.

30
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,104
You didn't go with her, did you?

31
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,273
My brother is totally fine!

32
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,359
He's extremely careful,

33
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,403
and his wound made by the infected
hasn't changed at all, either.

34
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,782
Now, let's go down.
We have to discuss Unit 501.

35
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,910
The others will join us
when they're done with their business.

36
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,161
Let's go.

37
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,788
This is bothersome…

38
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,764
Yi-hyun, bring the first-aid kit
and clean water.

39
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,312
Mr. Kim, let me take a look.

40
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,242
Hang in there for a bit.

41
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,078
You'll be okay if you go to the hospital.

42
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,415
But still, if I die,

43
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,042
tell my wife…

44
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,795
that I said I'm sorry,

45
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,549
and that I love her.

46
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,926
You tell her face to face.

47
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,970
You can go out and get treated.

48
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,805
Really?

49
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,724
Do you really think I'll live?

50
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,766
You will.

51
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,770
It's just a small hole on your side.

52
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,064
Is it really a small one?

53
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,108
Is it true?

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,611
Yi-hyun…

55
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,085
Jung-kook, hang in there a bit.

56
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,302
Sae-bom, Jung-kook…

57
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,512
Yi-hyun.

58
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,514
Yi-hyun!

59
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,308
Look at me.

60
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,814
We will get out of here alive…

61
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,151
and we will arrest

62
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,487
all of them.

63
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,904
Jung-kook got stabbed
with a knife on his side.

64
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,116
And Seo-yoon can't breathe well,
so have the medical staff ready.

65
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,243
We can go inside.

66
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,245
No, Seo-yoon is taken hostage.

67
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,039
It'll be dangerous if you come in.

68
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,332
Mr. Jung.

69
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,919
I thought about the reason
you're doing this.

70
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,170
Sae-bom has…

71
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,631
the antibody, doesn't she?

72
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,134
What if I say yes?

73
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,930
Then you should give us what we want

74
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,307
for Sae-bom to get out.

75
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,815
Mr. Lawyer, stay with this kid
for a moment.

76
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,245
I'm not a bad guy.

77
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,205
What's your name?

78
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,838
I know who you are.

79
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,549
Where are you going?
You have to get tested!

80
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,800
The hospital.

81
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:56,309
WANTED FOR MURDER
CHOI JONG-WOOK, AGE 33

82
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,938
You killed the real Ahn Kook-jin,
didn't you?

83
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,068
How many did you kill

84
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,946
with your face hidden like that?

85
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,197
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD: AHN KOOK-JIN

86
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,217
The infected are the same, though.

87
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,221
They hide their real selves to hide
in the crowd and seek victims.

88
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,058
They're ill because of the disease,

89
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,561
and you're just insane.

90
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,731
Hey, Mister.

91
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,025
How long have you known this?

92
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,528
I heard you started it!

93
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,906
It's been a few days.

94
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,617
I saw Andrew "taking care of"
the cleaning lady.

95
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,795
Hold on!

96
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,838
Wait.

97
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,175
Andrew, the 11th floor is vacant.

98
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,261
Wouldn't it be better
to hide the body there?

99
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,722
If you do this on the neck,
you can make it look like

100
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,098
it was done by the infected.

101
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,979
So I told the building representative
right away.

102
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,732
I have an offer for you.

103
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,944
There's a way
to get rid of those we don't like.

104
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,324
The building representative said yes,
so I told Andrew.

105
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,575
I told him we'll help him

106
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,160
so he should help us too.

107
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,455
You should all be thanking me.

108
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,876
I know you'll not like me saying this,
but I'm a top elite in society.

109
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,796
I even did some acting to trick the couple
on the fifth floor, for all of you.

110
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,174
How did you get into…

111
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,177
Kim Se-hoon's house?

112
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,680
I mentioned you,
and he opened the door for me.

113
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,476
Ms. Yoon got hurt.

114
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,519
Do you have a first-aid kit?

115
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,244
You would've suffered less
if you just listened to me.

116
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,831
I'LL LEAVE THE REMAINING FOOD AND WATER

117
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,924
Andrew.

118
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,842
This is limestone,

119
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,845
and it can get rid of
the smell of blood completely.

120
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,563
Stay there and talk.

121
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,024
You're making me uneasy by moving.

122
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,485
Mr. Kim is hurt.

123
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,280
He has to go to the hospital.

124
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,033
After you two do what you must do.

125
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,870
You can go outside, right? And…

126
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,625
Are you communicating
with someone outside?

127
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,798
What in the world
are you all talking about?

128
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,842
Please explain so we can understand.

129
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,393
We told the cleaners and the lawyer,

130
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,104
but we didn't get to tell you two yet.

131
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,566
You told my husband too?

132
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,527
Yes, I visited him once.

133
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,989
When he heard the 5th floor
and the 15th floor had a lot of food,

134
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,116
he loved the idea.

135
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,471
Mr. Jung had it.

136
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,316
You've been secretly reporting

137
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,736
about the situations going on in here?

138
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,114
You must've received something
and kept it to yourselves.

139
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,617
Under the condition
of monitoring us in here, right?

140
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,453
Hello?

141
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,622
Is anyone there?

142
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,962
I'm the building representative
of Building 101.

143
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,717
I'm in charge of managing
the apartments, so talk to me…

144
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,808
Hello?

145
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,480
Anyone there?

146
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,565
I told them everything.

147
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,277
What did you tell them?

148
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,450
Did you spread your delusions to them?

149
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
Yes, all of them.

150
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,748
I'm sure the people outside
will decide what happened here.

151
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,461
You two will go to prison
for aiding and abetting murder.

152
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,758
And aren't you ashamed to see your son?

153
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,429
I just did it
because they said they'd give out food!

154
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,599
I didn't know anything! I really didn't!

155
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,185
Food doesn't just fall from the sky.

156
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,690
You knew that someone was going
to get hurt, didn't you?

157
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,026
You were going to
get something if you ignored it.

158
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,028
So you accepted it.

159
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
No…

160
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,283
You don't need to be worried so soon.

161
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,620
What matters now is to hang in there
until the lockdown is over.

162
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,746
And…

163
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,839
The couple at Unit 501 promised
to turn on the emergency power.

164
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,965
Right.

165
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,719
Yes, you must turn on the
electricity and take the kid.

166
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,390
If they ask you about why this happened,

167
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,435
just tell them a lunatic
with a gun did it.

168
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,353
So…

169
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,315
are you telling us to keep quiet
about a crime?

170
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,372
What?

171
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,666
I didn't say anything wrong.

172
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,669
Don't mess with those
who have nothing to do with this!

173
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,715
If we attack you at the same time…

174
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,218
you could die too.

175
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,559
Yes, you two have a lot to do,
so you shouldn't fight.

176
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:42,149
Ms. Na, you don't need
to be here. Go home.

177
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,817
You too, Ms. Shin.

178
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:48,364
Your husband is at our house
with Seo-yoon right now.

179
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,952
She must've been shocked,
so please protect her at Unit 602.

180
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,746
I will.

181
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,632
Go turn the electricity on.

182
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,760
Then I will let Seo-yoon
and that detective out.

183
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,473
Do you want to come with us?

184
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,030
Seo-yoon, I'm fine.

185
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,534
I'm fine, so why don't you stay outside?

186
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,079
I'm worried because I might've
been infected, that's why.

187
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,336
Stay outside. It's okay.

188
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,385
Mr. Lawyer, can you please
take Seo-yoon to your house?

189
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,345
I don't think she should stay here.

190
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,431
Right.

191
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,183
Stop taking deep breaths,
and come with me. Come.

192
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,440
If you stay here,
that scary guy will come back.

193
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,317
You don't want to get in trouble, do you?

194
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,530
What are you doing?

195
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,867
So-yoon, you came just in time.
Her name sounds similar to yours,

196
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,243
so you persuade her.

197
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,873
Andrew has a gun and he threatened
the couple on the fifth floor.

198
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,251
Yes, he's totally insane.
He must be a murderer or something.

199
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,544
Let's turn a blind eye.

200
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,630
We just need to hide
until the lockdown is over.

201
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,636
Did you help too?

202
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,847
Hey, do I look like someone who'd do that?

203
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,643
I just heard about it from
the building representative.

204
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,687
She said I just need to help them a bit…

205
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,314
This isn't who you were.

206
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,400
When you were a public defender,

207
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,360
you helped those who have been wronged,

208
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,362
and took your time to investigate.

209
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,573
So what did I get from doing that?

210
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,533
I should find a way to live too!

211
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,790
Where did she go?

212
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,249
Kid, let's go. Come here.

213
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,419
Come here.

214
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,467
I want to go with her.

215
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,933
Yes, Seo-yoon, let's go.

216
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,186
But Mr. Kim…

217
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,406
Seo-yoon said

218
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,660
she wants you to come with her.

219
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,370
I'm sorry,

220
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,414
but I don’t think I can climb the stairs.

221
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,625
Please take care of Seo-yoon.

222
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,796
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:08,105
We'll go down,
so be careful not to get killed by Andrew.

224
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,985
And think about how you can live
in a less shameful way.

225
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,324
Aren't you going to give us any weapons?
Like baseball bats?

226
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,035
You said the infected
are human beings too.

227
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,621
Talk to them.

228
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,792
When you're done, come here.
We should go see Seo-yoon together.

229
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,503
Wait.

230
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,091
I'll come with you.

231
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,621
It's the senior citizens' center
in Building 103.

232
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
-Mr. Kim, wait here.
-What?

233
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
It's dangerous. You don't need to go out.

234
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,713
Stay here and go up
when the lights are on.

235
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,965
Is it okay for me to do that?

236
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,800
Why did you follow us?

237
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,428
It doesn't look like
you're here to film stuff, either.

238
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,181
That's my car right there.

239
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,100
I have nowhere to go.

240
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,605
So I want to try breaking out
by hitting the shutter with my car.

241
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,783
Good luck.

242
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,242
All right.

243
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,410
Let's go.

244
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,886
Wait.

245
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,554
That way.

246
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,028
ELECTRICAL ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

247
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
Yi-hyun.

248
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,546
EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLY

249
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,491
The infected will swarm in
when they hear the noise!

250
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,140
This way.

251
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Why did we come this way?

252
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,161
Andrew might try to kill us if we go up.

253
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,289
He'll be waiting at the elevator
or the stairs at our building.

254
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,417
He won't imagine we'd come down
from the next building's rooftop.

255
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,937
There was nobody on
the 15th floor of Building 103.

256
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,648
We just need to take Seo-yoon
and Jung-kook and get out.

257
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,081
Let's go.

258
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,553
What's wrong with this?

259
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,057
Why isn't it working?

260
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,975
Please!

261
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,408
No!

262
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,203
Please!

263
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,259
Andrew, you've done so much work for us.

264
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,181
Shouldn't the gun be managed
officially by the entire apartment?

265
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,019
Andrew.

266
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:09,234
When the fifth floor couple comes up,
you'll get rid of them, right?

267
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,908
You're going out
when the lockdown is over, right?

268
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,495
Yes, I must go to other apartments.

269
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,999
Everything that happened here
is all your doing, Andrew.

270
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,750
And we knew nothing.

271
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,128
Understood?

272
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,551
You two are okay with it too, right?

273
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,970
Of course. We know nothing.

274
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,433
What are you doing?
We have to go turn on the water.

275
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,352
Get in. You must go
to Unit 501 to get food too.

276
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,106
We'll go there after we go
to the second floor first.

277
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,274
Go ahead.

278
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
Why? That Andrew is nothing.

279
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,034
Are you nuts? Do you want to get killed?

280
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,917
Andrew, why have you been
covering that good-looking face?

281
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,462
Go upstairs.

282
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,964
I'm going to kill the cop couple
when they come up.

283
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,188
After we save the others,
can we get them out?

284
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,190
What if Han Tae-seok doesn't take them in?

285
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,859
He will take them in.

286
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,990
You have the antibody.

287
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,577
I do?

288
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,164
So he's trying to take you
by using Seo-yoon as an excuse.

289
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,543
Because you're the only one
in this world who has the antibody.

290
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,680
Stay in there!

291
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,520
Yi-hyun!

292
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,063
What are you doing? Get inside!

293
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,841
Yi-hyun, is this…

294
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,225
I'm sorry.

295
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,520
I couldn't tell you.

296
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,816
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

297
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,492
I always wanted…

298
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,746
to only show you my good side.

299
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,736
Don't come close to me.

300
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,822
Whenever I see you,

301
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,827
my heart thumps and I feel thirsty.

302
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,289
I do too.

303
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,336
Because I like you.

304
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,751
Come with me.

305
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,878
You will get better.

306
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,505
Because I'll make you get better.

307
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,474
You must have a reason
you're obsessed with this incident.

308
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,768
Even by locking up
the infected in freezer trucks

309
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,603
and sneaking into the apartments.

310
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,606
I got infected.

311
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,318
This will be my last favor.

312
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,035
Yes?

313
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,748
It looks like the emergency power
was turned on inside the apartments.

314
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,418
Remove the parking lot barricades

315
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,503
and block it again
after Ms. Yoon comes out.

316
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,338
Jung Yi-hyun is infected.

317
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,134
Tell them to fire
if he threatens Yoon Sae-bom.

318
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,765
Bo-ram.

319
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,685
Lee Bo-ram!

320
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,024
Bo-ram, open the door.

321
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,176
What are you going to do now?

322
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,969
Is there a way to get rid of Andrew?

323
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,472
The resident-representative-to-be.

324
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,058
I'm sure the police will take care of it.

325
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,019
We can just send him to prison
when things get better.

326
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,439
We didn't know that jerk was a murderer.

327
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,948
-Are you going to say that you knew?
-No. Have it your way, then.

328
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,452
Get lots of food and be happy and healthy.

329
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:40,333
You must be happy because
you have plans laid out like a movie.

330
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,967
Aren't you taking anything, Mr. Oh?

331
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,844
I have something else to take, so I must…

332
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,890
If you see any drugs, call me right away.

333
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,309
Anything like health supplements
or vitamins.

334
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,479
I was just playing.

335
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,191
I'm just going to find
the drugs and get out.

336
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,736
Want me to give you some if I find them?

337
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,197
If you take it,
then it'll be very hard for you to die.

338
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,332
Hyun-kyung, hurry.

339
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,334
The air conditioner.

340
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,462
Hey, is the lockdown over?

341
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,297
It's absolute chaos outside.

342
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,467
Andrew! That crazy piece of crap!

343
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,676
Why?

344
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,850
He threatened the fifth floor couple
to make them turn on the emergency power.

345
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,227
But didn't Andrew like you?

346
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,480
Damn it! Shut up.

347
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,317
What should we do?

348
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,236
We can't just sit here like this.

349
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,531
Hey, of course we can.

350
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,326
We just need to hide here,
enjoying the air conditioner.

351
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,536
We're powerless.

352
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,665
And I got the disease.

353
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,212
Still,

354
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,631
they did help us.

355
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,471
LOG IN

356
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,388
NO INTERNET CONNECTION

357
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,357
What are you doing?

358
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,567
It's nothing.

359
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,667
You still haven't given up?

360
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,086
The Internet is still out.
What are you trying to do?

361
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,759
You should charge your phone too.

362
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,927
Bring it here.

363
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,056
Go to Unit 501
and bring some water and food.

364
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,516
Me?

365
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,143
Then do you want
to stay here with Seo-yoon?

366
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,734
When everyone takes them,
there will be nothing left for us.

367
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,159
You go next time.

368
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,269
So-yoon, what is this? What are you doing?

369
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,690
You don't care about sacrificing others
and you only care about yourself.

370
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,152
And you justify yourself
by saying you had no other choice.

371
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,613
I'm sick and tired of you!

372
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
Hey, So-yoon!

373
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,658
Shin So-yoon!

374
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,709
Be careful.

375
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,961
Don't worry.

376
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,131
Just bring Mr. Kim out safely.

377
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,062
Wait, is this because of Sang-hee?

378
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,315
I told you she and I are not
in that kind of a relationship!

379
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,360
Oh Joo-hyung invested all the money
he pocketed in cryptocurrency.

380
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,445
We were going to share it, that's why!

381
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,406
So I can make you live in luxury.

382
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,203
The world is about to end.
Do you think that'll be worth anything?

383
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,164
No, you obviously don't know anything.

384
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,751
Don't you know what a blockchain is?
That's the value of the future.

385
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,712
Values like that shine more brightly
when the world is in chaos.

386
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,506
What the heck?

387
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,050
Let go! It hurts!

388
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,218
All right. Let go.

389
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,304
Ms. Shin So-yoon, it's me.
Open the door, please.

390
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,430
Sae-bom?

391
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
Darn it.

392
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,309
So-yoon, tell her
that it's a misunderstanding.

393
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,937
I protected the kid! That's a fact!

394
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,730
Hurry!

395
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,273
Just let him go.

396
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,275
He's too cowardly to fight back anyway.

397
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,571
Darn it.

398
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,869
You really did come back soon.

399
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,955
I kept our promise, right?

400
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,041
Does your chest still feel stuffy?

401
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,255
But Mr. Kim seemed to be in a lot of pain.

402
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,214
Yes.

403
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,550
He'll be going out with us.

404
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,268
What about Andrew?

405
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,230
I'm sure he's waiting down
there somewhere.

406
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,733
You guys can't get out of here anyway.

407
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,402
We're all trapped in here.

408
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,874
Are you going to kill me here too?

409
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,710
Just like my husband?

410
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,182
Help!

411
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,684
I'm going to die here!

412
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,854
I'm not going out, so don't worry.

413
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,107
Just wait here for a bit.

414
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,739
If we let her take the kid,
that psycho Andrew won't forgive us!

415
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,200
So you want to give the kid to a murderer?

416
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,662
Ms. Shin, we're going to go out.

417
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,458
Want to come with us?

418
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,753
Mr. Kim!

419
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,966
Seo-yoon, I'm happy to see you too,

420
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,303
but I'm in pain. Take it easy, okay?

421
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,937
So-yoon, calm down.
Let's go home and lock the door, okay?

422
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,525
I got to see how filthy
your nature really is.

423
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,818
We're done.

424
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,496
So-yoon!

425
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,674
This is yours.

426
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,763
Thank you.

427
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,872
Damn it, I said I won't!

428
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,206
You saw the look in his eyes.

429
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,083
-Please stop it!
-Let go!

430
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,878
We collected all that money for our kid…

431
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,048
Andrew. We were just…

432
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,886
Stay here. When the fifth floor couple
comes up, hold them.

433
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,681
I… Andrew.

434
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,311
I'll pay you by the hour,
at least. Please.

435
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,362
I can take you down
if you don't have this gun…

436
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,198
Honey! You can do it!

437
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,115
Go!

438
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,658
Go!

439
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,956
Hey, get off of him! Damn it!

440
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,916
Let him go!

441
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,220
Oh no!

442
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,138
Should I pull it out? What do I do?

443
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,556
Should I pull it out?

444
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,100
Ma'am, don't pull that knife out.

445
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,435
He'll die if you do.

446
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,199
This is some serious diet.

447
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,079
We're almost there. Hang in there a bit.

448
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,334
Bo-ram, do you want to come with us too?

449
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,795
Can I do that?

450
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,264
Yoon Sae-bom.

451
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,830
I'll keep him here, so go!

452
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,291
What are you talking about?
You should come with us!

453
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,521
I'm sorry I can't go with you.

454
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,485
Yi-hyun!

455
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,701
Sae-bom.

456
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,121
I was truly happy…

457
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,250
to be with you.

458
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,920
What are you saying?

459
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,340
Open the door, now!

460
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,216
Go.

461
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,344
Never give up.

462
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,890
Yi-hyun!

463
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,191
I think someone's coming up.

464
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,453
Don't mess with Yi-hyun.

465
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,705
I'm going to be back soon.

466
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,166
Let's go.

467
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,548
Hey.

468
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,967
That's a new model, so it won't break.

469
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,636
Wait.

470
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,391
Want this?

471
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,865
Jung Yi-hyun throws a pitch,

472
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,493
and the ball hits the mitt!

473
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,996
Andrew, the batter, can't do anything.

474
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,417
That was a fast pitch. It was fast.

475
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,421
Jung Yi-hyun is back after a long hiatus,

476
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,882
and he threw the best pitch of his life!

477
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,480
Hey, if I didn't get injured,
I could've gone to the Major League.

478
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,321
Your wife ran away,
and you're okay with it?

479
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,490
Yes, this is great.

480
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,120
I started liking her
after meeting her at a place like this.

481
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,623
On a sunny day…

482
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,586
with a beautiful blue sky.

483
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,715
And it's great

484
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,885
to let her go…

485
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,139
on a day like this,

486
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,058
and at a place like this in the end.

487
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,203
That's no fun.

488
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,457
Look at me.

489
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,294
Where's the fun in killing
if I can't look into the victim's eyes?

490
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,964
What does this even say?

491
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,827
Sang-hee, So-yoon ran away.

492
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,870
That's good.

493
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,748
There's something you must do for me.

494
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,167
About Oh Joo-hyung…

495
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,128
What the heck?

496
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,424
It must be high blood pressure.
He suddenly collapsed.

497
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,180
Look at this writing.

498
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,016
What does this say?

499
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,316
-Hey.
-What?

500
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,776
Right.

501
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,864
Isn't that cursive for doctors?
For writing prescriptions.

502
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,074
Don't you know? You worked at that clinic.

503
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,243
I only do consultations.

504
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,120
Don't you have your phone?

505
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,248
I left it at home…

506
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,336
He's alive.

507
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,967
Mister, is that something
for your blood pressure?

508
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,699
Here.

509
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,702
Read it carefully.

510
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,459
If we get it wrong ten times,
then we can't get the money.

511
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,920
Okay, I'll read it carefully.

512
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,535
You have to get up!
Put some strength into your legs!

513
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,995
You need to get up!

514
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,122
I can't put any strength into my legs!

515
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,957
Get up!

516
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,793
Building representative, please help!

517
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,336
My husband is hurt!

518
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,629
Please help us!

519
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,089
What happened?

520
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,550
Andrew stabbed him.

521
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,802
Don't talk to her!

522
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,971
It's all her fault! Damn it!

523
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,351
What about the others? Have you seen them?

524
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,731
What about Andrew? Where did he go?

525
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,858
To the 15th floor.

526
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,671
Hurry and get in.

527
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,903
It's okay.

528
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,947
They're all on our side.

529
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,217
Give me a gun so I can go bring Yi-hyun.

530
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,791
Let go of me!

531
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,740
SEYANG CITY HALL, SEYANG NEW TOWN

532
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,549
Yi-hyun…

533
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,034
Has the Martial Law been lifted?

534
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,038
And you kept it from us?

535
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:43,673
I'm sure it was to manage
the quarantine areas effectively.

536
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,092
And then…

537
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,971
you realized I had the antibody,
and pulled me out.

538
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,476
We gave you the antidote,
so you'll feel quite dizzy.

539
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,269
Lie in bed for a while.

540
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,028
Here is your phone.

541
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,577
-Where did you get this?
-From Detective Kim Jung-kook.

542
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:14,871
He told me…

543
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,249
that Mr. Jung told him
to take it with him.

544
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,016
I have to go find Yi-hyun.

545
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,770
Is it really worth it?

546
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,649
Wasn't it a marriage of convenience?

547
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,902
There are a lot of people outside
that you should protect.

548
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,446
Remember what you said to me?

549
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,451
That if something goes wrong,
the world may collapse.

550
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,247
I'm sorry about what happened to Mr. Jung.

551
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,041
But when the cure is developed
and things are resolved,

552
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,085
you might not lose…

553
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,755
the things you wanted.

554
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,508
Tell the world it'll have to wait.

555
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,803
I have to see Yi-hyun.

556
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,058
If I lose him…

557
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,939
my world may really collapse.

558
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,195
I want to show someone to you.

559
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,494
Is she infected?

560
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,082
Her seizure stopped,
thanks to your plasma,

561
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,709
but she won't be able to last.

562
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:48,298
We brought you with the excuse
of excessive tranquilizer injections.

563
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,342
We'll check your condition today
and tomorrow, and if you're okay,

564
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,969
you'll go to the governmental lab.

565
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,391
To a lab with Biosafety Level 4,
where outsiders can't enter.

566
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,811
What do you want?

567
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,944
She'll be cured only if she gets
one more injection of your plasma.

568
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,031
Then let's help each other.

569
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,283
I'll give you my plasma
or anything you ask for…

570
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,369
so help me go back home.

571
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,123
And keep the electricity on
at the apartments until then.

572
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,709
The emergency power

573
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,711
can't last that long.

574
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,757
Do you think…

575
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,011
Mr. Jung is alive?

576
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,018
Of course.

577
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,353
ALBUM

578
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,233
TO SAE-BOM

579
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:35,446
Ta-da! Hi, Sae-bom.

580
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,659
I'm sorry I couldn't propose
to you properly.

581
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,704
It must have seemed

582
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,000
like I agreed to marry you
because of the house.

583
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,585
But that's not why.

584
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,298
I was just worried
that you'd misunderstand

585
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,758
because I said yes so quickly.

586
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,303
I'm not such an easy guy, you know.

587
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,639
Of course, the house is important, too…

588
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,519
but what's really important is
whom I'm going to be with, right?

589
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:11,065
Mister, what are you doing
with Sae-bom's phone?

590
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,986
Seo-yoon, act like you didn't see that.
They're being lovey-dovey…

591
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,739
Wait, no. Just think
that he's invisible now.

592
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,074
Let's go.

593
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,080
I hope we can go out safely
and watch this video together.

594
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,294
When that happens, I'll tell you properly…

595
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,589
that I like you.

596
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,485
Ta-da! Hi, Sae-bom.

597
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,697
I'm sorry I couldn't propose
to you properly.

598
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,867
It must have seemed

599
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,080
like I agreed to marry you
because of the house.

600
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,749
But that's not why.

601
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,420
I was just worried
that you'd misunderstand

602
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,255
because I said yes so quickly.

603
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,341
I'm not such an easy guy, you know.

604
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,552
Of course, the house is important, too…

605
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:28,434
WONJUNG DORMITORY

606
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,843
I bit Andrew.

607
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,179
If he's alive, then we must catch him.

608
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,475
I'm sure he hid Andrew's body
and lied to me.

609
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,436
I can kill him too if something happens.

610
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,271
The antibodies are decreasing.

611
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,981
So we should kill the detective?

612
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,067
They're infected.

613
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,404
You people are the monsters,
not those with the disease.

614
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,449
I will take care of Yoon Sae-bom.

615
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,533
What about Yi-hyun?

616
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,034
Is he alive?

617
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:34,417
