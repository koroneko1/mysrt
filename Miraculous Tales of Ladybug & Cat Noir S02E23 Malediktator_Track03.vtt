&lrm;You're so flighty tonight.
&lrm;What's on your mind?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.420
&lrm;-The kwami Nooroo's transmission is...
&lrm;-Hawk Moth's kwami?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.860
&lrm;Yes. He's celebrating his 3500th cycle
&lrm;today... all by himself.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.660
&lrm;We will free him from Hawk Moth
&lrm;one of these days, I promise!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.060
&lrm;There may just be a faster solution.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.860
&lrm;Kwamis are able to communicate with
&lrm;their kind on their cycle or birthday.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.700
&lrm;But we won't get
&lrm;another opportunity for a long time.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.660
&lrm;A kwami's cycle lasts
&lrm;several hundreds of human years.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.500
&lrm;Wow, that's amazing!

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.580
&lrm;Then you could find out where he is.
&lrm;But... how would you do that?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.460
&lrm;The kwamis must gather in the Miracle Box
&lrm;at a specific time.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.780
&lrm;-When would that be?
&lrm;-Tonight.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.740
&lrm;Tonight? Why didn't you tell me
&lrm;about this sooner, Tikki?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.220
&lrm;Because Master Fu doesn't want us kwamis
&lrm;to leave our owners' sides.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.140
&lrm;We have to be able to take action
&lrm;immediately if someone becomes akumatized.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.940
&lrm;Hmm. He's right.
&lrm;But surely it's no big deal?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.660
&lrm;I mean, if all the other kwamis
&lrm;are able to meet up,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.700
&lrm;then it's still gonna happen, right?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.540
&lrm;Well, I'm afraid
&lrm;it might not work if I don't go.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.940
&lrm;The more kwamis are present,
&lrm;the better chance of succeeding!

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.700
&lrm;But if Master Fu doesn't approve...

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.980
&lrm;Wayzz, Plagg and I had an idea.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.940
&lrm;Well, it was mainly Plagg's idea.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.180
&lrm;Plagg and I would go and gather with
&lrm;the other kwamis inside the Miracle Box.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.620
&lrm;Wayzz would stand guard.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.900
&lrm;And he'd let us know right away
&lrm;if anyone becomes akumatized.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.740
&lrm;-What do you think?
&lrm;-A great idea!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.820
&lrm;There's no risk that way.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.300
&lrm;Even if we don't tell Master Fu
&lrm;the whole truth?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.060
&lrm;If it means we're able
&lrm;to defeat Hawk Moth,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.180
&lrm;-Master Fu can't hold it against you!
&lrm;-So you're OK with it?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.460
&lrm;-You'll let me go?
&lrm;-Yes. I trust you, Tikki.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.020
&lrm;Oh, thank you, Marinette!

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.860
&lrm;You don't have to worry.
&lrm;I won't let you down.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.660
&lrm;Sweet dreams!

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.300
&lrm;[yawns] I am exhausted!
&lrm;I'm off to bed.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.740
&lrm;Uh... Good night, Plagg.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.420
&lrm;[hums]

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.860
&lrm;Good night, sir.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.980
&lrm;-Where do you think you're going, Nooroo?
&lrm;-Uh... I just wanted to go out.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.940
&lrm;-Just for a little while.
&lrm;-No. You know the rules.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.540
&lrm;You can't be more than a few feet away
&lrm;from me, and no communicating with anyone.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.980
&lrm;-There are no exceptions.
&lrm;-But, Master, it's my birthday today!

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.980
&lrm;-I thought...
&lrm;-You obviously haven't grasped the rules.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.660
&lrm;We're going to have to make them
&lrm;even simpler.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.340
&lrm;From now on, you won't be able
&lrm;to communicate at all.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.460
&lrm;But, Master...

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.580
&lrm;[muffled voice]

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.580
&lrm;It was a joke, Nooroo. I'm not that cruel.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820
&lrm;Thank you, Master.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.460
&lrm;[gasps]

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.180
&lrm;Change of plans, Nooroo.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.100
&lrm;I feel an emotion of great intensity.
&lrm;So pure...

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.580
&lrm;Fly away my little akuma
&lrm;and evilise him!

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.380
&lrm;-Hey, Sugarcube!
&lrm;-I've told you not to call me that!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.380
&lrm;Ever hear me calling you Stinky Sock?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.540
&lrm;No. But you should!
&lrm;That would be delightful, Sugarcube!

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.140
&lrm;[groans]

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.220
&lrm;So, what lies did you tell your owner
&lrm;in order to sneak out?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.700
&lrm;Actually,
&lrm;I just told her the honest truth.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.540
&lrm;Oh? Maybe I should try that some day,
&lrm;see what it's like.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.340
&lrm;Plagg! You should have
&lrm;saved some for the others!

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.820
&lrm;True. But I was so grossed out by your
&lrm;kindness that it made me really hungry.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.020
&lrm;[sighs]

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.580
&lrm;I hope we can get in contact with Nooroo.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.260
&lrm;So do I.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.340
&lrm;-Are you crying?
&lrm;-Who? Me? Of course not!

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.900
&lrm;Are you kidding? Come on, let's race!
&lrm;The last one there won't get any cheese!

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.340
&lrm;[knock on door]

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.820
&lrm;Hey, Wayzz! How's it going?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.740
&lrm;Shh! You'll wake up Master!

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.860
&lrm;Psst! Come on!

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.820
&lrm;If you manage to contact Nooroo,
&lrm;wish him a happy 3500 cycles for me!

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.660
&lrm;We sure will, Wayzz!

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.580
&lrm;Hi, everybody! We're here!

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.900

&lrm;-[cheering]

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.580
&lrm;With you here, we'll manage to get
&lrm;in touch with Nooroo for sure!

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.620
&lrm;Good day to you, noble kwamis
&lrm;of creation and destruction!

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.780
&lrm;Oh! What did you bring?
&lrm;What did you bring?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.820
&lrm;Brothers and sisters
&lrm;living within the Miracle Box,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.300
&lrm;on this special day,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.700
&lrm;-I brought you some delicious cheese.
&lrm;-Oh, I love cheese!

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.260
&lrm;-That's so nice!
&lrm;-Unfortunately,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.980
&lrm;I had to sacrifice it on the way here,
&lrm;to feed a poor, starving kitten.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.740
&lrm;-Aw! That's just so cute!
&lrm;-What about you, Tikki?

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.140
&lrm;From my owner's home, I bring you this!

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.020
&lrm;-Yeah! Oh, what a jewel! What a jewel!
&lrm;-It's beautiful!

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.340
&lrm;Wait! I think I've got it!
&lrm;It's a paintbrush!

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.540
&lrm;-Oh!
&lrm;-Oh, so shiny!

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.660
&lrm;Let the party begin!

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.340
&lrm;-Oh, yeah!
&lrm;-Woo-hoo! Yeah!

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.540
&lrm;It is a good thing you are here.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.380
&lrm;Your owners were wise
&lrm;to give you permission to come.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.180
&lrm;Yes, Sass... Marin...

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.980
&lrm;-Your owner!
&lrm;-Ha, ha! You forgot about the magic spell!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.780
&lrm;We can't say our owners names
&lrm;to each other, remember?

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.620
&lrm;Yes! My owner is the best Ladybug
&lrm;I've ever served.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.940
&lrm;We are also very lucky that the guardian
&lrm;of the Miracle Box agreed to it, too.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.500
&lrm;Well, shall we dance, Tikki?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.900
&lrm;We have to properly celebrate
&lrm;our friend Nooroo, after all!

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.700
&lrm;[singing]

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.380
&lrm;[snoring]

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.540
&lrm;The code... What's the code?

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.940
&lrm;Tikki! Can you hear me? Tikki!

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.540
&lrm;<i>♪ The Sandboy just checked in!</i>
&lrm;<i>Now nightmares can begin! ♪</i>

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.980
&lrm;Master! Master! Wake up!

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.660
&lrm;Marinette? Wha... What...?

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.500
&lrm;Quick, Master! Don't stay here!

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.620
&lrm;Fu! We are the ghosts
&lrm;of the Guardians of the Miraculous!

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.460
&lrm;You caused our downfall
&lrm;and lost two Miraculous!

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.820
&lrm;It was not my fault!

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.820
&lrm;-I did not do it on purpose!
&lrm;-Yes! It was your fault! Your fault!

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.460
&lrm;-Your fault! Your fault!
&lrm;-Marinette... transform!

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.380
&lrm;I can't, Master.
&lrm;Tikki is inside the Miracle Box!

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.540
&lrm;I'm in love with a girl
&lrm;and her name is Chloé!

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.420
&lrm;It's disastrous! We can't communicate with
&lrm;the kwamis when they're in their world!

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.940
&lrm;Help me! Father!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.940
&lrm;Sandboy is turning Paris into one,
&lrm;huge, nightmare...

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.260
&lrm;and yet there's no sign of Ladybug
&lrm;or Cat Noir. What is going on?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.740
&lrm;-Nooroo! Nooroo! Nooroo!
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.500
&lrm;-What is that?
&lrm;-That's not Nooroo!

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.260
&lrm;-It's Hawk Moth!
&lrm;-[gasp]

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.340
&lrm;Keep singing! We must try to find out
&lrm;where he's hiding!

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.020
&lrm;Aha! It's me who's going to find you,
&lrm;little kwamis.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.700
&lrm;And I will make you my slaves,
&lrm;just like Nooroo!

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.980
&lrm;-[screams]
&lrm;-His will is so powerful!

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.140
&lrm;We must cut off all communication!
&lrm;Hawk Moth is trying to track us down!

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.700
&lrm;Argh!

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.300
&lrm;Hey, wait,
&lrm;the reason we can't speak to Nooroo

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.380
&lrm;is because he's powering Hawk Moth,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.860
&lrm;which means
&lrm;he's probably akumatized someone!

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.020
&lrm;And since Plagg and Tikki
&lrm;are with us...

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.940
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;are unable to transform!

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.380
&lrm;Go and find your owners right away!

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.900
&lrm;They're making a serious mistake!
&lrm;I just felt the kwamis

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.020
&lrm;somewhere on the right bank of the Seine.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.020
&lrm;-Find them! Capture them!
&lrm;-Yes, Hawk Moth!

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.460
&lrm;-It's your fault, Fu! Your fault!
&lrm;-Marinette, for your birthday,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.660
&lrm;-I'm going to buy you flowers...
&lrm;-Hey! Isn't that your owner?

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.140
&lrm;Of course not! Flowers? Pwah! No way!

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.220
&lrm;The real one talks nonsense,
&lrm;but it's never&lrm;<i> this</i>&lrm; bad!

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.260
&lrm;Hortensias, roses and Chloés!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.460
&lrm;I'd better go find him. I just hope he's
&lrm;not living a nightmare without me around!

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.980
&lrm;-It didn't work!
&lrm;-I'm sorry! We should have warned you!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.020
&lrm;-We'll talk about it later, Wayzz!
&lrm;-Right now, we have to end this nightmare!

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.260
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.740
&lrm;Yeah!

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.100
&lrm;Kwami in sight!

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.380
&lrm;That's Cat Noir's kwami! Capture it
&lrm;or follow it all the way to its owner!

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.260
&lrm;The Sandboy just checked in!
&lrm;Now nightmares can begin!

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.940
&lrm;I know what my nightmare is. And you'll
&lrm;never get me to eat dairy-free cheese!

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.580
&lrm;-[blows a raspberry]
&lrm;-Argh!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.500
&lrm;Ha, ha! I'm your worst nightmare!

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.580
&lrm;Argh! You failed!
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon!

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.940
&lrm;You must get me their Miraculous!

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.980
&lrm;-Adrien! Are you OK?
&lrm;-Plagg, I'm so relieved you're not a sock!

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.900
&lrm;-But you'd better have a good excuse.
&lrm;-Glad you've survived your nightmare!

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.100
&lrm;Quick! Plagg, claws out!

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.580
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.940
&lrm;No time for daydreaming!

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.700
&lrm;[screaming]

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.980
&lrm;What is this mess?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.180
&lrm;Milady! Tonight's been a total
&lrm;nightmare... until you showed up!

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.140
&lrm;This is no time for lullabies!
&lrm;We've got to stay focused!

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.900
&lrm;-[explosion]
&lrm;-Look!

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.980
&lrm;His cloud is shaped like a pillow!

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.420
&lrm;-I'll bet you that's where his akuma is!
&lrm;-Awesome! Then time for a pillow fight!

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.180
&lrm;You can't fight
&lrm;your worst nightmare for long!

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.180
&lrm;He's moving around too much!

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.820
&lrm;And his evil sand is blowing everywhere!

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.220
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.980
&lrm;Aaah!

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.780
&lrm;-Oh, no!
&lrm;-Who's about to get a pretty magic jewel?

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.820
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.380
&lrm;What's happening?

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.380
&lrm;Aaah!

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.860
&lrm;Good job, Sandboy!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.300
&lrm;Without her powers, she can't stop you
&lrm;from taking her Miraculous!

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.980
&lrm;Ladybug,
&lrm;your nightmare is my dream come true!

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.780
&lrm;Aaah!

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.300
&lrm;The Sandboy just checked in!
&lrm;Now nightmares can begin!

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.900
&lrm;-Stay behind me, Milady!
&lrm;-You still have your powers.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.220
&lrm;-Losing mine is not what I'm afraid of.
&lrm;-Then... what?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.220
&lrm;Cat Noir!

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.940
&lrm;Bad kitty! I'll never love you!
&lrm;I've always wanted to get rid of you!

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.660
&lrm;-You have weird dreams too!
&lrm;-My bad!

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.260
&lrm;I am gonna destroy you.
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.340
&lrm;Oops! Sorry, Milady!
&lrm;Stay behind me! I'll protect you!

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.940
&lrm;Stay still, you mangy cat!

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.060
&lrm;Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on!

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.300
&lrm;[battle cry]

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.540
&lrm;We need to figure out a plan! Fast!

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.220
&lrm;Stay still!
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous, Ladybug!

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.300
&lrm;So, you want to play hide and seek,
&lrm;kitty? Ha, ha! Come on, kitty!

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.100
&lrm;Watch out, Ladybug!

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.820
&lrm;-I'm about to transform back. Any ideas?
&lrm;-Looking!

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.980
&lrm;Quick! We've gotta lure her over here!

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.100
&lrm;You don't scare me!
&lrm;You're just a stupid dream!

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.300
&lrm;You'll be kitty kibble
&lrm;before you know it!

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.860
&lrm;-Now!
&lrm;-[battle cry]

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.660
&lrm;-Follow me!
&lrm;-Anywhere, Milady!

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.580
&lrm;Give me your Mira...

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.220
&lrm;Aaah!

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.580
&lrm;Cat Noir! Now!

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.420
&lrm;Whoa! Whoa!

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.420
&lrm;Aaah!

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.740
&lrm;No!

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.900
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.820
&lrm;Marinette!

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.140
&lrm;Pound it!

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.940
&lrm;It works again.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.300
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.620
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.060
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.060
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.620
&lrm;Well, what was that all about,
&lrm;little friend?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.700
&lrm;Oh, Ladybug! I watched a movie on TV.
&lrm;It was kinda scary.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.340
&lrm;Then I went to bed
&lrm;and I had a really bad nightmare!

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.940
&lrm;I woke up and there was
&lrm;a black butterfly in my room,

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.340
&lrm;and a weird man spoke right in my face!

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.500
&lrm;Hawk Moth! He fed off
&lrm;the negative emotion from a nightmare!

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.900
&lrm;That's what happens when you let kids
&lrm;watch anything they want on TV! Oh!

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.900
&lrm;Can I leave you to take
&lrm;this young man back to his parents?

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.660
&lrm;No problem. Right, big boy?

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.140
&lrm;Yay! Awesome, Ladybug!

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.380
&lrm;Cat Noir?

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.620
&lrm;You don't really think
&lrm;I'm as evil as your nightmare?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.940
&lrm;Course I don't!
&lrm;You're the lady of my dreams.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.340
&lrm;-Hmm.
&lrm;-It's all my fault, Master.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.660
&lrm;-No, it's mine.
&lrm;-No, Marinette, it's my fault.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.020
&lrm;Yeah, that's true. It's their faults.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.260
&lrm;Hmm.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.060
&lrm;You trusted me and I failed!
&lrm;I'm sorry I disappointed you.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.220
&lrm;Oh, of course not, Tikki.
&lrm;I know you only meant well!

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.660
&lrm;I will always trust you, you know.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.100
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.900
&lrm;Next time, come and talk to me.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.980
&lrm;[groans]

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580
&lrm;Hmph!

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.260
&lrm;-Thank you, Adrien!
&lrm;-Plagg! Something wrong?

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.340
&lrm;No. Just... thanks for letting me do
&lrm;whatever I want... almost all the time!

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.020
&lrm;I know what it's like
&lrm;to have restricted freedom.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.580
&lrm;You don't need to pretend to be a sock!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.780
&lrm;You're the best Cat Noir I've ever had,
&lrm;Adrien!

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.420
&lrm;But let's not get too cheesy
&lrm;about it now, huh?

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.580
&lrm;I hope you liked your friends'
&lrm;birthday gift.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.020
&lrm;Now I know that they're close
&lrm;and that there are many of them.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.220
&lrm;If I manage to find them,
&lrm;I'll take their Miraculous.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.220
&lrm;Then I'll have unlimited
&lrm;powers at my disposal.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.260
&lrm;If I have to fight a whole army
&lrm;of superheroes, I'll do it.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.100
&lrm;Whatever it takes, Nooroo.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.260
&lrm;And Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;won't be able to stop me ever again!

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.300
&lrm;[evil laugh]
