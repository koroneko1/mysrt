We're going to have to build

Use the instruments too.

00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,958
If we leave the door open,
they'll follow the music in.

we take the back door up to the roof.

we stack desks, chairs, and whatever else
we could find in the middle here.

Not here. Farther back.

We can figure out the rest later.

We have a TV too.

You're okay? Doesn't hurt?

497
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
Sergeant…

498
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,064
you know…

499
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,817
I'm thinking that
we should probably use our skills

500
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,861
to get ourselves out of here first.

501
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,405
And then they can send
the army in for the kids after, you know?

502
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,073
I think that makes more sense.

509
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,422
Do you know why some people run
to safety when they are in danger?

510
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,177
Because there are others
who are running into danger for them.

511
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,055
Why put ourselves in danger
if there's no reason to?

512
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,641
You're so frustrating.

513
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,768
I ought to just…

514
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,314
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

515
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,983
for a statue of you as big as the one
of Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

Okay? Happy?

[Jae-ik] What's with this guy?

518
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,699
If you're feeling scared,
you could just stay here.

519

Goodness. Very well put. Yes.

Okay, listen.
We're gonna leave together now.

He's very handsome.
