1
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,927
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,680
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,702
Seo-yoon, I'm home.

4
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,370
Your mom?

5
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,550
The call cannot be connected…

6
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,307
Is something going on outside?

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,266
This?

8
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,519
It's dangerous if people attack us.

9
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,105
My mom isn't answering her phone.

10
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,774
We even texted earlier.

11
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,151
MOM: DID YOU EAT?

12
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,951
It must be the base station.
You can call her later.

13
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,371
And even if people knock,
never open the door for them.

14
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,790
I'll be back soon,
so stay here and watch TV.

15
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,460
The TV doesn't work, either.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,504
What?

17
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,260
OFF-AIR NOTICE
DO NOT MOVE AND WAIT FOR THE RESCUE TEAM

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,196
That's enough. Come here.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,698
We should completely block it.

20
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,825
You saw how they were before.

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,162
Go over there and get some rest.

22
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,961
Jung-kook.

23
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,421
Keep an eye on him.

24
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,338
Okay.

25
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,805
Don't look this way. Face the wall.

26
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,940
What is it?

27
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,942
The infected are out there.

28
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,485
It's too quiet.

29
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,280
Hey! Face the wall!

30
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,659
What's all this?

31
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,954
Mister, what do you think you're doing?

32
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,963
What's all this?

33
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,198
Why isn't it working?
I had more than 1,000 viewers online!

34
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,699
-Dong-hyun.
-What?

35
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,952
The symptoms of this Mad Human Disease…

36
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:09,582
Are they like, a pounding heart,
the scratch mark getting itchy and hot,

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
and things like that?

38
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,377
That's menopause.

39
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,466
What are they doing?
Why aren't they working?

40
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,177
Where is the Management Office?

41
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,262
Which building was it, again?

42
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,640
It's next to the children's library.

43
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,016
Forget it. I'll go find it.

44
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,893
Dong-hyun!

45
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,853
I'm telling you, it's menopause.

46
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,582
It's the truth! Can't you believe me?

47
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,376
This is absolutely unbelievable.

48
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,295
I'm telling you,
everyone in other buildings got infected.

49
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,550
Their eyes rolled up into their heads
and they latched onto things like this!

50
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,929
What are you doing?

51
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,474
Will my kids…

52
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,227
be okay?

53
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,354
They'll be doing better than us, at least!

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,191
Old lady, you live in Unit 401, right?

55
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,777
Is the Internet not working
at your house, either?

56
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,779
I'm not old, and…

57
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,866
Neither the Internet
nor our phones are working.

58
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,661
Did you hear all the other
building residents got infected?

59
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,620
Really?

60
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,373
That's crazy. Who said that?

61
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,416
An announcement?

62
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,127
He said that. Ask him.

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,175
It's true, I mean it.

64
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,891
What is this?

65
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,146
Excuse me.

66
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,316
Don't stay here. Go to the gym.

67
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,485
Okay? Everyone is there.

68
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,820
What do you mean by "everyone"?

69
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,363
The residents.

70
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,365
Can you see it?

71
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,243
Is this real blood?

72
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,704
Then do you think this is ketchup?

73
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,957
-I wasn't the only one who saw it, either.
-I saw it too.

74
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,668
Mr. Lee at the Management Office
got infected,

75
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,671
and his eyes turned white,
and he did this…

76
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,300
It's just that I don't understand.

77
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,802
The other buildings were saying

78
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,637
our building had to be blocked off.

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,306
But they all got infected already?
That makes no sense!

80
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,183
Hi.

81
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,977
Is this real blood? Whose blood is it?

82
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,978
Put your phone down.

83
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,482
We need to talk for a moment.

84
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,070
-Is this blood?
-Is this really blood?

85
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,656
Stop recording. Come out.

86
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,074
It's real blood.

87
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,118
You're trying to scare me, aren't you?

88
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,161
What are you talking about?

89
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,498
Are you trying to scare me away
to become the resident representative?

90
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,416
It must be a prank by the kids.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,669
Building representative…

92
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,295
How do we open this thing?

93
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,840
Dong-hyun, do you know how to open this?

94
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,552
I don't care about being
the representative, so don't worry.

95
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,012
Stand back. It's dangerous.

96
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,639
-It's just…
-You shouldn't go outside.

97
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,516
It won't take long.

98
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,809
I think I saw someone…

99
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,227
Can't you see this?

100
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,230
-You don't know what's out there.
-We're all curious.

101
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,774
-Please calm down.
-Just open half of it.

102
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,278
-We're frustrated, that's why!
-Put your phone down!

103
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,571
-And calm down.
-Wait.

104
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,655
I said, stand back.

105
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,451
Where are you going?

106
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,369
They want to open the door.

107
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,787
You saw that monster earlier.

108
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,039
Then you should stop them, not run away.

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,711
Sae-bom, you came just in time.
Tell them what's out there.

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,962
You scared me.

111
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,007
It's open.

112
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,717
If you want to go out, then go.

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,012
Not like that…

114
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,814
Go on out.

115
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,991
The air in the basement floor is stuffy.

116
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,331
It's not a great place to smoke.

117
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,168
How could you give in so quickly?

118
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,669
Fine.

119
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,339
I will trust you two, just this once.

120
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:27,965
Detective.

121
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,052
I don't have to worry about it, right?

122
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,544
We must tell the other residents as well.

123
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,799
We need to discuss food matters
and basic provisions for non-residents.

124
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,634
We can't make announcements now,

125
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,095
and the Internet is down too.
How would we do that?

126
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
You can tell them yourself.

127
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,394
Where's your gun?

128
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,770
I gave it to Jung-kook.

129
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,024
What did the man downstairs say
when he cuffed you?

130
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,778
Personal liberty is an important right
guaranteed by the Constitution.

131
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,114
He can't do that without
a proper legal process.

132
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,907
I don't really remember what he said.

133
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:40,580
He didn't say much, but I don't think
he told me about my rights.

134
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,499
Then do the police have the evidence?

135
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,625
By any chance…

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,589
are you thinking that
I killed my wife or something like that?

137
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,050
It doesn't matter what I think.

138
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,720
It's up to the judiciary
to make the judgment.

139
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,722
It's just…

140
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,685
I loved my wife, Min-ji,
with all of my heart.

141
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,772
I still can't believe that she's dead.

142
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,651
Then the defending strategy should be
the wrongful arrest of an innocent man.

143
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,199
There's also a dermatology clinic
under my wife's name,

144
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,411
and I'm also curious about

145
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,956
how the issues of management
and inheritance would go.

146
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:27,877
Okay.

147
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,882
You must have
that murder charge lifted first.

148
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,220
Excuse me.

149
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,724
They said everyone should come to the gym.

150
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,368
I'll go out first, so cover me.

151
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,958
Let's switch.
I'm better with the bat than you are.

152
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,256
But you were a pitcher.

153
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,684
If I hadn't injured my leg,
I'd be a Major Leaguer by now.

154
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,353
Here we go.

155
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,387
-Where did everyone go?
-I'm sure they went home.

156
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,558
The infected turn back
to normal after some time.

157
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,352
What would they think
when they see what they've done?

158
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,645
I'm sure they'd regret it.

159
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,232
And they won't be able
to admit what they did.

160
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,694
Yes. I'm sure they would want
to go home and clean up.

161
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,613
There were traces

162
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,700
of an attempt to wipe off
the bloodstain on the door.

163
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
It means they wanted
to erase what they did.

164
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:31,542
And they want to hide the fact
that they want to drink blood.

165
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,270
I didn't do it.

166
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,315
I only took a look.

167
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,825
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAN TAE-SEOK

168
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,039
I should've asked for a walkie-talkie.

169
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,916
What do you think is going on outside?

170
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,211
There's a high chance of chaos
with lots of the infected pouring out.

171
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,379
-Or…
-Or?

172
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,839
Or they gave up on this place.

173
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,532
We tried to arrest
the Next dealers all at once,

174
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,493
but they noticed
and locked the door from inside.

175
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,537
-How many?
-About 50.

176
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,039
They were having
an exclusive party for members.

177
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,625
We can unlock it within five minutes.

178
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,793
Turn the music off.

179
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,420
Shut down all the power inside the club.

180
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,075
Don't open the door. Block them all.

181
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,121
Send out everyone from the other floors
and lock the building down.

182
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,043
Go and lock the building down.

183
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,109
If you need any, you can take some.

184
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,153
You're suddenly in a good mood.

185
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,614
Everyone outside is infected.

186
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,407
And that's a good thing?

187
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,200
Because I don't have to go to prison.

188
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,537
I just need to find
a way to lift my false charges.

189
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,081
You must have a plan.

190
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,210
We just need to silence
the couple downstairs.

191
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,255
I have to persuade them
before the lockdown is lifted.

192
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,257
And you are

193
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,093
on my side anyway, right?

194
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,309
Do I have to go too?

195
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,771
A lawyer should show up
at times like this.

196
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,899
Honey, they said our units are fine.

197
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,693
It's not because I'm scared! Come on.

198
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,405
I just can't believe that
everyone outside is infected.

199
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,951
You must be very scared.

200
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,327
Heading to the meeting?

201
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,621
I'm not scared of the infected at all.

202
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,791
The residents aren't going to
like you very much.

203
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,878
I'm sure many are thinking
that you caused this lockdown.

204
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,047
I told you, I'm innocent.

205
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,175
Where's Ms. Woo?

206
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,178
Sang-hee cares about
what others think of her,

207
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,888
like Mr. Lawyer here.

208
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,807
UNDER MAINTENANCE

209
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,225
Gosh.

210
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,462
Ma'am.

211
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,841
Ma'am, is something out there?

212
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,927
No.

213
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,515
You fell quite hard that day.
Did you go to the hospital?

214
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm okay…

215
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,520
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

216
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,649
Isn't she the one who bumped
into the woman next door?

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,735
Yes, Unit 302.

218
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,819
Don't go near her.

219
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,987
You might get infected.

220
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,906
I won't get infected.

221
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,660
Dad, what are you doing?

222
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,873
Damn it!

223
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,084
You should go out
and find out what's going on

224
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,669
even if it's dangerous out there.

225
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,963
Are you just going to sit here?

226
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,924
The Internet is still out too.
Hurry up! Come here!

227
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,426
-You…
-Sir.

228
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,470
I told you that it's dangerous outside.

229
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,514
All the other building residents
are infected.

230
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,685
Damn it! This is so frustrating!

231
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,733
What is she doing here?

232
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,861
Why did you come all the way here?
You said you were tired.

233
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,446
Mom, are you sick?

234
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,947
I'm not sick…

235
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,575
I'm just a bit tired, that's all.

236
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,171
I saw the bloodstains,
but is it really full of patients outside?

237
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,176
There are a lot of witnesses.

238
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,302
See?

239
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,221
"Do not move."

240
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,140
Who are the witnesses?

241
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,274
Who saw that the outside
was filled with the infected?

242
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,903
Me. I saw them.

243
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,952
Anyone from the higher floors?

244
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,412
No public rentals, you mean?

245
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:47,543
I'm asking just in case there are those
who can make more logical judgments.

246
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,669
Excuse me.

247
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,338
Who are you to doubt
my brother's judgment?

248
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,966
My brother works at a company.

249
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,342
He's a manager there.

250
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,177
Yes, and I'm a lawyer.

251
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,181
My job is to figure out
if the testimony can serve as evidence.

252
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,393
You promote yourself in the apartments
without an office, right?

253
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,020
You were advertising yourself
in the apartment elevator.

254
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,939
It's not promotion. I'm accepting cases.

255
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,316
Don't you know
what "accepting cases" mean?

256
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,693
I write novels, you know.

257
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,278
What's your signature work?

258
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,363
-Love Under Joint Name.
-Calm down, everyone.

259
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,447
Calm down.

260
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,740
Yes, good.

261
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,201
I know you're all sensitive now,

262
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,662
but we shouldn't be fighting
among ourselves.

263
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,456
I didn’t see any infected either,

264
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,584
but you're all saying the same thing…

265
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,799
I'll give you money.

266
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,598
If any of you figure out
what's happening outside…

267
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:47,060
It's not much,
but I'll give you 200,000 won.

268
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,774
If they really are outside,
we should stay inside.

269
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,611
And we can share the food
until the situation is clear.

270
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,822
If you're not going outside,
then okay, sure.

271
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,781
I will give you…

272
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,832
a total of 300,000 won in cash.

273
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,461
What a troll.

274
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,604
-Did you search everywhere?
-It's safe here.

275
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,941
Then can we start operating
the elevator again?

276
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,527
Sure, go ahead.

277
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,575
By the way, ma'am.

278
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,247
If I were you,
I wouldn't take the elevator.

279
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,042
You can't escape if you find
someone infected in a small space.

280
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,465
I believe I told you to stay home.

281
00:20:59,049 --> 00:20:59,883
Why?

282
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,055
You're supposed to release him 48 hours
after arresting him without a warrant.

283
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,349
Does everyone know
that you're a murderer, Mr. Oh?

284
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,065
You're atrocious.
Do you have any witnesses?

285
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:21,154
Some of you saw my wife
wandering around, right?

286
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,368
I called an ambulance
and took her outside.

287
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,206
I do admit that I couldn't protect
my wife until the end.

288
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,458
My heart breaks the most!

289
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,462
Is failing to protect my wife
until the end such a big crime?

290
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,966
And there's the presumption
of innocence too.

291
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,345
You must be glad
the apartments are in lockdown.

292
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,349
Don't worry,
I'm going to stay here anyway.

293
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,936
And this place is
no different from jail, anyway.

294
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,773
Mister, you got something here.

295
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,320
Don't even think about doing anything
to that lady staying with you.

296
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,948
Because I'll kill you if you do.

297
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,081
What are you saying?
You're so unsophisticated.

298
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,669
Ridiculous.

299
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,810
Let's go.

300
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,360
Please be with all families
suffering due to death

301
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,782
-and let them find peace from you, Lord.
-You're here.

302
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,910
-We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
-Amen.

303
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,496
Oh Joo-hyung recruited
those who'd go outside with him.

304
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,206
People want to go outside?

305
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,583
He said he'd pay them 300,000.

306
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,251
I was tempted too, to be honest.

307
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,796
Three hundred thousand.

308
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,468
I said it's dangerous at night,
so it was postponed to tomorrow morning.

309
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,053
Then what about today?

310
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,306
We have to decide on food
and places to sleep for visitors.

311
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,683
Those who are visiting from outside…

312
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,770
If you need food, please come to Unit 401.

313
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,689
I'll give you instant noodles and water.

314
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,444
Me too. Unit 602.
Do you have clothes to change into too?

315
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,073
People offered to chip in.

316
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,784
It seems that some people are still kind.

317
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,538
What about Oh Joo-hyung?

318
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,289
Don't even mention him.

319
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,084
He said there's no food at home,
so he has nothing to share.

320
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,962
I was stupid for asking.

321
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,923
Bye.

322
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,594
By the way, why aren't you going outside?

323
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,181
It seemed like you didn't believe
it was filled with the infected outside.

324
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,976
It'd be good to go outside
with the others and check.

325
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,645
I have a professional job.

326
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,730
I can't go with only that much money.

327
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,319
Then I'll give you a million
without any withholding tax.

328
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,237
How about that?

329
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,201
Mr. Oh, you must stop
taunting people with money.

330
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,663
Let's go. Now.

331
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
Okay, goodbye. Go get some rest.

332
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,462
What does that bastard take me for?

333
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,021
Why did you stop me?
I was about to kill him right away.

334
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,942
Honey, it's no good to be involved
with a lunatic like that.

335
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,905
Maybe we should just drop this case.

336
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,409
Also, there's a dermatology clinic
under my wife's name,

337
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,329
and I'm also curious about
how the issues of management…

338
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,788
That jerk…

339
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,750
We can just send him to prison
if necessary.

340
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,378
We just need to make money.

341
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,675
MY WIFE
I'M DOING FINE, DON’T WORRY

342
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,186
-I wonder if this would be enough.
-It's heavy.

343
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,563
Yes. Thank you so much.

344
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,774
We will clean this place
before we get out.

345
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,027
No, I live alone, so my house is clean.

346
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,863
-Don't worry, and go get some rest.
-Okay, thank you so much.

347
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,114
Thank you for the food.

348
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,324
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

349
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,002
Why did you do that earlier?

350
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,212
What?

351
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,589
You defended me.

352
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,216
I'm the only one who can insult you.

353
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,260
It gets on my nerves if someone else does.

354
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,389
Right? We're family after all.

355
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,059
Yes, but you can’t live here.

356
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,231
She's so harsh.

357
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,404
I'M WITH HYUN-KYUNG

358
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,989
LET'S GET A DOG WHEN WE LIVE HERE

359
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,747
Where were you trying to go?

360
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm sure you knew
you can’t get out of the apartment.

361
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,335
I told you.

362
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,838
I really did leave something in the car.

363
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,339
-Did you drink water?
-The drug?

364
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,636
I didn't!

365
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,222
I seriously don't know
anything about that.

366
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,225
Oh, my gosh!

367
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,144
Why did you do that?

368
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,024
You're avoiding eye contact,
so you're definitely hiding something.

369
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
To be honest…

370
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,863
I am hiding something, but…

371
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,783
it really has nothing to do with you two.

372
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,619
You did drink it.

373
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:16,134
But humans can't survive
without drinking water,

374
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,386
right?

375
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,480
Clip your fingernails short.
I'll check them tomorrow.

376
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,815
If you tell us who bought the drugs,

377
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,360
we'll find a way for you
to be more comfortable here.

378
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,572
When I get out of here,
I'll report you two.

379
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,074
I mean it.

380
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,202
Do anything you want
if you get out of here safely.

381
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,832
Think wisely.

382
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,183
Looks good.

383
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,560
All right.

384
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,147
Check the expiration date.

385
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,566
Seriously, what's with you?

386
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,527
I'm sure they won't be expired.

387
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
Don't you take that off even when you eat?

388
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,490
Stop that, seriously!

389
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,539
Hi.

390
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,668
I'm sorry, but could she stay with you
for the time being?

391
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,046
The cleaners' dorm
is in the basement parking lot,

392
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,048
but she said she's scared
to go down there.

393
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,801
Yes, of course.

394
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,678
That's great.

395
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,846
Thank you.

396
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,223
-Goodbye.
-Okay, bye.

397
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,524
-Please sit here.
-Welcome.

398
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,652
We were just about to eat instant noodles.

399
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,829
Here you go.

400
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,414
Thank you.

401
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,683
Slow down. It's hot.

402
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,145
Today was a long day too.

403
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,481
What about tomorrow?

404
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,108
Shouldn't we stop them from going outside?

405
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,359
How?

406
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,695
Should we block the entrance
and fight them?

407
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,572
Then they'll go through the basement.

408
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,990
We can't do that on our own.

409
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,660
It would be better
to just stay here for one week.

410
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,204
We have food.

411
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,040
And the infected won't break
through the metal gates, either.

412
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,334
What if this doesn't end
even after one week?

413
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,419
Then we should save on food.

414
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,259
Don't tell this to Seo-yoon.

415
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,553
It won't do any good
to make her worry even more.

416
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,805
Okay.

417
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,066
Is it true that it's filled with
Mad Human Disease patients outside?

418
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,317
What?

419
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,656
It's a different building,
not our building.

420
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,201
But it's only in our apartment complex.
Everywhere else is fine.

421
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,665
Was that supposed to be a secret?

422
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,124
You should've told me.

423
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,877
Jung-kook, I have something to tell you.
Come with me.

424
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
I…

425
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,676
When telecommunications are fixed,
you can call your mom again,

426
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,055
so you just need to stay here quietly
and leave when the rescue team comes.

427
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
Everyone will get better when
the vaccine and the cure are out,

428
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,894
so let's just wait a bit more, okay?

429
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,646
I'm okay.

430
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,314
I'm not injured,

431
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,275
and since it's safer outside,

432
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,694
Mom and Dad must be
doing well outside too.

433
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,195
Of course.

434
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,283
-Right.
-Seo-yoon?

435
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,005
I LOVE YOU TOO, MOM.
MOM, PLEASE CALL ME. MOM?

436
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,596
Mad Human Disease virus,
the so-called Lytta Virus,

437
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,515
is a neurotropic virus similar to rabies.

438
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,935
It moves through the central
nervous system and works in the brain.

439
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,813
It infects the host through
direct contact with blood vessels,

440
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,482
and the symptoms do not occur
until it enters the brain.

441
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,193
It seems that the infected
attack the neck most of the time

442
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,904
to shorten the time it takes
to make it to the brain.

443
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,074
Is it okay as long as we don't get bitten?

444
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,619
As of now,
there are three methods of infection.

445
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,290
Either you get bitten,
get scratched, or take Next.

446
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,835
It is presumed that the infection started
from among those who took Next.

447
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,712
What about the development of the cure?

448
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,926
The problem is, the brain is the
most important organ in the human body,

449
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,514
so it's protected by the BBB,
the blood-brain barrier.

450
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:18,394
Even if we develop the cure,
it can't enter the brain.

451
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,648
So, are you saying it's impossible?

452
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,869
The lab is now studying
the formation of new antibodies

453
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,455
that work directly on the brain
with an attenuated virus

454
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,040
cultivated at the lab,

455
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,376
so we'll come up with something
within a month.

456
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,295
Can we withhold until then?

457
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,255
It is considered possible, as of now.

458
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,423
But…

459
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,427
If we give up on active cohort isolation

460
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:56,140
and the infected count exceeds
a certain number, we'll be done for

461
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,436
within 72 hours,
or within one week at the max.

462
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,274
PROGRESS OF CONFIRMED CASES
OF LYTTA VIRUS INFECTION IN KOREA

463
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,342
Go on.

464
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,013
You know that
the lab cultivation is hopeless.

465
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,766
Everyone in the lab died
without antibodies being formed.

466
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,186
Then I should have told them
that the cure cannot be developed?

467
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,106
If we told them that we need
more time and budget…

468
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,401
Then they would have tried to kill
everyone infected.

469
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,112
If the number of the infected
grows without a cure,

470
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,740
then the only solution is
to kill them all.

471
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,704
I thought…

472
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,000
you didn't think of the infected
as human beings, either.

473
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,795
Those who bit and killed people

474
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,922
should be responsible
for what they have done,

475
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,882
don't you think?

476
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,136
We must buy time.

477
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,930
We have to expand
the areas of lockdown, if necessary.

478
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,391
If we want to save more lives…

479
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,728
that's the only way now.

480
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:35,698
And while we do that,
we must wait for the answer.

481
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,492
PERSONNEL RECORD CARD: YOON SAE-BOM

482
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,012
It's still out.

483
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,857
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY TOO, MOM

484
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,657
I even told her that
I had to do something about this.

485
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,690
Yi-hyun.

486
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,736
What is that?

487
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,739
A catcher's mask.

488
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,992
Is Seo-yoon still asleep?

489
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,094
We're police officers with public power,
so we can't just sit still.

490
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,096
Hey, we're in quarantine too.

491
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,599
And we're not here
because we're police officers,

492
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,101
and this won't raise our salary, either.

493
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,853
That's true, but…

494
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
I'm sure there are those who are
not infected in other buildings too.

495
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,109
We must find a way to save them.

496
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,944
You should think of your own survival.

497
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,572
You can't even run
because of your knee injury.

498
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,783
I'm still faster than old men.

499
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,869
I'll be back soon, so wait.

500
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,537
-Hey!
-You'll wake her.

501
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,206
Good morning.

502
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,251
Seo-yoon, just stay in bed.

503
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,379
You won't grow taller
if you get up right away. Stay in bed.

504
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,181
Aren't you coming?

505
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,643
No, I don't go to dangerous places
because they're dangerous.

506
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,978
Okay…

507
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,192
Hey, you're going to have to
go through me first.

508
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,861
Is it me or the residents?

509
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,991
Good grief, seriously…

510
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,037
There's nothing out there.
Everyone's mistaken.

511
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,872
How many times do I have to tell you?

512
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,416
Think of our kids.

513
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,294
If we get hurt, it won't count
as an industrial accident.

514
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,004
Everyone.

515
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,551
Please remember. Safety comes first, okay?

516
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,930
I heard that your wife passed away.

517
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,848
May she rest in peace.

518
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,523
Thank you.

519
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,110
Give us money too.

520
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,363
But you said the infected are out there.

521
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,992
Yes, and since I'm paid by the government,
I should lead everyone.

522
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,371
I hope you choke on money.

523
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,706
And some for Yi-hyun.

524
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,291
Are you going to take it?

525
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,752
No, thank you.

526
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,719
I don't like your behavior today.

527
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,137
Sorry.

528
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,056
You just violated
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.

529
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,225
Can you put this on?

530
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,780
From now on, I will lead this group.

531
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,575
Once you go outside, please be quiet.

532
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,869
Why should we follow your orders?

533
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,205
Because I'm sure you don't want to die.

534
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:11,682
Lord, please protect those
who are worried and sad about the disease,

535
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,436
and cure those who are ill.

536
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,901
Please comfort the families
grieving death,

537
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,028
-and…
-Amen.

538
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,491
You're being noisy! Stop it already!

539
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,369
Don't touch me. Lord…

540
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,705
What did you just blabber about?

541
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,333
I said, don't touch me!

542
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,878
Has she gone mad?

543
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,088
Good grief.

544
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,012
Where are you going?

545
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,514
Hey!

546
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,265
That little…

547
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,811
This household is a total mess!

548
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,663
Be careful!

549
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,792
There really is no one out here.

550
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,169
Maybe they all left without us.

551
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,981
Hi.

552
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,359
I want to help too.

553
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,611
So you can record
and upload another video?

554
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,114
I will get permission before I upload it.
I promise.

555
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,241
Hi.

556
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,996
Let's hurry.

557
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,414
Follow me.

558
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,754
Are you all okay?

559
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,797
I heard you were infected.

560
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,639
There were some internal problems.

561
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,433
A possibly infected person
was found during a meeting,

562
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:01,644
so we locked them up
in the children's library.

563
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,107
Wasn't there one in your building too?

564
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,360
Is that person okay?

565
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,655
Did the condition worsen by any chance?

566
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,578
Mister.

567
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:23,707
Don't you remember me?

568
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,543
Of course, I do.

569
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,128
You aimed a gun at me yesterday morning.

570
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,463
No, after that.

571
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,882
Then is everyone safe

572
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,677
except for the infected
in the children's library?

573
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,304
Yes, we told them to just stay home.

574
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,308
And a few of us will be in charge
of outer communication.

575
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,561
Mister! Stop recording, will you?

576
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,822
Then you didn't get boxed lunches?

577
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,283
We've been waiting, but they didn't come.

578
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,035
It looks like something
happened outside too.

579
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,167
Excuse me, is anyone out there?

580
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,339
Honey.

581
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,230
Are you going to stay here?

582
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,358
-Yes.
-Then keep waiting.

583
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,322
We should get going now.

584
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,798
What are they doing there?

585
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,092
They want to go outside.

586
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,386
They're afraid that the disease
will occur again.

587
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,557
And if they can't resist their thirst,
they will look for more victims.

588
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,769
What should we do now?

589
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,812
The supermarket.

590
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,523
We have to have as much food as possible.

591
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,448
Are you really infected with that
Mad Human Disease or something?

592
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:20,991
I am not.

593
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,661
You used to smoke marijuana
when you were in the US too.

594
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,664
-You still haven't broken that habit?
-It's not that!

595
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,916
You little punk!

596
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,086
I brought you here
to get closer to the residents,

597
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,754
and you take drugs! You asshole.

598
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,547
Yeon-ok.

599
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,548
Hey.

600
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,344
Don't act like you know me from now on.

601
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,145
Is it really dangerous outside?

602
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,233
If I were you, I would never go outside.

603
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,287
I only have a bunch of useless losers…

604
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,792
If I were you,
I wouldn't take the elevator.

605
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,379
You can't escape if you find
someone infected in a small space.

606
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,981
That's ridiculous.

607
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,276
How can a human being
suddenly change like that…

608
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,528
Ma'am, please open the door!

609
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,281
There are patients
in other buildings right now!

610
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,158
-Really?
-Yes, hurry.

611
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,041
I brought news from outside too.
It's crazy out there.

612
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
Okay.

613
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,050
By the way, are you injured?

614
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,594
Your neck, I mean.

615
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,761
I got scratched a bit.

616
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,222
Open the door first.

617
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:08,891
Wait.

618
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,402
There are symptoms
that show before the disease occurs.

619
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,405
The infected feel extreme thirst.

620
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:28,076
And they also show compulsive behaviors

621
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,996
like hitting the wall
when they're alone in an empty space.

622
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,164
Are you…

623
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,751
thirsty?

624
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:25,634
Those people seemed a bit weird,
but they didn’t look ill.

625
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,972
Should we have just
waited for boxed lunches too?

626
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,640
You can go and wait for them.

627
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,684
-Let's go get food first.
-Okay.

628
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,064
Get more water than food.

629
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,118
But how do we pay for this?

630
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,249
You grew up to become
more righteous than I thought.

631
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,793
That's not what it is.

632
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,587
What do you mean? That's what it is.

633
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,715
No, I'm just trying to stick
to the rules as best as I can.

634
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,302
I feel like if I cross the line once,
then the line might move by itself.

635
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,929
Right.

636
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,973
Okay, sir.

637
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,808
You're very pure and clean.

638
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,644
Like Type 1 water. So pure.

639
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,841
It's okay, calm down.

640
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,845
Get the instant noodles. That one.

641
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,972
Are there any more instant noodles?

642
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,224
Ice cream.

643
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,932
Hey, what are you doing?

644
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,896
-What?
-Oh, no.

645
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,289
Let's go.

646
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,348
Hello, my fans!

647
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,433
This is Dong-hyun.

648
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,768
I'm at a supermarket,

649
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,354
and there's blood on the floor.

650
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,108
My gosh.

651
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:34,364
For all of you, I will risk everything
and make really fun content.

652
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,118
I love you, my fans!

653
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,798
Young lady, what are you doing there?

654
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,467
Young lady.

655
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,642
Be quiet.

656
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,730
People suddenly poured in.

657
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:55,153
They had weird eyes.
I got scared, so I was hiding here.

658
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,697
What about those infected people?
Did they go outside?

659
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,574
I don't know.

660
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,702
Let's get out of here.

661
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,498
Hurry.

662
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,670
There's blood.

663
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,797
Let's get out of here.
Where are the others?

664
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,590
I don't know.

665
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,561
Run!

666
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,586
-What?
-There are people in there.

667
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,628
Hey!

668
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,463
We can't just leave them here!

669
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,007
I mean, I'm coming with you.

670
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,886
Over here! Hurry!

671
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,086
What are you doing? Let's go.

672
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,397
Mister.

673
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,192
Go down to the first floor.

674
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:58,944
Why?

675
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,948
Sae-bom said you should come down
if she doesn't come back by 10.

676
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,036
Okay, I will.

677
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,084
You really saw it?

678
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,169
Yes, I did!

679
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,047
And why did they go out
when it's so dangerous?

680
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,427
What if they all come back infected?

681
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,888
You're right.

682
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:40,318
I can't open this door
unless our safety is assured.

683
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:41,861
Yes.

684
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,948
Yes, go ahead. Sure.

685
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,411
That old lady is just like me.

686
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,131
Open the door!

687
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,425
-Is anyone infected?
-Open the door!

688
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
Come closer. I have to check.

689
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,222
Open the door, now!

690
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,810
Why is there blood on your face?
Did you get bitten?

691
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,894
Open the door, now!

692
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,146
No!

693
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,314
I said, open the door!

694
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,400
-You got bitten, didn't you?
-Come on!

695
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,402
We're all fine! Open the door, now!

696
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,655
Open the door!

697
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,450
Go on.

698
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,909
No!

699
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,579
Open the door!

700
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,372
Smash it!

701
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,749
Please…

702
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,625
We're really going to smash it down!

703
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,923
Open it!

704
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,551
What's that sound?

705
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,554
-Open the door! Hey!
-The sound Min-ji made.

706
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,474
What are you trying to do with that…

707
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,560
I told you we only need
to persuade the couple downstairs.

708
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,353
Dead men tell no tales.

709
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,522
Corpses can't talk.

710
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,149
No!

711
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,443
Open the door, now!

712
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,946
The infected cannot come in here!

713
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,447
Open it, now!

714
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,407
Open the door, now!

715
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
I can't open it!

716
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,329
Open the door!

717
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,956
Hey, what's all this…

718
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,958
-Open the door!
-What are you doing?

719
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,419
Let go!

720
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,673
Hey!

721
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,174
Open the door!

722
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,301
Open the door, now!

723
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,054
-Open the door, now!
-Open the door!

724
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,390
-Open the door, now!
-Open the door!

725
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,936
Lady, hurry!

726
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,146
Open the door, now!

727
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,566
You!

728
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:28,236
-Who do you think you are…
-Stop that!

729
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,696
-Die!
-Don't do this!

730
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,199
What are you doing? Get in!

731
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,203
-Go away!
-Damn it!

732
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,081
-Come here!
-Please stop!

733
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,461
Honey, stop! Please!

734
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,422
-Come here!
-Stop it!

735
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,507
-Turn this thing off!
-What's wrong with you!

736
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,010
-Calm down, please!
-Let go!

737
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,312
Oh Joo-hyung did this.

738
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,287
What a shame.

739
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,331
That was a good chance.

740
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,957
What a waste.

741
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,127
What's with that look on your face?

742
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,837
I didn't do anything.

743
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,881
I did nothing wrong. What's the problem?

744
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,716
Oh Joo-hyung!

745
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,055
Did you bring my phone?

746
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,479
What the…

747
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,109
What?

748
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,487
What are you trying
to charge me with this time?

749
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,288
Are you crazy?

750
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,168
This blood is from outside.

751
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,796
Are you scared now?

752
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,423
Are you scared
that you might get infected now?

753
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,467
You asshole!

754
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,557
Yi-hyun!

755
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,746
Once the Internet starts to work again,
it will be a big hit!

756
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,637
Darn it.

757
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,999
Sorry, I was a bit agitated.

758
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,752
If it weren't for you,

759
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,338
all of us might've gotten infected.

760
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,765
Good job, Yi-hyun.

761
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,786
-The one responsible should repent!
-Repent!

762
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:09,040
-Take responsibility for the infected!
-Take responsibility!

763
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:13,211
-Protect the survivors!
-Protect! 

764
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,255
-Give a definite answer on compensation!
-Give a definite answer!

765
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,550
Lieutenant Colonel,
an infected escaped from the apartments.

766
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,261
He's in serious condition.
Shall we take him back?

767
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,098
Take responsibility for the infected!

768
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,724
-Release him.
-What?

769
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,730
Release him, making it look like
a mistake, and let the protesters see him.

770
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,818
And suppress him quickly,
so no one would get hurt.

771
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,736
Lieutenant Colonel.

772
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,697
We should not let them pity the infected.

773
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,865
We must make them fear them
and want to avoid them.

774
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,453
That will buy us time
until the antibodies are developed.

775
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,948
All the residents here
are extremely anxious.

776
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,367
I want to buy that drug.

777
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,744
Yes, that's it!

778
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,875
If you think outside of the box,
you can get tons of ideas.

779
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,210
The situation will only get worse.

780
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,046
We must kick him out.
That's the only way we can survive.

781
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,466
-The ones who bought the drugs.
-The 15th floor.

782
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,593
So we wait
until the infected are all dead?

783
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,723
If you messed with Sae-bom,
I'm going to kill you.

784
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:56,856
