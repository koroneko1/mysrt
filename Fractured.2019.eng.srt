1
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,875
It's crazy!
What do you want me to say?

2
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm trying here, Jo!

3
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,803
Just...
You tell me what you need me to say.

4
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,375
The fact that you don't know what to say,
that's the problem.

5
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,000
You know what it is?
They just never liked me.

6
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,708
No, that's not true.

7
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,601
Really, 'cause your Dad's sitting there
offering me wine as if he didn't know.

8
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,184
And your Mom's just sittin'
on the other side of the table

9
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,042
shootin' me dirty looks.

10
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,351
Maybe she was upset
because the turkey was getting cold, Ray.

11
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,559
What do I got to do with the turkey?

12
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,143
It took so long for you to get us there.

13
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:34,958
I was driving 55.
I drove the speed limit.

14
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,917
Is that the problem, Jo?
I am a safe driver.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,625
Okay.

16
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,500
Look, why don't we just go home

17
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,042
and do Thanksgiving all over again,
all right?

18
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,833
Just the three of us. Our way.

19
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,833
We could get pizza. Peri loves pizza.

20
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,542
And then we can be thankful
for each other.

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,917
Yeah?

22
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,208
We need to stop kidding ourselves, Ray.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,958
We're just...

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
broken.

25
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,542
We have been for a long time.

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,583
I don't know why you would say that.

27
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,958
I would talk to you about it

28
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,642
if we ever actually talked,
but we don't.

29
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,625
That's not fair.

30
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,000
I work,
and sometimes I just like to... think.

31
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,750
But you don't fight for anything anymore.
You used to.

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,917
What about us?

33
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,000
Who do you want me to be?

34
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,833
I want you to be yourself.

35
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,167
The guy that I married six years ago.

36
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,292
The guy that I used to laugh with
and... and... and dream with and...

37
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,542
I'm still that guy, Jo.

38
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,375
I'm in a patch, and I admit it,

39
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,917
but I love you, okay?

40
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,417
And maybe I should just say it more often,

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,083
'cause I love you...

42
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,125
Ray!

43
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,917
Jesus.

44
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,500
- It's not working.
- Okay.

45
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,958
It broke, Mommy, and the songs won't play.

46
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,583
Let me see it, baby.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,333
Probably the batteries.

48
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,708
Right, Daddy?

49
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah. Probably the batteries.

50
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,000
You brought extras, right? I told you.

51
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,750
I left them on the... the counter.

52
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,042
Daddy will get you some more batteries,
all right, sweetie?

53
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,500
Hey, I have an idea.

54
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,292
Let's play I Spy.

55
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,125
- Blech.
- Blech?

56
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,408
- What do you mean, "blech"?
- Why don't we sing a song?

57
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,792
- Let's start with one obvious one.
- Let's sing a song.

58
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,417
- "Shake It Off."
- I Spy...

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,250
Hm. That's a good one too,
but I'm thinking more "Sing a Rainbow."

60
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,583
Okay.

61
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,625
- Maybe it's gotten a little babyish, Ray.
- One,

62
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,042
two... <i>♪ Red and yellow ♪</i>

63
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,000

<i>♪ Sing a rainbow with me ♪</i>

73
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,167
Daddy?

74
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
Yeah?

75
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,042
I gotta go potty.

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
What, right now?

77
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,042
- I gotta go.
- Can you hold it?

78
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,417
No.

79
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,167
Okay, I'll pull over
at the next rest stop, and then we'll...

80
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,750
tinkle. Okay?

81
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,333
Maybe they'll have batteries.

82
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,417
Mommy, come on! I have to go!

83
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,875
All right, baby.

84
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
Lean forward.

85
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,583
Remember, we don't touch anything
that we don't have to in there.

86
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,542
Can you get me a Coke, please?

87
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,667
- Yeah.
- I don't know why, but I'm parched.

88
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,542
And can I get a four-pack
of AA batteries, please?

89
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,792
And two of these, please.

90
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,292
Okay.

91
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,375
No plastic.

92
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,125
Okay, just... just the coffee
and the Coke and the...

93
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,708
Thank you.

94
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,083
Did you get batteries?

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,083
They didn't have any.

96
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,417
Mommy, my compact! Where is it?

97
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,392
I don't know,
why are you asking me, Per?

98
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,167
Because it's gone!

99
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,143
What... Did you check
on the seat under your bum?

100
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,167
Yes, it's not there.

101
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,583
- I had it in the ladies' room, remember?
- You check your pocket?

102
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,750
In the ladies' room?

103
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,167
Okay. Well, I will go check

104
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,250
in the ladies' room.
But if I find it in there,

105
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,293
you don't get to touch it
until we get home, okay?

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,333
Okay.

107
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,262
Will you check in the back,
under the seats?

108
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,083
Yeah.

109
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
Daddy, check the seats.

110
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,375
Come on.

111
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,792
Up, up, up.
Here we go. I got ya.

112
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:47,958
All right.
Right, just stay right there.

113
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,333
Peri, where is the...
It's a pigsty back here.

114
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,125
Where am I even meant to begin,
you know?

115
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,833
God damn it!

116
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Daddy.

117
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,833
I just...

118
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,292
This shi...
This is gonna stain. You know?

119
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:12,375
What if I wanted to resell this car?
Can't even do that.

120
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,958
I guess this is just the cherry
on the cake, this is.

121
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,000
Come on...

122
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,917
Peri, there's no sign of the thing.

123
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,292
Daddy.

124
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,583
Daddy!

125
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,417
- Daddy!
- What? What?

126
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,542
Peri, don't move.

127
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,585
All right, don't be scared.
Just stay right there.

128
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,458
Hey! Dog! Go on!

129
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,042
Hey! Go on.

130
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,083
Go on. Go on, move.
No, no, Peri, not you. J-Just stay there.

131
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,167
Peri, don't move.

132
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,792
Don't move. Don't move, okay?

133
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,875
Go on!

134
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,917
Go on, get!

135
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,667
Don't move.

136
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:30,917
Peri, stop.

137
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,792
Don't move.

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,167
It's gonna be okay.

139
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,333
I'm just gonna scare him.

140
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,125
No!

141
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,542
No!

142
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,708
<i>Sorry, Mr. Monroe. She's gone.</i>

143
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>They're both gone.</i>

144
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,708
Ray?

145
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,042
Uh, Ray? Ray?

146
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,167
Ray? Ray!

147
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,292
Ray! Ray! Ray!
Ray! Ray!

148
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,833
Ray! Ray!

149
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,375
My baby!

150
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Ray! Ray!

151
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,208
Daddy.

152
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,292
Peri? Baby? Baby?

153
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,542
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Baby?

154
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,542
Baby? Baby?

155
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,500
- Joanne, don't move her.
- She's okay. She's okay. She's okay.

156
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,500
Put her down.

157
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
She's okay. She's okay.

158
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,333
There you go.

159
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm right here. I'm right here.

160
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,333
You hurt?

161
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,333
I don't think so.

162
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,167
Okay. Well, there doesn't seem to be
any scratches or bruises.

163
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,000
Ray, she needs a doctor.

164
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,958
I know what I'm doin'.

165
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,333
- Ray...
- I'm gonna pick you up, all right?

166
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,458
- Ow!
- Hold on. What is it? What is it?

167
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,958
- My arm, Daddy. It hurts.
- This arm?

168
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,375
I think it's broken.

169
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,750
Let's try again.

170
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,292
Nice and slow.

171
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,042
Don't hurt me, Daddy.

172
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,917
I would never hurt you, sweetie.

173
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,500
I would never hurt you.

174
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,542
Gentle, Daddy.

175
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,667
- Gentle, Ray.
- Okay. It's all right. Up we go.

176
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,833
Here we go.
Daddy's got you.

177
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,875
Here we go. Yeah, here we go.
Here we are.

178
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:34,750
Here we go.

179
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,167
Shh. It's okay.

180
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,583
I'm calling 911.

181
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,250
- Don't bother. I'll drive.
- Ray...

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,042
I saw a hospital sign a few miles back.

183
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,765
By the time that ambulance gets here,
we'd have gotten her to help.

184
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,708
Are you sure?

185
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,833
Joanne, I got this.

186
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,476
We're gonna stay awake
until we get to the hospital.

187
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
Daddy's gonna get us there
real fast. Okay?

188
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,917
Move.

189
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,167
Hurry, Ray, hurry.

190
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,583
Nearly there.

191
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,792
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

192
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,083
Oh!

193
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,292
Ray. Hurry.

194
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,042
Ray?

195
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Ray.

196
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,083
Ray!

197
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,250
Okay.

198
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,333
There it is! There it is. There it is.

199
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,250
Okay. Daddy's got us.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,583
- Almost there.
- We're there.

201
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,000
All right, right.

202
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,333
I'll go get a wheelchair.

203
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,083
Nah, I'm gonna carry her. Okay, sweetie.

204
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,333
I'll go get us checked in. All right?
I won't be long, sweetie.

205
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,125
Okay.

206
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,958
We've been waiting for hours.
What's taking so long?

207
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,167
I understand.

208
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,625
- He's in pain.
- I apologize.

209
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,083
I'm gonna find someone
for you here, right...

210
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,000
Ray.

211
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,083
This is gonna take a sec.

212
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,085
You should take a seat,
make her more comfortable.

213
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,708
She's really hurting.

214
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,792
I know. I'll take care of it.

215
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,542
Okay.

216
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,934
So it doesn't matter
that the address has changed,

217
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,250
That's okay? All right.

218
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,875
Excuse me. I need a doctor.
There's been an accident.

219
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,934
- Do you mind?
- Take a seat. We'll be with you shortly.

220
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,268
- Hang on, it's my daughter.
- No!

221
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,226
- We think she broke her arm.
- Sir, take a seat, and I assure you...

222
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,809
- She's in a lot of pain!
- We'll get you checked in

223
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,167
as soon as possible.

224
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,000
- Take a seat.
- I just need to see someone.

225
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,333
Enough. Sit down.

226
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,625
Wait your turn. Please.

227
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,042
I'm sure it won't be long.

228
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,583
I heard her, Ray.

229
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,542
Mm-hmm. Just stay calm.

230
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,458
I'll be calm
when a doctor sees our daughter.

231
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,750
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

232
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,667
Daddy's gonna take care of us.

233
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,167
What do you want me to do?
You want me to kick down the doors

234
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,708
- and drag a doctor out here?
- Yes.

235
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,750
That I'd like to see.

236
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,625
Do something.

237
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,667
Do something, Ray.

238
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,292
Sir?

239
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,500
How can I help you, sir?

240
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah, I really need to see that doctor,
right now.

241
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:22,833
I understand.

242
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,917
But as I told you before, sir,
there are other patients ahead of you.

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,125
Can you just squeeze us in?

244
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,726
She's sick.
She doesn't know what's going on.

245
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,708
- Did you sign in?
- What?

246
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,833
It moves a lot faster if you sign in.

247
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,750
Y-You told me to sit down.

248
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,083
Mr. Fellows? Dale Fellows.

249
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,607
Hi, Dale. How are you feeling today?

250
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,500
He has a sharp pain in his stomach.

251
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,708
Bit of paperwork first,
and we'll get him admitted.

252
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,768
Would you happen to know
what Dale's blood type is?

253
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:46,792
B positive.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,708
Another one.
Maybe 15 years old.

255
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,792
B positive.

256
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,000
Let Dr. Berthram know.

257
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,083
<i>Dr. Berthram...
Dr. Berthram...</i>

258
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,083
Please go back to your seat, sir.

259
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,958
I'll let you know
when a doctor becomes available.

260
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,500
- We're on the list now.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She's sleeping.

262
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,583
Okay.

263
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,708
Here, hold this.

264
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,667
It's so hot in here.

265
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,625
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,250
I didn't mean to...
bite your head off earlier.

267
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,875
It's okay. Uh...

268
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,333
We're gonna be fine.

269
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,292
Thank you.

270
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,250
For what?

271
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,917
For getting us here so fast.

272
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,292
I just did what needed to be done.

273
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,542
- Well, you missed your calling.
- Yeah?

274
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,875
Driving NASCAR.

275
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,833
Ah, man, I missed that.

276
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,292
Missed what?

277
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,333
Just... laughing with you.

278
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,917
Mm...

279
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,542
You okay?

280
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:17,458
My head is just...

281
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,750
mm, like, throbbing.

282
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,958
I mean, you're probably dehydrated.

283
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,625
I can fix that.

284
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,083
There you go.

285
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,042
- Thank you.
<i>- Who are they?</i>

286
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,667
<i>They are the ones who fight
and don't give up,</i>

287
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,667
<i>keeping our families safe.</i>

288
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,708
<i>Sons, husbands, fathers. Our heroes.</i>

289
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,542
Monroe. Ray Monroe.

290
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,458
Yeah, go on.

291
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,167
Can I see
your driver's license and insurance card?

292
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,958
- All this information is correct?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,417
Your occupation?

294
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,208
I work at Craft Home Improvement.

295
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,833
He's the assistant manager

296
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,292
for the kitchen
and bathroom design center.

297
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,708
Has Peri had any prior surgeries?

298
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:44,792
Allergies?

299
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,875
Yes. She reacts to penicillin.
Her skin breaks out in a rash.

300
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,875
Any history of mental illness
in the family?

301
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,125
No.

302
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,167
Drugs? Alcoholism?

303
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,042
I'm a recovering alcoholic.
How long is this going to take?

304
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,250
Just a couple of minutes.

305
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:07,625
Your insurance records show
a prior dependent, Abby Monroe.

306
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:09,917
My first wife is deceased.

307
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,667
And this happened...?

308
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
Eight years ago. Why is this relevant?

309
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,333
There's just an overlap in your plan
that your PPO never fixed.

310
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,958
Were you at the same employer then?

311
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:24,042
No. I was self-employed and, um...

312
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,458
- Listen...
- And you're married?

313
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,292
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Of course, yeah.

314
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,500
- How many years?
- Six.

315
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,750
Honestly, how long is this gonna take?

316
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,333
We're almost finished.

317
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,875
Would you like Peri listed
for organ donation?

318
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,417
No.

319
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,000
Can I convince you to reconsider?

320
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,083
The number of children
on the transplant list is...

321
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,625
Not now, please.

322
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,250
What is your daughter's blood type?

323
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,333
Your blood types?

324
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,125
O, I think.

325
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,750
That's all right.
We can crossmatch later if necessary.

326
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,434
- Why would that be necessary?
- Last one.

327
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,917
The state requires me to ask
if everything is safe in the household.

328
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:12,917
- Really?
- Ray...

329
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,708
With these types of injuries, sir,
I am mandated by law.

330
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,292
Okay, but this was an accident
at a construction site.

331
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,042
Ray... Yes, we're safe.
Our household...

332
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,750
- is safe.
- Mommy?

333
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,500
All right, then. We're done.

334
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,583
I'll get a nurse to take you back. Oh.

335
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,917
My arm, it still hurts.

336
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,125
- What?
- I know, sweetheart.

337
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,375
Sir, it looks like we don't take
your type of medical insurance here.

338
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:37,542
- Ray...
- I'm sorry.

339
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,333
If you call your provider,
they can give you a list of qualified...

340
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,177
A list? I don't need a list.
I need a doctor.

341
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,292
This hospital's admission policy
requires proof of coverage.

342
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,833
Whatever it takes, I'll cover it. Okay?

343
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,042
You do take cash here?
You got an ATM?

344
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,375
You take cash?

345
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,667
I will have to check.

346
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Excuse me.

347
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,083
This is insane.

348
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,833
I can't believe this, can you?

349
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,167
She's sitting there going...

350
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,625
"Your shoe size?"

351
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,042
Mommy?

352
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,458
- He doesn't have...
- Did you find my compact?

353
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,542
We didn't, sweetheart,
but I'm gonna buy you another one soon.

354
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,083
Everything's fine, Mr. Monroe.

355
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,447
- You're good to go.
- Fantastic.

356
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,820
Nurse Anne will get you situated.

357
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,875
Okay.

358
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,417
- Hi, is this Peri?
- Yes.

359
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,042
- We'll get you taken care of right away.
- Yes, another one.

360
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,934
- Come on, baby.
- Sit in the wheelchair for me?

361
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:42,500
A walk-in. Six-year-old female,
unknown blood type.

362
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,583
Let Dr. Berthram know.

363
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,708
Kirkbride serves three counties,
so it can get quite busy.

364
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,672
And EMS just brought in
a couple of head traumas

365
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,292
- so it's backed us up a bit.
- Yeah, I saw that. What happened?

366
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,125
A couple of teenagers. Head-on collision.
It was a drunk driver.

367
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,208
That's horrible. They all right?

368
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,458
As I understand it,
it's touch-and-go.

369
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,458
Do you have to do that?

370
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:07,542
He's in a lot of pain.

371
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,708
I just need to know
where he's hurting, okay?

372
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,583
Okay, sweetheart.
There you are. Okay.

373
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,625
Doctor will be right in.

374
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,542
Hey, baby.

375
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,985
Hey, just keep that arm in your lap,
lay back on the pillow.

376
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,750
- Won't be long.
- Better not be...

377
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,333
or I'm gonna break somebody's arm.

378
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,833
Not mine, I hope.

379
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,417
Hi. I'm Dr. Berthram.

380
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,333
Hi.

381
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,042
- You must be...
- Peri.

382
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,917
- Peri.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

383
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,375
No, no, no, it's quite all right.

384
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,458
Sometimes I've gotta crack
a few heads myself around here

385
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,292
to get anything done.

386
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,625
So, Perry Mason,

387
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,375
what can we do for ya?

388
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,708
Monroe. Peri Monroe.

389
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,208
Oh! Yes. I see it now.

390
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,208
Yes. Peri. And that's P-E-R-I?

391
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,250
It's short for Periwinkle.

392
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,500
Isn't that sweet?

393
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,375
It's my mommy's favorite shell.

394
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,625
Okay, sweetheart.
Let's let the nice doctor do his job.

395
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,583
It's all right, I'm not that nice.

396
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:05,958
So...

397
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,667
what's the story, young lady?

398
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,125
I fell.

399
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,167
Oh, dear. Yeah.

400
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,542
Well, sooner or later, everybody does.

401
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,417
Right, Dad?

402
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,375
So, Peri,
I'm gonna see how that arm is doing,

403
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,875
and if anything hurts,

404
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,292
anything at all,

405
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,625
I want you to let me know. Deal?

406
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,333
- Deal.
- Okay.

407
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,333
Where did this happen?

408
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:34,000
- It's a gas station a few miles from here.
- We're on our way to Minneapolis.

409
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,708
Visiting Grandma and Grandpa
for Thanksgiving, I bet.

410
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,750
Uh-huh.

411
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,292
- All right, so you were at a gas station?
- Yup.

412
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,042
Yeah, off Route 20.

413
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,792
I know. I'm sorry.

414
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,083
Uh, there was a dog, and it scared her.

415
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,000
A dog?

416
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,708
Uh, it was just an accident.

417
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,333
You didn't say anything about a dog.

418
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:56,917
Did that hurt when I touched here?

419
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,625
- Yeah, I know, sweetie. That's an ouchie.
- Uh, it doesn't matter, she just fell.

420
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,792
And I nearly had you, didn't I?

421
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,833
So, sweetheart, when you fell,

422
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,792
did you hit your head, Peri? You did?

423
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,167
You know, you are a real trooper.

424
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:12,583
You think it's broken?

425
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,333
I think the swelling is consistent
with a fracture along the distal radius,

426
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,833
but we'll get an...
We'll get an X-ray to confirm that.

427
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,000
- She need a cast?
- We're going to put her in...

428
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,000
You're a brave girl. Yeah.

429
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't think
they're gonna have to amputate.

430
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,809
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you one thing.

431
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,958
In a few weeks,

432
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:33,583
this arm is gonna be as good as new.

433
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,125
Now, look at my shoulder.
Peri, look at my shoulder.

434
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,500
That's right. My shoulder.

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,833
That's right. Uh-huh.

436
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:43,333
Most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

437
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:48,458
Now, Peri, Nurse Anne is gonna come
and give you some medicine for the pain.

438
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,167
I gotta talk to Mommy and Daddy here
for a minute.

439
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,375
Um... ibuprofen. Check vitals please.

440
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,417
Uh, this way, guys.

441
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,083
Okay, baby.

442
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,333
<i>I'm concerned
about a possible head injury.</i>

443
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,042
There's no reason for alarm.

444
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,958
It's just I'm not seeing
the pupil dilation that I like.

445
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,875
Since you're traveling,

446
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:13,458
I'd like to do a CAT scan
just to rule out anything internal.

447
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,167
But she seems fine.

448
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,667
And I would agree with you,

449
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,750
but on the off chance
that it's bleeding around the brain,

450
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,000
what we would call a subdural hematoma,

451
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,667
now that can be quite serious.

452
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,458
A head injury like that could lead
to confusion, seizures,

453
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,375
even the possibility of slipping
into a coma.

454
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,458
We've... We've heard enough. Do it.

455
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, but you need to know...
it is a costly procedure.

456
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:41,625
I would do anything for my family,
so you do what you have to do.

457
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,792
Make sure she's okay.

458
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,375
That's a wise choice.

459
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,542
You know, that's a pretty nasty
little scrape you have yourself.

460
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:54,167
- Should I take a look?
- It's nothin'. I'm a tough guy.

461
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,958
Okay, well, give me a minute
to get things in motion for Peri.

462
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,125
Yeah.

463
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,458
She's all right, isn't she?

464
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,125
Yeah. Yeah, you heard him.
It's nothing.

465
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,583
It's just a precaution.
It's better to be safe, right?

466
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,375
We'll be fine.

467
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,208
We will, Ray.

468
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,083
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

469
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,708
Wow. Look... look at that.

470
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,875
This goes over your head
right here.

471
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,250
You're being so brave.

472
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,018
We're almost done,
and we get to go home soon.

473
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,542
He's going down to the lower level
for an appendectomy.

474
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,417
It looks like you're feeling better.

475
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,542
Hey, maybe we should get a motel
like the old days

476
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,083
and pick up the drive tomorrow.

477
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,042
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

478
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,167
My head is killing me.

479
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,125
Maybe they have a hot tub.

480
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,875
Hello, Peri.
Nurse Anne and I got this for you

481
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,042
for being the number one patient
of the day.

482
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,375
Oh! Ah, look at that. Thank you.
That's so sweet.

483
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,375
No problem.

484
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,875
- <i>I hope you feel better.</i>
- I'm Bruce.

485
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,737
And I'm gonna take you downstairs

486
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,553
so we can take a little peek
inside that little noggin of yours. Okay?

487
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,208
- Okay.
- Okay.

488
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,958
You know, you must have made
quite an impression on Dr. Berthram.

489
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,333
He does not crack a smile
for just anybody.

490
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, she's a real charmer.

491
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,042
Dad here must have to keep a shotgun handy

492
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,292
to chase off all the boys, am I right?

493
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,625
All right, keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle.

494
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,667
Mm-hmm.

495
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,958
So, this is a...
a more restricted part of the hospital.

496
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:46,333
I can only take one visitor down
with a patient to the lower level.

497
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,542
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

498
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:48,875
Hey, you go.

499
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,333
You sure?

500
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,708
Yeah, I'll be fine.

501
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,917
Okay.

502
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,917
Hey. I'm gonna wait right here for you
when you get out.

503
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,042
Actually, you might want to wait
out front.

504
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,750
Yeah, scans can take a while,
especially if they're backed up.

505
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,417
Okay, then.

506
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,708
I'll book that motel.

507
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,417
Daddy, can I have a pizza?

508
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,333
Yeah.

509
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:17,167
- With extra cheese.
- Extra cheese.

510
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,250
Yeah.

511
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,292
I love you, Daddy.

512
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,042
I love you, sweetheart.

513
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:26,833
You did good.

514
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,958
Okay. Okay, okay. We'll see you in a few.

515
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,042
Yeah.

516
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,583
Yeah.

517
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,667
Next year, we fly.

518
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,042
How about next year, we stay home?

519
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,708
<i>Daddy!</i>

520
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,667
Next time, we fly.

521
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,708
Hey, buddy, you all right?

522
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,208
You were talkin' in your sleep.

523
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,612
<i>Well, suppose somebody came along</i>

524
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,547
<i>and offered you
a million dollars for your life.</i>

525
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,833
<i>Would you take it?
John, don't even talk like that.</i>

526
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,250
<i>Do you mean I'll be... dead?</i>

527
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,583
No, I'm fine.

528
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,583
<i>Well, not me.</i>

529
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,083
<i>I wouldn't take it.</i>

530
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,542
<i>Your life is worth
more than a million dollars,</i>

531
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,292
<i>so don't bet it on getting around</i>

532
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,750
<i>in a car in order to save
a couple of minutes.</i>

533
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,333
<i>The gamble isn't worth it.</i>

534
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:26,167
<i>The stakes are too high
for what you can possibly get out of it.</i>

535
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,875
- It still hurts.
- Excuse me.

536
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,601
I think my baby has an infection
or something. He won't stop crying.

537
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,333
Okay, how long has that been going on for?

538
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,708
A couple of days.

539
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:56,917
Okay, um, well,
I'm gonna get you to sign this form.

540
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,292
If you'll just take a seat, sir.
Thank you.

541
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,625
How may I help you?

542
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,917
Do you know how much longer it's gonna be?

543
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,792
Sir, I'm gonna need
a little more information than that.

544
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,042
My daughter, Peri Monroe,
she went for a CAT scan with my wife.

545
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,708
Okay, so she checked in before?

546
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:44,625
Yeah.

547
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,875
All right, morning shift
would have taken care of that.

548
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,226
I don't have the imaging schedule,
but it can take a little while.

549
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,625
Yeah. They told me that, I just...

550
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,458
You know, I know my kid.
She's gonna be hungry

551
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,875
I just wanna check on her.

552
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,417
As I said, sir,
I don't have that information here.

553
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
It's been hours.

554
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,902
And if you just take a seat,
I'm sure she'll be out shortly.

555
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,542
<i>Cardiology, 54-12. Cardiology.</i>

556
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,333
I'd like to speak with Dr. Berthram.

557
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,708
Dr. Berthram has left for the day.

558
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,000
But he was helping us.

559
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:18,917
I understand,

560
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,750
but he would have passed his cases
to the other doctor on duty.

561
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,434
I can have the nurse's station
pass along a message to the on-duty,

562
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,458
- All right?
- Yeah.

563
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,625
If you'll just give me a moment.

564
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,583
<i>- Oh, no!
- Truck!</i>

565
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:46,125
<i>I lived it again and again,
like in slow motion...</i>

566
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,417
<i>We're gonna hit it!</i>

567
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,917
It's enough to drive you nuts, isn't it?

568
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,750
Sorry?

569
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,542
The wait.
I've seen you sitting over there.

570
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,542
My husband went in at 6:00 a.m.

571
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,583
Melanoma.

572
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,250
Pretty simple procedure.

573
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,125
Now it's almost dinnertime.

574
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,000
Hurry up and wait.

575
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,167
Hurry up and pay.

576
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,333
Sometimes they hope
we all just die in the meantime.

577
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,917
Uh, what are you in for?

578
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,125
Nothing.

579
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,888
<i>Call a doctor for Tommy.
Call an ambulance.</i>

580
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:42,917
Excuse me.

581
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,542
What's that? It's...

582
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,250
Hi, how may I help you?

583
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,042
My daughter?

584
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,667
Oh, right, yes. I did leave word, sir,
but I haven't heard back yet.

585
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,167
Can you check again now, please?

586
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,042
Okay, what was her name again?

587
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,250
Peri Monroe.

588
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,917
Monroe. M-U-N?

589
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,875
No, M-O-N-R-O-E.

590
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,792
Okay, I have several Monroes here,
but I'm not seeing a Peri Monroe.

591
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,363
Could she be under another name?

592
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,625
I signed in.
I signed in on the clipboard, right?

593
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,167
It's right... It's right here.

594
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,434
Yeah, but that gets thrown out

595
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,434
at the end of each shift.
It would all be in the system by now,

596
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,333
but I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe."

597
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,250
That's crazy 'cause we were admitted.

598
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,417
You know,
you asked us for all this information.

599
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,976
Yes, but the patient's file
is always under the patient's name,

600
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,184
and I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe."

601
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,417
She is a patient.
She's a patient of Dr. Berthram's.

602
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,768
- Yeah, he saw her.
- Dr. Berthram has left for the evening.

603
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,232
Yeah, I know that! You told me that!

604
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,458
Sir, there's no need...
to raise your voice.

605
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,083
Check again. When we came in,
in late morning, we did all this,

606
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,167
and then they took her down
to the CAT scan.

607
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,333
Okay, maybe they put it
under your insurance number.

608
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,292
Can I get your card?

609
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,833
You wouldn't take my insurance.
You said that I could pay cash.

610
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,625
- Cash?
- Yeah, all worked out.

611
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,542
The woman who admitted us,
she asked. They said it was fine.

612
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,268
I've just never heard it being done
that way before.

613
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:05,500
Yeah, I don't care about that
because I don't make the rules. All right?

614
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,792
Let's ask her.
Let's ask the woman that checked us in.

615
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,750
She's already gone.

616
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,542
Then let's ask the ER, all right?

617
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,476
Because there was a nurse named Anne,
there was an orderly, his name was Bruce.

618
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,851
There's been a full shift rotation.

619
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,417
I just want to see my wife and daughter,
and they're back there.

620
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,458
Unless I can identify you
with a patient, I...

621
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,458
It's been a long day,

622
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,934
and I just need you to call down
to where they do the CAT scans

623
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:29,667
and see if there's a woman
and a six-year-old kid still there,

624
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,167
and whether they're waiting,
or if they want to come home.

625
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,833
Can you do that, please?

626
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,667
You're... You're bleeding.

627
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,542
Hi, this is the main desk.

628
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh, hi, Tim.

629
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,125
You better stop,
or I'll make you live up to that.

630
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,333
Um, anyway, I'm just calling
about a little girl.

631
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,417
She came up for a scan.

632
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,833
Late morning.

633
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:02,583
I know, I know,
but can you check for me, please?

634
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,500
You're bad.

635
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,875
Bye.

636
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,583
I'm sorry, sir, there hasn't been a scan
since nine o'clock this morning,

637
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,833
and it was for a 62-year-old woman's hip.

638
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,667
So what are you telling me?

639
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm sorry, they're not here.

640
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,833
What? What? You lost my family?

641
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,817
Maybe you're at the wrong hospital.

642
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,167
I've been sitting there all day.

643
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,601
Maybe they left
before you got here.

644
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,434
Why would they do that?
Why would they do that?

645
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,809
- We came together.
- I'm sorry, sir. Sir! They're not here.

646
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,851
Would you please excuse me

647
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,309
so I can deal
with the gentleman behind you?

648
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:46,417
- What are you saying?
- Hi, how may I help you?

649
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,875
My wife's been sitting over there
for two hours.

650
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,667
It's just going to be
a little bit longer.

651
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,167
Uh, excuse me, sir!
You can't go back there!

652
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,167
Drew, that man,
he shouldn't be back there.

653
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
Call security.

654
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,583
What the hell? Do you mind?

655
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,583
- I'm so sorry, I'm just looking for...
- Hey!

656
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,333
- You're not supposed to be back here.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

657
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,083
- Hey! Hey!
- All right. Enough.

658
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,393
- Drew, what's going on?
- This guy just rushed in from up front.

659
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:46,097
Just... uh, my family's back here.
The receptionist, she wouldn't...

660
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,833
I don't give a shit, pal. Just calm down.

661
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,667
What is going on here?

662
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,018
I'm just looking for my wife and daughter.
Joanne and Peri Monroe.

663
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,333
Are they patients here?

664
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My daughter is.
That's what I'm trying to explain.

665
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:01,417
All right, all right,
let's all just take it easy. Okay?

666
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,542
I'm Dr. Lucado. And you?

667
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,875
Me, I'm Ray Monroe.

668
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,208
Okay, Ray...

669
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,917
why don't you tell me
what all this fuss is about.

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,292
Well, we came in earlier,
and my daughter saw Dr. Berthram, he...

671
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:16,542
- She had a potentially fractured arm.
- Okay, was she released?

672
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,833
No, no, no. She...
He was worried about a head injury.

673
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,684
He took her to the CAT scan.
Joanne went with her.

674
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,601
- That's the last time I saw her.
- This was when?

675
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,250
Hours ago.

676
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:31,125
- Monroe?
- M... M-O-N-R-O-E.

677
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,375
What a day, huh?

678
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:48,167
Got the whole day in front of me here,
and I'm not finding any Monroe.

679
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:55,292
Well, that's insane 'cause, you know,
we were here.

680
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,833
We were right... right there.

681
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,833
- All right...
- So was she. So was she.

682
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,167
She... She knows me.
She helped us. Ask her! Ask her!

683
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,875
Okay. Just calm down.
Anne, can I see you for a second?

684
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,417
- Yes?
- Have you seen this man before?

685
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:13,792
Yes.

686
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,767
- He was here on my earlier shift.
- See?

687
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,667
He was treated for a head injury.

688
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:19,958
A head injury?

689
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,583
That's not true.

690
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,667
I see.

691
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,958
Why are you lying?

692
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:28,417
That is a pretty nasty contusion
you have there.

693
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,375
You're lying.

694
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,667
- Ray, I need you to calm down.
- Just leave me alone.

695
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,018
- Ray, calm down.
- Stop calling me "Ray."

696
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:35,917
You don't even know me.
What have you done to my family?

697
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
- Where's my wife, huh?
- Calm down!

698
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,042
Where'd you take my family?

699
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,542
- Calm down!
- Get off me!

700
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,625
- Calm down!
- Droperidol. Five milligrams.

701
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,958
Get off me!

702
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,833
- Hold him still.
- Calm down!

703
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,125
Hold him still.

704
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,208
Ah!

705
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:49,958
Settle down!

706
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,292
We cannot have you disrupting
this hospital.

707
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,250
Hold him in four. I'll call upstairs.

708
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,208
Oh, God.

709
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:04,667
Yeah.

710
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,792
- Hey. Hey.
- Hold tight.

711
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:10,833
- Get up on there.
- Get off me. Get off.

712
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,117
Yeah, you gonna keep swinging?

713
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,250
Give me your hand. Give me your hand!

714
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,833
Please, please. You don't need them.

715
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,750
- You gonna behave yourself?
- Yeah.

716
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:18,833
It's okay.

717
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,625
I'm sorry. It's just...
Just a little confused, is all.

718
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,458
Wipe your eyes with this.

719
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:26,792
You're gonna be locked up in here

720
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,393
until the doctor can figure out
what you need, okay?

721
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,500
Lay down, let the sedative do its work.

722
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,292
Yeah, sure.

723
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,542
No...

724
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,542
Come on, wake up.

725
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,625
Wake up.

726
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,042
Wake up! Where is it?

727
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:27,125
Come on! Where is it?

728
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,083
All right. Hey.

729
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

730
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,167
Okay. Come on.

731
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:14,958
Three, two, one...

732
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,667
Oh, my God!

733
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,875
Call security!

734
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,208
Hey!

735
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:49,833
Hey. You remember me?

736
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,750
You remember my daughter, Peri Monroe?

737
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,250
<i>Your dad must have to keep
a shotgun handy</i>

738
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,083
to chase off all the boys,
am I right?

739
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:03,750
Hey! Hey! You!

740
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,042
Oh! Hey!

741
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,375
Oh!

742
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:21,917
Hey!

743
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, shit.

744
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,208
Whoa!

745
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,226
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

746
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,625
Fuck!

747
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,583
Ah!

748
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,917
- <i>Hey, Jeff. Jeff?</i>
- Fuck.

749
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,917
<i>Did you get him?</i>

750
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,542
Yeah, Frank, he got away.

751
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:13,833
<i>All right, what do you want me to do?</i>

752
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,917
Let reception know
in case he thinks he's comin' back.

753
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,167
Holy shit.

754
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,292
Oh, God.

755
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:58,417
Ah!

756
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,042
<i>We had a noise complaint.
Two white males in a vacant lot.</i>

757
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,750
<i>Looks like they may be getting high...</i>

758
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,458
- Hey! Stop!
- Oh, Jesus. What the fuck?

759
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,958
Help me! They've taken my family!

760
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,393
They just took 'em, just took my family.
They won't let me see them.

761
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:45,792
Step back. Calm down.

762
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,143
Then they gave me this shot and this drug,
and they kind of knocked me out.

763
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,559
- Relax.
- Maybe they gave the same thing

764
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,726
to my wife,
'cause I don't know what's happening.

765
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,390
- I don't know what happened.
- Calm down!

766
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,917
- I... I'm calm. I'm calm.
- What are you talkin' about?

767
00:47:56,083 --> 00:48:00,208
She's... My daughter's in there,
and she's only six.

768
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:01,833
Is this a custody thing?

769
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:06,375
No. We came here to get help,
and now they're saying that she didn't...

770
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,333
That she she never came here.

771
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:10,208
All right? They've done something.

772
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:13,073
They've done something,
and they're trying to cover it up.

773
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,708
What happened to your hand?

774
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:18,958
This? They locked me in a room.
I had to break out.

775
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,083
- All right. Can I see some ID, please?
- Yeah.

776
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:26,833
Here.

777
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:29,833
Here. That's them. That's them.
That's my wife.

778
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,333
That's... That's my daughter.

779
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,750
We were... It was Thanksgiving.
We were just going home,

780
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,083
and we stopped at this gas station,

781
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,018
and she falls over, she hurts herself,
and that's why we came here.

782
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,333
That's why I know they're still in there.

783
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,333
Okay. What are their names?

784
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,208
Joanne and Peri Monroe.

785
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:49,958
And I'm... I'm Ray.

786
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:51,792
Okay.

787
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,500
- You're gonna help me?
- All right.

788
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,743
Why don't we go inside
and see if we can sort this out?

789
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,917
- Would you please?
- Okay.

790
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,333
Come on.

791
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:03,708
Hey, it's the front desk.

792
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,125
Send somebody over here now.
It's him.

793
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,875
Hey, we just dropped off that OD.

794
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,167
Yes, what can I do for you?

795
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,417
Okay, so, now we have this man here

796
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,292
who says that you all
are holding his family against their will.

797
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,018
- You stay away from me.
- That's ridiculous.

798
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:21,875
That's the guy.

799
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,458
That's the one that put me in the room,
and he held me against my will.

800
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,542
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.

801
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,375
All right, well,
he's saying that you roughed him up

802
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,101
- and that you injected him with drugs.
- Yep.

803
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,458
No, he was in earlier and acting a fool,
so the on-call doc gave him a sedative.

804
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,143
- That's what happened.
- You're a liar.

805
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:40,625
I'm not lying.
Why aren't you arresting his ass?

806
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:42,333
Calm down. Let us handle this.

807
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,292
Now, where did you last see
your wife and daughter?

808
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,018
It was in the emergency ward,
it was ward nine.

809
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:49,322
It was just through those doors.

810
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,309
I can't believe you guys
are buying into this bullshit.

811
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,667
I mean, he's a fuckin' head case!
Look at him.

812
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,708
Want to take us to ward nine...

813
00:49:58,583 --> 00:49:59,583
Jeff?

814
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,417
Today, please.

815
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,875
Now, your chest X-rays
show a slight infiltration

816
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:10,458
in the right lower front lobe
of your lungs...

817
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:11,542
Doctor.

818
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,364
Now do you want to tell me
where my wife and daughter are?

819
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,708
- They should've locked you up!
- We'll handle this.

820
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:18,583
He slipped out.

821
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,917
Can you answer this man's question?

822
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,480
He says that his wife and daughter
are missing in the hospital.

823
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,167
The answer is, I don't know.

824
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,958
According to our nursing staff,
Mr. Monroe came in alone,

825
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,750
- wishing to be seen for a head injury.
- Peri was admitted.

826
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,583
Where's her file? Where's her file?

827
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,208
Can we take this to my office, please?

828
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:39,375
Gotta be a record somewhere, right?
For patients admitted.

829
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,208
I wasn't on call then.

830
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:43,917
Sometimes files get misplaced

831
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,750
or they get filed under the wrong name.
Maybe it wasn't entered into the system.

832
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,375
These things happen.

833
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,542
You're full of shit.

834
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:54,042
You should call that Dr. Berthram,
all right?

835
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:57,018
He sent Peri to get the CAT scan,
and that was the last time I saw him.

836
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:58,625
Call... Dr. Berthram.

837
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,125
This is ridiculous.

838
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,542
Where's Dr. Berthram?

839
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:04,917
He went off call. He's probably at home.

840
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:06,351
Well, if he can sort this out,

841
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:08,135
it's probably worth giving him a call,
right?

842
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:10,083
Right?

843
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:13,667
Call Gabe.

844
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,042
Where do you do the CAT scans?

845
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,208
Um... our imaging lab's
on the third floor.

846
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,125
Okay.
Take us up there please.

847
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,542
Take them up to three.

848
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,625
Hang on.

849
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,250
The CAT scans are downstairs.

850
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,292
- No, our imaging lab's on the third floor.
- No, no, no.

851
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:34,042
No, I saw them get in an elevator
and go down.

852
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:39,458
He's obviously confused.
Our lab is on three.

853
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:40,917
Can you take us up there, please?

854
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,875
This computer keeps a log of usage.

855
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,125
There's date, time, and duration.

856
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,333
You can see this machine
was used at 9:07 a.m.

857
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:16,125
for a duration lasting exactly 29 minutes.

858
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,667
And that was the last time.

859
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,708
Can you see this clearly, Mr. Monroe?

860
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:28,958
Yeah, it doesn't prove anything.

861
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,083
It proves no one had a scan

862
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:33,458
at the time you say
your daughter was here.

863
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:38,250
- Makes sense.
- Excuse me.

864
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,875
You can see this, right?

865
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,726
Yeah, she wasn't here,
because they never brought her here.

866
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,101
She didn't have a CAT scan.
They just took her somewhere else.

867
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,125
Where?

868
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,375
I don't know.

869
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,667
And why?

870
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,042
I don't know.
You're the detective, you figure it out.

871
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,417
I just know that there's something wrong
with this place.

872
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,875
Dr. Berthram,
who was attending this morning,

873
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,208
will be here shortly.

874
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,875
Good. Maybe he can clear all this up.

875
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:05,583
Oh, I certainly hope so.

876
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,750
- And there you go.
- Thanks.

877
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,250
- What's your name, baby?
- Anne.

878
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,500
Hmm. So, Anne... double shifts?

879
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:20,667
Single gal's gotta make a living.

880
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:22,458
Yes, she does.

881
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,458
You ever sleep?
What time you get off tonight?

882
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,333
Okay, well, this is him. Ray Monroe.

883
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,833
Found this in the trash out front.
It's the morning sign-in list.

884
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,917
Here's my name. There's my name.

885
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,542
Ray, it's... it's your name.

886
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,851
- I signed in for Peri.
- No, you signed in for yourself.

887
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,625
What's going on, Aaron?

888
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,167
Anne said something
about missing patients.

889
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,370
- You know me, right? Remember?
- All right, back off.

890
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,625
All right?
You saw my little girl, all right?

891
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,958
You... You treated her arm. You... You...

892
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,667
- Do you remember this man?
- Tell 'em!

893
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,667
Tell them, please!

894
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,458
I do. He was here earlier today.

895
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,792
- Yes! Yes!
- All right.

896
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:04,708
And what were the circumstances?

897
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:06,059
We have been all through this...

898
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,333
I'm talking to Dr. Berthram.

899
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,208
- What were the circumstances?
- Uh...

900
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,583
He was, um...

901
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,333
He was a walk-in,
and one of our doctors, Bruce Volk,

902
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,250
um, he examined him.

903
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,458
He told Anne
that he had been in a car accident.

904
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,417
Uh... Uh...

905
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:31,583
His behavior seemed rather... erratic.

906
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,542
Dr. Volk asked me to take a look.

907
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:39,750
So I suggested maybe doing a head CT,
which he refused.

908
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:43,042
He insisted on going back out
to the lobby to wait for his wife.

909
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,417
- Wh... What was her name?
- Abby.

910
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,750
Abby was her name.

911
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,625
Thought you said
your wife's name was Joanne.

912
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,958
- It is.
- Then who's Abby?

913
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,125
She's my first wife.

914
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,083
Where's Abby now?

915
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,625
She's dead.

916
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,625
She died.

917
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,958
She had nothing to do
with Joanne and Peri.

918
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,250
Joanne and Peri?

919
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,917
Who he claims is his current wife
and child.

920
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,500
This is real.

921
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:21,167
This is Joanne, and this is Peri.

922
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:25,042
Periwinkle. You remember?
Because that's Joanne's favorite shell.

923
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:27,083
And that's my family, and I love them.

924
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,625
What does your first wife have to do

925
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:31,292
- with any of this?
- Nothin'.

926
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:34,875
You got Abby's name
from the insurance information, right?

927
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,250
And you're just using it
against me to make me look crazy,

928
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,417
when, in reality,

929
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,768
you've kidnapped my family,
and you've done something to 'em.

930
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:44,500
All right, enough. Enough.

931
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:47,375
Okay, there's a simple enough way
to confirm or deny

932
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,917
any of this guy's bullshit.

933
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Right there.

934
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,333
This is today's waiting room feed.

935
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,708
What time did you say
you came in with your family?

936
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:00,083
Late morning.

937
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,292
So, we'll start at 9:00 a.m.

938
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,875
Work our way forward from there
until we see you.

939
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,125
Stop. Stop.

940
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,750
Go back.

941
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,458
Okay, this is me coming in,

942
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,042
and Joanne was carrying Peri behind me.

943
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,208
All right, there I am. Right.

944
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:27,125
This is where she said wait.
Um, I went back to the seating area.

945
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,125
What are those?
Those little glitches?

946
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,208
It's an older system.

947
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:33,333
Records 30 seconds out of every minute,
so there's gonna be gaps.

948
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,375
That's pretty convenient.

949
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,333
- Well, where's your family?
- They're right there. Just...

950
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:40,000
Can you... They're under the camera.

951
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,309
You can't see where they're sitting
'cause of the chairs.

952
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,500
You got a better angle?

953
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:46,583
The ones you see are the ones
that are workin' out there.

954
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,917
Just fast forward, fast forward.

955
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:51,667
Stop.

956
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,710
All right, there I am coming back.
That's after Peri went for the CAT scan.

957
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:58,292
Yeah.
Never saw you go in with 'em, though.

958
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,583
Your security system is shit.

959
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,875
You've got nothing of my family going in.

960
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:12,000
- Excuse me.
- This is just shit!

961
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,500
Do you have any footage
from inside the ER?

962
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:16,792
We don't record
in the treatment areas.

963
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,583
Uh, legal reasons, patient privacy.

964
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:19,750
Is Dr. Jacobs on call?

965
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,375
Check the hallways.
Check the hallways. Check 'em, all right?

966
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,292
You have better camera placement
in the hall.

967
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,684
We're gonna be here all fuckin' night.

968
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,542
- Search the hospital!
- Okay, that's not happening.

969
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,518
First, we would need a warrant.
Then we would need probable cause,

970
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:34,184
and there's nothing on that video
that proves anyone is even missing.

971
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:37,875
You think that I'm faking?
You think I'm making them up?

972
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,375
I showed you the picture!

973
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:40,833
That could be anybody.

974
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,625
Your sister, niece.

975
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,333
I mean,
the person you keep talking about is Abby.

976
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:48,833
I don't keep talking about Abby.
You keep talking about Abby.

977
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:53,083
Come on.
Come on, Ray. You got this.

978
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:04,375
The cashier
at the service station where Peri fell,

979
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,667
she saw us together.

980
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,500
There's a Gas and Go,
it's a couple of miles from here. Ask her.

981
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:12,958
- Ask her.
- Uh-huh.

982
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,018
- I'll see if I can track her down.
- Thank you.

983
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:16,875
Okay.

984
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,625
Mr. Monroe,

985
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:23,375
I think we found someone back in the ward
that can help us clear everything up.

986
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,917
Let's go.

987
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:26,667
Let's go, then.

988
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:29,958
Call if you need backup.

989
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:33,542
She's already here.

990
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:18,875
It's Peri's.

991
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:21,750
This is Peri's scarf.

992
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:23,958
Jo gave it to me.

993
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:28,083
It must've dropped out
when we were here this morning.

994
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,292
Can you prove it in some way?

995
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,292
- I mean, is her name on the tag?
- It's hers!

996
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,625
- Is there a receipt?
- It's hers.

997
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,583
Can I see it, please?

998
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,458
Yes. Just, gentle...

999
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:40,917
Gentle.

1000
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,250
Is this her blood too?

1001
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,583
It's... It's my blood.

1002
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:58,083
It's my blood from my head
when we fell into the pit.

1003
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,375
You know that.

1004
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,292
Look, with a head injury....

1005
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,917
it's not uncommon to be confused
or to mix things up,

1006
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,917
and you're obviously confused.

1007
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
No, no, no.

1008
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,458
Why would I have my daughter's scarf
and not her?

1009
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,833
And this is her scarf

1010
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,250
'cause she had it in the car

1011
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,726
when we were coming back
from Thanksgiving,

1012
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,893
and she wanted some batteries,
so we stopped in a service station.

1013
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,101
She fell, she went in the hole,
and I fell in on top of her,

1014
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,393
and that's where she got the blood.

1015
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,000
And then we came here
because she had a broken arm, and she...

1016
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,333
We saw you and...

1017
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:32,458
Stop! Get your shit together, man,
or you going to jail!

1018
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:33,583
Do you understand?

1019
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:36,708
You understand? Get it together.

1020
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Hello, Ray.

1021
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,000
I'm Dr. Teresa Jacobs.

1022
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,792
I work in the psychiatric department
for the county.

1023
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,500
You're a shrink?

1024
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,833
I prefer "medical counselor," but...

1025
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,292
"shrink," sure.

1026
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,208
I am not crazy.

1027
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,000
No one is saying that you are.

1028
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:05,208
I'd like to help you find out
what happened to Joanne and Peri.

1029
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,042
We're as concerned about them as you are.

1030
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:13,250
- I doubt that.
- You should think about listening, man.

1031
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,250
Officer, thank you. I can handle this now.

1032
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:20,750
You want to come somewhere more private
and talk about this?

1033
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,833
Yeah.

1034
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Good.

1035
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Come on, then.

1036
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:32,042
So, I thought you might be happy to know

1037
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:34,125
they found your admissions file.

1038
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:35,917
Yeah.

1039
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:37,792
Oh, finally.

1040
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,792
It's, um, your file,
Ray, not your daughter's.

1041
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,292
There's no mention of Peri in here.

1042
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,333
No, it's just bullshit
that they just made up.

1043
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,500
I was hoping you could talk a bit
about what happened

1044
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,208
before the car accident.

1045
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,167
It wasn't a car accident.

1046
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,958
She fell at a construction site.

1047
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,917
Okay, sorry, I only know what's in here.

1048
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,708
Maybe you could tell me
what you remember.

1049
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:07,542
I remember everything.
Don't treat me like I'm crazy.

1050
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,333
I am treating you
as a rational human being, Ray.

1051
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:13,792
Right now, all I've got to go on
is your word that they were here at all.

1052
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
There's this.

1053
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,500
This proves that they were here...

1054
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,625
and that they are hiding them.

1055
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,667
He's just hiding everything...

1056
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,458
Hiding... what?

1057
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,643
That your wife and little girl came in
at random for treatment?

1058
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:28,833
Why would we do that?

1059
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,333
Oh, you work here, you tell me.

1060
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,833
Tell me about Abby.

1061
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,583
She was your first wife?

1062
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:41,333
It's not got anything to do with Abby.

1063
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,833
- And she died?
- Yeah.

1064
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,042
Eight years ago.

1065
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,583
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1066
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:49,292
It was an accident.

1067
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,042
She...
It was a head-on collision.

1068
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:54,667
Car accident?

1069
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,083
Yeah.

1070
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:59,167
This has nothing to do with this...

1071
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,958
or my family now.

1072
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:04,708
In the file,
you mentioned a drinking problem.

1073
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,458
That day, Ray,

1074
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,458
had you been drinking?

1075
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,958
<i>Ray! Ray!</i>

1076
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:20,250
When the accident happened, Ray,

1077
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,375
were you too drunk to help Abby?

1078
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,625
You didn't even see.

1079
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,500
You didn't see it.

1080
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,750
Nothing could help her.

1081
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,250
I couldn't.

1082
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,333
Have you ever had blackouts, Ray?

1083
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,083
- Moments of missing time?
- Oh, God.

1084
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:36,792
I don't drink. I don't drink anymore.

1085
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,875
- I haven't had a drink in eight years.
- Why...

1086
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:43,875
did you tell the staff
that you were waiting for Abby, Ray?

1087
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,833
Help me understand all this.

1088
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:50,042
Abby died
in a car accident eight years ago,

1089
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,708
and it kills me.

1090
01:03:52,417 --> 01:03:54,458
Every day. It just...

1091
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:57,500
All right.

1092
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,333
I'm gonna say something,

1093
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:04,125
and it's gonna be hard to hear.

1094
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,542
But you have to listen, Ray,

1095
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:12,083
because I believe you.

1096
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:16,500
I believe something happened
to Peri and Joanne...

1097
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:19,792
Which is why...

1098
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,417
I think we should take a look at the spot

1099
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,458
where Peri had her accident.

1100
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,833
Why? There's nothing there.

1101
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:30,417
I think it's a good idea, Ray.

1102
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:35,500
If you'll excuse me for a moment, hmm?

1103
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:53,833
He's obviously experiencing
some deep trauma.

1104
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,167
He's confused.

1105
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,500
I suggest going back to the place
he claims his daughter was hurt.

1106
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,125
What are you thinking?

1107
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,125
They might still be out there.

1108
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,042
Oh, God.

1109
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:10,500
I'll, uh, put a call into the canine unit
and see if they can meet us

1110
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:11,958
- at the gas station.
- Mm-hmm.

1111
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,542
The place is closed,

1112
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,292
but I've got dispatch
trying to track down the cashier.

1113
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,917
Um, it might be good for us
if you come along.

1114
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,375
- Of course.
- They're not out there.

1115
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,583
Maybe you're all in on this,
or maybe you're not.

1116
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,833
The fact is, my wife and daughter
went down a hallway in this hospital

1117
01:05:29,917 --> 01:05:31,208
and never came back,

1118
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:32,875
and that's what happened.

1119
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,333
Is that it, up ahead?

1120
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,042
Yeah.

1121
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:51,708
Thanks for coming so quickly.

1122
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:53,625
No problem. What have you got?

1123
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:56,542
Two missing persons,
a woman and child.

1124
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,125
You got an incident site?

1125
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,667
Ray, where did your daughter fall?

1126
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,250
Got a scent source for Mandy?

1127
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:09,417
Can I see that scarf, Ray?

1128
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:14,625
The only thing that dog's gonna smell
is that we were here earlier.

1129
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,667
We have to start somewhere, Ray.

1130
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,375
Mandy, find.

1131
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,375
Good girl. Good girl.

1132
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,958
- What happened here, Ray?
- Nothing.

1133
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:12,917
Just, Peri lost a compact, you know?
This tiny toy mirror,

1134
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,333
and she was upset, so...

1135
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:16,917
me and Jo, we looked for it.

1136
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,458
She looked in the bathroom,
I looked in the car, and then...

1137
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,125
and I lost sight of her for a second.

1138
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,583
And I look up,
and there's this dog growlin' at her,

1139
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,750
and she spooked and fell.

1140
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,250
It was nothing.

1141
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,125
Here we go.
I think she's got something.

1142
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:32,833
We got something.

1143
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,667
Come on.

1144
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:49,125
Let me see it.
Let me see it. Please.

1145
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,625
Please. Just give that to me.
It's Peri's. That's what Peri lost.

1146
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,417
Please, that's Peri's compact.

1147
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,458
Must have just been in her pocket
the whole time,

1148
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:01,333
and it just fell out when she fell.

1149
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,708
And the blood?
That's your daughter's blood?

1150
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,292
It's my blood. I hit my head.

1151
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,893
- Oh, it's yours? You hit your head.
- Yeah.

1152
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,333
That's way too much blood!

1153
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,958
That's my blood.
I hit my head, man, look at...

1154
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,323
- Look! Look at it!
- Get the fuck off me, you crazy fuck!

1155
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:37,833
- Hey!
- No more.

1156
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,167
This is a crime scene now.

1157
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,292
- Go call the CSI unit.
- Fuckin' nuts, man.

1158
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,375
Keep on looking.
There might be more.

1159
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,750
He planted it. He planted the mirror!

1160
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:52,958
He planted it.

1161
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:54,417
Did he plant the blood too?

1162
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:56,292
Maybe you did!

1163
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:59,000
- Really?
- Officer. Just give us a second here.

1164
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,768
You gotta help me.
You see what's happening here?

1165
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,250
- You gotta help me.
- I am trying to help you, Ray.

1166
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,958
Now, I asked you once before.
Let me ask you again...

1167
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:12,333
what happened before the accident?

1168
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,750
Were you upset about something?

1169
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,750
U-Upset at your daughter, maybe?

1170
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:18,958
I was...

1171
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:21,375
I had a fight with my wife
about my marriage.

1172
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,875
So, I know that she's not happy.

1173
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,208
I know that she just wants me
to try harder. And I do try hard!

1174
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:32,000
I told Peri, "Just stay there." Right?
"Just stay right there."

1175
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,500
And she didn't listen,
and she should have listened!

1176
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,167
So you were angry with her.

1177
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,370
Yeah, I was angry.
I picked up a rock, and I threw it.

1178
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:39,833
At who?

1179
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,667
At... At the dog.

1180
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,542
I tried hard.

1181
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:50,292
I tried really hard
to... to... to-to grab her.

1182
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:53,625
She still fell.

1183
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Ray...

1184
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,833
are you sure there was a dog?

1185
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:18,417
There was no dog, was there, Ray?

1186
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,083
There was no accident.

1187
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,125
Peri didn't fall.

1188
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,792
You made that all up.

1189
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,792
It happened!

1190
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,458
It's... That's all that happened.

1191
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,708
Think, Ray.

1192
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,458
You were upset at your daughter,

1193
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,750
angry at your wife,

1194
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,417
angry at yourself.

1195
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:45,250
So you picked up a rock.

1196
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,125
When it was over,

1197
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,875
you were so angry at yourself
at what you'd done...

1198
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,917
Then Joanne appears.

1199
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:01,125
<i>Ray!</i>

1200
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,042
So you... lash out.

1201
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,125
<i>No! No!</i>

1202
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,583
That's what happened, isn't it, Ray?

1203
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,708
- Are you hurt?
- The mind, Ray,

1204
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:18,750
it can sometimes create
an alternate reality, a false reality,

1205
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:21,542
to shield itself from trauma.

1206
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,417
<i>From the things we fear,</i>

1207
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,583
<i>from the horrors we can't even imagine.</i>

1208
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:30,167
Is it broken?

1209
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:33,167
You lost your family once before,

1210
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,583
and when you saw
what you'd done to Peri...

1211
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,417
and then Joanne,

1212
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:46,333
your mind couldn't accept the fact
that it had happened all over again.

1213
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,917
And at your hands.

1214
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I would never hurt you, sweetie.

1215
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,625
Where are they, Ray?

1216
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,333
Where are Peri and Joanne?

1217
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:10,333
Where did you put them?

1218
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,458
Ray?

1219
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:19,708
Ray?

1220
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,500
Stand up, Mr. Monroe.

1221
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:35,458
Stand up, Mr. Monroe!

1222
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,250
Stand up.

1223
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,625
Get up, right now.

1224
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:48,792
Mr. Monroe, you are under arrest
for the suspicion of murder.

1225
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,833
You have the right to remain silent.

1226
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:54,208
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1227
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:57,125
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford an attorney,

1228
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,708
one will be provided for you...

1229
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:03,958
<i>Daddy!</i>

1230
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,250
<i>Don't move.</i>

1231
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,213
It's going to be okay.
I'm just gonna scare him.

1232
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,000
Daddy!

1233
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,583
No!

1234
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,625
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1235
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:16,500
I don't think so.

1236
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,208
It happened.

1237
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,375
No, Ray!

1238
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,583
Put it down. Put it down.
Put down all your guns.

1239
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,750
- Okay...
- Do it now. Now!

1240
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:30,833
Now!

1241
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,542
Put down your guns and your radios
and kick 'em away.

1242
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:38,250
- You too!
- You know you're fucking yourself, right?

1243
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,042
You stay up there. Right.

1244
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:44,167
Now, everybody up. Everybody out!

1245
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,792
You go, get out! Go on, go up!

1246
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:49,292
Everybody up!

1247
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,667
I know you won't hurt me, Ray.

1248
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,542
You think that I've murdered my wife
and my daughter.

1249
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,208
So who are you to me?

1250
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,375
Now move it.

1251
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:02,542
Move!

1252
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,208
Come on, round the side.

1253
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,292
Now open that door.

1254
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,792
All right, now get in. Everyone in.

1255
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,875
Come on. Come on.

1256
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,542
All right.

1257
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:16,792
- Give me your key card.
- Ray...

1258
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,875
if you thought seeing that dog

1259
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,250
somehow makes everything else
you believe true,

1260
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,583
you are wrong.

1261
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:24,083
Or you're wrong.

1262
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:27,625
Give me the card.

1263
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:32,708
- Mistake.
- Well, we'll see.

1264
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:48,083
You motherfucker!
You motherfucker! You're so fucked!

1265
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,417
I'm coming for you.

1266
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:49,750
- Still seeing Phil from radiology?
- I don't think so.

1267
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:15,917
Ah.

1268
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:36,958
I tell you, Terry,
what a long day that was.

1269
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:48,917
Pretty crazy, huh?

1270
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:53,250
I mean,
I'm afraid to even pick mine up, you know?

1271
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,333
What if I drop him?

1272
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:01,250
So, is this your first?

1273
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,167
<i>Ray, watch out!</i>

1274
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,042
<i>Sorry, Mr. Monroe. She's gone.</i>

1275
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,458
<i>They're both gone.</i>

1276
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,833
That's it. Call it.

1277
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:24,375
I'm sorry, Mr. Monroe. They're gone.

1278
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:28,417
Abby...

1279
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,708
<i>Do something.</i>

1280
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,500
<i>Do something.</i>

1281
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:41,417
Hey.

1282
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,375
Eighty-two degrees.

1283
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:05,667
Heads up.

1284
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:10,250
Help me. Help me.

1285
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:13,042
Help me, please.

1286
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,083
Help.

1287
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:31,292
Doctor? Doctor!

1288
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:33,458
Sign in, please.

1289
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,875
Thank you. Good work.

1290
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:01,125
Come on... Come on.

1291
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,542
Oh, fuck...

1292
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,500
Go!

1293
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,875
Just... Just...

1294
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:43,083
stop.

1295
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:44,417
Just stop.

1296
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:50,875
I just want to get my family...
and I want to go home.

1297
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,458
Just point the barrel away. All right?

1298
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,375
Okay.

1299
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:06,375
I'll take you to your family, all right?

1300
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,208
They're right downstairs.

1301
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:12,333
Thirty seconds away.

1302
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,875
Give me...
Give me the keys.

1303
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,208
Yeah.

1304
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:33,167
Okay.

1305
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,417
This is over!

1306
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,083
Give me my family!

1307
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:11,292
<i>I hope you feel better.</i>

1308
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,333
<i>EMS just brought in
a couple head traumas.</i>

1309
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:09,583
<i>Head-on collision. Drunk driver.</i>

1310
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,208
<i>The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.</i>

1311
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:23,917
<i>Would you like Peri listed
for organ donation?</i>

1312
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,542
<i>No.</i>

1313
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:27,375
Can I convince you to reconsider?

1314
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:11,458
Don't touch her!
Get back! Away from the table.

1315
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:16,208
Put that down! Put it down!
Back against the wall! Peri...

1316
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:21,042
Peri? Stay there.

1317
01:26:22,417 --> 01:26:23,417
Oh...

1318
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,667
Take off your mask.

1319
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:32,708
Take it off.

1320
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,708
You're a monster.

1321
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:50,958
You're all monsters.

1322
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,750
Ray, don't do this.

1323
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,042
Don't worry, baby. I got you, baby.

1324
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,750
You don't need to do this.

1325
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,583
- Ray... Ray...
<i>- </i>Jo?

1326
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:03,583
Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo!

1327
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:05,375
No.

1328
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:07,458
Ray... Ray...

1329
01:27:07,542 --> 01:27:10,000
- Come on. Come on.
- Ray...

1330
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:14,167
You think you can cut up my family?

1331
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:17,125
You think you can just cut up
my little girl?

1332
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,958
Put the gun away.

1333
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:20,333
Nobody needs to get hurt.

1334
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:21,458
Daddy's here.

1335
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:24,625
Ray, you are deeply confused.

1336
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:35,708
I'm not afraid of you.

1337
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:40,000
Ray, don't do this, please.

1338
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:41,375
Ray... Ray...

1339
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:43,042
They drugged us.

1340
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,208
I know. Hold on to Peri.

1341
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:46,292
Ray.

1342
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,375
You're not seeing things clearly.

1343
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:51,208
I've never felt more clear.

1344
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,208
Come on, come on.

1345
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:01,583
Hold him down!

1346
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,667
Propofol, 15 milligrams!

1347
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,000
Ray!

1348
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,667
Oh, Jo, you're okay!

1349
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,125
You're okay.

1350
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:59,708
I got you. I got you.

1351
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:04,583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Whoa, whoa!

1352
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:07,583
Just get out of my way.

1353
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:10,208
Mr. Monroe, listen to me.
You gotta listen to me.

1354
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,417
We can't let you leave.
You can't leave here.

1355
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,417
You remember me?

1356
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:18,458
I'm Dr. Bruce Volk. Do you remember?

1357
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:22,268
Look, we just want to help you.
Why don't you just put the gun down...

1358
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:25,542
Fuck! Shit!

1359
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:28,458
I did it.

1360
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:31,292
Yeah, I did it.

1361
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,750
You fucking shot me!

1362
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:35,542
I did it.

1363
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,542
Fuck you!

1364
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:45,625
We're nearly there.

1365
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,667
Here you go. Stay warm.

1366
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:03,625
Daddy?

1367
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:05,375
Yeah?

1368
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,208
Are we home yet?

1369
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,583
Soon, sweetheart.

1370
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,500
Soon.

1371
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,208
You okay?

1372
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:54,875
We are now.

1373
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,875
My arm, Daddy, it still hurts.

1374
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,458
Well, how about a song,
will that make you feel better?

1375
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:05,667
