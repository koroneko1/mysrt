00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.540
‎-Are you OK?
‎-Yes.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.540
‎Thank you, Luka.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.620
‎Oh, uh, by the way, did you find
‎that perfect tune you were looking for?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.700
‎I think I did, yeah. But are you sure
‎you really want to hear it?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.460
‎You're still thinking of Adrien,
‎aren't you?

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260
‎-Huh! Marinette!

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.900
‎Luka? Oh, no! Not those again!

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.540
‎Tikki, we have to take shelter!

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.620
‎Power up!

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.500
‎Aquatikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.180
‎I should have known that Hawk Moth
‎had a bigger plan all along.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.540
‎The battle's not over!

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.820
‎No! I mean... I mean, yes!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.660
‎I mean, it's the first time
‎that I thought it would be different.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.100
‎So you're not happy.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.900
‎Yes, I am. It's just that...

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.060
‎I think I wasn't really ready.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.260
‎So, when will you be ready?

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820
‎Your indecision is hurtful, Adrien.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.260
‎-Huh!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.380
‎-What?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.740
‎No!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.020
‎-Kagami!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.580
‎ Plagg! Lunchtime!

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.380
‎Aquaplagg, claws out!

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.940
‎People of Paris,
‎listen to Miracle Queen's first order.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.740
‎From now on, no one
‎will have to keep his identity a secret.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.580
‎All the Miraculous wearers, come to me!

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.580
‎Yes... Yes! No more hiding!

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.260
‎Nerdy Max? The fake reporter? DJ Headache?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.540
‎What has possessed Ladybug
‎to choose such losers as her superheroes?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.940
‎Oh, simple little Kim too!

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.540
‎For a moment there, I thought you only had
‎to wear glasses to get a Miraculous.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.300
‎Don't know this one. He's cute.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.740
‎But he gets his clothes from a dumpster!
‎Oh, no! Not this one!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.980
‎Oh, my! Such ridiculous choices!
‎Utterly ridiculous! Anyway,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.060
‎grab your Miraculous!

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.300
‎Huh? Why don't they take any?

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.580
‎Surely because the Miraculous of the Moron
‎and the Pompous Brat do not exist!

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.740
‎Or maybe someone else
‎is already wearing them.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.820
‎Come on, hurry up and transform, my pawns!

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.220
‎Trixx! Let's pounce!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.900
‎Kalkki! Full gallop!

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.420
‎Sass! Scales slither!

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.380
‎Xuppu! Showtime!

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.700
‎You were once Ladybug
‎and Cat Noir's minions,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.780
‎but from now on,
‎you will be Miracle Queen's Royal Guard!

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.980
‎ Huh!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.980
‎Ladybug, Cat Noir, I'm gonna use
‎your own weapons to defeat you.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.260
‎You'll so regret not choosing me!

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.740
‎Mayura!

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.980
‎Now it's time
‎to deal with the old guardian.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.540
‎-Mayura!
‎-I'm all right.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.140
‎Of all the plans I've concocted,
‎I never wanted this.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.740
‎Forgive me for needing you again
‎one last time.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.460
‎Don't blame yourself.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.180
‎From the very first day,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.500
‎I knew that I'd do anything for you.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.300
‎ Little amok...

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.980
‎ Give body
‎to Hawk Moth's sentimonster again!

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.820
‎Sentimonster, I am Mayura!
‎You will now obey Hawk Moth!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.460
‎Destroy the shield!

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.780
‎-Ladybug!
‎-Cat Noir!

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.700
‎There's something wrong.
‎What did Fu say to you

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.460
‎when you gave him back
‎the Dragon Miraculous?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.180
‎-I wasn't able to give it back.
‎-What?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.220
‎Master Fu has disappeared!
‎I'm worried something happened to him!

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.500
‎Huh?

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.940
‎Huh! You're right!

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.660
‎They found Master Fu and the Miracle Box!
‎It's a catastrophe!

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.020
‎And I just happen to be
‎an expert in cat things!

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.020
‎It's... It's my fault.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.180
‎I didn't transform back
‎before I went to find him.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.820
‎-What?
‎-I was... confused.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.420
‎I'm sorry. I'm such a failure.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.860
‎Hey! The important thing
‎is to save Master Fu

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.780
‎before the sentimonster
‎destroys his shield.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.660
‎And we'll need a focused Ladybug for that.
‎Forget what happened, OK?

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.100
‎Thanks, Cat! You're always here for me!

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.780
‎Always, little bug!

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.580
‎OK.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.860
‎We have to free our friends
‎from Miracle Queen.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.060
‎Then we can defeat Mayura,
‎Hawk Moth and his sentimonster.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.940
‎But first, we gotta neutralize those wasps

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.900
‎so we can get out of the water.
‎If we get stung, it's all over.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.580
‎Sounds easy when <i>‎you</i>‎ say it!

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.980
‎Yes! We're gonna make it easier!

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.140
‎No! It's too dangerous!
‎Too many powers at the same time!

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.140
‎We don't have a choice.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.420
‎Huh! I'm ready to fight, Ladybug!

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.580
‎-Claws in!
‎-Spots off!

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.540
‎Tikki, Longg, unify!

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.420
‎Water Dragon!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.580
‎ Ladybug!

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.780
‎It'll be "Dragonbug" to you, Chloé!

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.460
‎A few extra powers
‎aren't going to save you, you know!

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.780
‎-In a few moments,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.340
‎when the old guardian
‎is too weak and his shield is broken,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.700
‎I'll force him to tell me
‎your secret identities,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.700
‎and it will all be thanks to Ladybug.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.020
‎She led you all to your own doom!

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.980
‎He's trying to divide you!
‎Don't listen to him!

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.180
‎I chose you both for a reason!
‎Stay united!

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.100
‎-It's us against the world!
‎-As always!

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.180
‎Ladybug and I never fight each other!
‎We fight together!

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.540
‎Welcome to your doomsday, Hawk Moth!

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.700
‎You fools!
‎It's time to take action, my queen!

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.380
‎En garde, my guards!

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.180
‎Uproar!

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.300
‎Huh.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.980
‎Voyage!

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.380
‎Second chance!

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.060
‎Viperion is by far the most dangerous.
‎You focus on him! Be careful, Cat.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.220
‎Got it! Cataclysm!

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.100
‎- Second chance.
‎-Got it! Cataclysm!

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.740
‎- Second chance.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.780
‎Got it! Cataclysm!

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.260
‎Looks like you forgot

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.420
‎-about me! But I didn't!

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.740
‎Useless! That snake is utterly useless!

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.660
‎-Cat Noir! It's your turn.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.300
‎Ah!

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.700
‎Sass, Plagg, Unify!

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.460
‎ Second chance!

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.620
‎Stop him!

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.260
‎Dragonbug! It's an illusion!

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.940
‎No!

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.300
‎Ladybug!

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.900
‎ Dragonbug! They're illusions!

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.500
‎ Dragonbug! They're illusions!

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.180
‎-Dragonbug! Opening! There!

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.780
‎Huh.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.780
‎Pathetic!

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.380
‎Is that honestly how you think you--

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.820
‎- No!

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.180
‎Longg, Tikki, divide!

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.660
‎Sass, Plagg, divide!

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.180
‎ No more evildoing for you,
‎little akuma.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.980
‎Time to de-evilize!

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.220
‎Gotcha!

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.700
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.820
‎Told you!
‎Welcome to your doomsday, Hawk Moth!

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.140
‎Ah!

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.380
‎Ah, ah, ah!

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.100
‎Hawk Moth is our enemy, Chloé.
‎He can't get hold of the Miracle Box!

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.740
‎I'm not on your side anymore!

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.020
‎How many times have I asked
‎to fight alongside you?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.180
‎And how many times have you refused
‎to give me back<i>‎ my</i>‎ Miraculous?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.300
‎How many, huh?

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.820
‎Hawk Moth isn't my enemy, he's yours!
‎And the Miracle Box is mine!

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.580
‎-Chloé! No! Don't do that!
‎-Oh, yes I will!

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.100
‎I am going to be the most powerful
‎Miraculous wearer there ever was!

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.580
‎I don't even need to do anything!

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.700
‎I knew you were one of us,
‎Chloé Bourgeois!

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.260
‎Well, what are you waiting for?
‎Transform me!

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.220
‎-She doesn't even know our names!
‎-And you didn't give the right commands!

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.940
‎Or say "please", for that matter!

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.460
‎I am your queen,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.580
‎the queen of the Miraculous!
‎I command you to tell me how to proceed!

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.500
‎There's nothing you can do anyway!
‎I already won!

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.500
‎ It's moments
‎before that shield caves in.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.660
‎Then the Guardian will be at my mercy!

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.700
‎Your friends are about to transform back!
‎You're on your own. Checkmate, Ladybug!

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.060
‎I still have one move left, Hawk Moth!

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.540
‎Lucky Charm!

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.620
‎A keyring?
‎What am I supposed to do with this?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.900
‎-Um...

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.620
‎Nothing! There's nothing you can do!

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.740
‎My plan was perfect! You can't beat me!

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.540
‎-I can't figure it out!
‎-Focus! You can do it!

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.420
‎I'm sorry! I'm so useless!

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.340
‎If I hadn't forgotten to de-transform
‎myself to go see Master Fu...

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.620
‎Ladybug, no!

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.020
‎...Hawk Moth
‎wouldn't have taken him hostage.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.460
‎He wouldn't have taken the Miracle Box.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.780
‎I'm the worst Ladybug
‎that has ever existed!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.860
‎Ladybug, you are the best
‎Miraculous holder I've ever met.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.180
‎You made mistakes, but who hasn't?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.940
‎What matters is to fix them.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.940
‎And you always, always miraculously knew
‎how to fix everything, right?

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.740
‎But what should I do, Master?

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.940
‎You hold all the keys, Ladybug.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.460
‎You always have.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.820
‎And you will be
‎the most magnificent of Guardians.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.620
‎-What?
‎-Master!

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.820
‎-No!
‎-Don't do it!

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.860
‎I, Wang Fu,
‎hereby relinquish the Miracle Box

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.500
‎and name Ladybug the new Guardian!

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.020
‎No!

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.220
‎Master!

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.540
‎No! It's<i>‎ my</i>‎ Miracle Box, <i>‎mine</i>‎!
‎I'm the Guardian! I'm the Queen!

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.060
‎Hawk Moth,
‎tell him to give me my box back!

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.700
‎How disappointing.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.140
‎I'll take care of them!
‎You take care of the box!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.020
‎Sorry, but I think this belongs to me now!

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.980
‎I don't need all those stupid Miraculous
‎anyway!

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.660
‎I only need the Queen Bee!

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.980
‎Besides, you're lame, and Paris is lame!

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.860
‎I'm going to go to New York with Mummy.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.580
‎And I'll be
‎the one and only Queen Bee there,

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.660
‎and I'll save the world all by myself,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.220
‎without you and your ridiculous,
‎poorly chosen friends!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.700
‎Utterly poorly chosen!

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.140
‎I'm sorry, Chloé,
‎but I can't let you do that.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.300
‎Well, if that's the way it is,
‎I'm no longer your fan, Ladybug!

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.700
‎I don't love you anymore!

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.860
‎And I'm still going
‎to leave with Mummy anyway,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.140
‎because you don't deserve
‎to breathe the same air I do!

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.300
‎Sorry, couldn't catch up with them.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.380
‎Master!

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.340
‎-Master! Wake up!

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.140
‎Oh, my Nathalie. There are
‎no words to express how sorry I am.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.220
‎I've failed yet again,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.140
‎and you have used up
‎every last bit of strength for nothing.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.140
‎No. Not for nothing.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.260
‎ There's a ‎deciphered ‎version
‎of the grimoire

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.020
‎stored on the Guardian's tablet!

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.340
‎Now we can fix the Peacock Miraculous!

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.180
‎Master!

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.500
‎-Master?

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.620
‎Oh! Master Fu!

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.780
‎Oh! Such pretty costumes!

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.660
‎Who are you?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.460
‎Has he... lost his memory?

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.300
‎It's the rule of the Guardians.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.780
‎Their memory gets erased
‎when they pass on the box,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.380
‎to protect the secret identities
‎of the Miraculous holders.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.420
‎It's all good. We're friends, sir!

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.500
‎Well, nice to meet you!

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.540
‎Goodbye, Master.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.940
‎Wait! You haven't repaired everything yet!
‎There's still hope!

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.500
‎Oh! Of course!

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.820
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.860
‎Master! Do you remember me?

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.820
‎I'm sorry to disappoint you, young lady,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.540
‎but this is the first time
‎I've ever set eyes on you.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.300
‎Yes, of course.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.100
‎What happened to him has nothing to do
‎with the damages caused by Chloé.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.860
‎So my magical ladybugs
‎couldn't do anything.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.300
‎It's a shame
‎you threw such a pretty keyring away!

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.740
‎I could have used it for my key.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.580
‎-They were matching, too.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.220
‎Mum! I hope Jean-Patrick
‎has finished packing our suitcases!

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.380
‎We're leaving right now!

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.460
‎Chloé! Your mother has decided to stay,
‎after all.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.060
‎Yes. We've undoubtedly made
‎our share of mistakes along the way,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.180
‎but then who hasn't?
‎What matters is to fix them, right?

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.220
‎Oh! My queen!

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.140
‎-Ew!

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.900
‎This is despicable! Utterly despicable!

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.660
‎I order you both to fight again!

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.340
‎ <i>‎"As we grow old,</i>

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.700
<i>‎we realize life doesn't always give us</i>
<i>‎all the gifts we hoped it would.</i>

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.700
<i>‎I would have loved to tell you</i>
<i>‎all this in person, Marinette,</i>

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.620
<i>‎but if you're reading this,</i>
<i>‎it means I've already lost my memory.</i>

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.580
<i>‎But you mustn't be scared.</i>
<i>‎And you mustn't be sad.</i>

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.300
<i>‎As I was telling you at the beginning</i>
<i>‎of this letter, experiencing loss</i>

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.900
<i>‎is a part of life,</i>
<i>‎but it doesn't define it.</i>

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.900
<i>‎Because what really matters</i>
<i>‎isn't whether you win or lose.</i>

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.180
<i>‎It's the ability to..."</i>

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.140
‎ <i>‎...accept changes</i>
<i>‎in ourselves.</i>

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.500
<i>‎It's accepting that even if life</i>
<i>‎doesn't always give us the gifts</i>

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.220
<i>‎we were hoping for,</i>

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.340
<i>‎the real gift is life itself.</i>

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.300
‎It's incredible.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.740
‎I've only just met you and yet my heart
‎is beating as if I've known you forever.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.060
‎You should always trust your heart.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.740
‎Take this, sir, for the journey.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.900
‎ Mmm-hmm.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.660
‎Thank you, young lady.
‎I will never forget you.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.860
‎ <i>‎Even if life doesn't always</i>
<i>‎give us the gifts we were hoping for,</i>

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.260
<i>‎the real gift is life itself.</i>

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.140
‎You OK?

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.380
‎So, how about that tune?
‎Will you let me hear it?

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.380
‎Are you sure you really want to hear it?

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.140
‎It's perfect.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.460
‎As good as new!
