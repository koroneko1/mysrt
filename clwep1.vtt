1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
Why, Korn?

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.880
Why did my father give you the farm stocks?

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.060
Why?

4
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.820
Get out of my house, Korn.

5
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.460
Don’t ever come back.

6
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.060
Korn, you are okay to talk, right?

7
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.540
Yes.

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.560
Win knows about our bakery shop.

9
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.800
You know well that I hate his guts.

10
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.260
Why do you still talk to him?

11
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.260
Why do you talk to him?

12
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.260
I must clear this with him.

13
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.440
This shit must end tonight.

14
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.460
What the hell happened to me?

15
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.860
Just a moment.

16
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.260
How are you, Lin?

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.560
Korn, you’re here.

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.760
Korn, you son of a bitch!

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.860
It’s all because of you.

20
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280
I’m like this because of you!

21
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.620
You asshole.

22
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.620
Help. Help.

23
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.540
It’s all because of you.

24
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.420
What’s going on?

25
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.980
Lin, calm down.

26
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.700
Calm down.

27
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.340
What’s wrong?

28
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.500
Let go of me, four-eyes!

29
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.440
Let go of me!

30
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.900
Don’t freaking touch me!

31
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.320
Oh my god. Are you alright, Doctor?

32
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.920
Ouch!

33
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.940
Quickly!

34
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.560
Go get some help!

35
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.800
Get me the injection.

36
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.640
Okay.

37
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200
What’s that for, Non?

38
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.460
Lin is suffering acute confusion after the accident.

39
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.020
We’ll give her a drug to treat aggressive behavior.

40
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.400
It’ll help her rest.

41
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.100
My head hurts.

42
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.720
I don’t want to get an injection.

43
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.080
I just woke up.

44
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.520
If I get it, I don’t know when I’ll wake up.

45
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.840
Alright.

46
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.040
Non, is the injection really necessary?

47
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.720
I don’t think she can take it.

48
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.040
No, I can’t, Mom.

49
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.020
If I get it, I don’t know when I’ll wake up again.

50
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.580
I want to do nothing.

51
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.740
But you’re fine now, right?

52
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.540
Why do you ask like that?

53
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.360
You didn’t look fine earlier.

54
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.840
It looked like you were angry with Korn.

55
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.180
Why were you angry with him?

56
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.040
Well, I was just shocked.

57
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.980
I thought some random guy was going to attack me.

58
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.920
But you called out his name.

59
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.800
(Shit, what excuse should I make?)

60
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.980
Argh!

61
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.880
My head hurts!

62
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.440
I don’t know anything!

63
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.140
My head hurts!

64
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.620
I’m so stressed out!

65
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.200
Okay.

66
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600
I won’t pressure you anymore.

67
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.040
Non, could she be having a brain concussion?

68
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.160
I don’t know.

69
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.700
We’ll have to ask the professor

70
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.320
who’s a neurologist.

71
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.720
Then I’ll go get him.

72
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.460
Could you take me to the neurology department?

73
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.900
Of course.Please come with me.

74
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.740
Please take care of her.

75
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.940
Where are you going?

76
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.960
I’ll be right back.

77
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.340
Finally, they’re all gone.

78
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.100
Untie me, four-eyes.

79
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.020
Excuse me?

80
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.020
What did you say?

81
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.680
Don’t act confused.

82
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.360
I said untie me.

83
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.540
Sorry?

84
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540
It’s me, your friend Win.

85
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.420
Really?

86
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.400
Yes.

87
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.480
Untie me right now.

88
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.420
Or do you want me to get Chumphon to do it?

89
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.020
Hold on.	That’s my father.

90
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.820
Is it really you, Win?

91
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.260
It can’t be.

92
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.100
Did Win tell you about me, Lin?

93
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.040
You still don’t believe me?

94
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.520
Fine.

95
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.440
In grade 8, you got called to the principal’s office for carrying porn books to school.

96
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.380
In grade 10, you skipped chemistry to sleep in the library.

97
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.240
The teachers thought you skipped school so they told your father Chumphon.

98
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.460
He then told you off	and made you ride on his motorbike to school every day.

99
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.460
That’s enough.

100
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.160
How is this possible?

101
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.060
I don’t know.

102
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.620
I’m way more confused than you.

103
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.320
Untie me right now, four-eyes.

104
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.000
It’s uncomfortable.

105
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.240
Quickly!

106
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.040
Non, is she suffering a severe brain concussion?

107
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.580
I don’t need to tell you who I am

108
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.200
but I want you to know that you’re the cause of this.

109
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.700
You have a scar in that spot.

110
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.460
Is that true?

119
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.860
Win, is it really you?

120
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.760
How did you swap bodies with your sister?

121
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.080
I don’t know.

122
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.100
Non,

123
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.640
can you get me back into my old body?

124
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.000
I’m a doctor, not a shaman.

125
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.700
I don’t even know how you swapped bodies with your sister.

126
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.600
Oh, you just had a car accident.

127
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.820
Maybe you have to get into another car accident with your sister.

128
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.460
Are you insane?

129
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.460
If you want to, do it yourself.

130
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.300
Wait, how’s my body?

131
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
Your insides are normal.

132
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.840
A few bruises on the outside, but your body is still unconscious.

133
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.660
You woke up first.

134
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.880
If I’m here,

135
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.760
where is my sister?

136
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.760
Venerable Uncle.

137
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.860
Namaste, Venerable Uncle.

138
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.500
Good day.

139
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.920
How are you feeling, Win?

140
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.420
You knew?

141
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.640
Your father told me everything.

142
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.780
My father?

143
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.780
He chased me to my quarters.

144
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.700
Then you know what happened, right?

145
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.740
Why dwell in the past?

146
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.880
Why don’t you focus on the solution?

147
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.900
You know the solution?

148
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.420
Of course I do.

149
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.100
I wouldn’t have come if I didn't.

150
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.060
You have to pay respect to four monks

151
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.940
and ask them for holy water within the next 7 days.

152
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.800
I wrote down everything in this paper.

153
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.140
Thank you.

154
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.760
Why did you give it to him?

155
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.760
It’s better to let him keep it.

156
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.760
You’re an impetuous person.

157
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.280
You could lose it.

158
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.460
Does this mean I have to go with him?

159
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.540
Why?

160
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.540
Can I go with Non instead?

161
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.540
What does this have to do with me?

162
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.300
I wouldn’t suggest that at all.

163
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.400
Your fate will always bring you bad luck when you’re alone.

164
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.460
Korn’s fate will push the bad things away.

165
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.520
Really?

166
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.700
Can I go alone anyway?

167
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.180
Listen to me.

168
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.060
I doubt it.

169
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.000
Don’t stay in doubt.

170
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.740
Can I ask one more question?

171
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.860
You can.

172
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.980
If I can collect the holy water in time,

173
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.240
Lin and I will get back into our old bodies, right?

174
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.760
What I can tell you is

175
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.780
you and Lin will live again.

176
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.620
Everything else depends on you.

177
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.380
Remember, you have seven days.

178
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.120
Collect the holy water by midnight of the seventh day

179
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.280
or Lin’s soul will not return to her body again.

180
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.160
Understand?

181
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.280
I will never go with you.

182
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.120
(Remember, you have seven days)

183
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.920
(or Lin’s soul will not return to her body again.)

184
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.640
How is she, Doctor?

185
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.120
Her symptoms are normal.

186
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.360
She can rest here for one more night and go home tomorrow.

187
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.020
Can I leave today?

188
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.360
Please?

189
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.120
Mom, I’m fine now.

190
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.920
I don’t want to waste another day.

191
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.680
Can she leave, Doctor?

192
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.640
The fact that she’s talking this much means she’s healthy now.

193
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.980
She can leave.

194
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.940
Thank you krub.

195
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.100
Ka.

196
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.960
Mom, can we visit Win before we leave?

197
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.460
Win, I’m sorry.

198
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.760
You’re suffering because of me.

199
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.860
I’m sorry, son.

200
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.960
If anything happens to you, how will your sister and I live?

201
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.440
Your father is already gone.

202
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.820
I don’t want to lose you too.

203
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.920
Win.

204
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.700
It’s okay, Mom.

205
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.140
I will make things good again.

206
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.160
You know well that I hate his guts!

207
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.520
Why do you still talk to him?

208
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.520
Why do you talk to him?

209
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.580
Slow down.

210
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.380
Shut up!

211
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.720
Don’t worry about Win.

212
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.560
He’s with the doctor now.

213
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.040
There’s nothing to worry about.

214
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:40.040
Besides, the Venerable Uncle said he will wake up.

215
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.040
The Venerable Uncle?

216
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.000
The Venerable Uncle paid me a visit today.

217
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.120
He said I should go collect holy water from four temples and he will perform a ritual for us.

218
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.120
Is that so?

219
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.720
Yes.

220
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.840
A lot of bad fortune is probably what’s causing him to be like this.

221
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.960
If we can get all the holy water, everything will go back to normal.

222
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.500
Do we have to resort to that kind of thing these days?

223
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.740
Please don’t ask too much.

224
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.940
The Venerable Uncle said it’s good, so it’ll be good.

225
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.000
Don’t you trust him?

226
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.360
If you don’t believe in this, don’t disrespect it.

227
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.940
It doesn’t hurt to try.

228
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.760
Isn’t it worth the risk to try if it could make everything better?

229
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.420
I haven’t said anything.

230
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.760
You’re being too rational just like your brother.

231
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.840
Where’s the holy water?

232
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.540
Can we send our farm workers to get it?

233
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.280
No.

234
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.500
The Venerable Uncle said I have to do this myself.

235
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.500
I don’t think you’re ready for that.

236
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.320
You’re just getting out of the hospital.

237
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.320
Where do you have to go?

238
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.920
You wouldn’t know if I told you.

239
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.520
It’s everywhere in all directions.

240
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.080
Oh, I forgot to tell you I’m not going alone.

241
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.420
Who are you going with?

242
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.500
That bloody Korn, of course.

243
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.020
What?

244
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.160
Yes, that bloody Korn.

245
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.520
He heard about it, so he offered to go with me.

246
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.960
Oh, and if you want to call Win,

247
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.860
I mean if you want to call me, call Win’s number.

248
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.140
My phone is not working.

249
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.860
Why do you talk about Korn like that?

250
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.060
Like what? Korn is Korn.

251
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.320
I’m not fully recovered yet,

252
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.760
that’s why I keep talking nonsense.

253
00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.500
Don’t mind me.

254
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.460
Let’s just hurry home after we’re done here.

255
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.020
I haven’t started packing.

256
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.940
(Four places in four regions. No kidding.)

257
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.800
(I only have seven days. Will I finish the mission in time? )

258
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.300
(I have no choice. )

259
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.860
(I have to finish it in time. )

260
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.500
Damn, this is too much.

261
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.300
I’m going to wear my own clothes.

262
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.380
Must I put these on?

263
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Clothes.

264
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.760
Toothbrush. Toothpaste.

265
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.880
Shoes. Socks.Underwear.

266
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.300
Phone!

267
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.520
Hello?

268
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.480
What’s up?

269
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.300
I just wanted to ask if you got home already.

270
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.040
I’ve been calling for some time.

271
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.040
I turned my phone off.

272
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.320
What’s the matter?

273
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.340
I’m packing.

274
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.600
Are you really going alone tomorrow?

275
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.900
Yes.

276
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.260
You’re still mad at Korn?

277
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.400
If you were me, wouldn’t you be mad at him?

278
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.500
Do you really think he wants your family’s fortune?

279
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200
Honestly,

280
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.100
after all this time you’ve known and been friends with him,

281
00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.940
do you really think he’s that kind of person?

282
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.440
Who knows?

283
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.920
When it comes to money, you can’t tell about people.

284
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.500
Haven’t you seen the news?

285
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.840
I don’t think he’s that kind of person.

286
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.000
If he doesn’t want the money, why hasn’t he given it back?

287
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.240
He might have other reasons you don’t know about.

288
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.660
What reasons?

289
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.640
I’ve been thinking about this for a year and I still can’t think of one reason,

290
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.160
except he’s been sucking up to my father for his fortune.

291
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.160
But he never talked to you about that, did he?

292
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.460
Four-eyes, seriously, who would admit to something like that?

293
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.000
Do you have an excuse for him?

294
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.140
Enlighten me.

295
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.080
I don’t know.

296
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.760
I’m not him, so I don’t know.

297
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.200
You’re closer to him than I am but you don’t even know.

298
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.360
Exactly.

299
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.100
I’m close to him. Why didn’t he tell me?

300
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.120
Let’s not talk about him.

301
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.080
I don’t want to anymore.

302
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.880
Is there anything else?

303
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.400
I’m busy packing.

304
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.720
You can talk to him when you see him tomorrow.

305
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.720
I’m not going with him.

306
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.220
I just told my mom I would.

307
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.540
Don’t even think about telling her I’m doing this alone.

308
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:10.980
I have to go.

309
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:32.860
7 DAYS LEFT

310
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.860
Win.

311
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.640
Win.

312
00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.140
You’re leaving, right?

313
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.420
Get in the car.

314
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.040
No.

315
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.040
I’m going on my own.

316
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.560
Win.

317
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.240
Why is he so stubborn?

318
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.100
Win.

319
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.540
Win.

320
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.780
Get in.

321
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.760
I’ll drive you.

322
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.020
No.

323
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.360
I’m going on my own.

324
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.360
Win, the Venerable Uncle said you must go with me.

325
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.260
My mission is to collect holy water from four temples within seven days,

326
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.660
not to go with you.

327
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.680
Win.

328
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.840
Win, get in the car.

329
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.860
Win.

330
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.160
How are you going to get there?

331
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.620
None of your business.

332
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.620
You only have seven days.

333
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.260
Don’t be stubborn. Come with me.

334
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.900
Trust me.

335
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.280
Is this how you hurry?

336
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.780
Looking for food?

337
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.420
I’m not looking for food.

338
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.260
I’m looking for bottles to collect the holy water.

339
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.300
You’re bringing so much stuff

340
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.940
and you just got out of the hospital.

341
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.720
We should go together. Trust me.

342
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.080
I’m going on my own

343
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.640
and I’m going to finish the mission without you.

344
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.640
Seriously?

345
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.860
I was just driving it the other day.

346
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.860
Why are you shaking your head?

347
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.080
Neck bone problems?

348
00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.580
Hey.

349
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.920
Flat tire?

350
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.320
You have to be kidding me.

351
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.260
Win.

352
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.680
Get in my car.

353
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.620
No.

354
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.720
I’d rather die than go with you.

355
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.400
Win, are you really going to walk?

356
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.200
Mind your own business.

357
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.160
You can’t walk all the way. Look at the sun.

358
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.900
Leave me alone.

359
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.300
Think carefully.

360
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.600
If you walk, you’ll arrive in two days.

361
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.500
Normally, a runner can only run 40 kilometers per day

362
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.200
and will rest for two days after.

363
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.720
You won’t finish this in seven days.

364
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.800
Who said I’m walking?

365
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.300
I’m hitchhiking.

366
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.560
Win.

367
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.100
Hey.

368
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.100
What’s wrong with you?

369
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.100
I think you should drop your ego.

370
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.460
If you don’t want to do this for yourself, do it for your sister.

371
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.460
Okay? Get in the car.

372
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.520
Hurry up.

373
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.320
Win, get in.

374
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.380
Hey, can I get a ride?

375
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.400
Win.

376
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.140
Hey, stop. I need a ride.

377
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.800
Hey.

378
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.400
Where are you going, girl?

379
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.380
Girl?

380
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.240
I’m going to Lop Buri.

381
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.000
Where are you heading?

382
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.060
Lop Buri?

383
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.540
I’m not going that far.

384
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.280
I’m going to Ban Pho, Chachoengsao.

385
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.280
Can I get a ride though?

386
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.240
I’ll get off on the way.

387
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.880
Sure, let’s go.

388
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.500
How long have you been trying to get a ride?

389
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.500
Not long.

390
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.420
You’re the first car I asked.

391
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.060
The other car didn’t let you ride with them?

392
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.060
No.

393
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.580
Not many people are kind these days.

394
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.820
It’s hard to find one like you.

395
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.880
You’re praising me too much.

396
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880
Anyway, it’s going to get a little packed in here.

397
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.100
Don’t worry. I just have to pick up two workers.

398
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.700
They must have been waiting for a long time.

399
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.480
Oh.

400
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.700
There he is.

401
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.500
Who is he with?

402
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.580
His wife?

403
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.340
I don’t think so.

404
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.560
No.

405
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.860
Please go wait outside.

406
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.860
I’ll get those two to sit in the cab.

407
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.540
You guys are drinking again?

408
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.320
We’ve been waiting for sometime without anything to do.

409
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.320
Is that your wife?

410
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.900
What? No.

411
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.140
Who is she then?

412
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.340
She asked me for a ride.

413
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.460
I think I’ll get off here.

414
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.080
Hey, come with us.

415
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.420
Don’t you want to come with us anymore?

416
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.700
It’s okay. The car is packed.

417
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.420
I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.

418
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.240
We won’t.

419
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.460
If there’s not enough space, you can sit on my lap.

420
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.460
No.

421
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.280
Please.

422
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.080
Let go of me!

423
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.960
Let go!

424
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:18.840
Hey!

425
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.600
Let go!

426
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.600
Ouch!

427
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.480
Don’t mess with me!

428
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.380
That didn’t hurt.

429
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.600
My skin is thick.

430
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.300
Please keep punching.

431
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.600
Please.

432
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.340
Punch me too, please.

433
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.340
Please.

434
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.040
Please, my ass!

435
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.060
She’s fierce.

436
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.720
Who’s that?

437
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.320
I’m her husband.

438
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.620
I’m sorry for all this trouble.

439
00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.220
Hey!

440
00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.140
My wife is always sulking.

441
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.700
Let go of me, Korn!

442
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.460
Let go!

443
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.960
Let go of me, Korn!

444
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.840
Korn! I’m telling you to let go of me!

445
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.400
Let go!

446
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.240
Let go of me!

447
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.640
Leave me alone already.

448
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.260
Stop.

449
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.720
Give me your backpack.

450
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.440
Get in the car.

451
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.700
You’re hurting me.

452
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.060
If I hadn’t saved you, you would be hurting a lot more.

453
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.060
But you had no right to say those things.

454
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.360
My sister is not your wife.

455
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.340
No, she’s not.

456
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.000
But if I hadn’t said that, do you think you could’ve gotten away so easily?

457
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.760
You see where your stubbornness got you?

458
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.920
The Venerable Uncle said you have to go with me.

459
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.000
Otherwise, bad things will happen to you.

460
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.020
If you don’t care about your body, at least care about your sister’s.

461
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.160
Go with me or not, it’s your choice.

462
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.460
Which way do we go?

463
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.460
Follow the GPS

464
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.460
and don’t talk to me.

465
00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.280
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

466
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.260
What’s up?

467
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.520
Win has agreed to go with you, right?

468
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.320
How do you know that?

469
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.420
His mother told me when she came here today.

470
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:16.820
Yeah.

471
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.640
How did it happen?

472
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.220
Last night when I spoke to him,

473
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.480
he said he’d never go with you, even if he had to die.

474
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.820
I don’t know.

475
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.500
He must have changed his mind.

476
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.940
Good.

477
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.900
He’s in Lin’s body. It’s dangerous for him to travel alone.

478
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.300
This is your chance to be alone with him.

479
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.540
Tell him what’s on your mind.

480
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.020
Alright.

481
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.020
I have to go. I’m driving.

482
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.600
That was Non.

483
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.760
He wanted to know if you were with me.

484
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.540
Your mother knows you’re with me.

485
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.540
Do we turn here or up ahead?

486
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.800
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.380
You’re talking to me now?

488
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.380
Why are you laughing?

489
00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.740
What’s wrong with you, Win?

490
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.620
If you’re not happy about something, just say it.

491
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.300
If you want to pee, poop, or stop at the gas station, you can tell me.

492
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.180
If you have any questions, you can talk to me.

493
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.900
I don’t want to talk to you.

494
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.880
And this is the only place I’m going with you.

495
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.260
I’m going to the other places on my own.

496
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.820
Without you.

497
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.620
(Is he not going to stop somewhere for food?)

498
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.280
(Just tell him you’re hungry.)

499
00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.500
Are you hungry yet?

500
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.840
I won’t eat.

501
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.300
(Win, you’re starving but you’re still trying to keep your cool?)

502
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.340
(I can’t tell him. It’s embarrassing.)

503
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.560
But Lin’s body needs food.

504
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.260
I won’t eat.

505
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.860
I will get the holy water first.

506
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.720
But I will eat.

507
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.340
I’m hungry.

508
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.720
I know this area.

509
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.500
There should be a good restaurant around here.

510
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.480
I’ll take you.

511
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.360
(Of course. You’re only worried about Lin.)

512
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.700
Come in quickly.

513
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.100
Welcome.

514
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:08.980
Thanks.

515
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.020
Stop making that face.

516
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.020
You look like a monkey’s butt.

517
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.260
I’d like Tom Yum seafood soup,

518
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.780
sesame encrusted chicken tendons

519
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.140
Okay.

520
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.600
And fermented pork ribs.

521
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.740
Would you also like boiled seafood with dipping sauce?

522
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.740
Yes, please.

523
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.240
It’ll be just a moment.

524
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.240
Feel free to order anything else you want.

525
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.240
I’m not hungry.

526
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.260
No?

527
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.800
We’ll see about that.

528
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.360
Excuse me.

529
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.020
Ah.

530
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.280
Chicken tendons.

531
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.100
This smells so good.

532
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.100
Here.

533
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.680
Wow, the food here is very fast.

534
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.740
Here you go.

535
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.140
Tom Yum.

536
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.300
Thanks.

537
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

538
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.820
I said I’m not hungry.

539
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.780
Okay.

540
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.520
The Tom Yum is really tasty.

541
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.660
The fermented pork.

542
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.320
Wow, it’s perfectly sour.

543
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.140
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

544
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:43.980
Yes.

545
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.560
Fine.

546
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.780
Boiled squid and spicy dipping sauce.

547
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.540
Wow.

548
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.540
The sauce is really good.

549
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.540
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

550
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.540
I can’t hold it back anymore.

551
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.780
Hey, that’s mine.

552
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.960
I thought you said you’re not hungry.

553
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.460
I’m not.

554
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.880
I’m feeding my sister nutrition.

555
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.940
Oh yeah?

556
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.720
Yeah.

557
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.160
Win?

558
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.760
What’s wrong?

559
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.120
Hey.

560
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.780
Win?

561
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.380
Why?

562
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.440
Why what?

563
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.280
Win?

564
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.760
Do you want to go to the hospital?

565
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.140
I’m in trouble.

566
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.200
What’s wrong?

567
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.120
Calm down. Speak slowly.

568
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.300
Look at me.

569
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.280
What’s wrong?

570
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.400
I…

571
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.580
You what?

572
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.440
Look at me.

573
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.360
I…

574
00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.560
You what?

575
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.560
I’m full.

576
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.020
Screw you.

577
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.040
What’s wrong with me?

578
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.100
I used to be able to eat 4-5 dishes and nothing happened.

579
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.480
Why am I suddenly getting full after trying only a bit of each?

580
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.220
That’s all Lin’s stomach could take.

581
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.000
Don’t forget that you’re in your sister’s body now.

582
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.000
Coconut milk custard.

583
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
What now?

584
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.140
You said you’re full.

585
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.240
Savory and sweet food go to different stomachs.

586
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.020
Don’t you know that?

587
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.760
Are you a cow? Is that why you have many stomachs?

588
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.580
I can’t make a clueless guy like you understand no matter how hard I try.

589
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.200
Clueless, huh?

590
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.860
I probably can only eat one cup.

591
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.320
Excuse me.

592
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.060
Yes?

593
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.880
Can I get only one cup?

594
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.080
No.

595
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.200
But I only want to eat one.

596
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.280
We sell them in pairs.

597
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.440
If you can’t eat them up, you can share them with your boyfriend.

598
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.340
He’s not….

599
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.060
Okay.

600
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.620
I’ll eat them up, darling.

601
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.600
Eat.

602
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.600
Why did you tell her I’m your girlfriend?

603
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.300
Stop thinking too much. It’s nothing.

604
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.740
You can say that because your reputation is not at stake.

605
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.360
Calling me girlfriend and wife?

606
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.320
What should I do with you?

607
00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.520
Fine, I will stop saying things like that, darling.

608
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.000
How many steps are there?

609
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.120
Wait a second.

610
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.660
Shit.

611
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.760
There are 1,500 steps.

612
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:27.920
What?

613
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.760
There are 1,500 steps.

614
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.760
We should hurry up before it gets dark.

615
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.220
I know.

616
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.060
What?

617
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.660
Aren’t you going to thank me?

618
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.780
I looked it up for you.

619
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.260
Where are you guys going?

620
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.620
To see the monk up there.

621
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.720
Now? It’s late.

622
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.580
It will already be dark when you get there.

623
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.260
Besides, tonight is a moonless night.

624
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.080
No one goes up there.

625
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.660
Moonless night?

626
00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.660
What about it?

627
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.360
They say people have seen floating head ghosts.

628
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.160
Come on, floating head ghosts are not real.

629
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.260
Believe what you will

630
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.220
but let me warn you about something.

631
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.680
Do you know you can be turned into floating head ghosts through saliva?

632
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.940
If anyone offers you water, don’t take it.

633
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.880
It’s getting late. I have to go.

634
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.140
Thank you.

635
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.340
What do you say?

636
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.680
If you’re afraid of ghosts, we can come back tomorrow.

637
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.120
Are you suggesting we drive back to Chonburi and come back here tomorrow?

638
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.920
Are you crazy?

639
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.860
Why would we drive back? We can spend the night in this area.

640
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.780
You’re crazy for telling me off without thinking.

641
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.040
You bastard.

642
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.700
I thought we’re going to waste another day.

643
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.420
More importantly, I don’t want to spend the night with you.

644
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.420
Can you do this?

645
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.320
(1,500 steps of stairs.)

646
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.980
(How much time will it take?)

647
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.220
(Climbing 300 steps up to Doi Suthep takes half an hour.)

648
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.740
(This would take an hour and a half.)

649
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.300
(You can’t walk up, Win. It’ll get dark before you arrive.)

650
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:07.980
(You have to run up.)

651
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.480
I’m going to get there before dark.

652
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.280
Good.

653
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.280
What are you looking at?

654
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.260
Don’t look.

655
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.260
Come have some water.

656
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.860
You can continue your journey later.

657
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.760
Hey, don’t drink that!

658
00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.100
Shit!

659
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.520
What’s going on?

660
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.700
You can sleep up here.

661
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.940
I’m just afraid you won’t get enough sleep.

662
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.340
We have a long way to go tomorrow.

663
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.320
5 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND FRESH OUT OF UNIVERSITY

664
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.740
I don’t know when I’ll be able to go on a trip with you guys again.
5 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND FRESH OUT OF UNIVERSITY

665
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.740
I don’t know when I’ll be able to go on a trip with you guys again.

666
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.600
Is being a doctor that busy?

667
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.940
Yes,

668
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.200
but that’s not the point.

669
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.200
Our schedules will be unpredictable.

670
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.460
We may not get the same time off.

671
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.960
Mm.

672
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.880
Then let’s enjoy this feeling.

673
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.040
How?

674
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.520
By the way, this feels familiar.

675
00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.520
How?

676
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.200
Déjà vu?

677
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.480
Have you guys seen 4bia?

678
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.960
There’s a group of friends sleeping in a tent

679
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.960
and the one in the middle got spooked by a ghost.

680
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.160
Oh, I’ve seen that movie!

681
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:55.640
Wait,

682
00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.380
that’s me.

683
00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.600
Get up, Non. Swap places with me.

684
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.320
No.

685
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.040
Why did you tell us this story?

686
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.400
No. I’m scared too.

687
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.860
Why me?

688
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.340
Korn, you do it.

689
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:05.900
What?

690
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.020
Fine, you guys are talking nonsense.

691
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.360
I can sleep in the middle.

692
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.780
Are we okay now? I’m sleeping in the middle. Problem solved.

693
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:27.800
What is it?

694
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.500
I’m getting goosebumps.

695
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.040
Do you want to do it?

696
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.540
What are you talking about?

697
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.480
I mean I’m scared of the tent’s hole.

698
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.480
Oh.

699
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.600
Come here.

700
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.740
You can sleep on my arm.

701
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.280
I’ll cover the hole.
