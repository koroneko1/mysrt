1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
How are you?

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,039
Who did this?

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,039
Shh. Relax, sweetheart.

4
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,880
The doctors are confident
you'll recover your memory over time.

5
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,560
Finally, after 20 years, I get to sleep
with a girl from Las Encinas.

6
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,439
But I had to pay.

7
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,200
-I went to your school, too.
-Oh, really?

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,159
Yeah.

9
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,640
And don't worry.
Some of us come out of there all right.

10
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,920
Hey, mind if I share your number?

11
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,920
With who?

12
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,680
My buddy.

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,439
I raved about you.

14
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,400
Didn't you want to expand the business?

15
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,120
Actually, I do.

16
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,560
But it's gotta be in this room, though.
Everything included.

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,560
-So, the same as with me?
-No. Not the same.

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
'Cause your little buddy pays double.

19
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,919
I want you to join the debate team.

20
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
You did a nice job defending Shanaa
when I first got to this school.

21
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,560
I think you've got talent.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,319
And if you choose to apply it
to serving noble causes, well,

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,439
you could one day become…
a brilliant lawyer, for instance.

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,719
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to be a lawyer.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,240
Getting there would mean
you'd have to work hard, consistently,

26
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,719
every day after class.

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,199
Wait, hold on. I can't. After school,
I work every day at the Lake Club.

28
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,080
Hmm. You'll have to quit.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,479
How much do they pay?

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
Why?

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,919
Las Encinas
is capable of offering you 25% more

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,719
for completing
assorted administrative computing tasks.

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,439
The hours would be compatible
with the debate team.

34
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,520
If you don't mind me asking,
well, uh, are you tryin' to help me?

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
-He said I'm really good.
-He's got ulterior motives.

36
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,840
They don't offer this sort of thing
to people like you.

37
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,800
-What do you mean by that?
-Come on, Samuel.

38
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
Two days ago, he wanted to kick you out
'cause you weren't worthy.

39
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,360
What's your point? He just said
I could become a great lawyer.

40
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,960
-Yeah, and you believe him, right?
-Fuck you.

41
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,719
-What are you saying?
-Samuel.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,439
-Come on, let's go. Go on.
-C'mon. Don't be pissy with me.

43
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,039
Hey. What's up, Gonza?

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Samuel, make sure Mencía stays out there.

45
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,680
-Why?
-I'm gonna give her a surprise.

46
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,680
Uh… What the hell is this?

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
The key to suite 428.

48
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,519
"Gran Hotel Brenwhorf."

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,959
For tomorrow?

50
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,720
Oh, shit.
Why didn't I switch to girls way earlier?

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,639
Come on. I don't think I was that bad.

52
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
Know what?
Actually, now that I look back on it,

53
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,759
ya done fucked up.

54
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,480
Busy tomorrow night? I'm free.

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,839
We said today. I have plans then.

56
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,839
Ah. Who are you seeing
that you can't move around for me?

57
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,319
I can do today. Mañana, no.

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Forget it.

59
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
I can't meet tomorrow, either.

60
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
Almost done. Give me a minute.

61
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,399
Coffee?

62
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,279
You think that's all you have to do?

63
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,800
I erased it.

64
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,319
Your video.

65
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,120
I did it this morning.

66
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,959
You can't erase that you recorded
without my permission.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,920
But I am telling you, it wasn't personal.
I swear.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,680
I can't trust anybody.

69
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,120
Look, Phillipe.
We should end things here,

70
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,680
because it was never gonna work out
between us.

71
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,959
You're a prince,
and I'm just… the fucking janitor.

72
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,199
There's no planet
or parallel universe

73
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,680
where you and I
would have ever worked out together.

74
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,600
Even before you recorded us.

75
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,600
Let me make it up to you.

76
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,639
Just let me…
let me prove to you that behind the title,

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,759
there's a real person.

78
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,279
Maybe I'm not interested in that person.

79
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,120
What if I was just drawn to that person
because he was a prince, but that's all?

80
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,639
And you were just drawn to me
because I was easy prey.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
-No.
-Yes.

82
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,160
-Just another groupie, right?
-No.

83
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,759
Cayetana…

84
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,720
End of story.

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,079
You go your way. I'll go my way.

86
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,160
We're more secluded in the books
than in the showers.

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,199
Stop. No more.

88
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,759
I'm not doing anything.

89
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,079
Am I gonna have to beat it into you?

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,399
Relax just a little, will you?

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,720
It was just sex, not a marriage proposal.

92
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,800
You could care less 'cause you have
no one that you might really hurt.

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
Ander.

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Look, whatever Omar's deal is,
we can talk our way through it.

95
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,040
The three of us, like adults.

96
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,279
Yeah, sure.

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Why would he want to see you,
when he won't even see me?

98
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Well,
we can at least try, right?

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Just set up a time for the three of us
to meet, and I'll sort this thing out.

100
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,199
Just trust me.

101
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,079
Hey, can we maybe go somewhere more chill?

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,600
Just a little longer. Come on.

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,360
-Please. I'm begging you.
-C'mon. Just a little longer.

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
-What are you doing?
-All right. Come on. Your turn.

105
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,759
-No, no. No fuckin' way.
-Come on.

106
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,360
-Do it. Come on.
-I don't want to.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,759
Oh, God, Ander.

108
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,759
Patrick. Patrick!

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,799
Hey. How's it going?

110
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,639
-Mm.
-How's it going? Huh?

111
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,440
Hey, turns out you don't need
much clothing to be happy, right?

112
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,320
What's going on? Did you two plan this?

113
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
-What's the deal?
-No. I swear.

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,799
-I'm not into this. I'm outta here.
-No, just stay a bit.

115
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,000
-I'm dead tired. I said no.
-Hey. Why are you in a rush?

116
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
You say you're tired? Great.

117
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,480
I have just the thing to wake you up
and get your ass off the ground.

118
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,879
-What is it? Magic?
-No.

119
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
This is G.

120
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,720
-And what's that?
-GHB.

121
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,399
A little squirt,
and say goodbye to being tired.

122
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,600
And goodbye to inhibition, repression,
self-consciousness, all of it.

123
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,440
Listen, it can't be worse for me
than chemo.

124
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,320
Dude, this shit kills people.

125
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,679
What's the matter?
You afraid to let go now?

126
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,159
Imagine that.

127
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
Listen, Omar.

128
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,759
I said no.

129
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,559
I think we both really just need
to loosen up and relax a little bit.

130
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm not interested.
For chrissake, no means no.

131
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,600
-A little squirt?
-Yeah, thanks.

132
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,159
Where did you get this?

133
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,159
You're searching my room?
Is that where we are?

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,360
-Is this from Rebeka Parrilla?
-No, you leave Rebe out of this.

135
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,000
-Her mother was in jail on drug charges.
-This has nothing to do with her.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,399
Then where'd you get it?

137
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,639
I'm not about to give it back
until you tell me where it came from.

138
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,759
I mean, you don't even know
why she had the hotel room key.

139
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,200
-It could be for anything, like maybe--
-Jesus Christ, dude.

140
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,320
You're supposed to be
the star of the debate team.

141
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,639
-Scared to see what the bad ones are like.
-Look, all I meant to say was--

142
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,320
Doesn't matter what you were gonna say.
What's wrong with me? Huh?

143
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,840
Tell me. I want to know.
Am I too much or not enough?

144
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,960
You would know,
since you fooled me like she did.

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
I'm really sorry, but…

146
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,039
but sometimes people make mistakes,
and it has nothing to do with you.

147
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Yeah.

148
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,679
It's not about what you do or don't do.
It's entirely our fault.

149
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,720
The fact that the rest of us are assholes
doesn't mean you're defective or bad.

150
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,519
The opposite, actually.

151
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,120
Hey.

152
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,159
You're the most fucking awesome girl
out there.

153
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,279
If you can hold on to one thing,
hold on to that.

154
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,559
Maybe you won't be so bad,
on second thought, with that debate thing.

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Ice cream sound good to you?

156
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,120
I want, like, a shit ton.

157
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,240
-Good, 'cause we got chocolate.
-Fuckin' awesome.

158
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,799
Yeah, that was something
my dad always told me.

159
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,159
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,519
Hey, man.

161
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,000
Evening.

162
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,639
-Evening.
-Do you have a reservation?

163
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
-Yeah.
-Yes.

164
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
You look great.

165
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,159
-Thanks. That's nice.
-Can you take our coats?

166
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,759
Thanks, Samuel.

167
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,799
-I'm out.
-No, Omar.

168
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Listen.

169
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,840
There's no way I can go to bed now.
I mean, I'm high as shit.

170
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,399
That sounds like your problem, Ander.

171
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,879
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll be his babysitter.

172
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,320
Omar.

173
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,000
Omar!

174
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,720
Hey, just try a little. It's fun.
I promise you'll like it.

175
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,759
I said no.

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,039
Please, Omar. Listen to me.

177
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
Take whatever you want and leave me alone.
Why's that so hard to get?

178
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,600
Well, hey.
At least look on the bright side.

179
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,320
-Now there's more for you and me.
-I don't want more, man.

180
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,639
Ander!

181
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,639
Hey! Watch out!

182
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,000
Uh… Can you…
Can you give me a hand? Patrick.

183
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Omar. Omar!

184
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,440
-Omar!
-I think your friend's calling you.

185
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,799
Out of the way.

186
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,440
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

187
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,000
Patrick. Patrick.

188
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,679
Patrick! Patrick!

189
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
Look at me.

190
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,720
Close the door.

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,600
-I'm gonna puke.
-Jesus, Ander.

192
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,200
What are you doing?

193
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,679
You need a shower.

194
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,720
Come on. It'll do you good.

195
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,679
Come on.

196
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,440
All right, fucking help me out here.

197
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,679
Feeling better?

198
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,039
Nah, man. I'm pretty sick.

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,559
Okay, go lay down.
I'll be there in a minute.

200
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,799
-Come on. Let's go.
-No, no, no, no. No.

201
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,960
You all right?

202
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
I feel so cold.

203
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,160
Please don't leave me.

204
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,119
Okay. Scooch over.

205
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,799
-That's kinda personal.
-It is?

206
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,960
-You're the girl of a thousand questions.
-Yep.

207
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,920
-Why do you wanna know?
-Sorry, we're, uh, closing up.

208
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,519
Your father said
I should join the debate team.

209
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,200
-He did?
-Yeah.

210
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,519
-Well, I'm on the team, too.
-For real?

211
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,440
Except you can't, right, bud?

212
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,680
I mean, you don't have time
between work and school.

213
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,279
Actually, I'm seriously considering it.

214
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,839
Oh yeah? What about your job here?

215
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,559
Well, that's kinda up to me.

216
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,160
-Just the bill?
-Yes, please.

217
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,400
Want a ride, or did you bike here?

218
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,440
I biked.

219
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,599
Samuel, don't forget the coats.

220
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,759
Benjamín,
I think I will join the debate team.

221
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,160
We're late for class.

222
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,720
Omar. Are you working at the club tonight?

223
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,160
Uh, yeah. Why?

224
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,119
I need you to do me a favor.

225
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,200
-Cut that shit out.
-What's wrong with you?

226
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,039
Hangover.

227
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Wait, you went out?

228
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,359
I thought you said
you couldn't hang out last night.

229
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,839
Who are you seeing later?

230
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,079
Um, I told you
I'm just doing some odd jobs

231
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
so I don't have to depend on Benjamín.

232
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,839
Yeah, like what?

233
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,000
Great, then we're even.

234
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Mencía,
you can't keep doing this.

235
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,359
Dad doesn't want you seeing Rebeka.
Stop adding to the tension.

236
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,599
Children aren't to blame
for the way their parents choose to be.

237
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,119
The same goes for Rebe.

238
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,720
Hello?

239
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,359
Okay.

240
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,599
-Hi.
-Hey there.

241
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,359
-Want to go?
-No. Come say hi to my dad.

242
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,519
I know.

243
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,599
Why are you here?

244
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
Mm, I have a meeting with your dad
about the debate team.

245
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,279
Why couldn't you meet at school? Why here?

246
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,079
Um, Benjamín requested it.
What's goin' on?

247
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,319
You sure?

248
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,680
-Mm, never mind.
-Samuel.

249
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,599
I was actually worried
you'd changed your mind.

250
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,920
-I almost did.
-Come in.

251
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,359
Uh, Dad. Say hello to Guzmán.

252
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,720
Of course. How are you? How's your family?

253
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,319
We're all great. Thank you.

254
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,079
-Uh, let's go to my office and talk.
-Sounds good.

255
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,480
Um, can I get a black coffee, Ari?
Want anything?

256
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,960
Me? Uh, if you could get me coffee
with a little milk, that'd be great.

257
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,359
I worked my butt off

258
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,759
at every job imaginable
to pay for my studies, too.

259
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,039
What?

260
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,119
Thought I got everything
on a silver platter?

261
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
Well, uh…

262
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,160
I don't even remember my father.

263
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
-Yeah, I don't know mine either, really.
-Hmm.

264
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,640
Thankfully, I was given a scholarship
to a private university in London.

265
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,359
And well,

266
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,759
of course, I went back home ecstatic.

267
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,759
And my mother,
the first thing she said to me

268
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,640
was,
"Don't you ever forget that we aren't,

269
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,880
and never will be, like them."

270
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,000
"Like them," she said.

271
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,000
And from that day on,
I set out to prove that

272
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,720
there's no "us" and "them."

273
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
The future's decided
by someone's merits, Samuel.

274
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,640
Right?

275
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm sure she was proud
of everything you did.

276
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,359
Just like your mother must be.

277
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Ah, Ari.

278
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,200
So you're going to be Samuel's partner.

279
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,559
His what?

280
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,319
You're gonna make a great match
on the debate team. I can tell.

281
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah.

282
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Um, I'm going out with Guzmán.

283
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,440
Thanks for the coffee.

284
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,279
-She can't handle visitors.
-Yeah.

285
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,279
Go home.

286
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,480
Huh?

287
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,559
I don't want you bothering her.

288
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,960
Hello?

289
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, Cayetana.
It's Omar. How are you?

290
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,440
Hey, listen. So, I'm calling

291
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,000
just to confirm your table
for tonight at the Lake Club.

292
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,160
What?

293
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,519
-Good evening, miss.
-Omar, what's this about?

294
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,880
Why is there no one here?

295
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,039
Your table's ready.
Will you come with me?

296
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,279
-Omar.
-Here you are.

297
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,079
Welcome. Have a seat.

298
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,319
Okay.

299
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,160
-Thanks.
-You look pretty.

300
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,960
-Omar, I'm leaving. This is absurd.
-Bonsoir.

301
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,519
-Good evening.
-Oh my God!

302
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,160
-An aperitif?
-Phillipe, what is this?

303
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,839
I don't mean to be rude, mademoiselle.
I think you've got the wrong person.

304
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,319
I'm just your humble waiter.

305
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,680
I won't see you as anything different

306
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,880
just because you played a waiter
for me tonight.

307
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
-Is it to your liking?
-Are you listening?

308
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,160
Mais non, s'il vous plaît.
It's my first day.

309
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,079
Yeah.

310
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,799
-Hmm, yeah. Not cold enough.
-Really?

311
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,200
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I'll bring you another. Anything else?

312
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,759
Oh, yeah. This napkin,

313
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,759
it's dirty.

314
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,039
I'm sorry.
I'll, uh, bring another right away.

315
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,720
Stick to English, why don't we.

316
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,640
Hmm.

317
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,680
-Can I make any sort of recommendation?
-À la carte?

318
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,319
-Mm-hmm.
-Let me see.

319
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,960
Uh…

320
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
Oh.

321
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,559
-I think I know what I want now.
-Right. Tell me.

322
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,920
Trust.

323
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,359
That's really all I want right now.

324
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,319
Cayetana, I would've taken the same steps
with anyone.

325
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,359
Well,
I don't care about anyone else.

326
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,799
You made me doubt myself
and got me in my head.

327
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,720
And I don't know about you,
but when we were together,

328
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,160
I just forgot who we were.

329
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,559
We were naked, and it was just us two.
And I forgot.

330
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,680
And I just hope
you'll manage to forget it, as well.

331
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm sorry.

332
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,640
Can you forgive me?

333
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,599
I'M COMING TO THE CLUB TO SEE YOU.

334
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,759
I'M VERY BUSY. IT'S BETTER IF YOU DON'T.

335
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,079
Hey, you two.

336
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,319
Let's go. Gotta get out of here.

337
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,319
We gotta clean this up
before our first reservation arrives.

338
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,559
Come on.

339
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,279
And only because you are thinking it,
this isn't a third date, you know.

340
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,200
Oh no?

341
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,240
-No.
-Oh.

342
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,000
It's just some little performance
I put on like the total fool that I am.

343
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,920
Okay, great.

344
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,920
Actually, the third date
is gonna be back at my place.

345
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,559
If you're interested, of course.

346
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,559
-Yeah, I am.
-Yeah?

347
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,759
Mencía?

348
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,599
Take it off for me.

349
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,759
Aren't you forgetting something?

350
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,799
That's one hour.

351
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Then let's not waste any more time.

352
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,200
Pizza? No, we agreed on sushi.

353
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,880
-One of them has anchovies. Chill out.
-Dad, that's not fair. We said sushi.

354
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,200
Dad, come on.

355
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,599
Is that the way you'll be defending
your position in a debate?

356
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,000
-He's gonna clobber you.
-You've gotta be kidding me.

357
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,119
Where is Mencía?

358
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,200
She went out earlier.

359
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,559
Who'd she go out with?

360
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,799
With Rebeka, I think.

361
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,039
-And why did you let her?
-Because I can't--

362
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,400
-I didn't want her near that girl.
-Hold on.

363
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,559
Rebeka is one of the best people
I've ever known.

364
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,279
My daughter has 3,000 euros in her room.

365
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,200
What?

366
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
Where does a kid get 3,000 euros

367
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,759
when she's going out
with a dealer's daughter?

368
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,440
Can you connect the dots, García?
Or should I?

369
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,680
But she doesn't do
that sort of thing anymore.

370
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

371
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,440
-I have to answer it.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

372
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,640
-Not right now.
-Um, look, man. Let go of me. Okay?

373
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,359
What?

374
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,920
I said I'm not into this game.
Please let go of me.

375
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,759
Enough of that, huh?

376
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,559
If you really want me to pay you,
behave like a professional.

377
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,039
Except I told you, I'm not a professional,
so let go of me.

378
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,839
Shh.

379
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,240
Uh, Patrick.

380
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,839
See if she's at the club
or if anyone's seen her there.

381
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
We'll go to Parrilla's house.

382
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,640
-She's not at Rebeka's house.
-Nobody asked for your opinion.

383
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
-I'll go get the car keys.
-I don't want you driving like this.

384
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,279
She's into something serious.

385
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,039
-Oh, please. I hope Guzmán isn't home yet.
-I can drive your father's car.

386
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,960
-I'm going with Samuel.
-What are you saying? No, no, no.

387
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,519
If she calls,
you have to be here to pick it up.

388
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,599
Let's go.

389
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,319
-Patrick?
-Have you seen Mencía?

390
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,720
N-- No. Haven't seen her all afternoon.
Patrick!

391
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,240
Get out. The fuck is this guy doing?

392
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,119
Yo, can I ask you what's going on?

393
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,079
-Fuck!
-Hey. Stop. Calm down.

394
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,759
You!

395
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,119
-Fuck, you scared me.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

396
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,160
-What?
-So now you're going after Omar?

397
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,319
What are you talking about?

398
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,599
First, you're in his bed,
then stalk him at his job.

399
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,960
-Is that how it works?
-My sister disappeared.

400
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,440
Right. You think I'm an idiot?

401
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,240
Listen, I'm not fucking lying.
Mencía's missing.

402
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,960
And you're not an idiot, just blind.

403
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Omar came looking for me.

404
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,079
At the ball.

405
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,759
You fucked him at the ball?

406
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,559
He fucked me, to be precise.

407
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,880
You must think
our family's completely bonkers.

408
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,960
No, not really. My own family--

409
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,759
I mean,
we have good reasons to be the way we are.

410
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,920
When Mencía was a little girl,
she ran away from home,

411
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,760
and we didn't even realize it
until it was dinnertime.

412
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,039
So my mother grabbed Patrick
and went to look for her with the car,

413
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,880
and soon, it got dark out.

414
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,599
My mom started getting
more and more nervous,

415
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
and they got into an accident.

416
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,400
Patrick was bedridden for two years after.

417
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,239
My mom died instantly.

418
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,840
Holy fuck.

419
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,960
My father still misses her every day.

420
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:31,639
-She had 3,000 bucks on her?
-Did you give it to her?

421
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,559
I didn't.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

422
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,039
Mencía's not answering,
and we've been there two hours–

423
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,519
Are they worried about her?

424
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,679
I gotta run. Ari's in the car waiting.

425
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,239
Oh shit, the hotel room key.

426
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,840
Please, let me go.

427
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Hey… can… can we stop?

428
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,559
Are you even listening to me? Please?

429
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,519
Who is it?

430
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,840
Room service.

431
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,039
Uh, no, no.
We didn't order anything.

432
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,440
It's a bottle of champagne for you, sir.
Courtesy of the hotel.

433
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,639
Leave it outside.

434
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,000
Hey, I… I think maybe I could go
for a little bit of champagne.

435
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,559
Hmm?

436
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,159
Who are you? Get the hell out!

437
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,519
What the hell is this?

438
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,760
Rebeka's calling me.

439
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,800
Mencía!

440
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,039
Where are you?

441
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,079
Okay, but are you all right?

442
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,440
Oh my God!

443
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,079
Well, I'll see you at home, then.
Hurry back, okay?

444
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:45,960
See you there.

445
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,679
So, back to your house then?

446
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,239
Mm-hmm.

447
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Hey, are you in the mood for pizza?

448
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,679
Sounds good.

449
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,960
-It's not what it looks like.
-Oh, it's not?

450
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,119
Explain it to me then.

451
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,239
'Cause this
could only be one fucking thing, Mencía.

452
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,599
Please don't you treat me like that, too.

453
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Rebe…

454
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,440
you know I'm only doing this
so I can afford to get out of this place.

455
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,239
Hopefully, with you.

456
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,199
I'm sorry, kid.

457
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,880
Do you think
this is some kind of game, huh?

458
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit why you did it.

459
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,880
But that asshole could've done
all sorts of awful things.

460
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,280
Don't look at me like that.

461
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I can't take it.

462
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,239
Not from you.

463
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,159
Don't scare me like that ever again
in our fucking lives, you brat.

464
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,519
Ari.

465
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
-Samuel García?
-What? What?

466
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,559
-Come with us.
-What is goin' on?

467
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:24,519
-Let's go.
-What's going on? Ari?

468
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,119
Ari. What's going-- Ari!

469
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,440
Ari!

470
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,719
Ari!
