1
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,719
Where are they now?

2
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
Mr. Kasem Suksan.

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Mr. Yut Kongpongtun.

4
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,519
Mr. Kanchit Sobchengchai.

5
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,519
Mr. Pratchaya Panbutsaban.

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,439
Mr. Panumart Na Srichiangmai.

7
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,439
That's all. For the rest of you,
thank you very much.

8
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,199
-How's it going?
-We've got good players this year.

9
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,879
-Their heights are just perfect.
-Great.

10
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
-Bye.
-One more thing...

11
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,960
Coach, bye.

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
-Bye. Don't mess around.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,800
Everything's alright. We'll be able
to manage the practice schedule soon.

14
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,840
Fine.

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,719
Let me see it when you're done.

16
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,800
I need time to figure out
how to assign the players.

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,159
-For the record, it works...
-Excuse me.

18
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,520
Is it because I'm a homo?

19
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,159
Come on,
try my hot yummy dumplings.

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Come on,

21
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
try my hot yummy dumplings.

22
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,479
Wow.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,599
If it's not good,
you don't have to pay for it.

24
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,960
If you don't want my money,
what do you want?

25
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,719
I just want...

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,639
your body and soul.

27
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,599
-Just take the money.
-Let's go. Quick.

28
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,520
Take your dumplings, boy.

29
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,080
You want some veggies?

30
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,240
Bye-bye.

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,080
Come on,
try my hot yummy dumplings.

32
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,960
What the hell?

33
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,319
That faggot can sell his dumplings,

34
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,199
but I can't sell a damn thing.

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
I've had no customers for a whole day.

36
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,240
Well, sis.

37
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,319
Look at your mussels.

38
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,800
They've been dried out in the sun
all day long.

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,159
They look dull
and have turned green.

40
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,280
Mon, I think...

41
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,000
Her mussels might be rotten by now.

42
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,919
Damn you, Jung.

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,039
You're saying shit about me.
I'm sick of you trash talking.

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,759
You're a mean faggot.
I don't know what to do with you.

45
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,120
Don't mess with Jung.
You'll never win.

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,759
Hello.
Welcome to Lampang!

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,199
Look at those tourists.

48
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,759
They look like Hipposaurus
and still taking a ride on a pony?

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
Poor thing,
it's too bad to be a pony.

50
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,240
Not as bad as being a homo.

51
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,839
What?

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,920
We are fabulous and proud.
How can you say such a thing?

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,199
You're still upset, aren't you?

54
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,040
You already knew that
those stupid volleyball clubs

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
would never ever
have a homo in their team,

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,519
except for those
who act like straight guys.

57
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,079
I know. I just want to give it a go.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,439
Finally, I can give it up.

59
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,879
You can't fool me.

60
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,439
Someone like you
can't give up on volleyball.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,639
Why not?
Why can't someone like me give it up?

62
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,759
Watch me. I will never touch
a volleyball ever again.

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,639
Holy shit!

64
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,120
Oops.

65
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,519
See? Speak of the devil.
Miracles can happen.

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Not a miracle.

67
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,759
Here.

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Thank you.

69
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,399
Oh.

70
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Cute. Hot. Babe.
He's my type.

71
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,000
He's just right.

72
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,879
-Jung, you're so horny.
-It's our turn.

73
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,519
Chai, make it quick.

74
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,839
Man.

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
Your block was so lame.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Sorry.

77
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,439
Hey, Chai!

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,279
Why can't you get the ball?

79
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,720
Damn you, Chai.

80
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,720
Block with me on the second contact.
You never listen to me.

81
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,319
Are you nuts?

82
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,639
You saw the ball coming over the pole.

83
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,079
-Do you ever listen to anyone?
-You want a piece of me?

84
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
Hello, everyone.

85
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,439
I'd like to introduce Ponthip,
or Coach Bi to you all.

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,439
Well, Coach Bi
is a teacher at Boonyawart School.

87
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,560
She made the school's volleyball team
champions three years in a row.

88
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,600
Does her achievement

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,639
have anything to do with us?

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
It does, because Coach Bi

91
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
is going to be the new coach
of our Lampang team.

92
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,839
-What about Coach Chatri?
-We've considered that

93
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,879
Coach Chatri has health problems.

94
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,560
Let's just say that

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,800
Coach Bi will take care of you all.

96
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Coach Bi,
just don't let me down, okay?

97
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,600
-I won't.
-Gotta go.

98
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,680
Goodbye.

99
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,680
Hello, everyone.

100
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,759
-She's a lesbian.
-Obviously.

101
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,879
I'm so glad to be here.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
I already know everyone's name,

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,920
but I don't know how good you are

104
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,279
-in the game.
-Neither do we.

105
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,000
A high school championship is...

106
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,079
-different from our league.
-That's right.

107
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,399
Keep in mind that the Lampang team
has never been a champion yet.

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,040
That's why I want to have a tryout,
so we can see if there's some new hope.

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,560
Such a waste of time, Coach.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,199
I am the team's MVP.

111
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
We know who is good or not.

112
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
Mon, I've just bought a new lipstick.

113
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll swatch it for you.

114
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,959
Daddy!
You keep doing that to me.

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,959
Jung, take these sausages

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,360
to your Auntie Nee's house
in Bangkok for me.

117
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,840
You have to go straight to her place.

118
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,759
-They might go bad.
-Daddy.

119
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,879
It's time to start your career, honey,

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,519
and behave.

121
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Well, Mommy,

122
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
the salary is ridiculous.

123
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,559
I can make more money
from selling dumplings.

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't say that.
You've got a degree with honors.

125
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,240
You can't just be a food vendor, right?

126
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,879
Jung, your apartment in Bangkok.
What's it name?

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,559
It's next to a university, isn't it?

128
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,200
-That's right, Daddy.
-Yeah. I got that right.

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,279
Your foundation looks weird.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,720
Come on, Daddy.

131
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,240
Stop it, Jung.

132
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,399
I said stop it.

133
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Lampang City Station.
Lampang City Station.

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,120
Mon, come here. Hurry up.

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
You have to see this.

136
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,799
-Follow me.
-Where?

137
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,039
Don't ask.
Come on, hurry up.

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
-I have something to show you.
-Where is it?

139
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,360
The train will be leaving soon.
Where are you going?

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,320
Look, Mon.

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,320
See that? It says volleyball.

142
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,799
Lampang team
is recruiting new male players.

143
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,600
What do you say?

144
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
Nothing. I don't give a shit.

145
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,279
Mon, wait. It's volleyball.

146
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,759
Mon, we haven't had a chance
to play volleyball for years.

147
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,559
Let's do it. I can't wait.

148
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,000
Wait, Jung.

149
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,600
What about making a team?

150
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
This is volleyball,

151
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,200
not a video game
that only two of us can play.

152
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,279
The team is nothing.
It's normal. Don't you worry.

153
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll just take a walk around

154
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,240
and then lots of guys will follow me.

155
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,240
-You mean dogs?
-No.

156
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
Granny, not dogs.

157
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,639
Boys. You'll see how hot I am.

158
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,240
Jung.

159
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,759
What about your job?

160
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,559
And that sausage too?

161
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,320
How do we get there?

162
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,679
Yes!

163
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,039
My dream has come true.

164
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
I will survive.

165
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
We'll see, Jung.
If we don't make it at the tryout,

166
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,519
you'll have to pay for our new tickets.

167
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,519
Coach Bi will have a tryout.

168
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,240
I guess we'll be alright.

169
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,360
-We're so ready.
-Coach Bi, my ass.

170
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,399
Bullshit. Hey!
Where's my beef salad?

171
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,720
I can't take this.
She's just a school coach.

172
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,799
A high school, bro.

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,240
She must be good at it.

174
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,879
You're trying to please that lesbian.

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,039
Wanna hook up with her?

176
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,639
-I think you're not her type.
-Son of a bitch.

177
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,200
I gotta go.

178
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,559
These homo people

179
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,759
are really disgusting.
I can't stand them.

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,039
They are a disgrace to humanity.

181
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,200
Wanna eat this?
If you do...

182
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,559
cook it yourself.

183
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,679
Mon, you go to him.

184
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,320
You.

185
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,080
What?
It's your idea, Jung.

186
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,559
Mr. Yuttachai Srisattayakul.

187
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Mr. Kamon Klaimae.

188
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,320
Mr. Julapong Wiwattananong.

189
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,399
Jungkochika's team is here.

190
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,840
-I'm Julapong.
-Yes.

191
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,919
Right, next.

192
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,519
He acted up
and then mingled with the homos.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
Please, sign it.

194
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,519
Next.

195
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
What's the point of this tryout?

196
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,799
They're all losers.

197
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,919
Such a waste of time.

198
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,320
The next round of our tryout

199
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,440
will be Meungman's team
versus Jungkochika's team.

200
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,639
Hey! Hey!

201
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Incoming. Ouch!

202
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,960
We attack first.
Mon, you're on the right and Jung...

203
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
He's hot. So perfect.

204
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,559
His sex appeal is no joke.

205
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,399
Hello, handsome.

206
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,559
You're Meungman, right?

207
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,919
Such a pretty name.

208
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,360
Why are you here, cutie?

209
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,159
Well...

210
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,279
Why don't you just go
and fuck yourself?

211
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,879
Oh my goodness.

212
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,559
Why are you so rude like a jackass?

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
-What's up, faggot?
-Shit.

214
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,320
You have nice legs but...

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
they're quite big, you know.

216
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,960
-Let me see.
-What are you doing, pervert?

217
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,519
Asshole. Son of a bitch.

218
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,879
Go away.

219
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Let me see it.

220
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,919
Get lost, will you?

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
On your positions now.

222
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
On your positions.

223
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,200
Go to your position.

224
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,360
Kamon.

225
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,159
You'd better use your anger for the game.

226
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,559
MEUNGMAN 6
JUNGKOCHIKA 4

227
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,519
MEUNGMAN 7
JUNGKOCHIKA 8

228
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,559
You, shut up.
Stop it.

229
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,919
Why can't you get the ball?

230
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,440
What was that?

231
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
-That's my position.
-No. It's mine. I got the ball.

232
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,720
The ball's coming!

233
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,600
MEUNGMAN 14
JUNGKOCHIKA 14

234
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
15

235
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
-They're good.
-I'm so happy.

236
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,120
Jungkochika.

237
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,480
See what faggots like us can do?

238
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,000
Now for the list of players

239
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,159
of the Lampang volleyball team.

240
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Mr. Meungman.

241
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,559
You are the team's leader.

242
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Mr. Yuttachai.

243
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes.

244
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,679
Mr. Julapong.

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,399
-Mon, I made it.
-Mr. Sakda.

246
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,679
Mr. Kamon.

247
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
Mr. Sobprab.

248
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Mr. Somsak.

249
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,440
Mr. Samran.

250
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,960
Mr. Rattana.

251
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,879
That's all.

252
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
-I'll let you know...
-Coach.

253
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,559
As a leader,
I want to make a change right now.

254
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,360
I don't want these faggots in our team.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,159
Leave him alone.

256
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,119
Man,

257
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,799
if you discriminate against people
based on sexuality,

258
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,720
you don't deserve to be an athlete.

259
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,960
How dare you, Coach?

260
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,920
Do you know

261
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,720
what you are doing?

262
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,200
Mon, our team must be awesome.

263
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,759
Where are you going?
Is Coach Bi not home?

264
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,119
Coach, don't tell me that
those two are...

265
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,400
What? All of them quit?

266
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,519
Do we have anyone else from
Boonyawart School?

267
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
Coach,

268
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,240
you should keep Meungman.

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,720
Me and Jung are not that good.

270
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,559
Seriously, it's getting out of control.

271
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you have any other friends
who can play well?

272
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,279
-What?
-Yeah.

273
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,680
Do you know anyone
who is good at volleyball?

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,640
Yes, I do. They were so good
when we were in college.

275
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,119
Their skills are no joke, seriously.

276
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, they are not...

277
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,400
like you, are they?

278
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,720
Nonsense.
He's in an army.

279
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,559
-Set.
-Set the ball.

280
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,160
-That's him, Nhong.
-The troll-like one, Coach.

281
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,200
Is he okay?
Is he good at it?

282
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,799
-He's so powerful.
-He's good and different.

283
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,920
No.

284
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,000
Just a moment, Coach.

285
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,759
These people are so mean.
That hurts.

286
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,240
You can't just drop me. I'm hurt.

287
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
What's up, pussy?

288
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,680
Jung.

289
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,759
Are you sure it's the Cabaret Show,
not a freak show?

290
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,519
This is the seventh show.

291
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,640
Pia. Pia.

292
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Nhong, is this nice?

293
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,400
-This one is cute.
-I prefer this one.

294
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,720
Turn around, okay?

295
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,799
-You can go.
-So chic.

296
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,000
-Sis, your silicone is so bouncy.
-Bitch.

297
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,000
You've undergone
so many plastic surgeries.

298
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,680
You guys, my boobs
are not your toys.

299
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,039
All three of us
kept finding you in the crowd,

300
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,640
and we almost couldn't recognize you.

301
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,640
I thought you were Paris Hilton.

302
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,640
He's right.

303
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,599
We have something in common.

304
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,960
The magic of plastic surgery.

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,200
-Wow. So chic.
-Exactly.

306
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,480
Sis, what about our volleyball team?

307
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,720
-Are you in?
-Right.

308
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,279
Coach,

309
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I really want to help you, but...

310
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,119
I haven't touched a ball for three years.

311
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,359
-Worried about your boobs?
-Bitch.

312
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,119
I'm scared that my face will be ruined.

313
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,799
If my nose was messed up,
what would I do?

314
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,400
Just call your doctor.

315
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,039
Pia, are you done?

316
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,559
Chat.

317
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,119
Chat, these are my friends and coach.
They came to see me.

318
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
-Hello.
-So hot.

319
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,759
Hello.

320
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,279
If I could do it,

321
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,240
I would undergo plastic surgery
as much as Pia did.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
If I could do it,

323
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
I would fuck Pia.

324
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,039
Well, she's not in.

325
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,200
Probably so into her boyfriend.

326
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,880
All girls need their boyfriends.

327
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,880
Who doesn't?

328
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,319
Just like all the bees

329
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,359
are always welcomed by flowers.

330
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,680
Then, we can go home now.

331
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,759
No need to rush, Coach.

332
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,680
-Pia.
-Wow.

333
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,640
-Fa-bu.
-You're gorgeous.

334
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,480
Well, you can't be with us,
so we have to go.

335
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,519
Yes, that's right.

336
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,039
Who said that I can't go with you?

337
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,519
I talked to Mama and she said
I can take a week off.

338
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,680
Wow.

339
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,319
Pia can join us.

340
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,039
Mama said yes,

341
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,680
or your boyfriend said yes?

342
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,839
Bitch.

343
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,880
Wit. Wit.

344
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,240
Your friends are here.
They're waiting for you over there.

345
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,839
You should meet them.

346
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,200
Hey, have you seen the woman...

347
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,480
How come?

348
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
Oh, Jung.

349
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,839
Today is your big day.

350
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,480
How could we miss it?

351
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
Exactly.

352
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
You're getting married

353
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,480
and you didn't invite us?

354
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,759
It's just an engagement.

355
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
So it's a small party
with our families only.

356
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,960
Congratulations to you, Wit.

357
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Where's your fiancé?

358
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,400
Hello.

359
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,920
This is Julie, my fiancé.

360
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, her name is Julie.

361
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,559
Jung.

362
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
You have a pretty name.

363
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,359
Great.

364
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,720
Li Ju, come here. Hurry up.

365
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,000
-Greet your granny.
-Mom, I told you to call me Julie.

366
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,279
Can't you call me Julie, Mom?

367
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,079
-She calls herself Julie though.
-You guys.

368
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,640
The master told me,
after seeing Wit's birth date,

369
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,480
that a long engagement
is not good for him.

370
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,400
So I want you to get married soon.

371
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,119
I think I should wait.

372
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,599
What are you waiting for?

373
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,680
Get married and have kids.

374
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,839
Mom and dad will take care of them.
Let's do it.

375
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,599
I need more time.

376
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,759
My friends asked me
to join their volleyball team.

377
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,519
-Volleyball?
-Volleyball?

378
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,720
Oh, right.

379
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,799
He's always liked playing sports.

380
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,960
He saw a bodybuilder
when he was a kid. He was so...

381
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
thrilled.

382
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,119
Finally.

383
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,519
Where's the mirror?

384
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,039
Oh, God.
I look pale like a ghost.

385
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
I look like one of Wit's relatives.

386
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,680
Look at my face.
It's horrible.

387
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,759
-Hey, Wit.
-Yeah?

388
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,279
Now you're a lesbian?

389
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,759
Ew!

390
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,839
Absolutely disgusting, isn't it?

391
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,880
Don't be silly.

392
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,640
It was so sudden,
I didn't know what to do.

393
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,160
They've already
arranged my engagement.

394
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
What would you do
if you had to get married to her?

395
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,640
-Wit.
-Well...

396
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,640
How about doing it
like you're making a movie?

397
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,079
You and her enter the room
and turn off the light.

398
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,319
Then, you switch up with a stand-in.

399
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,799
That's crazy, Jung.

400
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,039
You've watched too many movies.
Such a drama queen.

401
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,880
-It works though.
-It really does.

402
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,640
-Good idea.
-You do it.

403
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,119
-Are you insane?
-If this happens to him...

404
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,440
That's enough.

405
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm serious.

406
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,359
Hey, Julie is quite pretty.

407
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,799
LAMPANG

408
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,000
Bullshit.

409
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,440
-Don't do that.
-Right. I can't die here.

410
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,559
-Wit, are you going to be a lawyer?
-Hey! Look.

411
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,519
Nice tractor, uncle.

412
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,599
All of them?

413
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,599
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

414
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,319
They're all good players.

415
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,880
Chai, I missed you.

416
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,240
Hurry up. I'm going to introduce him
to you guys.

417
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,160
This is Wichaidee.

418
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,119
This one...

419
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,680
is Pia, Pianuch.

420
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,759
And this is Nhong, the troll.

421
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,039
Hello to you.

422
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,599
You're way more good looking
than what Jung said.

423
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,400
Are you guys done?

424
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,200
There are only six of us in the team,

425
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,839
so I asked three of my students
who can play volleyball

426
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,680
to join us for practice
and be our substitutes.

427
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,119
I'm so relieved.

428
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,000
Here they are.

429
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,079
Come and meet your seniors,
April, May and June.

430
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,960
What did you call them?

431
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,440
Hello.

432
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,160
-I'm April.
-I'm May.

433
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,319
I'm June.

434
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,839
We're so glad to know you all.

435
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
-They're so cute.
-Yep. Come on.

436
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,160
-You guys are so cute.
-Hello.

437
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,119
Muk.

438
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,079
You're not coming with me to see Nan?

439
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,640
Nope.

440
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,799
I can't beat your teammates' beauty.

441
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,200
Nonsense.

442
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
They don't really hit on me.

443
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
Now I'm not sure about this team.

444
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,519
I'm just kidding.
Don't be upset

445
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,079
that everyone says
you are the moon among the stars.

446
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,599
People don't think that
you have anything to do with them really.

447
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,160
Can I ask you something?

448
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,039
Seriously, do you not like them
because they're not straight

449
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,240
or you want them to be girls?

Lampang team has made it
as the representative of District Five

455
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,559
to participate in
Thailand National Games this year.

456
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,759
They beat Nan team
by winning three sets in the preliminary.

457
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,200
They've become
the top team of this tournament.

458
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,200
We shouldn't underestimate them.

SAMRUAY SAENGTUBTIM
COACH - NAN PROVINCE TEAM

460
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
We thought they're weak like girls.

461
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:19,680
They also did a lap dance
when they got points.

462
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,519
It's really distracting, you know.

463
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,599
My players couldn't focus on the game.
Idiots!

464
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,440
They're getting more confidence
for the next match

465
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,720
with their tricks and talents.

466
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,319
They beat Lamphun team
like it was nothing.

467
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,480
I'm pretty sure that the third match

468
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,680
was not too hard for Lampang team.

469
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,559
They played really well
and won over Phrae team.

470
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,599
The cheering crowd went wild for them.

472
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,039
My boys haven't practiced much as a team
so there's a lot to improve.

COACH - LAMPANG PROVINCE TEAM

474
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,720
They can beat teams of straight guys
three matches in a row.

475
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,559
What do you want to say about that?

476
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,119
Let the best team win.

477
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,079
They're all grown men.
No differences.

478
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,000
However,
my team comes with great passion.

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,640
Their passion or whatever
is unbelievable.

480
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
The volleyball team
with a feminine touch from Lampang

481
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
can beat the mighty Chiang Mai team

482
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,160
three sets to one.
We have no doubts about them.

483
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,839
Only time will tell, in six months,

484
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,240
what will happen in the upcoming
National Games in Nakhon Sawan.

485
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,160
Will Lampang team
be able to get a gold medal

486
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,839
for District Five?

489
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,359
We don't have time
to train some new players.

490
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,920
Your boys are pretty good.
They made it to the top in Nan.

491
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,720
Their teamwork is awesome too.

492
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,079
We can't do it from scratch once again.

493
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,200
Hold on, Coach Bi.

494
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,160
I didn't mean that.

495
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,359
You don't have to change
any of your players.

496
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,559
I mean...
I'm talking about...

497
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,480
that tournament in Nan.

498
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,880
I think it's pretty weird, Coach Bi.

499
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,079
How should I explain it?
Well...

500
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,279
The ways that they behave.

501
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:11,039
Do you think it's alright
to behave in that way?

502
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,320
You mean they're being sassy
like school girls?

503
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,920
That's what I mean.

504
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,719
I'm so worried about this,
Coach Bi.

505
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,079
I mean, people with authority.

506
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,360
If one of them is not happy
about our boys,

507
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,159
we could be in trouble.

508
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,079
-What's wrong, Nhong?
-Nhong.

509
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,000
What happened to you, Nhong?

510
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,719
-What's up with you?
-Are you okay, Nhong?

511
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,719
-You've got cramp?
-What is it?

512
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
No. Not a cramp.

513
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,000
What is it?

514
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,320
My nails are ruined.

515
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,199
I did my manicure last month.

516
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,559
Take it easy, Nhong.

517
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,559
We will fix them with some hot glue.

518
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
Let's have a chat.

519
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,719
Quick.

520
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,239
Come here.

521
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,119
We haven't practiced for a long time.

522
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,239
You guys are not in your best condition.

523
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,480
I want you all to practice as a team.

524
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,719
Too bad that Pia can't be with us.

525
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,360
She has a lot on her mind right now.

526
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,719
The fact that we've made it
to Nakhon Sawan

527
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,239
drives me crazy. It's so surreal.

528
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,079
If we don't have Pia,

529
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,440
-I think it's alright.
-That's great.

530
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,719
We can have a new guy.

531
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,000
Only queers like us made it, remember?

532
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,880
Listen,

533
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
we should always remind ourselves

534
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,440
about what we're doing.

535
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,239
Mon...

536
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,559
Chai...

537
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,159
We'll have to sacrifice a lot for our team

538
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,079
or we might lose it.

539
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,920
You know, I met the district chief
on the other day.

540
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
You have no idea
that there are some people

541
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,079
who hate the way you behave.

542
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,760
Don't have too much pride.

543
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,239
Who's that?

544
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,519
Doesn't matter who they are.

545
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,519
The point is, they have authority

546
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,840
that can bring our team down,
end of story, just like that.

547
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,800
One. Two. Hey.
One Two. Hey.

548
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,639
One. Two...

549
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,280
-Pia is here.
-Oh, sis.

550
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,840
-Pia is here.
-Oh, Pia.

551
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,079
What's going on?

552
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Pia, you poor thing.

553
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,639
She looks like she has been dumped.

554
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,000
You're right.

555
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,880
He told me

556
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,239
his parents wanted us to break up.

557
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,679
He confessed to me later

558
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
that he...

559
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,280
loved someone else.

560
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,159
Isn't it awful, Nhong?

561
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,519
I mean, she's gorgeous.

562
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,440
How could he do that to her?

563
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,000
God bless her.

564
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,199
Everlasting love doesn't exist.

565
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,559
Sis, you made the right decision
coming here.

566
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,559
It's better than wandering around.

567
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,360
Hi.

568
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,360
You guys take care of Pia
and take a rest.

569
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,760
Let's call it a day.

570
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,000
Come on, sis.

571
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,840
Poor Pia.

572
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,199
Kamon, what happened?
Tell me everything.

573
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,519
It's quite complicated.
Pia broke up with her boyfriend

574
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,840
because he fell for his fiancé
whom he had been totally ignoring.

575
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,679
Sis, look at these shoes.
They are so pretty.

576
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,599
Must be really expensive.

577
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,840
The color and design are so nice.

578
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,199
All guys are the same.

579
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,039
They'd never fall for a transgender.

580
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,440
If you're transgender,

581
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,440
you must be naughty, slutty,

582
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,679
and have sex as much as you can.

583
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,159
My goodness, what an attitude!

584
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,000
When you were with him,
you said that you were a monogamist.

585
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,679
Your ex just went back to that girl

586
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,719
and you have turned into a polygamist?

587
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,079
We've been waiting for the right guys,
just like you said.

588
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,480
They are all satanic.

589
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Why are you so suddenly
changing your standpoint?

590
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,719
I can't follow you.

591
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:09,920
People like us
will never have a happy ending.

592
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's right, sis.

593
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,760
If so, why would you care for him?

594
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,239
-Stay here and play volleyball with us.
-Yeah.

595
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,920
You've got a month off.

596
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,960
Spend it wisely. Don't be upset.

597
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,480
Right. Turn your sadness
into power for the game.

598
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,519
It's much better than
being sad and bitter like this.

599
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,599
Yeah.

600
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,719
Well, Nhong,

601
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,159
I've known you for seven or eight years.

602
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,960
Finally, you said the right thing.

603
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,840
Bitch. You think I'm useless.

604
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,079
You slut!

605
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,440
You bitch! You ugly whore!

606
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,519
Chat, you go to hell.

607
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,440
Asshole.

608
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,119
That bitch.

609
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,760
-What's your problem?
-I just can't do it.

610
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,320
Take it easy, Mon.

611
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,199
-Easy, Mon.
-What's wrong with it?

612
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,679
-Take it easy.
-Don't.

613
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,000
-He didn't mean it.
-Take Chai away.

614
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,440
Mon, take it easy.
It's nothing.

615
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,679
-How could he...
-He didn't mean it.

616
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,239
Damn. Can't deal with his ego.

617
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Don't be upset.
It causes wrinkles, you know.

618
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,800
Right, Mon.

619
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,199
You have an ego as big as he has.

620
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,000
Everyone, listen up.
Hear me out.

621
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,480
I have a surprise today.

622
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,639
Oh.

623
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,679
Please give Nhong
a big round of applause.

624
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,400
Thank you.

625
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,920
This is for you, Mon.

626
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,920
A jacket?

627
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,400
-What about me?
-Pianuch's.

628
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,239
These are for April, May and June.

629
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,559
My God.

630
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,639
IRON LADY

631
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,880
These jackets
are my mom's designs.

632
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,519
She designed and made them herself.
Our team's name...

633
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,519
is Coach Bi's idea.

634
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,239
It matches you guys perfectly.

635
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,320
Strong but feminine.

636
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,719
Feminine but strong.

637
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,360
Absolutely awesome.

638
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
Looks like our leader
feels uncomfortable with that name.

639
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,440
No.

640
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,960
You'd better be strong like the name.

641
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,159
Mon, why can't you shut your mouth?

642
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,519
You always bite his head off.

643
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,639
Let me do it for you.

644
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,039
Sure. I need someone
to help me out.

645
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,920
-Oops. My bad.
-What do you mean?

646
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
-To your health.
-Cheers.

647
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,320
It's sizzling. Looks yummy.

648
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,360
Uncle, are you alright?

649
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,039
NAKORNSAWAN SCHOOL
WELCOME DISTRICT FIVE TEAM

650
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,679
We're here. Thanks.

651
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,159
Private Nhong.

652
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,920
-Salute.
-Salute.

653
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
Salute to you girls.

654
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,400
Jung. Look.

655
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,840
-Jung, hot guys coming your way.
-Boys.

656
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,000
What's your name?
Just call me Nhong.

657
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,599
Nhong, go.

658
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:28,519
THE VOLLEYBALL DRILL BOOK

659
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,679
You're not coming this way, Leader?

660
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
I will.

661
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,840
I just forgot something.

662
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,119
Hey.

663
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,880
If you could make a wish come true,
what would it be?

664
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,880
I don't believe in magic.

665
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,719
I believe in myself.

666
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,880
I knew
that would be your answer.

667
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:04,000
You know,

668
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,320
I used to be like you.
I used to believe in myself.

669
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,239
But my life experiences

670
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,519
have proven me wrong.

671
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,519
I had this dream for so long.

672
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:19,360
I wanted to play for a famous club.

673
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,800
I wanted to be in a national tournament,
an international one,

674
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,679
like SEA Games or Asian Games.

675
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:29,199
How about Olympic Games?

676
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,199
That must be hard.
You should get a good start.

677
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:38,800
Oh, you started with queers like us.

678
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,159
Well...

679
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,800
just do your best.

680
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,880
You see us like everybody does.

681
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:52,639
Seriously,

682
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,280
have you ever
made friends with a queer?

683
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,320
No.

684
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,280
How many queers

685
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,679
have you known so far?

686
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If none,

687
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,400
you have no right to look down on us.

688
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:22,119
Thank you. Thank you.

689
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,400
Rambutan please.

690
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,079
Why are they so small?

691
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:32,760
A queer's rambutan
are always small like these,

692
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,360
but I can guarantee you,
they're all delicious.

693
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,599
How many do you want?
I'll get them for you, cutie.

694
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,039
How about three kilos?

695
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,039
-Maybe not today.
-Why is that?

696
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,920
Come on, cutie.

697
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,880
It's so pretty. Can I try it on?

698
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,039
No! You can't try it on.

699
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,599
Your head is so huge.

700
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
You'll ruin it. Go away.

701
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,719
I won't sell it to a homo like you.

702
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,840
Go away from my stall.
Take your stuff away too. Go.

703
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,400
I said go away.

704
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,199
I saw your team from District Five.

705
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,360
Where did you find them?

706
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,320
Man, they're something.

707
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,559
Don't be too harsh on them.

708
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,840
Right. They might get hurt easily.

709
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,239
I have a better idea.

710
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,559
Why don't you and your team
transfer to women's volleyball?

711
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,159
That way,
your team might have a chance to win.

712
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,079
Winning isn't everything, is it?

713
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,400
No matter what gender my players are,

714
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,039
they are real athletes for sure.

715
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,239
I heard that one of them
is transgender.

716
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,199
For local or provincial tournaments,

717
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,079
-I think it's okay.
-Yeah.

718
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,159
-But this is a national one.
-That's right.

719
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,119
I don't know
how they've made it this far.

720
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,480
I'll do something about it.

721
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:35,360
Sir, here you are.

722
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,480
This is it?

723
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,480
WELCOME TO
PAKNAMPO GAMES

724
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:47,760
WELCOME ALL OF YOU

725
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,320
WELCOME

726
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,159
NAKHON SAWAN SCHOOL
WELCOME ATHLETES FROM DISTRICT FIVE

727
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:53,360
WELCOME ALL ATHLETES

728
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,639
Honey, it's on TV.

729
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,639
Hurry up. The parade's beginning.

730
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,239
You'll see our Jung.
Just wait for it.

731
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,239
-He's coming?
-All of them will.

732
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Where's our son?

733
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,360
You'd better watch those
walking at the end of the line.

734
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,840
They get a lot of attention
from reporters.

735
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,039
We don't know who they are.

736
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,519
-There he is.
-I need their details.

737
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,840
-One moment.
-He's cute.

738
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,559
According to the report,

739
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,480
-at the end of the line...
-So pretty.

740
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,639
...is the men's volleyball team

741
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,480
from District Five
and their team is called

742
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,599
The Iron Ladies.

743
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,719
It'll be really interesting

744
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,280
to see how well they perform in the game.

745
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,079
Hey, we've got some good news.

746
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,679
We have to play
three matches in a row today.

747
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,519
-Three matches?
-Oh, my God.

748
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm gonna be dead for sure, Coach.

749
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,639
I'm not a machine.

750
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,519
They're trying to get rid of us.

751
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,320
They want us out today.

752
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,679
We should be ready.

753
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,280
Somebody wants us
out of this tournament so badly.

754
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,159
Go!

755
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,519
DISTRICT FIVE 14 POINTS
DISTRICT TWO 7 POINTS

756
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,039
Hey! Let's see the wrath of queers.

757
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,840
You haven't paid for it.

758
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,199
RAJABHAT INSTITUTE NAKHON SAWAN

759
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,000
Come on, Jung.

760
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,280
Hit!

761
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,480
Jung...

762
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:04,639
Get the ball.

763
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,679
The Iron Ladies.

764
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,159
-The Iron Ladies.
-Everyone, come on.

765
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,880
-It's better than the second match.
-They're hyped up.

766
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,719
Good job, all of you.

767
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,079
Hello.

768
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,079
Trust me. They can't make it through
three matches in a row.

769
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:03,800
"PINK BOYS" ARE ON FIRE
IN PAKNAMPO GAMES

770
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,119
THE IRON LADIES
WON 3 MATCHES IN A ROW

771
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,800
VISIT CLINIC

772
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:17,280
-Hello.
-Hey, what's up?

773
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,519
Are you not coming to see me?

774
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,280
No, I'm afraid I can't take a day off.

775
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,679
Where is everybody?

776
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:27,400
They are so famous now.

777
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,599
They have an interview at a radio station.

778
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,360
They've gone crazy.

779
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,239
Wit is...

780
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,159
studying for an exam in his room.

781
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,039
Oh, he is so hard-working.

782
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,719
Do his parents know
that he is...

783
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,480
No. Don't let them know about him.

784
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,159
Must be big trouble.

785
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,679
Look at them.
We've never seen so many fans like this.

786
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,280
I'm so touched and speechless.

787
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,159
Here's the last question.

788
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,440
The Iron Ladies team
beat other teams in Nan,

789
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,400
and today you won
three matches in a row.

790
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:12,800
Does that mean queers can play volleyball
much better than straight guys?

791
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,039
You're a big star today, Nhong.

792
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,800
-A fruit juice vendor.
-Jung, wait up.

793
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,400
Right, The Iron Ladies.

794
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,039
What's up?

795
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,800
Faggots.

796
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,000
I'm so sorry.
I'll buy a new one for you.

797
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,039
That's okay. I don't want it.
I'd prefer some oranges.

798
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,440
You jerk!

799
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,400
You son of a bitch.
Asshole. Ugly as hell.

800
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,199
-Dick head.
-What did you say?

801
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,320
I said...

802
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,679
you're a dick head.

803
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:06,639
Faggot!

804
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,880
-Want a piece of me?
-You're bullying my friends?

805
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:13,079
What a loser.

806
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:15,599
Stop it. Stop.

807
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,519
Get a grip, people.

808
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,599
Knock it off,
you guys are athletes.

809
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,360
It's really nothing.
My friend just wanted an orange

810
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,199
and they acted like drama queens.

811
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,840
-Bullshit. You're lying.
-Easy. Stop it.

812
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,559
That's enough.
Everyone, back to your place.

813
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:35,400
Are you drunk? Go home, now.

814
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,159
-Go away.
-He said go.

815
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,920
Take it easy.

816
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,000
-Thank you, Officer.
-That's alright.

817
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,000
If you hadn't stopped them,

818
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,599
we might've been in big trouble.

819
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,000
I think it's them

820
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,199
that might be in trouble.

821
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,800
Look, it's a mess.

822
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:07,559
Officer, can I have your name?

823
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,239
I'm Jung.

824
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,000
Yute. Lieutenant Yute.

825
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Your name sounds so manly.

826
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,840
Why did you hit me, bitch?

827
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,920
Lieutenant, look.
He hit my hands.

828
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,119
Sis, are you alright?

829
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,320
You're thinking of that jerk?

830
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:42,320
Yeah. It's great that I have you guys
and our matches in my mind.

831
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,360
If not, I'd probably feel so depressed.

832
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,320
I just don't get it.
Why are you so into that jerk?

833
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,559
We had lots of good memories together.

834
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,199
It's good for him to be with his fiancé.

835
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:01,239
It's better than spending his time
with a queer like me.

836
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,079
He is so selfish, like all men are.

837
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:08,519
Right. All men are selfish.

838
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,119
No matter what their sexuality is.

839
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,119
That's right.

840
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,360
Just like my dad.
He never loved me or cared for me.

841
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,840
He ignores me.

842
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:22,519
I grew up with my mum.

843
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:25,920
He is so selfish

844
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,320
and abusive. He hit me and my mom
when he was angry.

845
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:31,800
He hates me because I'm gay.

846
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:33,960
It's funny.

847
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,519
Mom always tells me
to love and respect him just because...

848
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,239
he's my father.

849
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:42,800
But I'll never love him.

850
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:47,840
You can't love him,

851
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,480
but you don't have to hate him though.

852
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,320
Hating someone makes you suffer.

853
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,079
You troll.

854
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Lieutenant Yute likes me.

855
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,039
Says who? He had a crush on me.

856
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,840
Stop it.

857
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,239
Focus on the game.
You can't even get the ball.

858
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,679
I'm in.

859
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,519
Give a signal when you move.

860
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,960
Your team is not really
on top of their game today.

861
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,679
They're not professional

862
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:35,199
and they're unstable.

863
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,039
They can be really good or bad.

864
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,840
My team has a problem too.

865
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:46,159
He thinks he's the best, right?

866
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,320
Nailed it.

867
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,480
Take this!

868
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:06,320
Take this!

869
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,679
QUALIFYING ROUND

870
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,039
What the hell?

871
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:17,280
Can't you guys pull yourself together?

872
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,320
Mon was out because he got a red card.

873
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,280
Our game was a total mess.

874
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,840
Nhong was absent-minded

875
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,679
and made lots of mistakes.

876
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,679
It's you who was absent-minded.

877
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,079
-I made a mistake because my arm hurts.
-Yeah?

878
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,719
-You troll. How dare you blame me?
-It's your fault.

879
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,639
-Bitch.
-It's the real deal.

880
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,159
Not the time to mess around.

881
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:49,880
Man's team
might be laughing their asses off by now.

882
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,880
How about you, leader?
You were so lame too.

883
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:56,760
Not as bad as you, homo.

884
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,920
Bullshit.

885
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,719
Stop talking about homos.

886
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,320
Wit and Pia were so good.
Why don't you say something about that?

887
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,880
Please,

888
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,280
-don't blame other people.
-Coach, you came just in time.

889
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,480
-We're having a big fight.
-It's just begun.

890
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:21,760
You're finding someone to blame,
aren't you?

891
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,440
You all should know who it is.

892
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,360
Today, you're not The Iron Ladies

893
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,719
who won three matches in a row
the other day.

894
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,239
The Iron Ladies are just acting girly

895
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,920
and playing with makeup.

896
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:52,519
You said it makes you play well.

897
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:54,000
-Chai, hold on.
-Coach.

898
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,480
Excuse me, Coach.
Just let me finish.

899
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:01,719
I've had enough of their pettiness,

900
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:04,880
spouting nonsense and being trivial.

901
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,320
I am trying to be a good leader

902
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,599
for all members of our team.

903
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,039
If they had priority for being gay,

904
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,960
-I would quit.
-What? Chai.

905
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,840
They are so feminine.
How can they make it to the semifinals?

906
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,400
You look so disappointed.

907
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:52,960
Mr. Kitti, it's quite interesting
that they're different.

908
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:55,800
Right. I don't think it's a problem.

909
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,079
I think it is a big problem.

910
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm giving you the last warning.

911
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,079
Keep your boys under control.
Don't mess around.

912
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,639
Don't step out of line again,

913
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,960
or I'll drop your team out
of this tournament.

914
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,440
Oh my goodness.

915
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,119
Sis.

916
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:25,800
-What?
-Today's match will be on live TV.

917
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,360
-So?
-Look.

918
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,159
I look pale like a ghost.

919
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:33,320
When people see me on TV,

920
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,880
my rating will be dropped.

921
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,719
Jung, stop making a fuss.

922
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,519
Remember what you promised Chai.

923
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:46,559
Look at Nhong,
he's not making it a big deal.

924
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,280
Come on.

925
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,840
Go.

926
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,599
Don't you forget it.

927
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,440
Bring me some powder right away
when we have a break.

928
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,480
Don't worry.

929
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,239
-You're in a good mood.
-I am.

930
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,440
They haven't put on any makeup today.

931
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,840
When my parents watch us on TV,
they won't know anything about us.

932
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:15,559
Sis.

933
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,159
-What?
-Are you ill?

934
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,719
I'm not. Why do you ask?

935
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,159
-You look pale like a ghost.
-Damn you, Mon.

936
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,519
I'm so nervous today.

937
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,920
-Your lips are so pale.
-We'll be on live TV today.

938
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,559
I went to do my mom's business
in Ang Thong.

939
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:42,559
I saw you on TV so...

940
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,039
I came here.

941
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:47,400
Pia...

942
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
I really miss you.

943
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:56,239
Chat, I will go and find our seats.

944
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:00,679
Hello.

945
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,159
Is that her?

946
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,480
She's cute. Perfect for you.

947
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:15,559
Pia, listen.

948
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,480
-I always loved you.
-Enough, Chat.

949
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,679
Just go, please.

950
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,119
Are these yours?

951
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,400
I found them.

952
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,079
Coach,

953
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,159
I think we should take Pia out

954
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,719
and let April or May in,

955
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,599
or we might lose today.

956
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:45,920
Agreed.

957
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,239
Why there are so many problems today?

958
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,519
Just want to remind you that

959
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,440
District Three used to be
Thailand's team in SEA Games.

960
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,880
Look at them. They're titans.

961
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,199
Most of them
are from Royal Thai Air Force team.

962
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,920
Their teamwork is excellent.
They have passion to win.

963
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,760
Disgusting.

964
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,360
Move. Hit it!

965
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,239
You said they were so lively.
Look, they're boring.

966
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:38,320
They are actually sassy and fun.

967
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,000
Sassy? Let's go home.

968
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,639
If District Three win this set,

969
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,760
The Iron Ladies will be in trouble.

970
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:54,199
My goodness.

971
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:07,360
I think The Iron Ladies team
is trying so hard to score.

972
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,320
But they keep making mistakes.

973
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:13,239
Nhong, how could you miss that ball?

974
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,079
You guys can't concentrate.

975
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:47,519
What do you say?

976
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:53,320
I know. We're playing so badly today.

977
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,480
You guys look horrible.

978
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,960
I can't stand it.

979
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,920
Just put some makeup on.

980
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,239
Don't let our coach down.

981
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:24,960
Are you sure, leader?

982
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,519
We are The Iron Ladies.

983
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,840
I don't know what's going on
with The Iron Ladies.

984
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,400
They're gathering in a group.

985
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,599
Is there anyone having a stroke?

986
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,360
What happened?

987
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:47,599
Why? Why?

988
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,280
Honey. Honey.

989
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,079
The Iron Ladies
have put on their makeup now.

990
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:03,760
It's getting more exciting.

991
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:06,880
This is what I'm talking about,
the highlight of this tournament.

992
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,039
Wow.

993
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,480
The Iron Ladies...

994
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,480
Go!

995
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,400
-It was me.
-I scored those points.

996
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:31,320
It was me.

997
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,280
Hey! Get your shit together.

998
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,760
I want to tell you that
you did really well today.

999
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:51,400
I almost fainted at the beginning.

1000
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,719
You guys,

1001
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,880
I think Chai has something to tell you.

1002
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,079
You guys look great with makeup on.

1003
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:11,519
Way better than without makeup.

1004
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,360
Damn you, Chai.

1005
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

1006
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,800
-Bi, is that you?
-No. Jung's speaking.

1007
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:40,600
I'm her dad.

1008
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,039
Oh, hi.

1009
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,119
Where's Bi?

1010
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,439
Coach Bi is talking with Mon downstairs.

1011
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,520
I need to poop, so...

1012
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,760
It's okay. Too much information.

1013
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,439
Today is her birthday.

1014
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,119
I just want to wish her a happy birthday.

1015
01:08:58,199 --> 01:08:59,279
That's alright.

1016
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,520
Tell her congratulations
for making it to the final tomorrow

1017
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,159
-and tell her that...
-Wait, hold on.

1018
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:07,399
Need to write it down.

1019
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,680
Make a wish, Coach.
Do it.

1020
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,920
Blow out the candles, Coach.

1021
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:28,079
Go ahead.

1022
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:36,359
Thank you.

1023
01:09:36,704 --> 01:09:38,064
Thank you to you all.

1024
01:09:47,944 --> 01:09:51,824
Keep looking at me, if you want to

1025
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:55,159
Some people do it and gossip

1026
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,840
They look from head to toe

1027
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,399
But never see who we really are

1028
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:08,479
You might be unhappy
with what I am

1029
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,840
It doesn't mean that we are evil
We're just...

1030
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,079
Different

1031
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,880
Open your mind
Try being in my shoes

1032
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,319
We couldn't decide our own fate

1033
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,880
Accept us for what we are

1034
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:33,439
And just be open-minded

1035
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,079
Don't hate us
You don't have to love us

1036
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:42,920
It's alright
Just open your mind

1037
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,840
One day you might see it

1038
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,439
That I'm no different from you

1039
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,319
I am what I am...

1040
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,520
Homo freaks make a birthday party
for a lesbian.

1041
01:10:57,039 --> 01:10:58,760
It doesn't mean that...

1042
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,800
-Disgusting.
-We're...

1043
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,760
Just different

1044
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,039
Open your mind
Try being in my shoes

1045
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,319
We couldn't decide our own fate

1046
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,880
Accept us for what we are

1047
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,640
And just be open-minded

1048
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:23,640
Open your mind
Try being in my shoes

1049
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,920
We couldn't decide our own fate

1050
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,720
Accept us for what we are

1051
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,760
And just be...

1052
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:36,319
Open-minded

1053
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,439
Happy birthday to you.

1054
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,960
Happy birthday to you.

1055
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:01,279
-Thank you, all of you.
-Coach...

1056
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,960
All of us

1057
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:08,039
-want you to be happy.
-Right.

1058
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,680
Thanks.

1059
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,680
Even though
we haven't known you for long,

1060
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,840
you treat us with love and care
like our mothers do.

1061
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,359
We...

1062
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,800
are like the outcasts.

1063
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
We are not bright,

1064
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,239
strong,

1065
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,880
or confident like the way we act.

1066
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,800
But we're so lucky to have you
as our mom.

1067
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,920
No, I'm not that old.

1068
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:48,680
-You're our Coach Mama.
-Right.

1069
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,199
Oh!

1070
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:53,439
Bitch.

1071
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,279
You've ruined my mood.

1072
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,079
I have something for you, Coach Bi.

1073
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:01,000
Here's a note from your father to you.

1074
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:03,800
I wrote it down word for word.
Let me read it to you.

1075
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:08,800
"Bi, be happy
and keep in mind that

1076
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,840
winning over oneself
is the true victory."

1077
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:15,079
Here.

1078
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:17,960
Listen up.

1079
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:22,319
That show might be not perfect,

1080
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,960
but you guys did it quite well.

1081
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,000
Can you do something like this
for tomorrow's game?

1082
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,520
Yes.

1083
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,800
I used to think that
winning was everything.

1084
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:39,159
Today, I know that my happiness

1085
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,039
is not seeing you as the winners
with gold medals.

1086
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,079
I want you guys to be a great team,

1087
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:48,680
like in my father's note.

1088
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:51,800
Winning over oneself
is the true victory.

1089
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:54,800
Bless you.

1090
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,079
Making fun of me?

1091
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,119
My humps

1092
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,760
Do you like that, boys?

1093
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,960
Hey! We should get going now.

1094
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,680
Pia...

1095
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,640
-Chat, what are you doing here?
-Where?

1096
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:17,319
How have you been?

1097
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:19,279
You should know that.

1098
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:22,399
Where's Lookkade?
Is she not with you?

1099
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,680
She's gone.

1100
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:26,359
You should leave too.

1101
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:34,319
Why do we three have to be in pain?

1102
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:37,800
-Just let me go.
-Pia...

1103
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,399
You're hurt
and I'm hurt too.

1104
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,720
I need you.

1105
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:47,960
Where are you going?

1106
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,000
Let's have some fun.

1107
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,439
Is this faggot that good

1108
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,119
that you can't live without her?

1109
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:02,920
It's none of your business.

1110
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,800
Oh.

1111
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:08,760
-Let me have her then.
-Hey!

1112
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:10,119
Hey.

1113
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,359
She...

1114
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,079
used to do a stunt show.

1115
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:27,680
Jackass.

1116
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:39,760
What the hell?

1117
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,039
My nails.

1118
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,800
Hey!

1119
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,560
Wanna die, faggot?

1120
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:04,960
-I'm gonna hit you.
-Quiet.

1121
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,479
I said quiet!

1122
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,079
Enough with the fighting, okay?

1123
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,680
Officer,

1124
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,880
please let me go.
I didn't do anything.

1125
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:20,720
All my nails are messed up.

1126
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:24,399
Who are these people?

1127
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,760
Teletubbies, perhaps?

1128
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:30,319
-Are you alright?
-Your face is damaged.

1129
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,479
You're being mean to me again.

1130
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,640
Pia...

1131
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:39,399
Thank you for taking care of me.

1132
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,479
I'll always take care of you,

1133
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,199
but we need to be friends.

1134
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,760
That's the best for us.

1135
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:07,359
Ouch. Easy.

1136
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,079
Sorry.

1137
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,800
Thank you.

1138
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,600
What were you thinking,

1139
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,159
to save me from him?

1140
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:25,399
I don't want to lose
one of our best players.

1141
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,760
Coach Bi told me that

1142
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,119
we have something in common.

1143
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,600
We have passion.

1144
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
We're eager to win.

1145
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,760
Sometimes,
we overlook what really matters.

1146
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,399
Yeah.

1147
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:47,239
I always play as if it's the last game,

1148
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:49,560
and I need to win,

1149
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:53,119
so people can't look down on me.

1150
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,520
I know that will never happen.

1151
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,840
Gold medals or silver medals

1152
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,159
don't really matter.

1153
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:07,399
I'll just do my best.

1154
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,680
I'd prefer a gold medal, you know.

1155
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,119
-Jung!
-Oh, dear.

1156
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,000
Are you okay?

1157
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,399
Bitch, you left me behind.

1158
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,800
I need a favor.
They're my friends.

1159
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:29,520
-Please.
-Are you sure, sir?

1160
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,680
Coach, Wit's father is here.

1161
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:44,680
He's going to bring Wit back.

1162
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,640
-He and Wit are having a big fight.
-Hurry.

1163
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,960
Sir, I'm begging you.

1164
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:09,760
Wit, go home.

1165
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,920
Wit, I said go home.
Get in the car now.

1166
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,039
You can take it,
caps or fans with Jung's face.

1167
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,119
Coach Chatri,
how about this one?

1168
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,960
Just leave me alone.

1169
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,119
It's alright. He might prefer a cap.

1170
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:09,319
It can protect you from the sun,
protect your bald head.

1171
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:10,640
One hundred and thirty...

1172
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,279
The fans of The Iron Ladies team

1173
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,760
keep coming into the stadium.

1174
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:22,399
They're dressed up and look like

1175
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,680
-they're going to a costume party.
-Well,

1176
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:26,399
they're not holding back.

1177
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,640
Today, we have the governor

1178
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,359
who has come here to watch the game,

1179
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:32,920
and he will present medals for the winner.

1180
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,840
That's right.

1181
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,199
Your team had a fight last night.

1182
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,319
It's a disgrace to this tournament.

1183
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,279
We have to punish them.

1184
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,800
Excuse me,

1185
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:48,680
the officer didn't even
make a report on them.

1186
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,560
So, legally,

1187
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,520
nothing happened last night.

1188
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,239
But they did have a fight.

1189
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,600
You are just trying to kick us out
of this tournament

1190
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,520
because you hate queers.

1191
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:02,520
I hate lesbians too.

1192
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,760
Not just lesbians and queers,

1193
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:08,640
you can't stand it

1194
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,520
when you see a female governor
or a female astronaut.

1195
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:16,439
You think patriarchy rules the world.

1196
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,560
-You and your dick head.
-Hey, you...

1197
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:22,159
You think women should be only

1198
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:25,239
in the kitchen or in bed.

1199
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,399
Those who are different from you,

1200
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:30,720
or do things that you don't like,

1201
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,840
are worthless human beings to you.

1202
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:37,760
I think everyone in my team

1203
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,159
is more worthy than a jerk like you.

1204
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:44,840
-They never discriminate against people.
-Are you insulting me?

1205
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:23,000
I thought your attitude was bad,

1206
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,399
but your manners are much worse.

1207
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,199
I want The Iron Ladies team

1208
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,479
out of today's game immediately.

1209
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,199
Mr. Kitti, is it too late to do that?

1210
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,039
-We can't do that. People might go crazy.
-I don't give a shit.

1211
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:40,840
-Rules are rules.
-Rules are for the game.

1212
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,159
-Not for you.
-I don't care.

1213
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:48,199
I want the fucking Iron Ladies team
out of this game now.

1214
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:04,479
The Iron Ladies

1215
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:31,720
Everyone, we have some breaking news.

1216
01:23:32,119 --> 01:23:35,600
They might disqualify
The Iron Ladies team.

1217
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:40,560
It's not official,
but if it really happens,

1218
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:42,239
it's going to be chaos.

1219
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:44,600
We're going to be in big trouble for sure.

1220
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,600
The Iron Ladies! The Iron Ladies!
The Iron Ladies! The Iron Ladies!

1221
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,319
I'm not quite sure that

1222
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:52,880
my players are horrible.
It's you.

1223
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,199
Is he dead?

1224
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,880
Too bad he's not.
What are we going to do now?

1225
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,880
Well, he fell, so...

1226
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,880
let the game begin.

1227
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:12,159
Thank you.

1228
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,720
Attention, please.

1229
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:26,920
Attention, please.

1230
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,479
The volleyball championship match

1231
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:35,920
will begin in five minutes.

1232
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:00,079
Everyone,

1233
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:04,720
ever since I've known you all,

1234
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,920
I've been so tired.

1235
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,520
You guys might feel the same,

1236
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,880
but we probably won't have
a big chance like this ever again.

1237
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,199
So...

1238
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,720
give it your all.

1239
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,119
Yes, Coach.

1240
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,399
Wit is also giving us moral support.

1241
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,399
Paknampo Games'
volleyball final match

1242
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,600
has started with the first set.

1243
01:25:34,119 --> 01:25:36,760
District Seven beat District Five
with the scores 15 to 8.

1244
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:40,479
District Seven team
attacked District Five team

1245
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,720
and many of its players are injured.
That's why they won the first set.

1246
01:25:45,399 --> 01:25:50,159
Sports News 97.25 radio
will keep you updated on the hour.

1247
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,439
Next is the weather forecast.

1248
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,920
Get that troll.

1249
01:25:55,479 --> 01:25:56,560
He's badly injured.

1250
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,720
That's it, Coach.

1251
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:01,640
On your positions. Get ready.

1252
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,560
Hurry up, people.

1253
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,359
Welcome to...

1254
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,359
Paknampo Games.

1255
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,199
Here we go.

1256
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:16,479
They hit it so hard. No mercy.

1257
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:19,720
You can see they keep hitting it hard.

1258
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:24,359
Bam! Boom!
That's the real deal.

1259
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Don't even blink, people.

1260
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:32,159
People, today we...

1261
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,920
Why is that, Otto?

1262
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,000
District Seven has already won

1263
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:41,279
-two sets.
-Maybe they're not that good, chief.

1264
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:49,000
Man attacks us really hard, Coach.

1265
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:52,560
We should be careful.

1266
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,640
We don't have any substitute players left.

1267
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:58,479
I will get that faggot with boobs.
She's the weakest one.

1268
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:02,199
I'll get it.

1269
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:07,840
In the third set, District Five team
still makes mistakes.

1270
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:10,079
Please make some noise
for District Five team.

1271
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,199
Give a big round of applause to Pia,
she is really something.

1272
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,720
I think she's got something
really interesting.

1273
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,399
Well, her body is...

1274
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,199
What's wrong with you, pervert?

1275
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,000
Give her some respect, will you?

1276
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:43,079
-Are you alright?
-Are you okay?

1277
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:47,600
Her head is almost cracked.
Sis, do you need some rest?

1278
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,079
-Pia
-Oh.

1279
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,079
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

1280
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,920
I'll be her substitute.

1281
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,199
-He's so hot. Wit!
-Wit!

1282
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,560
Wit!

1283
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,840
DISTRICT SEVEN 12 POINTS
DISTRICT FIVE 12 POINTS

1284
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:46,359
WE LOVE THE IRON LADIES

1285
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:50,239
Wit!

1286
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:17,760
It's a miracle.
Now they are even.

1287
01:29:25,239 --> 01:29:26,840
Fuck you.
How could you miss that?

1288
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,800
You have to focus. I'm so tired.

1289
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,760
If those faggots win,
you guys will be so embarrassed.

1290
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,520
That was close. Really close.

1291
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,800
You can't really tell
who's gonna win this game.

1292
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:42,039
Both teams really need the next set.

1293
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:43,840
If District Seven get it,
they win.

1294
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,920
For District Five,
one more chance for them.

1295
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:49,279
We'll see.

1296
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,479
Look, Big Sis Mi and the rest are here.

1297
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,840
The Iron Ladies! The Iron Ladies!
The Iron Ladies! The Iron Ladies!

1298
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:04,800
The Iron Ladies!

1299
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,079
They are the bomb.

1300
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,720
-Coach.
-We're ready.

1301
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:13,079
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1302
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
Cat Woman's killing serve.

1303
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,760
I see that right now,
both teams are using their best players.

1304
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,399
The Iron Ladies won the fourth set.

1305
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,840
Now both teams have won two sets each.

1306
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,439
He hit hard and scored.

1307
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,000
Everyone, right now,

1308
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:43,439
the first point of the fifth set
goes to District Seven.

1309
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,399
If they hit the ball across the court,
Nhong, you move back quickly.

1310
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,279
You guys need to be quick,
Mon and Chai.

1311
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:58,640
Block the ball from Man together.

1312
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:13,279
Chai!

1313
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,319
Now District Five has got four points.
They're even.

1314
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,600
Hey.

1315
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:34,479
Continue.

1316
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,079
What's wrong with him?
Has he passed out?

1317
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,880
-Jung, get up. Come on.
-What should we do?

1318
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:28,439
-Get up, Jung. Come on.
-Get up. Get up.

1319
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,520
-Jung!
-Jung!

1320
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,199
Jung! Jung! Jung!

1321
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:27,359
One more point and it'll be over.

1322
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,920
I might have a heart attack.

1323
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,359
District Seven needs this rally point.

1324
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,319
Come on. Let's cheer them.

1325
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:57,880
Come on!

1326
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,680
Yes!

1327
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,039
We did it.

1328
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,800
-We won. We won.
-My boy won.

1329
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,039
-Our Jung.
-Our Jung won.

1330
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:32,920
The result of men's volleyball
final match,

1331
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:37,159
District Five, Lampang,
beat District Seven, Suphanburi.

1332
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,840
Three sets to two.

1333
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:41,560
The medal ceremony

1334
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,359
will commence soon.

1335
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,840
We won!

1336
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,079
Great. Absolutely great.

1337
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:55,319
Queers rule the game indeed.

1338
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:59,880
This year should be
the year of all queers.

1339
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,960
Just accept us for what we are.
That's all we need from you.

1340
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,560
Wow, your waist.

1341
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:39,359
One, two, three.

1342
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,720
