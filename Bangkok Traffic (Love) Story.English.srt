1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,439
-Are they back?
-Yes.

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,479
Back and really drunk.

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,479
Who? The bride or the groom?

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,399
The maid of honor.

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,640
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,359
-We are almost there.
-Keep going.

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,719
Be careful.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,159
What the hell happened to her?

9
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,560
Wine.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
-How many?
-Four.

11
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,759
-Glasses?
-Bottles!

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,039
Let’s get her inside.
This is so embarrassing.

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,920
Okay.

14
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,520
-Li, get up.
-Li.

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,079
-My carpet!
-Oh, my God.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,519
-Is she all right?
-I guess so.

17
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,040
I'm okay.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,120
Let’s party on.

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,280
Hey, you.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
Take a picture of us.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,359
Be creative.
I want to look good. Hurry up.

22
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,799
Right here is good.

23
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,200
-Ped.
-Yes?

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
-Come on.
-Okay.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,840
Li, let’s go home.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,079
We want to celebrate Valentine’s day
with our husbands too.

27
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,159
You can celebrate Valentine’s day anytime.

28
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,319
Our friend just got married.
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,239
You never had a boyfriend.
You don't understand how we feel.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,480
It’s because I'm always with you girls.
That's why I have nobody.

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,439
Please look towards the camera.

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,439
Let's do a sexy pose.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,239
All right. One, two, three.

35
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,680
You guys go home. I'll take care of Li.

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,400
-Okay. Take care.
-Bye.

37
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,039
Ped, what do you want?

38
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,479
Let’s mix them together, then.

39
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,319
Come on. Sit down.

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
Cheers.

41
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,280
-Ped.
-Yes?

42
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,319
Do you remember...

43
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,199
how we practically grew up together?

44
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,599
We always had the same group of friends.

45
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,319
We went to the same school.

46
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,199
We graduated together
and work at the same company.

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
So, if you have a husband,

48
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,639
we should also have--

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Li.

50
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,719
Li.

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Li.

52
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,280
I am so happy for you, Ped.

53
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,199
Thanks.

54
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,520
I better go now.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
I shouldn’t bother you any longer.

56
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,240
You're going home?

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,639
Are you all right? Let me drive you.

58
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,879
I’m okay. Don’t worry.
Just stay where you are.

59
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,319
What should we do?

60
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,240
On the sofa?

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,959
That should be interesting.

62
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,759
Good luck

63
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,439
You will find all the good things

64
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,240
That you have dreamed of

65
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:47,040
I will never forget today 
even until the day I die

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,120
And I will see you again, my friend

67
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,680
Friends never leave each other

68
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,199
No matter how far our dreams take us

69
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,759
Whenever you fall,
friends will be there for you

70
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,040
No one can understand

71
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,639
No one to love or give
like true friends can

72
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,319
Miss.

73
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
Miss!

74
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,439
Wow.

75
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,959
He’s so heavenly handsome.

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
Miss.

77
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,759
You are safe now.

78
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,519
You’re as drunk as a skunk.

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
Are you okay?

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,879
I'm usually in better shape than this.

81
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,439
Let me have a look.

82
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,959
Let me check under the hood.

83
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,360
I mean your car’s hood, not yours.

84
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,920
Here’s your wing mirror.

85
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,480
You can keep it. Consider it a gift.

86
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,399
Thank you for helping me.

87
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,199
Bye.

88
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

89
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,600
I called over ten times!
I almost called the police!

90
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,240
My cell battery died.

91
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,480
Were you drinking and driving?

92
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,200
I slept to sober up before driving here.

93
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,240
If you weren’t drunk,
why is your car all wrecked?

94
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,240
You know Grandma was so worried
that she couldn’t sleep?

95
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,919
Gram!

96
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,879
What did Grandma say?

97
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,360
She said you hardly have any boobs,
yet you still dress provocatively.

98
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,320
Shame on you.

99
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,600
Give me your car key.

100
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,679
Are you getting my car fixed for me?

101
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,320
Then, can I borrow your car?

102
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,879
Dad, my office is very far away.

103
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,639
How am I going to get to work?

104
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,399
Dad.

105
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,600
NICO SOLAR CELL THAILAND

106
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,120
Miss.

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,759
We’re here.

108
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
That sure woke me up.

109
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,919
Ms. Jongjit, why are you sitting here?

110
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,159
Aren’t you supposed to be meeting
with a client?

111
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,759
Oh, my God. I forgot.

112
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,080
He has been standing in the sun waiting
for the solar cells.

113
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,080
His skin turned so dark
that his wife can’t remember him anymore.

114
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,399
Well, he should've waited in the shade.

115
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,120
You're still talking?

116
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,360
Please be careful of my knees!

117
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,600
How lucky. At least this pair
only costs 199 Baht.

118
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,879
THE CUPID'S TEARS

119
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,159
Araya, since when did you come back?

120
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,120
How come nobody told me?

121
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,639
It’s so exhausting not having a car.

122
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,600
I had to transfer
to five different buses to get home.

123
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,080
Araya, why didn’t you tell me
so I can pick you up?

124
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,440
I didn’t want to bother you, Mr. Chawee.

125
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,320
Mom, Dad's still mad at me, right?

126
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,240
Of course, I am!

127
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,440
Because what you’ve done is so bad
that I can’t forgive you.

128
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Mom, what's wrong with her?

129
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,159
Please let me explain.

130
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,279
After that, you can hate me all you want.

131
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,039
Well, the leading actor
and actress used to be in love

132
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,320
when they were studying in England.

133
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,799
Then, the lead actor came back
to Thailand without telling her,

134
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,440
so she thought he dumped her.

135
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,159
But he actually came back
because his dad died.

136
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,639
He came to get his inheritance.

137
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,279
Stop rambling. It’s so annoying!

138
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,200
Deedee! She is your big sister!

139
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Hello, Ped. Are you sleeping?

140
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,639
Not yet.

141
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
What about your husband?

142
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,919
Is he sleeping?

143
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,039
If he hears us talking,
will it disturb him?

144
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,759
It's fine. Tor is not sleeping either.

145
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,559
I see. And where is he now?

146
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,440
He is upstairs.

147
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,720
-And where are you?
-I am downstairs.

148
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,879
But I think I'll go up soon.

149
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,399
Ped!

150
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,519
-Why are you moaning?
-Are you nuts?

151
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,399
I am talking to you. How can I be moaning?

152
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,840
Ped, I will call you right back.

153
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,840
My God!

154
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,559
Holy shit!

155
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,399
Where are your parents?

156
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
I don’t want to wait anymore.

157
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,559
Let’s just call the cops to settle this.

158
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
Please stay calm.

159
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,879
I already called Uncle.

160
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,120
He left his office a while ago.

161
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,120
That must be him.

162
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey. What are you doing here?

163
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Juen called me to come here.

164
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,119
Are you his relative?

165
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Juen is the bellboy
at the guest house I'm renting.

166
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,000
I thought you were
his father’s older brother.

167
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,920
No, my name is Loong. It means "Uncle".

168
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
What kind of person
whose name means "Uncle"?

169
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,680
Have you been drinking again?

170
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Is your nephew a lizard or something?

171
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,960
He snuck upstairs and...

172
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,599
did it on the roof.

173
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,720
And he even brought beer too.

174
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,880
I really hate drunkards.

175
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,680
-No, sir. That's not mine.
-Don’t you dare argue with me!

176
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,839
Dad, that’s enough.
He looks really ashamed of himself.

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,039
How could you two do it?

178
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,319
We just did it in
missionary position, ma’am.

179
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,799
Hey! Don’t talk dirty in my house.

180
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,759
You want to settle this
at the police station?

181
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,039
Calm down, dad.
Don’t make a big deal out of this.

182
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,359
Your blood pressure will go up.

183
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,480
Mei Li, please sort this out.

184
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,039
So, did the two of you...

185
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,160
do it?

186
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,119
Well, the reason you called me here

187
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,799
is because you saw these two doing it,
isn't that right?

188
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,839
Well, I saw...

189
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,799
Juen lying on top of Fah
and he looked like...

190
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
he was moving up and down.

191
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,839
So, did you guys do it?

192
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,559
Did we really do it?

193
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
Of course, we did, you idiot.

194
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,319
Okay. Then, this Songkran festival,

195
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,079
Juen will go back home
to talk to his parents about the wedding

196
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,839
and he will come back to marry Fah.

197
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Are you okay with this?

198
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,640
That’s fine.

199
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,319
Why don’t you turn on the lights?

200
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,640
My dad likes to save electricity.

201
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,079
EMMANUELLE

202
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,039
Juen. These are yours. Pick them up.

203
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,680
Seeing this with my own eyes,

204
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,680
makes me even more impressed
with how advanced these solar cells are.

205
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,720
Go ahead and confirm that I will order
these cells to install at my new resort.

206
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,880
I’m willing to support clean energy
like this a hundred percent.

207
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,519
We have been torturing our Earth
way too much.

208
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,240
This is a solar bra,

209
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,720
or a bra for collecting solar energy.

210
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,400
Last time you missed your appointment.

211
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,200
And yesterday you fell asleep at the site.

212
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,960
What is this for, sir?

213
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,079
This is for charging a mobile phone.

214
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,640
It also works with an iPod.

215
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,079
If you keep acting like this--

216
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,960
And what is the bag of water for?

217
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,599
Oh, this?

218
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,799
This is for drinking water.

219
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,039
Like this.

220
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,200
If you keep acting like this,

221
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,039
I will transfer you
to solar bra sales department!

222
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,440
Is that what you want?

223
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,559
It's a good thing that I already quit.

224
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,079
If I had to go selling that stupid bra,

225
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,880
I'd definitely want to kill myself.

226
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,480
I know. If I had to sell that,
I would want to quit too.

227
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,200
It's so ridiculous, right?

228
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,920
Hey.

229
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,480
Since I am leaving,
who are you going to have lunch with?

230
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,720
I’ll just eat by myself.

231
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,480
It's better this way
because I don’t have to wait for anyone.

232
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,240
But if there’s anything you need,
you can call me anytime, okay?

233
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,039
Come on, Ped. Don’t be so dramatic.

234
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,480
You're leaving to be with your hubby.

235
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,480
It’s not like you’re leaving for good.

236
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,839
I am sorry.

237
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,599
Hey, Ped!

238
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,039
You want to go shopping
at the Central midnight sale tonight?

239
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,920
I really want to go but...

240
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,880
Tor and I made an appointment
to take my dog to the breeder.

241
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,720
We have to because the stud

242
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,119
is flying back abroad tonight. So...

243
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,359
this is her last chance
to make babies, you know.

244
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,759
You understand, right? You're not mad?

245
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,200
My God. All the women
around me are all getting married?

246
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,240
What about me?

247
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,000
TANG HENG GARAGE

248
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,680
All eyes are watching

249
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,279
the hottest couple from
the hottest soap opera, The Cupid's Tears.

250
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,480
Kob, Kavita Kanyanon and Stephen Jamrus.

251
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,160
People say there might be something more
between them off-screen.

252
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,079
Since there has been gossip about this,

253
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,599
-both Kob and Stephen
-Mom.

254
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,960
have denied their romance,
insisting that they are just friends.

255
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
How did you and Dad fall in love?

256
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,119
It was arranged by our parents.

257
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
No one ever showed interest in you?

258
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,799
No.

259
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,119
I hit on them first.

260
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
But they didn’t like me.

261
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,960
But,

262
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,079
didn’t you say
that hitting on men first isn’t proper?

263
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,119
Really?

264
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
Did I say that?

265
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,160
This guy is the hottest
I don’t think my eyes are lying

266
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,720
Joe Nuvo!

267
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,799
Mei Li!

268
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,960
If your dad ever finds out
you're this crazy about men,

269
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,960
I guarantee you all hell will break loose!

270
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,319
Mom, you once said...

271
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,200
never flirt with a man first. Remember?

272
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,640
I didn't say that.

273
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,920
You thought I meant that?

274
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Yes.

275
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,079
How long have you been thinking that?

276
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,279
Seventeen years.

277
00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:00,079
I want my 17 years back!

278
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
SAPHAN TAKSIN STATION

279
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,480
Wait. Will he think that I’m stalking him?

280
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,920
Next station, Siam.

281
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,880
Passengers can change to Sukhumvit line
at this station.

282
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,880
Please mind the gap between train
and platform. Thank you.

283
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,839
Shit. He already saw me for sure.
What should I do?

284
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,960
Should I put on more makeup
so he won’t recognize me?

285
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,640
Hey, there.

286
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,480
You're Li, right?

287
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,720
I almost didn’t recognize you.

288
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,160
Where are you going?

289
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,680
Central mall.

290
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,480
What about you?

291
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,920
I’m going to work.

292
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,079
My office is here in the BTS building.

293
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Just a second.

294
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,519
I can’t pick it up.

295
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,319
Let me help.

296
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,880
I got it!

297
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,640
I am sorry.

298
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
It's okay.

299
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,720
It was an accident.

300
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,440
-I saw it.
-You never listen. Damn it!

301
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,839
Saw what? Who told you?

302
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,160
Can you try to make more sense?

303
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,680
-Why do you have to be so stupid?
-How am I stupid?

304
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
What the hell?

305
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,079
What’s up?

306
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Nothing.

307
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,839
Where are all the nice guys?
Did they all die?

308
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,240
What’s wrong, Plern?

309
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I caught him with another girl.

310
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,359
And who is that?

311
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
That's Suthep.

312
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
We met yesterday.
He came to order stickers at my shop.

313
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:32,039
So, I gave him a sticker
with my number on it as well.

314
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,519
He called me in a heartbeat.

315
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,160
And what’s wrong with him?

316
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,039
His jeans are a bit too tight.
So it's kind of hard for him to get down.

317
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,119
Anyway,

318
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,039
is it that simple?
Just giving out your phone number?

319
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,759
It’s just a phone number.

320
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,960
It’s not like you're taking
an entrance examination.

321
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,559
See you later.

322
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,960
Let’s go.

323
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,720
Let’s go.

324
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,000
Is this the price or the product number?

325
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,119
-Hey.
-Hey.

326
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,039
Li, did you just get off work?

327
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,200
Yes, I did.

328
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,440
I bought this for you.

329
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,039
No, it’s okay. I can’t accept that.

330
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,559
But if you insist,

331
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,319
I will take it.

332
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,119
I have to go now.

333
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,079
Great advice, Plern!

334
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,200
I should have done this since I was 18!

335
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,559
INCOMING CALL
MOM

336
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,440
Hello?

337
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,799
We're eating out tonight?

338
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,839
Grandma won the lottery?

339
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,799
Mom.

340
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,200
You're here, Mei Li? Come and sit.

341
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,880
Come on. You don’t remember him?

342
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,200
You two used to play tag
when you were little.

343
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,640
You probably can’t remember.
Chai has changed a lot.

344
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,880
Everyone says he looks like
that Korean singer.

345
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,440
Mom, come on.

346
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,880
-Come on.
-It's Rain.

347
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,800
-Yes, very much.
-We don’t look that similar, Mom.

348
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,039
But a lot of people do tease me about it.

349
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,480
You do look like him. Who says you don't?

350
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,719
Chai, show everyone your dance move.

351
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
No, Mom.

352
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,559
-Come on. Just a little bit.
-There are lots of people here.

353
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,079
-Come on. Show us a little.
-Are you going to dance?

354
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,119
If he is going to try that hard,

355
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,000
he might as well
change his name to Rain, too.

356
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,960
Mom, I'm leaving now.

357
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,599
Don’t leave yet.

358
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Stay and talk to him first.

359
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,719
So you guys can get to know
each other better.

360
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,840
Mom, what did her grandma say?

361
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,880
She said just take Li to be your wife.

362
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,840
She's 30 and still a virgin.

363
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,480
It’s hard to find someone like her
these days.

364
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,519
Your figure is not too bad
but your boobs are a bit small.

365
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,559
You don’t look very fertile.

366
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,079
But that’s okay.
Chai has strong sperm like me.

367
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,079
A little bit of banging would do it.

368
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,320
You'll make plenty of babies in no time.

369
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,280
Small boobs aren’t a problem.
You got a big butt?

370
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,800
I am a person, not a puppy.

371
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,599
There’s no need
for this kind of arrangement.

372
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,880
Hey, I’m buying a tour package
to China during the Songkran holiday.

373
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,000
-All right.
-Good idea.

374
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,440
Chai, let’s go together, okay?
Come and take a trip with my family.

375
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,960
I’m not going.
I want to stay home this year.

376
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,400
Come on, Li. Don’t be shy.

377
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm not shy. I don’t want to go.

378
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,280
I’m not going to China!

379
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:04,960
P JEAB

380
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,199
You're not going to bed yet, Li?

381
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,960
I’m waiting for a phone call.

382
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,599
Watching TV in the dark
will ruin your eyesight.

383
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,440
Wait. Did I give him the house number?

384
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,639
Here you go. 120 Baht, please.

385
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,159
Thank you.

386
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,119
Hey, Li.

387
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,840
It didn’t work, Plern.

388
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,719
Men these days play hard to get like this.

389
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,360
You should give up on him.

390
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,199
Wait a minute.
Maybe he is not interested in women?

391
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,079
You’ve flirted so hard
and he still doesn’t care.

392
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,920
Hey. Don’t talk about him like that.
He’s a good man.

393
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,800
Good personality or good-looking?

394
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,960
Both.

395
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,400
He's so good that I can hardly believe
I found him.

396
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,119
I’m so lucky.

397
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,920
Really? How come you got so lucky?

398
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,960
Who knows?

399
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,360
Then, just ask him
whether he has a girlfriend or not.

400
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,280
Plern.

401
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,480
If I was that brave,

402
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,840
why would I be sitting here with you?

403
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,679
Okay. If you aren’t brave enough,
I can be your spy.

404
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,480
But you have to show me who he is first.
I got my ways.

405
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,400
Are you crazy? How can I do that?

406
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,079
TWENTY VCD DVD

407
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,519
Which one?

408
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,400
I don’t see him.
He probably hasn’t arrived.

409
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,679
Will he be here for sure?

410
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,599
Of course! He’s s a regular customer
of this shop.

411
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,360
How do you know this is the branch
he often goes to?

412
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,760
There are many branches?

413
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,599
Excuse me, can I grab a movie?

414
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Hey, Li. You also rent DVDs here?

415
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,360
Renting? Yes.

416
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,000
This guy, right?

417
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,920
This is my neighbor.

418
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,519
Plern, this is Loong.

419
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,079
Hi.

420
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,320
Let’s go check out these DVDs.
Loong has to get to work.

421
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
We have to go now.

422
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,480
What do you do?
Why do you have to work late?

423
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,079
I’m an engineer.

424
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,320
Wow. An engineer.
So you must be good at mathematics.

425
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,199
When you’re free, can you help me
with my homework?

426
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,400
Plern, I majored in accounting.
I can teach you.

427
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,000
Will you excuse us? Let's go.

428
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,960
Don't your wife and kids mind
that you have to work late?

429
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,719
I don’t have a girlfriend.

430
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,960
I don't believe you.
When men see cute girls,

431
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,719
they always say that.

432
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,960
I still say that when I meet an ugly girl.

433
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,760
Who are you talking about?

434
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
Will your skinny-legged boyfriend
pick you up today?

435
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,360
That’s right.
I wonder why he isn't here yet.

436
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,119
Wait. Where’s my phone?

437
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,880
Hey.

438
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,280
Where’s my phone?

439
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,639
Excuse me, can I borrow your cell phone?

440
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,960
I'll use it to call my phone.

441
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,480
Thank you.

442
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,800
It’s here. I thought I lost it.

443
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,159
Jesus. It’s as big as a funeral wreath.
How could she not find it?

444
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,239
Excuse me, I have to go to work now.

445
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay.

446
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,719
Li, how do you spell "Loong"?

447
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,320
I want to save it on my phone.

448
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,440
B-i-t-c-h.

449
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,119
There’s no way you can beat me.

450
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,280
Araya, please don’t do this.

451
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,760
Araya, please don’t do this. Please stop.

452
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,280
Please help me. Chawee, please help me.

453
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,440
Chawee, please help me.

454
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,159
Araya, how can you be so cruel?

455
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,280
You're such a heartless person.

456
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,159
I am really disappointed in you.

457
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,119
She is such a snake.

458
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,480
Grandma said if that girl ever walks
past our house,

459
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,079
just tell her and she will throw
a spark plug at her!

460
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,800
She is such a bitch.

461
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,440
She would even snatch her sister’s
boyfriend.

462
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,880
And the leading lady just lets her do it.
Slap the bitch!

463
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,119
You are so evil.
That’s why no one ever loves you.

464
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,559
You’re not the only one that has hands.

465
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,760
Good. So the neighbors will know
that we're fighting over the same man.

466
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,679
Good. Learn to fight back.

467
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,840
Don't let anyone take what is yours.

468
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,039
Araya Wiwattananon will not be your
victim anymore.

469
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,039
TWENTY VCD DVD

470
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,159
Plern.

471
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,440
Hey, Li.

472
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,760
-What are you doing here?
-This is my side job.

473
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,599
Why do you choose this branch?

474
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
Loong!

475
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,119
Li...

476
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,599
What are you doing?

477
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:21,639
I...

478
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,480
I lost my phone.
I don’t know where I dropped it.

479
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:26,920
Can I borrow yours?

480
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,920
Sure. Go ahead.

481
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,400
But Loong’s number is in this phone.

482
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,480
I MISS YOU SO MUCH.
WE HAVE NOT TALKED FOR A WHILE.

483
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,079
COME SEE ME AT THE VDO SHOP?
LOVE YOU. XOXO.

484
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,360
SENDING MESSAGE.

485
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,719
MESSAGE SENT.

486
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:51,960
Plern, I need to use the restroom.

487
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:52,960
Okay.

488
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,360
Please come in.

489
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,440
Hey, babe. Why didn't you tell me
you're working today?

490
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,800
Didn’t you promise me
you would tell me everything?

491
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,760
Are you done with work yet, Plern?

492
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,159
Today, I drove a Z3 to pick you up.

493
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,519
Wow.

494
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,800
Your car is so dope!

495
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,440
Can I go with you too?

496
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:41,760
Who the hell are you?
It's a two-seater car.

497
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,440
Hey, babe. How are you doing?

498
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,519
How did you all get here?

499
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,880
Well, didn't you send me a message?

500
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:06,440
Hey, what’s your problem?

501
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,159
Shut up, boy!

502
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,400
What’s going on here, Plern?
Let’s discuss this outside.

503
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,199
What the hell do you have to discuss
with my lady?

504
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,440
Hey, what's up?

505
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,719
Beat it! One at a time, all right?

506
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,119
This is my girlfriend. Don’t mess with me.

507
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,360
You skinny lizard pants!

508
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,960
You can call me whatever you want

509
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,199
but don’t you dare insult my jeans.

510
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,880
I'll smash your mouth with this!

511
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,199
Damn it, man. Come on!

512
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,519
Stop, Nguan!

513
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,280
-Nguan.
-Hip hop my ass!

514
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,360
-Nguan. That's enough. Stop!
-Hip hop my ass!

515
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,000
-Yes, kick him!
-Nguan!

516
00:46:59,039 --> 00:46:59,880
You too, huh?

517
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,199
Suthep!

518
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:04,800
Loong, please help me!

519
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,079
You want some too?

520
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,480
Wichai, do you still have the file

521
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,599
that we need for tonight?

522
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,679
I have a problem with my laptop.

523
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:33,280
Well...

524
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:34,760
it has a virus.

525
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:36,360
And all the data is gone.

526
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,159
Yes.

527
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:41,760
Yes.

528
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,079
Shall I get it fixed for you?

529
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,639
It’s okay. I will take care of it myself.

530
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,800
It’s already late.
Where are you going to get it fixed?

531
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,280
Let me handle this.

532
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,360
My friend’s husband is a computer expert.

533
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,320
You'd better go to work.
I will bring it to your office.

534
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,960
-No, that’s okay.
-Don’t worry.

535
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:09,239
I will get it fixed.
Seriously, I want to do this.

536
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,960
-It’s okay. I can do it myself.
-No, I’ll have it fixed for you.

537
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,880
Great! Can it get any worse?

538
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,440
Li, what’s up?

539
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,559
Why don’t you put some clothes on
before you open the door?

540
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,880
I don’t see anything wrong with it.
You’re crazy. Come in.

541
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:47,760
Hi.

542
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,800
Oh, crap!

543
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,280
What are you guys doing?

544
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,760
You can fix anything, right?

545
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,960
Yes, if it's computer related.

546
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,400
Hey, Li. This isn’t your laptop, right?

547
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,760
It’s my client’s.

548
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,719
Really?

549
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,840
Oh my.

550
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,880
No one is picking up the phone.
I guess Mr. Loong is still on the site

551
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,039
and has not come back yet.

552
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,960
Why don’t you call his cell phone?

553
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,199
I don’t have his number.

554
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,280
Then, can you please give...

555
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,719
this bag to Mr. Loong for me?

556
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,239
Okay, no problem.

557
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,559
Can I leave a message for him as well?

558
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:57,880
Yes, of course.

559
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,239
I’d like to say...

560
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,519
To Loong,

561
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,440
"To Loong,"

562
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
it is all my fault.

563
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,519
"it is all my fault."

564
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:12,039
It cannot be fixed.

565
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,719
"It cannot be fixed."

566
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,840
I am really sorry.

567
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,519
"I am really sorry."

568
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,280
Please forgive me for what I have done.

569
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,599
"Please forgive me for what I have done."

570
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,719
From now on,

571
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,800
"From now on,"

572
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,280
I will not get in your way.

573
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,039
"I will not get in your way."

574
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,400
From now on,

575
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,760
"From now on,"

576
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,400
I won't cause you any trouble.

577
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,519
"I won't cause you any trouble."

578
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,480
I won’t cause you any more pain.

579
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:47,719
"I won’t cause you any more pain."

580
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,639
I'll be out of your way.

581
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,719
This must be the right thing to do--

582
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,840
Mister. No. I only want the chorus part.

583
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,880
I was really feeling it. Darn it.

584
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,039
Please give it to him for me.

585
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,239
Yes, I will.

586
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,360
Thank you.

587
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,800
Actually, Mr. Loong will be out in a bit.

588
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,199
See you later. Bye.

589
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,079
Excuse me.
There’s someone waiting for you in there.

590
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,480
INCOMING CALL
MOM

591
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,880
Hello.

592
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,840
I’m at Ped’s.

593
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,320
No, I'll be back later.

594
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,199
Hey.

595
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,960
I’m sorry for breaking your laptop.

596
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,079
It really can’t be fixed.

597
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:08,280
Don’t worry about it.

598
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,679
My laptop is so old
that it's almost broken anyway.

599
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,239
Look.

600
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,039
I’ve been using it since college.

601
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:15,880
It's a good thing,
because now I can throw it away.

602
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,159
It’s getting too quiet.
What should I talk about next?

603
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,400
What should it be?

604
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,519
Look at the stars.

605
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,639
Aren't they beautiful?

606
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,960
Stars? Those are the lights
at the top of the buildings.

607
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,760
Bangkok is too bright
for you to see any stars.

608
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:45,800
If you want to see the stars clearly,

609
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,480
you have to go to Bangkok Planetarium.

610
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,960
You can see the whole universe there.

611
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,840
I don’t think I can go.

612
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,639
I can't stay up late at night.
I get sleepy early.

613
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,679
It opens during the daytime.

614
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,400
Where do you think it was?

615
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:05,960
Don’t tell me you have never been there.

616
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:10,000
I drive past it quite often.

617
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:12,480
What?

618
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,079
Does your school never had school trips?

619
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,159
Yes, but we only went to Siam Park.

620
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,159
You know,

621
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,760
I haven’t been there in a long time.

622
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,360
The Planetarium or Siam Park?

623
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,400
Both.

624
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:32,199
They don’t open at night.

625
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,199
Why don’t you wake up a little early?

626
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,800
I work all night.
How can I get up that early?

627
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,519
My ID card is already expired
and I don’t even have time to renew it.

628
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,960
Then, take a day off.

629
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,000
I can’t. I don’t have any days off.

630
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,599
What? No holidays or weekends? None?

631
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:57,840
I can’t. The BTS operates 365 days a year.

632
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,280
Why do you like to work at night?

633
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,960
It’s quite peaceful.
There's no traffic jams or big crowds.

634
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,320
Why do you like working during the day?

635
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:19,400
I sell solar cells. They need sunlight.

636
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,559
But I actually like nighttime too.

637
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,440
It’s not hot and I won’t get sunburned.

638
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,639
Plus, I won't sweat.

639
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,800
I see, you always forget to greet me now,
handsome.

640
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,360
Well, if I say "hi" to you every day,
I’m afraid you will get bored.

641
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,880
Fine. I’ll greet you tomorrow, all right?

642
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,039
Okay.

643
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,119
Bye.

644
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:22,280
Bye.

645
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,440
Ma’am, do you need a taxi?

646
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,880
Please go ahead.
Let me help you carry your bags.

647
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,639
Here you go. Just get in.
Don’t forget your bags.

648
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:45,039
Have a good ride.

649
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:53,679
Jesus. Why is the traffic so bad?

650
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:57,960
The more the merrier, mister.

651
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,639
I won't be able
to return the car on time, then.

652
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,440
Why didn’t you tell me?

653
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,599
You go return your car.
There’s no need to take me anymore.

654
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,159
PHOTO LEAKED ONLINE
KOB KAVITA SITS CLOSELY TO MYSTERIOUS GUY

655
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,039
HOT SHOT! KOB KAVITA IS SWEET WITH A GUY

656
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,519
WHO IS NOT IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

657
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,760
KINGS

658
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,320
We are already closed. No one is here.

659
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,840
It was you, right? You're the one
who gave the photos to the press!

660
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,119
I didn’t give them to the press.

661
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,360
I just uploaded them on Hi5.

662
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,119
Don't you know you're hurting people?

663
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:28,760
And what is it to you?

664
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,440
Are you Kob Kavita?

665
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,559
So you used to be his girlfriend?

666
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,159
I admit that we used to be together.

667
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:40,920
But, we broke up a long time ago.

668
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:42,960
Why did you guys break up?

669
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,599
We didn’t have time for each other.

670
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,559
Is there a chance
that you might get back together?

671
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,159
How can that be?
We haven’t seen each other in years.

672
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,679
If there aren’t any more questions,
then will you excuse me?

673
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,360
Here. Go bail your dad out.

674
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,119
For drinking and driving.

675
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,159
He went out dining with his friends.

676
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,159
He probably drank too much beer again.

677
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,760
I was drunk like a dog.

678
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:04,880
Did you drink a lot, Dad?

679
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,239
I drank so many bottles
I have enough caps to play chess.

680
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,360
The reason I don’t let you drive
is because I'm worried about you.

681
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,119
You are my only daughter.

682
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:23,519
If anything happens to you,
what would I do?

683
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,639
So, Dad?

684
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,480
When you called Mom, did she scold you?

685
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,920
Your mom is nothing compared to my mom.

686
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,679
Don’t let your grandma know,
or else I’m dead.

687
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,119
-Dad.
-Yes?

688
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:53,400
If we do something wrong...

689
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,519
and confess what we’ve done,

690
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,519
will our guilt be reduced by half?

691
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:02,519
That’s not always true.

692
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:08,920
If it's really bad, it might be good
to keep it to yourself sometimes.

693
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:18,480
Dad.

694
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,000
Yes?

695
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,159
For Songkran this year,

696
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,199
can I go to China with you?

697
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,880
Yes, I'm bringing you the designs
right now.

698
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,519
I'm almost there. I’m at Siam station now.

699
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:40,119
Yes.

700
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,880
So I should get off on the Emporium side
once I arrive at Phrompong station?

701
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,960
Okay.

702
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,199
I will be there in a bit.

703
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,119
Okay.

704
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,519
SHOCKING NEWS!
A MYSTERY MAN KISSES KOB KAVITA

705
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,400
Next station, Chitlom.

706
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,639
PHROM PHONG

707
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:39,840
I'm sorry.

708
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,679
See you in our next life.

709
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:23,920
Next station, On Nut terminal station.

710
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,719
Next station, On Nut terminal station.
Thank you. 

711
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,320
ON NUT STATION

712
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:41,599
Excuse me, sir. This is the last station.

713
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,480
Hey.

714
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,960
Li!

715
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,840
Do you remember that bag
that you threw away?

716
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,760
There was stuff in there.

717
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,960
There was a Tylenol.

718
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,079
Botan candies.

719
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:23,680
Stamps from 7-Eleven.

720
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Video rental coupons.

721
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,560
And also a roll of film negatives.

722
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,000
I think the photo must have leaked
from the negatives I took to develop

723
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,960
What was that?

724
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,359
I think the photo must have leaked
from the negatives I took to develop.

725
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,960
I’m sorry.

726
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,640
Forget it.

727
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:21,000
It’s both our fault.
I threw it away. You dug it up.

728
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:23,359
Hey.

729
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,720
You dug it up from the trash?

730
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:31,680
Anyway, who dumped who?

731
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,800
What was that?

732
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,039
Actually, I don’t really care
about celebrity gossip, you know.

733
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,600
But...

734
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,159
What’s the real story?

735
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,640
Kob and I were together.
Then, I went to study abroad.

736
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,680
I see. So you left her?

737
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,760
During that time, she got into
the entertainment business.

738
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,000
So she left you?

739
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,279
When I got back,

740
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,279
I worked night shifts.

741
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,359
That will do it.
You broke up because of this, right?

742
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,840
Kob asked me

743
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,359
if we don’t have time
to see each other at all,

744
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,680
how can we be in a relationship?

745
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,239
And are you okay now?

746
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,039
I’m okay, and so is Kob.

747
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,680
Luckily, Stephen also understands.

748
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:21,119
What?

749
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,800
They are really a couple?

750
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,439
My grandma will be very happy
to hear this.

751
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,479
We are almost at Bangkok Planetarium.
Get ready, children.

752
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,119
Please get in line.

753
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,640
Watch your step, everyone.

754
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:42,359
You want to go?

755
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,119
My treat.

756
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:50,439
BANGKOK PLANETARIUM

757
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,680
When the sun is about to set,
we'll speed up the time to go faster.

758
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,560
The sun will slowly set on the horizon
along with the musical score

759
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,640
as you enjoy the view of the evening sky
in Bangkok Planetarium. Here it goes.

760
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,319
Why are you so sleepy?
Aren’t you usually wide awake at night?

761
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:10,239
Who says it's nighttime?

762
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:11,640
It’s only three in the afternoon.

763
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,439
It’s so sunny outside.

764
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,560
But it is nighttime in here now.

765
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,000
That's the end of our program.

766
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:49,479
See you next time. Goodbye.

767
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,279
This is Bangkok’s map.
We can see the whole city.

768
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:07,439
MCBRIGHT'S COMET

769
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,079
When Halley’s comet passed by the Earth,

770
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,640
I was asleep.

771
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:19,960
Halley passes every 75 years.

772
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,960
But McBright might not pass us again.

773
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:26,840
Can we see it clearly?

774
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,199
Supposedly.

775
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,600
This one passes closest to earth.

776
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,960
April the 16th.

777
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,720
How about we watch it together?

778
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:44,199
We'll see.

779
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,039
It’s right here.

780
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,079
Hey.

781
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,680
What are you doing?

782
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,279
I'm looking for my house.

783
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,880
INCOMING CALL
HIDE

784
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,640
Yes, I am almost there!

785
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,520
What?

786
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,159
I don’t need to go anymore?

787
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,760
CLOSED FOR FOUR DAYS,
12-15 AUGUST DUE TO SONGKRAN HOLIDAYS

788
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:53,920
Are you still free
this Songkran festival, Li?

789
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,159
I got days off
but I don't know where to go.

790
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:02,239
So...

791
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,279
I want to invite you
to spend Songkran together.

792
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:18,319
Don’t you want to get wet?

793
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,279
Yes, I do. I want to get wet.

794
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,279
See you tomorrow, then.

795
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,960
Okay.

796
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,479
Mei Li, call a cab now.
We might miss the flight.

797
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:02,319
Hey, wait!

798
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:14,720
Jesus. Why is the traffic so bad?
Are we going to make it?

799
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,720
Probably not. Let’s just not go.

800
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,680
Please let there be traffic.
Please let us miss the flight.

801
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,720
Excuse me,
there’s no need to drive that fast.

802
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,159
My grandma might go into shock.

803
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:39,399
Grandma said you can drive
like in Fast and Furious!

804
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,760
Oh, no!

805
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:46,560
I forgot something.

806
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,800
What?

807
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,399
My underwear.

808
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:54,199
Grandma said it’s okay.

809
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,199
You can use hers.
Grandma brought more than enough.

810
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,479
Where is it?

811
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Which one? Let's check.

812
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:10,239
What’s the flight number?
Where do we check in?

813
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:11,239
TOILETS

814
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:12,439
-There?
-I don't see it.

815
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,760
Dad, I really need to pee.
I’m going to the restroom.

816
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Okay. Hurry back or we won’t be able
to check in on time.

817
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,079
Is it that one?

818
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:20,840
PASSPORT

819
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,800
Miss.

820
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,880
You dropped your passport.

821
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,119
Here she comes. Hurry, Li.
Let’s go, dad. Go.

822
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:23,439
What took you so long?

823
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,119
You almost didn’t make it in time
to check in.

824
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,199
Dad, I forgot my passport.

825
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:30,359
What?

826
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:31,920
-Li!
-Did you look carefully?

827
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:34,119
Take everything in your purse out
and check again.

828
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:37,880
-I already checked. It's not in there.
-Check again.

829
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,720
Is it in your suitcase?
Check if it’s there, Li.

830
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,640
No, Mom. It's not there.
There’s no need to look anymore.

831
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,399
Why didn't you double check
before leaving the house?

832
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:51,920
It’s just three days. I will be okay.
You guys just go.

833
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:54,960
You guys should go now.
I will send you off.

834
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:57,760
You’re so careless.

835
01:17:58,359 --> 01:17:59,560
-We got to go now.
-Let's go.

836
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,039
Mister. Where is a good place to go
this Songkran?

837
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:51,760
HAPPY SONGKRAN DAY, ROMANTIC BANGKOK

838
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,640
Li, can I go fill up my water gun?

839
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,119
Just like in my dream.

840
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:47,119
Here you go.

841
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:49,119
Let’s go.

842
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,079
Where are you going? Can I come too?

843
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:08,720
Where do you plan to go
for the water fight?

844
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,600
Shall we go
where there aren't too many people?

845
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,159
I don’t want to get wet.

846
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,880
No, I'm not playing. No, thank you.

847
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,279
I said I don’t want to play.
It’s okay. No!

848
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:28,079
I'll kill you, you nasty kids!

849
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:10,039
You okay?

850
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:22,239
Wow. He's still hot
even with all that powder.

851
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,239
Can the two of us get on there?

852
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:37,720
Hop on.

853
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:13,439
Where are you guys going next?

854
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,800
What do you think, Li?

855
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:18,119
It's hard for me to think
when I'm all wet like this.

856
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,159
How about we go home to change
and then make plans from there?

857
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,079
Is your house around here?

858
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,720
Yes, I'm staying at the guest house
at the end of that road.

859
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,159
I'll pick you up later, okay?

860
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,239
You don't look like you had fun today, Li.

861
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,560
If you don’t like the water fight
on Songkran,

862
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:26,760
how about we go see a movie together?
It will be fun for the three of us.

863
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,800
Or if you don’t want to see a movie,
we can go shopping in Siam Square.

864
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,680
Or if you don’t want to go,
that’s good too.

865
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,439
Then, Loong and I will--

866
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,399
Enough, Plern!

867
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,800
He is mine, please!

868
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:56,199
That's cool.

869
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,399
Hey, where are you going?
We are not home yet.

870
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:05,039
Let’s split up here.

871
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:07,479
I will join my friends at Khaosarn road.

872
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:16,119
Good luck, Li.

873
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:17,880
Bye.

874
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,720
HAPPY SONGKRAN DAY, ROMANTIC BANGKOK

875
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,039
Hey. You’re awake?

876
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:48,039
I already read your tour’s itinerary.
The only thing we can do now is...

877
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,520
take a scenic car ride
around Bangkok at night.

878
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:54,760
Did you write this yourself? Looks fun.

879
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:59,640
I already called a taxi.

880
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,800
Okay.

881
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,720
Are you hungry?

882
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,680
Are you?

883
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,039
I'll make you some instant noodles, then.

884
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,199
-I guess the taxi is here.
-Okay.

885
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:20,680
Hey, the noodles are still hard.
Are they ready?

886
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:25,479
One minute is good enough.
I like my noodles to be firm.

887
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,960
But the instruction said
to boil for three minutes.

888
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:39,600
So, do you prefer wet or hard rice?

889
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,359
How hard is hard? Raw you mean?

890
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,800
Well...

891
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:50,159
Hard rice is kind of grainy.

892
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,720
And wet rice is kind of soggy.

893
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:57,079
Then, I'll go with hard rice.
It tastes better with curry.

894
01:27:57,159 --> 01:27:59,960
Soft rice with curry tastes weird.

895
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,159
Do you like sour or raw mangoes?

896
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:09,479
I don’t like sour mangoes.

897
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,800
Why not?

898
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,319
Because it makes my face pucker.

899
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,600
Now it's your turn to choose.
Whiskey or beer?

900
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,039
I can’t decide.

901
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:35,840
It depends on the occasion.

902
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,560
I think if you want to puke,
go with whiskey.

903
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,279
And beer if you want to get drunk.

904
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:48,239
How many hours do you sleep?

905
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:51,159
-What?
-How many hours do you sleep?

906
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:52,359
Let's see...

907
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
Ten.

908
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:58,159
And you?

909
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,880
How many cans of beer does it take
for you to get drunk?

910
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:02,239
Three.

911
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:06,159
And you?

912
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:08,920
How many porn videos do you watch a day?

913
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,079
I can’t even finish one before I...

914
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:13,439
fall asleep.

915
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:17,960
What were you thinking?

916
01:29:18,039 --> 01:29:20,880
-It’s you who was thinking dirty.
-I’m the innocent one here.

917
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,399
You asked the question.

918
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:23,760
I wasn’t thinking anything.

919
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,319
How many girlfriends have you had?

920
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:32,960
Two.

921
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:35,640
Two? Just two? Did he include me as well?

922
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,880
What about you?

923
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:38,520
How old are you?

924
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:43,760
I don’t want to play this game anymore.
It’s no longer fun.

925
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,079
Where are we going next?

926
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,920
Should we call it a day?

927
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,039
Tomorrow,

928
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,439
I will take you
to tour our train repair garage.

929
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:57,159
You want to go?

930
01:29:58,199 --> 01:29:59,439
I can go?

931
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,159
Of course. Tomorrow is family day.

932
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,720
They allow us to bring family
or close friends.

933
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:17,439
Hi, there.

934
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,680
-Name, say hi to my boss, Mr. Loong.
-Hello.

935
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:20,920
Hello.

936
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,239
And Auntie too?

937
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,640
Well...

938
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,159
Uncle is supposed to come
with Auntie, right? Hello.

939
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:34,479
You’re so cute! What’s your name?

940
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,800
My name is "Name".

941
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,239
Wow. Even your name is cute.
How old are you now?

942
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,439
Li.

943
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:49,199
What are you doing?
You're taking pictures?

944
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:52,239
I wasn't ready. Can you take another one?

945
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,920
Wait a second.

946
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:05,159
-You took it already?
-Yes.

947
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:08,960
Oh, my God! I look super ugly!

948
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,800
Delete it, please.

949
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,760
Hey, it’s beautiful.

950
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,119
It’s very ugly. Let me delete it.

951
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:23,520
It’s broken.

952
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:27,520
I’m sorry.

953
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,880
It's all right.

954
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:31,560
It's an old camera, anyway.

955
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:33,319
Let’s go.

956
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,479
Okay, kids.

957
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:40,159
This is the SKL car.

958
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,119
Its main function is to cover the rails

959
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,520
after the sky train stops operating.

960
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,119
And this right here is the machine

961
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:50,920
that polishes the metal
on the train’s small rail.

962
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:52,600
Its duty is to polish

963
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,159
the rail of the train to make it smooth.

964
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:57,720
If you want to know
why the rail has to be smooth,

965
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,279
you have to ask that gentleman.

966
01:32:00,359 --> 01:32:02,560
Please give him a warm welcome.

967
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:07,520
He is a guy who has polished 100,
if not 1,000 rails.

968
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,760
Unfortunately, he’s not going to work
here anymore.

969
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:15,159
He got a scholarship
to study in Germany for two years.

970
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,560
If you guys want to be as smart as him,

971
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,319
you have to study hard

972
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,439
and listen to your parents.

973
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,920
That way, you will be able
to study abroad like him.

974
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:28,359
So, have you finished packing?
Are you going with him too?

975
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,520
No.

976
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,039
Hey, look. There's time for us to relax
as we please in today's itinerary.

977
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,159
How long have you already known

978
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:14,640
that you are going abroad?

979
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:18,000
Well...

980
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,319
about four or five months now.

981
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,720
And you’re going the day after tomorrow?

982
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:32,239
Yes.

983
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:40,119
And when are you planning to tell me this?

984
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,920
Tomorrow.

985
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:05,640
You still want to go to other places?

986
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:24,359
I’m already tired for today.

987
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,800
You can relax as you please.

988
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:41,119
BANGKOK... THE PERFECT CITY TO ENJOY LIFE

989
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,600
Li.

990
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,720
Hey.

991
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:01,359
You’re home?

992
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,960
Well?

993
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:06,399
If you thought I wasn’t here,
why did you ring the bell?

994
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,479
-Ped.
-What?

995
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,720
Do you think
couples should always eat together?

996
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,720
Why do you ask?

997
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,960
Just answer me.

998
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:24,520
Let's see.

999
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,439
Not always. When my husband is hungry,
he never waits for anyone.

1000
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,760
And when you have to eat all by yourself,

1001
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:37,479
do you get bored?

1002
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,840
What’s wrong, Li?

1003
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,560
I’m lonely.

1004
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,199
I’ve been eating alone
for almost two months now.

1005
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,760
I told you to find a boyfriend.

1006
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,199
If I have a boyfriend,

1007
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:13,439
but he is never free to eat with me

1008
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,960
or have time to go anywhere with me,

1009
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,399
then what’s the point of having one?

1010
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:26,359
Li.

1011
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,880
You don't get a boyfriend
just so you can be with him all the time.

1012
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:35,199
You have him so you know
there is someone who loves you.

1013
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,560
Sorry for answering the door so late.
I was in the restroom.

1014
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,479
There’s no need to be sorry.
I'm the one who should be

1015
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,119
for ditching you today.

1016
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,800
Come in.

1017
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,199
GERMANY

1018
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:07,520
What time is your flight tomorrow?

1019
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:10,279
At 8 a.m.

1020
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,119
I’m glad

1021
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,439
that we went out together on Songkran.

1022
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:30,079
When you asked me out,

1023
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,720
did you think...

1024
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:42,520
Did you think of me

1025
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:45,399
more than just a friend?

1026
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:49,600
At first, I didn’t want to.

1027
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:54,640
But I couldn’t resist my feelings.

1028
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:07,079
You feel this way
even though you know you're leaving?

1029
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:10,560
I think

1030
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,680
even though we are not together,

1031
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,560
we can make this relationship work.

1032
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:26,039
So...

1033
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:30,760
Let's say once you come back,

1034
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,520
will you ever consider switching
to working the day shift?

1035
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:47,600
I used to think that

1036
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,760
any girl who left a man like you

1037
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,760
must be crazy.

1038
01:41:58,479 --> 01:41:59,600
But now,

1039
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:01,479
I understand.

1040
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,119
Kob was right.

1041
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,520
If we can’t be together,

1042
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:14,800
how can we be a couple?

1043
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,880
I think,

1044
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,239
if we really have to part ways,

1045
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,199
it’s better if we part as friends.

1046
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,880
Good luck.

1047
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:20,199
HAPPY SONGKRAN DAY, ROMANTIC BANGKOK

1048
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,920
Hey, you’re back already?

1049
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,680
-How was it?
-Too many people and bad traffic.

1050
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,439
There were people everywhere
trying to have fun.

1051
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,039
It’s best to be in Bangkok
during Songkran.

1052
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:52,359
Well...

1053
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:55,960
I stopped by the guest house earlier.

1054
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:58,720
Loong left this box for you.

1055
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,039
TO JUEN, PLEASE GIVE THIS TO LI.

1056
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,439
Last Valentine’s day,

1057
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,640
if this hit me in the head,
we would not have met each other.

1058
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,640
Because I would probably
be in the hospital instead.

1059
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,199
And if this did not break,

1060
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:05,880
then I wouldn’t have seen this.

1061
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,720
Sorry.

1062
01:45:21,079 --> 01:45:22,880
I wasn’t brave enough to call you.

1063
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:24,680
And to call now...

1064
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:26,800
is probably too late.

1065
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,239
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SING THIS SONG

1066
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,680
I want to hear you sing this song for me.

1067
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:53,680
TO LOONG, IT REALLY CAN'T BE FIXED.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

1068
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,039
I WON'T CAUSE YOU ANY MORE PAIN.

1069
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,720
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY, LI JONGJIT

1070
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,479
SCIENCE CENTER FOR EDUCATION

1071
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,920
Most couples go to the movies
on their first date.

1072
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,680
But we got to see the stars
during the day time.

1073
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,000
Romantic, right?

1074
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:34,319
Even though the camera is broken,
we still have our memories.

1075
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:27,800
Yes. Sure. No problem.

1076
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:31,079
Okay. Have a nice day.

1077
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:38,199
Did the flight to Munich depart yet?

1078
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,880
The flight already departed at 8 a.m.

1079
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,439
It's now past ten.
The plane should be in India now.

1080
01:49:20,279 --> 01:49:21,319
Li!

1081
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:24,199
How are you? Is everything cool?

1082
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:28,199
When are you getting married?
Don’t forget to send me an invitation.

1083
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,800
If this was a romantic movie,

1084
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:44,279
I should have made it on time.

1085
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,239
Goodness, my legs are so sore.

1086
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:05,399
Grandma is a shopaholic.
She was on a shopping spree.

1087
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:08,239
We got a lot of stuff for you, Li.

1088
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:11,359
Grandma.

1089
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:13,680
Did you have fun?

1090
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,439
She missed your grandpa.

1091
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:31,239
Everywhere she went,
everybody looked like your grandpa.

1092
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,399
Right now, I am at Bangkok Planetarium.

1093
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:43,000
And behind me are all the people

1094
01:50:43,079 --> 01:50:46,359
who are waiting
to see the McBright’s comet tonight.

1095
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:48,239
Hey, dear. Where’s the camera?

1096
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,760
I’ll take a picture
of the McBright’s comet.

1097
01:50:51,239 --> 01:50:54,880
I forgot which bag I put it in.
Li, can you find it for your dad?

1098
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:42,720
TWO YEARS LATER

1099
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:51,840
Yeah, it's almost 6 p.m. in New York.

1100
01:52:53,479 --> 01:52:55,560
And their stock market is closing soon.

1101
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:00,560
We have sent you the report of the four
Asian stocks you advised already.

1102
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,800
Okay.

1103
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,760
Bye.

1104
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,079
You always get home in the morning.

1105
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:21,279
Now, everybody's saying
that you’re one of those night women.

1106
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:25,159
Just quit your job.
And come help me sell motorcycles.

1107
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:30,479
Come on, Dad.
Working at night is convenient.

1108
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,920
See you later. I’m sleepy.

1109
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,239
Sala Daeng station.

1110
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,319
Since when did you get back?

1111
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,720
About a couple of months.

1112
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,119
Well...

1113
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:01,359
How are you doing?

1114
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:06,079
I’m good.

1115
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,600
Where are you going?

1116
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:12,479
I just got out of a meeting.
I’m going home.

1117
01:55:14,119 --> 01:55:15,079
And you?

1118
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:19,560
I’m heading to work.

1119
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:33,680
Next station, Siam.

1120
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,479
I'm getting off here.

1121
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:40,720
Me too.

1122
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:00,880
I'll get going now.

1123
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,960
Attention, please.

1124
01:57:21,079 --> 01:57:23,680
There are some technical problems
with the train system

1125
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,560
-which are currently being checked.
-Hello, Mo.

1126
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:29,199
The BTS electricity went out.
What should I do?

1127
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:33,560
I’ll tell you about it later.
You should have come with me today...

1128
01:58:12,039 --> 01:58:13,000
INCOMING CALL

1129
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:22,800
Hello.

1130
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,520
Hello. Is this Li?

1131
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,279
It’s me. Loong.

1132
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:33,439
Li.

1133
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,119
Yes. Hello?

1134
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:41,600
The BTS electricity went out.

1135
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,560
And where are you now?

1136
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,880
We haven’t reached Asoke station yet.

1137
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:49,560
Don't be scared.

1138
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,439
There's a technical problem
with the train's system.

1139
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,920
They're fixing it now. 
It'll be able to run as usual very soon. 

1140
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:02,760
Li.

1141
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:06,239
Yes?

1142
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:10,479
This Songkran, are you still available?

1143
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,119
I am available.

1144
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:24,479
I am available.

1145
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:30,560
Yes.

1146
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:36,439
This is my number.

1147
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,399
Don’t forget to save it.

1148
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,680
Millions of stars that are floating
in the sky

1149
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,560
Is there any that's floating alone

1150
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,520
And not orbiting anywhere?

1151
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:10,720
I've never seen a star like that

1152
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:15,199
You tell me my star is so distant

1153
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,199
But aren’t all stars far away?

1154
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:23,399
I think your star must be the same

1155
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,239
There's no need to count
how many light years apart
