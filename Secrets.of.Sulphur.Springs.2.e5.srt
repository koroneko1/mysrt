1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:02,212
Savannah:
Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,880
Griffin: I thought
the springs dried up.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,982
Ben:
The springs, they're back!

4
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:07,484
This means our luck
is changing.

5
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:09,185
Bennett, Sr.:
I want to help you bring
this place back to life.

6
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:10,387
With just a few phone calls,

7
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,155
I'll have a dozen workers
over here.

8
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,725
‐Zoey: That was
no electrical surge.
‐Wyatt: No way.

9
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,894
I think
our ghost is getting
really ticked off.

10
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:21,197
Hoping I could talk you
into reconsidering my offer,
Elijah.

11
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:23,567
One bad season.
Heck, one bad accident,

12
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,802
and all you'll leave
your children with
is a mountain of debt.

13
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,870
Harper:
Do you trust that man?

14
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,638
Sam:
Sometimes, I don't
know who to trust.

15
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,206
But I do know
one thing for sure.

16
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,442
You're not my sister.

17
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:35,378
So who are you
and where did you come from?

18
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:36,613
Savannah:
I've been trying to think

19
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,348
how I can prove to you
I've traveled through time,

20
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:39,249
but all I have is this.

21
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,718
"Guys, help.
I'm stuck in 1930.

22
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:43,720
I'm trying my best
pretending to be Daisy."

23
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,221
Daisy's my sister's name.

24
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:47,524
Griffin:
You have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

25
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:50,160
Mrs. Roth:
You got every single question
on the quiz wrong.

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,294
It's not like you at all!

27
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:53,897
The truth is,
I'm not who you think I am.

28
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,803
I'm sorry, it's just‐‐

29
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,440
It's‐‐ It's‐‐ It's a lot
to process. So...

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,309
So‐‐ So you're saying
that you and your friend,
Harper‐‐

31
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:07,811
We've both used your machine.

32
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:09,879
And not just us,
Daisy too.

33
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,716
It says here she's stuck
in the future.

34
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:14,651
And if Harper's
trapped in 1930‐‐

35
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,119
That means
they're both in trouble.

36
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,354
Exactly.

37
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:19,189
Which is why
you really need
to get back to work

38
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,290
on that invention
of yours.

39
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,591
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

40
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,226
Now, even if all this is true,

41
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,861
it doesn't change the fact

42
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,797
that my... invention
isn't working now.

43
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,935
Yeah, but you're so close.
You must be.

44
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,770
Caroline: Savannah,
are you in there?

45
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,672
I need help with dinner.

46
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,307
Sure, I'll just
be a minute!

47
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,776
No, no, no. No, no.
You go help your mother.

48
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,177
Look, I'm just gonna
finish up here,

49
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,979
and then I'll,
uh, head down
to the basement

50
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,247
and I'll take a look
at that‐‐

51
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,651
‐Time machine.
‐Yeah.

52
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:50,787
I think I have an idea
to get it up and running.

53
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:54,858
Cool! I'll see you
in the basement after dinner.

54
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,540
Whoa. What's that?

55
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,741
Found it
in the springs.

56
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,643
Guess it's some kind
of weird rock.

57
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,978
Not like
any rock I've seen.

58
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,613
Maybe it's from space.

59
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,382
Definite alien vibes.

60
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,718
Could be.
Why don't you guys
do some research?

61
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:28,258
Oh, no! We broke it.

62
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,231
What do you mean,
you're not who I think
you are?

63
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,400
I just meant I'm...

64
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:42,372
not as smart
as you thought I was.

65
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,040
I get it.

66
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,776
There's a lot of pressure
on kids these days.

67
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,278
If you'd done the reading,

68
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,779
the quiz
should've been easy.

69
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,982
I know.
And I'll do better
next time, really.

70
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:54,718
You're one
of my best students,
Harper,

71
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:56,352
which is why
I'm gonna allow you

72
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,354
to take a makeup quiz
tomorrow.

73
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,724
This time,
come prepared.

74
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,827
‐Fair?
‐Yes, ma'am. Very fair.

75
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,534
Hey, nice save.

76
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:12,669
So listen,
I've been thinking‐‐

77
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,205
No, Griffin.
I can't do this anymore!

78
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:16,339
I'm a nervous wreck.

79
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,141
Every second I stay here
is just another chance

80
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,342
I'll get caught,
and then what?

81
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:20,610
But you've been doing
so great.

82
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,845
Great?

83
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:24,147
Until this morning,
I didn't even know
we had 50 states.

84
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,915
Alaska and Hawaii,
when did that happen?

85
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:26,916
I don't know.
A while ago.

86
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:30,186
Look, I was thinking about
what you said earlier.

87
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,821
Topher told you
he was sleepwalking?

88
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:34,357
Yes. He woke up this morning
covered in mud.

89
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:36,826
Said something
about eating worms.

90
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,394
‐Worms?
‐Yeah.

91
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,130
See, that's pretty weird,
even for him.

92
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,397
He's gotta be
hiding something.

93
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,433
The crystal?
Griffin, I told you.

94
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,734
I already searched
his room.

95
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:45,902
You said
you were interrupted.

96
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,804
Yes! And I was almost caught.
It's too risky.

97
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:49,405
Look, do you wanna
go home or not?

98
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,180
(theme music playing)

99
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,119
Look who it is.
Good afternoon, kids.

100
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,287
Afternoon.

101
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,289
Doing
a little shopping, I see.

102
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,291
Miss Landry's
famous beignets.

103
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,026
Must be
a special occasion.

104
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:46,529
Mother's favorite.
Papa treats us sometimes.

105
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:47,797
Your father's
a fine man.

106
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:49,599
I just wish
he'd let me help him

107
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,367
with your... situation.

108
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,836
We don't need your help.

109
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:55,438
We just want the farm
to stay in our family.

110
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,106
Well, of course,
you do.

111
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,474
But that's what
I want too.

112
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,312
If only someone
could get your father
to listen to reason

113
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,047
and sign these.

114
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,619
I'll talk to him.

115
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:12,021
Smart girl.
Let's work together.

116
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:15,024
Save your sweet mother's farm
before it's too late.

117
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,763
Why'd you take
those papers?

118
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:21,898
Because if I didn't‐‐

119
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:24,868
I have a reason, okay?

120
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,937
More of a feeling,
actually.

121
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:28,938
A feeling?

122
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,574
I wish I could explain.

123
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:34,143
So why can't you?
We tell each other
everything.

124
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,512
Or at least we used to

125
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:39,015
before you started acting
so strange.

126
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,216
Sam...

127
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,588
(distortion)

128
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:56,733
Oh, my gosh.
The judge...

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,002
He's really gonna do it.

130
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:13,449
foreman:
Nail it down good.
The deck is rotten through.

131
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,852
‐Nice.
‐You got it.

132
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,155
Uh, hi.
You in charge here?

133
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,390
I am.
Are you the owner?

134
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,058
Depends. You about
to hand me a bill?

135
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,093
Actually, someone's already
taken care of that.

136
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,095
That would be me.
Bennett Campbell.

137
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,730
Appreciate
the business, sir.

138
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,499
We never worked a job
in Sulphur Springs before.

139
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,200
Really?
Where are you from?

140
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,469
Waller City,
about 100 miles
north of here.

141
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,506
Heard you guys are having
some plumbing issues.

142
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:37,573
Mind if I take a peek?

143
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,008
Go right ahead.

144
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,749
Dad, this is generous,

145
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,418
but you should've
talked to us first.

146
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,187
Oh. Oh,
I'm sorry, Bennett.

147
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,088
I thought we covered that.

148
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:53,923
When? You just got here.

149
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,526
Come here.
There's something
I wanna show you.

150
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:03,366
What do you think
about a parking garage
right over there?

151
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,969
Once this place takes off,
all those guests are gonna have

152
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,537
to have some place
to park, right?

153
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,538
I guess so.

154
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,273
Yeah. And that's‐‐
that's only the beginning.

155
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,942
Once this hotel
is done, Bennett,

156
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,877
trust me,
everyone in town
will forget

157
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:16,612
all about
that ridiculous
ghost business.

158
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,082
Dad!

159
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,718
Oh. Ugh.

160
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,286
Dad, are you okay?

161
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:25,955
Better me than a guest.

162
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,193
Looks like I got here
just in time.

163
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:46,009
(objects rattling)

164
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:06,696
(rattling continues)

165
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,233
Hello?

166
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:15,838
Whoever's there,

167
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,175
I'm under legal obligation
to warn you

168
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:22,445
these hands
are lethal weapons.

169
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,219
(screams)

170
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,058
What're you doing
in there?

171
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,260
I could've
seriously hurt you!

172
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,561
What's going on in here?

173
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,696
Harper was snooping
through my stuff again.

174
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,899
No, I wasn't.
I was just, uh‐‐

175
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,734
Planning to do my laundry?

176
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,570
No, you don't understand.

177
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,772
Then maybe
you should explain.

178
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,608
First, I get a call
from Mrs. Roth

179
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,444
telling me
you failed a quiz.

180
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:55,645
And now this?

181
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:58,714
I'm sorry, Mother‐‐
Mom, I, uh‐‐

182
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:00,016
Harper, what is going on?

183
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,718
I know you haven't been
sleeping well.

184
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,687
Or is it something
at school?

185
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,689
Baby, just talk to me.

186
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:09,525
I wish I could.

187
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:11,994
I can't.

188
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,605
Dad, hey, have you seen
Topher around?

189
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,540
Not since yesterday.
Have you asked the twins?

190
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,641
They're not
in their rooms.

191
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,843
Yeah, maybe check
the springs.

192
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,079
‐The springs?
‐Yeah.

193
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,849
Yeah, I found
this crazy‐looking rock
in the water earlier

194
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:33,916
and gave it to 'em.

195
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,985
They're probably down there
looking for more.

196
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:37,386
Crazy‐looking rock, huh?

197
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:38,521
Yeah, I was
kind of hoping

198
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,123
it'd be a distraction
from ghost‐busting,

199
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,190
but I guess we'll...

200
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,194
see.

201
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,565
Just tell me
where it is, okay?

202
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,201
Haven't you ever
heard of "finders keepers"?

203
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,036
Come on,
you didn't find anything.
Dad gave it to you.

204
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,605
Exactly.
Which makes it mine.

205
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,040
Ours.

206
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:00,476
Zoey:
Why do you want it so bad?

207
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,379
I just...
I just do, okay?

208
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,448
Must be
really valuable.

209
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:06,349
Definitely alien.

210
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,417
And don't even think
about looking for it,

211
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,453
because I found
the ultimate hiding place.

212
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,855
If you want your own,
why don't you come in
and look for it?

213
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,790
Because I'm running
out of time, that's why!

214
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,496
Zoey: Whatever.
Let's keep looking.

215
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,969
(phone ringing)

216
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,307
Great news!
Wyatt and Zoey
have the crystal.

217
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,676
That's wonderful!
So they'll give it
to you, right?

218
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,611
Griffin:
Clearly, you don't know
my brother and sister.

219
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,647
No, they're hiding it
somewhere.

220
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:40,016
Oh, my!
Any idea where?

221
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,084
‐(door closes)
‐Griffin: Not yet.

222
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,420
But as soon as we find it,
we're heading straight
to the bunker.

223
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,222
‐Meet me at The Tremont.
‐I'll be right there.

224
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,829
Everything the judge said
is right here.

225
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:55,531
Man of his word.

226
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,703
‐You okay with this, Daisy?
‐Sam: No, I'm not!

227
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,371
Please don't sign, Papa.

228
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,774
This land
is all we have left
of Mother.

229
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,175
Sam, listen to me.

230
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,778
Your mother's
always gonna be with us

231
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,146
wherever we go.

232
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,414
You know that,
right?

233
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:13,482
Then why does this feel
so wrong?

234
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:25,261
I know this is hard but‐‐

235
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,196
Why should I believe
anything you say?

236
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,431
Because I'm telling
the truth.

237
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,066
If Papa doesn't sign
those papers...

238
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,370
‐Remember that vision
I was telling you about?
‐Yeah?

239
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,571
I've been having
more of them.

240
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,206
And each time,
it's been about a fire.

241
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:40,076
Someone's going to burn down
our home, Sam.

242
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,844
‐I can feel it.
‐Who?

243
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,547
Judge Walker?

244
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:45,815
Remember the other day
when he hinted

245
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:47,416
that something could
go wrong?

246
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,517
Some kind of accident.

247
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,253
‐You really think he'd‐‐
‐Yes!

248
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,555
That's why I need you
to trust me on this.

249
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:00,830
So what's
the big wire for?

250
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,999
Power.
Lots of it.

251
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,569
I'm just hoping
it doesn't overload
the capacitor bank.

252
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:07,837
It's been an issue
in the past.

253
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,372
Cool.

254
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,241
‐Hey, Sam.
‐Yeah.

255
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:13,909
Do you hate it here?

256
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,649
Now why would you ask me
a question like that?

257
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,051
I guess I just know
what it's like
to want to run away.

258
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,687
And you are building
this machine.

259
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,122
So you think I wanna
run away too?

260
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:27,757
Am I right?

261
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:30,760
I used to.

262
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,896
Studied hard,
got an engineering degree,

263
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:36,499
and a big job
lined up in Boston.

264
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,868
So why'd you come back?

265
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,203
The springs.

266
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:44,440
After my mother got sick,

267
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,208
she used to soak in them
for hours.

268
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:48,244
Believed they had
healing properties

269
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:50,112
that came from
these little guys
right here.

270
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,616
So it's true?
The crystal
has magical powers?

271
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:55,284
Energy.

272
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,287
It didn't save her life,
but it might have extended it.

273
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,290
Now I'm trying to use it
to power this contraption.

274
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,794
Dedicated the last
18 years to it.

275
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,228
Wow.

276
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,032
So where are you gonna go
when it finally works?

277
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,367
Far into the future,

278
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,235
to a time where they had
a cure for what took her.

279
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,237
And with any luck,

280
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,541
that crystal
might save her life yet.

281
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,448
So what do you say,
you wanna give it another try?

282
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,524
(radio whirring)

283
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,394
Oh, my gosh!
It's working!

284
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,143
How much longer
is this going to take?

285
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,179
I've got five cases
of melting Nutt‐O Bars
in the deep‐freeze.

286
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,681
Any minute,
Miss Caroline.

287
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:00,549
And you.

288
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,451
How many times
have I told you

289
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:03,986
to stay out
of this man's hair?

290
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,354
What? I'm helping!

291
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:06,989
The best assistant
I ever had.

292
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:10,025
Well, she's
the only assistant
I ever had.

293
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,796
Might be good for her
to learn the ins and outs
of this place,

294
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,565
you know, in case
I'm not around
one of these days.

295
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,334
Now, Sam,
why would she do that?

296
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:19,935
It's not like you're
leaving anytime soon.

297
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,381
I appreciate
the hospitality, Elijah.

298
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,617
Beignets were
as delicious as always.

299
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,419
Least we can do,

300
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,788
considering how much
you're helping us out
with the farm.

301
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,190
I like to assist when I can.

302
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:46,962
So what do you say
we get down to business?

303
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,103
Everything all right?

304
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,575
Everything's fine, Judge.
Just fine.

305
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,290
Come on, we have to hurry
if we're gonna find the crystal

306
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,958
before Wyatt and Zoey
get back from the springs.

307
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,493
Any idea
where it could be?

308
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,129
No, but... it can't be
that hard to find.

309
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,431
I mean, Wyatt's hiding spots
tend to be kind of lame.

310
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,204
Topher?

311
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:32,675
Oh. Hey, guys.
What's up?

312
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,281
What're you
doing here?

313
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:42,117
Me? What are you
doing here?

314
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,086
I live here.

315
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,088
Okay. Valid point.

316
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:47,490
Th‐‐ This place
is a mess!

317
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,360
‐What're you looking for?
‐Uh, I...

318
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,929
Why were you
going through my closet?

319
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,297
Don't change the subject.

320
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,066
You told me you were
sleepwalking last night.

321
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,567
What were you really doing?

322
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,403
Could you rephrase
the question, please?

323
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,038
‐Topher...
‐Fine!

324
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,508
I took the crystal,

325
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,176
but it was a huge mistake.

326
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,644
That thing is cursed.

327
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:09,979
Cursed?

328
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:11,280
Weird things
kept happening.

329
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,015
We need to put it
back where it belongs.

330
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,783
That's what we want too.

331
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,085
Then we're all
out of luck.

332
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,587
I've been through
this whole room,
and it's not here.

333
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:19,688
So let's check
Wyatt's room.

334
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,823
Not in there either.

335
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,559
I have a lot
of cleaning up to do.

336
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,229
So what do we do now?

337
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,364
I don't know.

338
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:30,733
(sighs)

339
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,868
Oh, a long day, huh?

340
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,638
Would've been a lot longer
without that crew you hired.

341
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,007
You sure
you don't wanna
ice that ankle?

342
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:40,042
Oh, no,
it's just a scrape.
It's fine.

343
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,214
Hey, listen, Dad, uh...

344
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,386
Sorry, if I didn't seem
more... appreciative earlier.

345
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:54,223
It means a lot to me that
we're doing this together.

346
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,192
That's good to hear,
Bennett.

347
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,330
Now we just
have to figure out

348
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,399
a way to brighten up
this whole fire trap.

349
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,867
‐Yeah.
‐It's depressing.

350
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:11,273
(bulbs exploding)

351
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:13,442
What was that?

352
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,245
Probably another power surge.

353
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,047
Have to get that contractor
before he leaves.

354
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,416
This place
is a disaster.

355
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,521
(radio whirs)

356
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,256
(radio powers down)

357
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,458
Doesn't make any sense.

358
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,160
There should be
more than enough power.

359
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,495
Maybe try another cable.
There's more in the barn.

360
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:34,964
No, no, it just‐‐

361
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,766
It doesn't work, that's all.

362
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,568
I should've known better.

363
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,403
But you can't
give up!

364
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:43,439
Harper needs us!
Your sister needs‐‐

365
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,707
(shouts):
There's no point!

366
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,147
(softly): I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,183
It's not your fault.

368
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,451
You‐‐ You're a kid.

369
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,288
Guess I just wanted to believe
that crazy imagination of yours.

370
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,123
‐Sam, please...
‐No.

371
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,926
No, your mother's right.

372
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,331
From now on,
just stay out of my hair.

373
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,907
(shouts):
Why won't you work?

374
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,477
(radio whirring)

375
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:28,684
I'm on my way,
Harper.

376
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,850
‐Savannah!
‐Got your note.

377
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,285
Figured you could use
a lift home.

378
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,620
I can't believe it's you!

379
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,388
I can't believe
you got stuck here!

380
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:07,589
What have you been doing?

381
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,058
Pretending to be
my great‐grandmother.

382
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,359
It's been so crazy.

383
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,593
I cooked
this terrible dinner.

384
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:12,761
I milked a goat.

385
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:13,829
Then I kept having
these visions

386
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,998
of this horrible judge
burning down the house.

387
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:18,167
Whoa!
You milked a goat?

388
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:19,802
Yes, an actual goat.

389
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:21,704
Did you not hear
the part about the visions?

390
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:25,574
Oh, no.

391
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,209
‐What is it?
‐I don't know.

392
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,577
But go. Now!

393
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,649
(loudly):
Papa, something's happening.

394
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,350
I really think
you should come out here.

395
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:49,331
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

396
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,501
Something I can
help you with?

397
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,602
Elijah Tremont?

398
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:55,137
Yes.

399
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:58,807
According to your agreement
with Judge Emmet Walker,

400
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:02,411
you are hereby ordered
to vacate this property
within 48 hours.

401
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,013
Elijah:
Vacate?

402
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:07,616
No, no, Sheriff,
there must be some mistake.

403
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,852
The judge and I have
an agreement.

404
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:11,120
And that agreement's
in your hand.

405
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:12,721
If I was you,

406
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,189
I'd start packing...

407
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,191
now.

408
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,344
Think...
where else could it be?

409
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,146
I don't know,

410
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,481
but Zoey and Wyatt
are gonna be back
any minute.

411
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,051
(sighs)

412
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,859
Hey, uh, Topher,
I just had an idea.

413
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,694
Uh, do you think
you could go down

414
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,296
and stall the twins
for a bit?

415
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,931
You know, give us
more time to search?

416
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,299
I guess so. Sure.

417
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,504
I can't do this anymore,
Griffin.

418
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,407
Every time
I think we're close,
something happens.

419
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,842
I might as well accept it.

420
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:08,844
I am never going home.

421
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,346
Actually,
I... think you might.

422
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,982
What do you mean?

423
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,952
I mean, I...
think I'm sitting
on Wyatt's hiding place.

424
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,696
Oh, my goodness!

425
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:30,299
I've never been
so happy to see anything
in my whole life!

426
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,366
Me either. I‐‐

427
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,603
‐Is that a crack?
‐A crack?

428
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,938
This jagged line
right here.

429
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:37,506
That wasn't there before?

430
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,341
No, it wasn't.

431
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,948
Harper:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

432
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,150
Your family can't let
that slimy judge win.

433
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,351
Harper:
We have to stop him.

434
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,953
Judge Emmet:
You got the document
for their farm?

435
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,454
associate:
If you mean the original.

436
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:53,689
I'm not sure I can leave.

437
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,457
What? No!
You have to switch back.

438
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:57,492
Zoey:
This is... new.

439
00:21:57,492 --> 00:22:00,429
Topher: It's the ghost
sending a message
loud and clear.

440
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,530
(Bennett Sr. yelps)

441
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,497
Topher:
Put the rock back now...

442
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:03,866
(electronics going haywire)

443
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,601
‐Or else...
‐Fire!

444
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,769
Savannah!
Are you down there?
