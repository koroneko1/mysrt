00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You've gone all day. Don't you know that I missed you, baby?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I was out and about all day and I had to see you here?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Are you alright? Or you have a new house rule of prohibiting exercise in the evening?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.500
Yeah.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Wait? Are you mad at me?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You seem to be mad at me a lot lately.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Nothing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Wait. I think there's something for sure.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Normally when I messed with you like this, you'd talk back to me.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But you seem to be quieter for several days now.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Are you mad at me?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You act like this because of what happened the other day?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Wait. I think there's something for sure.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.500
Nope.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Wait.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Why did you avoid me?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Who avoided you? I live my life normally I just didn't see you quite often.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Why do I feel like you avoid me both at home and at work?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You're overthinking it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Wait.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where're you off too, naughty dog.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What's wrong with him? I don't want to mess with him anymore.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Why does my heart keep beating like this?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Calm down.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Remember, this love is impossible.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I need to stay away from him.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What should I do?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I need to hear the briefing at Suttirak's office again.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
How can I control myself if I have to be alone with him?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
What if he's questioning about me? What should I tell him?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
What're you thinking?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Stop it. Right now.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.000
Do I look dewy enough?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Dewy enough. If you want it to be more dewy, then you need to layer your face with oil.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Your turn.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Nothing. / It's not nothing. I saw you keep turning your head around.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It looks like dogs about to cross a road.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You can tell me.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's nothing.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
If it's nothing, then you should go and receive the briefing from Suttirak.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
If you're slow and get spanked, I can't help you with that.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Can any of you do it for me?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.000
Nope / Nope.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Please / I have a date with Pom. You know how important the first date is.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.000
You know I can't be late.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I have one month anniversary celebration with my boyfriend. It's an anniversary of him being a good boy.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.000
If I go home late, he's gonna go out for sure.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's five to 5 p.m. Let's go.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.000
It's just a briefing. It'd take only 10 minutes.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Please, do it for me.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.000
What's wrong with you?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Normally when he called you to this, you can do it by yourself.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.000
What's the matter with you today? Why you need us to cover for you?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I..I have a headache. Please, do it for me.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.000
Wait! Diao!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What's wrong with him?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Did he have a fight with Suttirak?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.000
I know. Normally, he'd be glad to join the briefing so he could talk back to him.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There must be something / There must be something

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
How long do I have to avoid him?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Why do I have to like him this much?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Diao!

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Where are you?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Hey!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So you're home.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I knocked on your door earlier, why didn't you open the door for me?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Crap! I forgot to lock my back door.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I was just coming down the stairs.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Decha and Kanomthai said that you're sick.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.000
How're you?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Your body temperature is normal.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I don't have a fever. I…My stomach hurts.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Did you take anything? You need to see a doctor?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It's okay. I should lie down for a bit and I'll get better.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
You can go now.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Wait.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
What's going on with you?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Why do I feel like you're avoiding me?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
He asked me this again.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I'm fine. I told you I have a stomachache.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I'm gonna go get some rest.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But you said you just came down the stairs.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I needed to get some water and I'd go right back.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Wait a second.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I think you should go see a doctor. I'll take you.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.500
Let's go.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You don't have to.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Come on, don't be stubborn.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You don't have to live up to your name.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Let's go, naughty little boy.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Go.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
You really don't have to take me to the doctor. It's really nothing.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
If you could diagnose yourself, then we wouldn't need any doctors anymore.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Don't be too stubborn. Let's go.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
If you resist, I'm gonna carry you to the doctor.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Rak!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Toon!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Long time no see. I need to recharge.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
How did you get here?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That's too formal.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I haven't seen you for a long time,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you should have asked me how I am, or said that you missed me.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.000
Something like this.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Toon, this is Diao. He's the house owner.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
This is Toon, my friend.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I was more than his friend.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Nice to meet you.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Nice to meet you too.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Diao said that he had a stomachache. I'm about to take him to see the doctor.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You can come back later.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Let's get going.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.500
Rak!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's you! I bought you some snacks.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.000
You said that you like it.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.000
Thank you / Wait

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
You have a guest, I'm sorry.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Who's she?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Her name is Toon, Rak's ex.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Hello, I'm Dao. I'm the landlady.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Hello, so you and Diao are husband and wife?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You must be joking. Because if you're not, you're about to be beaten.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I'm his sister.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.000
I see.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Diao said that he had a stomachache earlier.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Can you take him to see a doctor?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.000
Rak and I have a lot to catch up.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You should go taking care of your guest. Don't worry about Diao. I'll take care of him.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Thank you.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Which one is yours?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Over there.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Thank you again / Sure.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Let's get inside. I haven't seen you for so long. I missed you so much.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Let's go. Your stomach hurt, right?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I'm fine now.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Did you really have a stomachache? Or did you just want to mess with Rak?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I was just messing with him.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I forgot to give him this.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Hello, Jum? You're back?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I went to see you earlier but you weren't there so I came back home first.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Alright, I'll go now.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Okay. Bye.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Can you bring this to Rak? I'm gonna go have a chat with Jum.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
If I went to give him this, would he think that I was jealous of him?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Nope. I don't even to go but Dao asked me to.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
But if I went inside, he'd think that I was a jealous type.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Here's some water.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I don't want it. I want to recharge.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Dao asked me to give this to you.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Wait a second.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Thank you.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
You should have come a little bit closer,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.000
so he wouldn't have to walk to you and I could get more of this.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Dao didn't take you to see a doctor?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I feel better now. No need to see a doctor.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
How often do you have stomachache?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Not too often.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
But I think you should go see a doctor, in case you're suffering from dyspepsia.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Can we discuss about Diao later?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.000
He's living across from here, isn't he?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But I live so far away. You should pay attention to me.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It means that she wants me to go.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
What should I do to keep staying here?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
But why do I have to stay?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I want to be away from him.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I need to go. I need to go.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
But if I leave, then they're gonna be alone.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
What should I do?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Diao? Diao?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I think it's not your stomach that gets hurt, it should be your brain.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
You should go to see a doctor and have it checked.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.000
Toon!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I was being so blunt. You should know about it by now

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
that I want to be alone with him.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
What do you want?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Nothing.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Good, then please.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Okay.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Please, can I recharge for more? I need more.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Are they gonna do anything?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
She seems to be flirty. Can he resist her?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Why do I care about him? I should control myself.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Stop thinking about him right now. Stop it!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Do you think Rak's house is too quiet?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
His ex returns like this? Do you think they're gonna repeat their history?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It's none of your business.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:42.000
It's not. I just want you to feel like you should have a girlfriend too.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.000
Think about it. If Rak had a girlfriend before you,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.000
and he brought a girlfriend here just to mock you. Would you accept that challenge?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Here's iced chocolate from Uncle Jod's café.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.000
You should have some so you could feel better.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
What do you want?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.000
You said that you had a headache so I canceled my date just to see you here.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Stop lying already. You're here because your boyfriend went out tonight.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
So did you. Pom canceled your date so you crawled right back to your friends.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.000
Stop fighting already.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You both are liars.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Get out of my way.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.000
I'm gonna invite you to Move On Bar.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So I can tell you about Rak's briefing. Let's go.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Dao, do you want to join us?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Get out of my way. I'm not talking to you.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I'm gonnn join online prayer session with my new boyfriend.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
He's a religious person.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.000
Bless you.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.000
Bless you.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Your sister's gone to the angel side, you should join the dark side instead.

00:21:00.001 --> 00:21:03.000
This is called Yin-Yang, the way of balance.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.000
Let's go / Change your shoes.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Hello, Suttirak.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.600
Hi.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Who's this bitch?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Her name's Toon, she's Rak's ex.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I see. She's the one that Rak refused to pick up her call earlier.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
They're staring at me devilishly. Would they fight with me?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Hello.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Hi, I'm Daisy. This is Kanom.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
It's Kanomthai.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.000
We work for Suttirak.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
It's nice to meet you, Daisy, Kanomthai.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Please don't look at me like that ever again. I thought you two were gonna slap me.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
My name's Toon. I'm Rak's ex girlfriend.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Excuse me. Let's go.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Wait.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
What is it?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Why did I call him? It's none of my business about his whereabout.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
What's going on?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Nothing. I was just gonna say that please don't come home late. I'm gonna go to bed early.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.600
And I'll shut the gate.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Don't worry about me. I have a key.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
That's right.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Excuse me.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
You think so? / I think so.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Wow!

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Hello, mister. Who're you with tonight? You wanna buy us more drinks?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Stop pretending to be drunk.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.400
It's because of you. You refuse to go to the club with us.

00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.000
So I have to fake it.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.000
That's right. Why didn't you go there and stay here at the old place instead?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
It's hurt to hear the word old.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.000
Are you hoping to see someone?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Nothing.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.000
You two said that you're gonna brief me about the project.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
How could we hear anything if we go to the club?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Let's hang out here, right?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Well, how could I say something else.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Are you waiting for someone?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Nope.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
He said he didn't wait for anyone so stop asking questions already.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Hello, Diao. Hello, Uncle Jod / Hello.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Where are you going?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.000
Somewhere only I know / What?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
It's my friend's place. Somewhere I want to go.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
The teacher told ทำ to work with my classmates for extra credits.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.600
I see.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
You failed again? You need my help?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Thank you. But I don't think you can help me with this.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I'm not failing English, but I fail social studies this time.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.000
You're not home like this, Rak must be lonely being home alone.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I should spend the night with him.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Stop right now. You have a boyfriend already. Let it be my job.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Somebody already fulfills this position.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Who's that?

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.000
It's Toon. She just had a fight with her boyfriend so she asked to spend the night here.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Well, I think I have to go now. See you all later.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
When did Toon and Rak come back home?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
You've waited for them for too long.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
That's right. Wait! No, I didn't

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Fine / Fine !

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Toon had a fight with her boyfriend and she spends the night at her ex's like this.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Are they gonna do anything?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
None of our business. You and I should go to Move On already.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.000
I'm not going. But you should go. I'm tired.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
It couldn't be clearer than this. I think this is it. / I think so too.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
This is not the first time that Joe did this to me.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
He always chooses his friends over me.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
When we were together, you didn't have time for me.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
But at least you spent your time focusing on your career and for our future.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Joe is different. He chooses his happiness, like his friends or playing games.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Where do I stand in his life?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
What's wrong with her neck? She keeps leaning on him.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And he lets her do that? Push her head back.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I think you should calm down.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
When you both calm down, maybe you could talk about it.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
It won't happen. Joe kicked me out like that.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I'm so lucky to have you.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Thank you for letting me stay. I really have nowhere to go.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
There're hotels. You can't think of that?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
And you let anyone stay? Don't you feel bad for the owner?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
But he can do that.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I think you should stay at your mother's.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I feel bad about this.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
So he thinks about me.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
I don't want my mom to worry about me.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Can I stay here? It's for one night. I have something to do tomorrow and it's around here.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.500
Please.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I really don't want to stay in a hotel.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
If you feel bad about it, I could sleep on a couch in front of your house.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
You don't have to.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
You can stay here.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Thank you.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
You're so soft just like that? You can't keep up with her trick.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I'll be right back.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
You should take a shower so you could feel better.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
You can wear my clothes. Just pick whatever you like from my closet.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Thank you so much. You're my safe person.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
You've never changed.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Thank you so much .

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Which one? / This one.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Hello, mom? I'll call you back.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Is it good reception here?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You sneaked out to have a call here.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
That's right. You should try.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Or were you eavesdropping on me and Toon earlier?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
What eavesdropping? I'm about to scold you.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
You let the stranger stay at the house and you didn't even let me know.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I'm sorry. She just broke up with her boyfriend.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
So she asked to spend a night here.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I didn't have a chance to ask you first.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Can I let her stay here for one night?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
She just broke up with her boyfriend and you took her to spend a night here.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Don't you think others would see you as the third party?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Are you worried about your home or me?

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
My home, duh?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
What if Toon's boyfriend knows that she's here and he follows her here?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
My home would be in trouble.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Don't you worry. I'm not gonna let it trouble you.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Toon just asked to spend a night and she'll leave tomorrow morning.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:33.000
To make you feel better, I just want to tell you that Toon and I sleep in separate rooms.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
She stays in Rit's room and I stay in mine.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Why did you tell me this? It's none of my business if you're sleeping on the floor, on the couch or in the kitchen.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Sure.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Be careful of what you do.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
If Toon went back to her boyfriend, you're the one who'd be sorry.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Thank you for caring about me.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
I didn't care about you. I just don't want you to feel useless.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Wait, I let them alone in there? Will Suttirak survive the night?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Toon seems to be a flirty type.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
What if he couldn't survive the night, who am I to get in their way?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I'm nothing to him.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Stop thinking about this and go to bed already.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
See? Toon is about to take advantage of him.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
What should I do? If I let her do this, he won't be survived for sure.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Get out of here!

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Get out of here!

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Get out of here!

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Get out of here!

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Get out of here!

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
What happened?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I…I was out here to get my clothes and then I saw snake.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.000
So I smacked these to scare it.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
What clothes? I don't see any.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
It's because of Dao! She kept the clothes inside and didn't tell me. I thought she didn't do it.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Sorry for waking you up.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I'm not asleep.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
You're not? What're you doing then?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
We were about to do something but we heard someone hitting something so we didn't start.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:25.500
Toon!

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
I was just kidding.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Toon came to my room and asked for charger cord.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I was overthinking about this?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Let's go back to bed. I'm tired.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
But before going to bed, can I be recharged?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Did you know that Rak's shoulders are the best place for my recharge.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.000
When I'm upset about something and I lean on his shoulders, I suddenly feel better.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Let's go back to bed. I'm tired.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:14.000
But I need to lean on your shoulder for a little bit longer so I could get a good night sleep

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You go ahead. I need to talk to Diao for a while.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Fine, but hurry back. I'm gonna wait for you in bed.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Good night.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
She likes to make jokes like this.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Don't take it seriously.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Don't say that you're a jealous type.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Nope. I just don't want to see Toon's boyfriend come here to fight with you.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I see, you're not jealous but you're worried about me.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Wait.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Good night, baby.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Damn it. He makes my heart skips a beat again.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Can Rak keep up with her trick?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Stop thinking about him already. Go to bed.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Toon!

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
You shouldn't have cracked a joke in front of Diao like that.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
He could misunderstand the whole thing.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
You're caring about him too much. Do you have a crush on him?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
I didn't have a feeling for you anymore. But I've observed his reaction and I think he's jealous.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
It's nothing like that. He's just worried about his house.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
When there's a stranger coming to his house, he often comes to check like this.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.000
Don't pretend to be innocent . Even I know what it is, you could see this too.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
So, do you have a crush on him or not?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
What? / What?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Fine, I'm not nagging you about this anymore. Will you be lonely tonight?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
If so, I could keep you company.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Toon!

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
I was just kidding. I know that we can be just friends.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I'm back but not to get you back.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
My heart was just broken and I can't move on that fast.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I'm not that easy.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Or should I start to be easy from now?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Hey!

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
It's just fun teasing on you.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
But I don't think that I'm wrong about Diao.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:06.000
If he's still mad at you tomorrow, then I think he's jealous.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Where's my charger? / It's here.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Sweet dream / Sweet dream.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Welcome.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
What is it? Why did you call me?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Please have a seat.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I can stand up.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Please have a seat.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
What do you want?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I just missed you so I wanted to see your face.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Wait. Please sit down.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Toon's gone.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Why did you tell me this?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
In case you want to know.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Why would I want to know?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
You didn't want to know? But you kept spying on me several times.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
I didn't spy on you.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Fine. You didn't spy on me.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Did you really scare the snake last night? By hitting washing bowls?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
That's right. You think I chased off something else?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
What if Toon wanted to get back to me?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
What do you think?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
You couldn't think of this by yourself?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
She was just breaking up with her boyfriend for one day and now she wanted to get back to you the next day?

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.000
Is this the kind of girl you want to date?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Thank you for this.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what you think of me.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I have a crush on you too.
