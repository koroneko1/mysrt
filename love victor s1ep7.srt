and calm down?

No, I get it. It's your job.

‐ Is that grilled cheese?

‐ Yeah. The food at this party sucks,

381
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,627
so I snuck into the kitchen
and whipped one up for you.

what happened between us?

It was a mistake.

‐ Well, you asked me to come over.

Okay, and... ever since then,

396

you've been acting like
it never even happened.

397

You know, if you didn't like me,

398
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,265
then how come you called me up
in the middle of the night‐‐

399
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,808
‐ Because my mom called me.

400
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,313
Um, yeah. The night we...

401
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,483
...you know, uh, my mom called me.

402
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,069
She didn't even say anything,
but I knew it was her.

403
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,991
And we just stayed on the phone
in silence for like...

404
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,452
a minute, and then she hung up.

405
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,956
In some screwed up way,
I think it was her version of a goodbye.

406
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,586
I just needed to feel something else,

407
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,213
so I called you.

408
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,801
I'm sorry, Andrew.

409
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,640
I mean, you were just a very bad idea,

410
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,099
on a very bad night.

411
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,648

all this drama with Nathan.

from your math class,

415
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,915
or Nicole from chemistry class?

Sorry, there's a lot of Nicoles
in Creekwood.
