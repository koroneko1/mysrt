00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.660
Are you crazy, Dang?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.180
Why are you so stress when we fight with those weakly guys.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.900
What if we faint because of over practicing?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.380
Contempt, complacent is self-picking the losing.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820
You're crazy, everything have really been there, in front of our eyes.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.380
You are scared about those music guys, right?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.480
But I'm not either.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.800
If you don't like, you can go home now

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.700
I won't stop you.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.140
Crazy.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.660
If you can, come and rob my ball

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.020
Here... hey, what are you doing? Give it to me!

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.460
Or... you intend to keep lying on my body?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
Not at all

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480
As if I liked lying on your body

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.980
Episode 4: All of us are trying to move forward

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.100
Oops... I have stomachache.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.940
You... you are having a stomachache

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.380
I will take you home... Brother, please stay here.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.340
Teacher... Why are you here?

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.060
I must be the one who ask that question

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.300
What time is it that  you are still singing here?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.260
We... We are only practicing together.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.380
But teacher...

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.340
Can you do not tell their parents, please?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.620
Because of me, I'm the one who begin all.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.900
If you want, please fine me alone.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.420
Of course I have to fine you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.300
Only because I haven't known how to fine until now.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.860
But... Don't you parents give you the money?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.700
That you have to get a part-time job like that

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.420
Not like that, teacher.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.300
Only because of money matters of our club.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700
Besides, we wanna decrease the burden for Lam

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.700
Or you see.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.660
It's not sure that we will win if we fight.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.740
You are too silly

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.220
How much are you given when you keep singing all night like that?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.700
And how about your studying?

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.000
Only today

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.920
From tomorrow, don't go and sing like that.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.420
About the money matters, I will find the way to solve it

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.850
But | Not "but" anymore

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
It will be OK

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.400
And now...

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.900
Stand up, I will take you home.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.660
What a perverted girl!

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.420
Why are you too conscious when you come in a boy's room?

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.820
You behave as if you are a teen girl.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.200
As if we are strangers.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.160
But you? There is nothing to look at.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.700
Why not? At least, I also have 2 snails.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.840
It's so terrible | Hey...

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.440
Don't underestimate your brother

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.120
At least, I'm also a No.1 hotboy in school

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.520
Many girls lust me but can not.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.440
Eat it back...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.760
They seem be blind all...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.760
But... Why are you so docile these days?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.820
You are always home.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.100
I am out of money, then I'm home. That's all

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.520
Because our club is in a trouble time.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.520
So... do you wanna find the money?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.140
Who don't want money? But how to find it?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.520
Hey... Don't tell me that I have to do that thing

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.120
I will never do that thing

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.080
I sell my art but not sell my body...

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.600
My god, god... Are you crazy, Lam? Are you having illusion, Lam?

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.800
What is illusion? | Godness...

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.740
Wanna earn money? Get dressed and go with me...

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.710
Where?

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.080
Well... Go then you will know. Quickly, I give you 5 minutes

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.920
5 minutes right?

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.040
Thanks for taking me home, teacher

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.880
You're welcome, come in your home then take a shower and sleep early...

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.400
For going to school tomorrow.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.280
So... teacher have to be careful.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.640
You come in home first then I will go

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.040
And... I forget that thing... | Don't worry

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.700
I won't talk it out. Don't you believe me?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.580
That's not my mean

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.700
So, please let me go up to my home.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.180
But... I also have to fine you

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.660
Tomorrow, after practicing, let's go to my room.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.660
Yes

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.020
Wow... I don't think that you can keep patience like that

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.860
Oh! Thao... Because you said that you will come so I wait.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.500
And this guy...

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.180
Introduce to Khoi

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.180
This' my boyfriend.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.820
The girl who goes out this time

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.020
need to take boyfriend along

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.020
Is it right, Oppaaaaa?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.940
Right? | What?

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.800
Oh, yes... right!

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.240
I thought that you were single!

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.700
That's only your thinking

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.120
But... This is the true.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.280
So why do you still agree to date with Khoi here?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.640
Because of you, you keep messaging to me all day.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.820
Too annoying.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.380
So today I take my boyfriend to tell you

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.740
That

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.340
I have got a boyfriend already.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.540
Khoi are very good... But I'm very regret!

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.360
I know

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.600
So... Ok... Bye Khoi

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.220
We go, Oppa

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.910
Oppa... OPPA

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.460
Opps here
