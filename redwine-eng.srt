1
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,166
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,583
You're making me blush.

3
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,500
Something wrong?

4
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,958
No, nothing's wrong.

5
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,250
I love you, Tee.

6
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,458
Yes, I know.

7
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,416
You can go now.

8
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,708
Can't I stay?

9
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,125
Tomorrow is the weekend.

10
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,500
No, you can't.

11
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,458
I want to be alone.

12
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,333
Well...

13
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,750
I'll go then,
but I'm coming back tomorrow.

14
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,708
You don't have to.

15
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,500
You don't have to come here anymore.

16
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,666
I'm a guy.

17
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,541
I'm not gay.

18
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:48,083
Don't ask me why we did this
or bring up what we've done.

19
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,666
It was just sex.

20
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,791
I just wanted to cum.

21
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,166
And I think...

22
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,708
I can do it with anyone.

23
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,750
It doesn't have to be you.

24
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,208
And because you're always around,

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't have a girlfriend.

26
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,083
All my friends have been asking
what we are.

27
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,416
"Am I gay"?

28
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,750
The fact is, I'm not gay.

29
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,541
Do you understand?

30
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,083
-You don't love me anymore, do you?
-It's not that.

31
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,500
I think...

32
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,916
I never loved you at all.

33
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:18,000
Asking myself if I'm tired

34
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:25,041
Asking myself if I'm hurt

35
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:31,000
Every time I hear that song

36
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:36,833
The song you used to play

37
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:43,250
When you left

38
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:49,708
You left all I've done from my heart

39
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,916
No matter how much I love you

40
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,833
How much I love you

41
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,916
TEE: ARE YOU FREE THIS EVENING?

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,291
TEE: LET'S MEET AT THE PARK

43
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,291
Hey, Wine.

44
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,458
Tee admitted to us that he is gay.

45
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:15,125
And he was telling us that he loves you.

46
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,625
Yeah, so he wants to meet you
this evening.

47
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,750
-Where?
-That abandoned building, street side.

48
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,250
Why that place? It's scary.

49
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,916
Well, maybe he wants some romance
with you. To do what lovers do.

50
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,916
Another thing is...
He said the view up there is stunning.

51
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,250
I think he wants to see it.

52
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,958
Anyway, you don't have to be worried
about us having found out.

53
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,500
We're fine with it. We won't tell anyone.

54
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,875
No matter what happens,
Tee's still our friend.

55
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,458
Hey. He said that he really loves you.

56
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,666
Do you think Wine will go
to that building?

57
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,166
I don't think he will go.

58
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,000
Too scary.

59
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,958
Someone committed suicide
hanging himself there.

60
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
It was on the news everywhere.

61
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,958
But I think he'll go.

62
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,333
He really loves Tee.

63
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,916
Forget the ghosts! All he cares about
is if Tee's going to stop loving him.

64
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,291
I don't think he'll go there.

65
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,500
He doesn't love me.

66
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,250
He doesn't really love me that much.

67
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,208
Really?

68
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,250
But when I told him that you loved him,

69
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,625
you know,

70
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,666
his face was like he was dreaming.

71
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,291
I guess he was probably chased by ghosts
and has jumped off the building already.

72
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
Why are you guys pranking him like that?

73
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,958
Why not? Are you worried about him?
Are you loving him for real?

74
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,500
You said it was for fun.
Now it's real, isn't it?

75
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,958
Real my ass. Fuck off.

76
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,500
I don't love him.

77
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,250
I don't care whether he lives or dies.

78
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,208
WINE

79
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,125
6 MISSED CALLS

80
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,875
OK, let's wait a second.

81
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,750
He will make another fucking call.

82
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,541
Don't you pity him and answer his call.

83
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,416
Otherwise, you lose.

84
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,916
I know you want to answer Wine's call.

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,291
If he calls again

86
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,291
and you want to talk,
answer his call, Tee.

87
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,500
You should answer his call.

88
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,666
If something really happens to him,

89
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,291
we're all screwed, you know?

90
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,541
WINE

91
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,083
Fuck! Tee!

92
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,583
You're the man!

93
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,500
I believe you now
that you don't love Wine.

94
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,583
Well... If it were me,

95
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,541
I wouldn't leave my friend hanging
like that.

96
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,250
-You're the real deal, Tee.
-Guys.

97
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Can you all leave?

98
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,250
-I'm so sleepy. I need to sleep.
-Oh.

99
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,833
What the hell is going on with you now?
I'm not sleepy yet!

100
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,916
Then go back to your room.

101
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,625
I want to sleep now!

102
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,625
Go! Get out!

103
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,875
He wants to sleep now.

104
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,750
Don't be stupid. Hurry up!

105
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,666
Let's go.

106
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,333
I'm leaving now.

107
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,250
See you, man.

108
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,375
Hey, Tee. Do you need me to stay over?

109
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,041
It's OK. You can go.

110
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:04,541
MISSED CALL - WINE

111
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,125
Help.

112
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,333
Help.

113
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,375
I'm starving.

114
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,250
I'll pray for you.

115
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,375
But I'm leaving now. You're scaring me.

116
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,375
I'm not dead.

117
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,083
I'm not a ghost.

118
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,916
So, where are you?

119
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,541
Help...

120
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,708
Help.

121
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,125
I can't see you.

122
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,083
Now you can't really say
that you're not a ghost.

123
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,250
Help.

124
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,375
Help.

125
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:04,958
You!

126
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,833
Hey, you.

127
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,291
I'll get some food for you.

128
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,208
Thanks.

129
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,250
Don't be long.

130
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,250
I'm afraid of ghosts.

131
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,833
I thought you were not coming back.

132
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,833
Thank you.

133
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,291
Here you go.

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,708
Have some congee. It'll give you energy.

135
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,625
Eat it.

136
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,750
Hey!

137
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,875
Drink some water.

138
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,541
Hey!

139
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,791
What's wrong with you?

140
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,833
I don't know.

141
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,625
Maybe you haven't eaten anything
for too long.

142
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,666
Your body might need time to adjust.

143
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,458
Let's try something else.

144
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,458
Eat this banana.

145
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,500
You.

146
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,458
Hey, you!

147
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,875
Wake up. Hey!

148
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,541
What's wrong?

149
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,541
Oh my God.

150
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,500
What should I do?

151
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,625
Should I get some help?

152
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,458
We need a doctor.

153
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,500
Ouch! It hurts!

154
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,583
Ouch.

155
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,750
Hurts...

156
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,666
Hey.

157
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,208
Ouch, it hurts.

158
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,875
What the hell are you doing?

159
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,500
Why are you sucking my blood?

160
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
It makes me feel better.

161
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,500
I think I can drink blood.

162
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,791
I don't throw up after drinking it.

163
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,000
Can I drink your blood a little more?

164
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,125
Are you crazy? What kind of human
are you, drinking blood?

165
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,250
Or maybe...

166
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,791
you're not human!

167
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,250
-Maybe you are...
-I am what?

168
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,708
In Hollywood movies,

169
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,541
a person who drinks blood for living is...

170
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,500
a vampire.

171
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,000
No way.

172
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,125
I'm not a vampire.

173
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,500
If I was a vampire,

174
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,958
I would have some kind of power
like in the movies.

175
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,875
But I have...

176
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,083
no energy.

177
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,791
I feel like I'm dying.

178
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,458
That's true.

179
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,708
-Do you have fangs?
-Do you see any?

180
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,541
See?

181
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,833
No fangs.

182
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,541
Since when did you start drinking blood?

183
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,958
I don't know. Why can't I...

184
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,875
Why can't I remember anything?

185
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,458
So, who are you? Where do you come from?

186
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,458
How old are you?

187
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,833
And what's your name?

188
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,916
Name?

189
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,583
What is my name?

190
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,583
Where am I from?

191
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,583
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

192
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,041
So, you're a vampire with amnesia then.

193
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,416
Can you stay here for a while?

194
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,541
I can't really take you back home with me.

195
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,791
What about a hospital?

196
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,625
But you will need blood after all.

197
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,875
Maybe the police?

198
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
But you have amnesia.

199
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,833
What should we do?

200
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,833
What if I share your photo
on some social networks?

201
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,708
In case someone knows you?

202
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,416
But that could make you a freak.

203
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,750
Not good.

204
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,166
What should I do?

205
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,000
I can live here.

206
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,833
But, would you come to see me every day?

207
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,750
I'll come to see you every day, of course.

208
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,250
Who else is going to feed you?

209
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,791
Are you gonna let me drink
your blood again?

210
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,708
Like, every day?

211
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,750
What if I drink it all?

212
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,083
Would it kill you?

213
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,208
I don't know.

214
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,625
I can drink just a little bit a day.

215
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,083
Just to get energy so I can move around.

216
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,458
And your body can take time
to produce blood.

217
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,916
Sound good?

218
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,333
I don't know.

219
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,250
How is it, Wine?

220
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,000
Do you like it?
Is it OK for you to live here?

221
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,833
It's a bit old.

222
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,166
It's fine. This room is huge.

223
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,541
I think it's too big for me, even,
but I like it.

224
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,083
It's old but also classic.

225
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,541
I'm happy that you like it.

226
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,833
What were you and your parents
fighting about,

227
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,916
that you wanted to live by yourself?

228
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,791
The same old problems.

229
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,375
My home is a gambling house. So boring.

230
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,166
There are always strangers everywhere.

231
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,875
And they are so loud. I can't study.

232
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,458
Besides, my mom always forces me
to buy stuff for them.

233
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,166
I don't like it.

234
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,583
I understand you, Wine.

235
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,291
But do you understand me?

236
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,791
Well... I do.

237
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,916
So, would you do it with me today?

238
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:33,000
You know that I have been waiting
for this. I love you, Wine.

239
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,250
I have loved you
since before anyone else did.

240
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,625
Before you yourself ever loved anyone.

241
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,166
Let me kiss you.

242
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,291
Can you get up and walk?

243
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,250
I can't.

244
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,833
Just moving...

245
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
makes me feel terrible.

246
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:47,833
Here.

247
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,583
You can drink my blood then.

248
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,583
Ouch. It tickles.

249
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,166
Come on, when is blood going to come out
if you're just sucking like that?

250
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,000
I've got no fangs.

251
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,833
I don't want to bite you.

252
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,375
I don't want you to get hurt.

253
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,875
What are you doing?

254
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,500
Does it hurt?

255
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,250
Of course it hurts.

256
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,541
But if I don't do this,
we'll never get out of here.

257
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,083
Suck it.

258
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,250
Thank you.

259
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,208
Is this your home?

260
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,750
It looks like...

261
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,541
nobody lives here.

262
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,250
No, it's not my home.

263
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,291
And nobody lives here.

264
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,125
That's why we moved in here.

265
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,500
Well...

266
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,041
is the owner OK with that?

267
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,791
What are you looking at?
You're making me nervous.

268
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,500
I like the color of your eyes.

269
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,583
Red, like rabbit eyes. So cute.

270
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,958
I really want to know...

271
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,541
who you are,

272
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,291
and where you come from.

273
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,416
How old you are.

274
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,625
Where you studied.

275
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,291
If you are seeing anyone.

276
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,333
If your lover is a guy...

277
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,375
or a girl.

278
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,000
Mm. I want to know, too.

279
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:50,166
I'm think your parents, your loved ones,
and the ones who care for you

280
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,250
are probably looking for you.

281
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,750
I think so.

282
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,333
Why can't I...

283
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,833
remember anything?

284
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:05,125
I feel like I have just been born
again into this world...

285
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:11,416
since I woke up in that building.

286
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,250
And you are the first one I saw.

287
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,750
And you are...

288
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,375
also the first one who saw me.

289
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,291
Have you ever had sex?

290
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,541
I don't know.

291
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,125
So...

292
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,375
can I have sex with you?

293
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,083
Whatever makes you happy,

294
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,833
I'll do it.

295
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,375
You saved my life.

296
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,916
Your blood is in my body.

297
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,375
You and me...

298
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,041
are like the same person.

299
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,375
Thank you.

300
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,083
So, let me call you...

301
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,125
Night.

302
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:33,083
-Is it OK?
-OK. I like it.

303
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,583
My name is Night.

304
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,625
-And what's your name?
-My name is Wine.

305
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,583
-We are boyfriends now.
-Mm.

306
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,541
I'm now your boyfriend, Wine.

307
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:17,875
Hey! Night!

308
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:54,750
Wine!

309
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,875
Wine! Wake up, Wine!

310
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,041
Wine!

311
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,583
I'm sorry.

312
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,125
Wine! Wake up!

313
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,208
Wake up! Wine!

314
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,333
Why are you yelling?

315
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,291
I feel exhausted today.

316
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,083
Let's sleep.

317
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,625
-Hello, Boy.
-Are you back at our place?

318
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,500
Can I go see you tonight?

319
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,916
I won't be there tonight.

320
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,708
My mom called me to come home.

321
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,708
It's the weekend tomorrow,
so I have to stay home to help her.

322
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,625
OK, then.

323
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,916
So, if you're free tomorrow, text me.

324
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,916
I will pick you up.

325
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,500
I miss you.

326
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,166
I want to hold you. I want to kiss you.

327
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,625
Sure.

328
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,958
Do you miss me?

329
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,666
A little.

330
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,583
Boy...

331
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,625
My mom is calling me now. I gotta go.

332
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:38,250
PORK, CHICKEN, AND COW BLOOD

333
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,833
Come! It's dinner time.

334
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,583
Let's try the first type of blood.

335
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:48,916
It's chicken blood.

336
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,041
Drink it.

337
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,916
Wow, you can drink it.

338
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,666
How was it? Are you feeling OK?

339
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,750
It's OK, right?

340
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,250
Let's try the second kind. Here.

341
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,500
It's pork blood.

342
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,333
Taste it.

343
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,750
Well...

344
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,666
Let's try the last one.

345
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,000
Cow's blood.

346
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,375
Try it.

347
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,333
You might able to drink it.

348
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,416
Please try a little bit.

349
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,500
Come on.

350
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,375
Just a little.

351
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,583
Night?

352
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:06,875
Night!

353
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,666
Night! Are you OK?

354
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:09,916
Night?

355
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,541
Why did we have to come here?

356
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,166
You told me once

357
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,083
that you wanted to have sex
in strange places.

358
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,416
Don't you remember?

359
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,375
Yes, of course.

360
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,916
I didn't mean to make you remember
everything I said.

361
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,375
I remember everything...

362
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:39,375
whether you meant it or not.

363
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,625
Thank you.

364
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:46,041
-But...
-But if I hadn't told you

365
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,166
that I would post our photos
and clips online,

366
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,958
including our sex clip,

367
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,541
and the clip where you told me
you loved me,

368
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,916
you wouldn't have come to see me.

369
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,666
Why do you say that?

370
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:05,083
You're always like this. You always
make your own assumptions.

371
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,666
But you told me you love me the way I am.

372
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,208
At least, we used to love each other.

373
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,625
Do me a favor today.

374
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,208
So we have something good to remember.

375
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:24,791
Just one last time.

376
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,000
And then I'll delete all the photos...
and all the video clips.

377
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,750
I'll delete everything about us.

378
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:36,875
All right, Tee?

379
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,500
All right.

380
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,625
I used to feel good about you.

381
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,208
-Does it hurt?
-No.

382
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,750
It's exciting. I like it.

383
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,416
What are you doing?

384
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,375
I want to take your blood.

385
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,708
It will hurt a bit.

386
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,125
-Stay still. You might break the needle.
-No way. You can't take it.

387
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:54,875
Let me go! This is not funny. Let me go!

388
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,166
Tee! I said quiet!

389
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,208
Don't scream! Don't move!

390
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,708
Are you insane, bitch?

391
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,708
You're getting mad
just because I don't love you?

392
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,833
It hurts me, too, lying to myself.

393
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,458
Let me go! I love you, you know that!

394
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:09,958
Do you hear me? Let me go!

395
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,750
I love you, all right?

396
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,125
Liar.

397
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,083
I don't want this.

398
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,791
I don't want this anymore.

399
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,291
I'm tired.

400
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,291
I've lost all my energy.

401
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,458
Please let me die.

402
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,250
I don't want your blood anymore.

403
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:04,583
I promise...

404
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,583
I won't trouble you again.

405
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,458
Stop saying that.

406
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,166
I'm not troubled at all.

407
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:16,750
Please, try again.

408
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,333
I promise.

409
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,791
If this doesn't work,
I won't force you anymore.

410
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,875
Please, do it for me.

411
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,333
If you die,

412
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,458
all the effort we have put in
will be meaningless.

413
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:36,208
You mean so much to me.

414
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:42,458
I want to live for you, Wine.

415
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,291
Do you like it?

416
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,083
Like you, Wine?

417
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,416
I don't.

418
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,083
I love you.

419
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,958
No, I didn't mean me.

420
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,083
I meant...

421
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,583
the sex we've just had.

422
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,083
I don't know.

423
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,958
I don't know if I had sex before.

424
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,875
I don't know
what I should compare it with.

425
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,166
I just know that...

426
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,166
it was...

427
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,833
the best of my life.

428
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,625
It was the best of my life, too.

429
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,125
I love you, Night.

430
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,541
I will do anything

431
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,125
to keep us together forever.

432
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,958
Thank you...

433
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,750
for seeing a dying person
as worth something.

434
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,625
And the blood I just had...
what animal did that blood come from?

435
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,625
How come it worked with my body?

436
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:35,291
It was buffalo blood.

437
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,291
I stopped by a market

438
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,666
and saw someone selling it,
so I bought it.

439
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,375
Tomorrow, I'll go back to tell them
that I will need it every day,

440
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,208
so they'll prepare it for me every day.

441
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,083
That's wonderful.

442
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,708
The buffalo is the loveliest animal
on earth, isn't it?

443
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,333
Hey, Wine!

444
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,416
Have you seen Tee?

445
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:34,208
-No, I haven't.
-Did he call you?

446
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,375
-Why should he call me?
-We tried calling, but his phone's off.

447
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,833
His parents are looking for him right now.
Aren't you worried about him at all?

448
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,875
-Why should I be worried about him?
-Gosh!

449
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,500
What the fuck is wrong with you? Let's go.

450
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:54,333
If he doesn't care about Tee,
we will go search for him ourselves.

451
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,208
Eat something, Tee.

452
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,250
Please, eat.

453
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,500
Why are you doing this?

454
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,291
Are you angry at me?

455
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,583
Do you hate me that much?

456
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,916
I'm sorry for saying I never loved you.

457
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,291
The truth is I do love you.

458
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,416
But I don't know what to do,

459
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,458
because I'm not gay.

460
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,625
And I never saw you as a man anyway.

461
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,250
Please eat, Tee.

462
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,125
I can't let you die like this.

463
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,916
Wine.

464
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,916
My head hurts.

465
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,666
I got you some pills.

466
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:32,458
Have some, and you will feel better.

467
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,416
My arms and legs are hurting, too.

468
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,750
Maybe my blood isn't circulating well.

469
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,625
Can I change positions?

470
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,000
No.

471
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,541
Wow.

472
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,875
Looks like you're a great player.

473
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,000
You've done it so many times, haven't you?

474
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:06,208
"Great"? I haven't made any shots.

475
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,958
Come on. Just keep trying.
You'll get there.

476
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,958
Here. Drink this.

477
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,208
Cheers.

478
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,125
Please hold the glass for me.
I'll go to the restroom.

479
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:28,625
Wait a second.

480
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,500
Don't be long. I miss you already.

481
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,666
That's too sweet!

482
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,041
Excuse me.

483
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:47,833
My name is White.

484
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,375
You look familiar. Have we met somewhere?

485
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,666
My name is Night.

486
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,916
But... Have we really met
each other before?

487
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,666
Night...

488
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,791
Well... the person I know,

489
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,083
his name is not Night.

490
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,666
Never mind. Forget about the name.

491
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:11,750
I think I like you.

492
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,166
Can we be boyfriends?

493
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,250
Wine!

494
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:29,875
Come here.

495
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,041
This is Wine. He's my boyfriend.

496
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,041
I love you.

497
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,333
I love you, too.

498
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,791
I love you very much.

499
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,208
Ouch!

500
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:31,791
Wine!

501
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,333
Wine?

502
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,041
Wine!

503
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:04,000
Wine!

504
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,125
Wine! Where are you?
I'm right at the door.

505
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,416
Are you trying to surprise me?

506
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,916
I'm home helping my mom today.
She called me.

507
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,333
Oh.

508
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,916
Really?

509
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,666
See? Now you're upset
because you never trust me.

510
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,125
And you always think
that I don't care about you.

511
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:50,541
-Everything is always my fault, right?
-No!

512
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,375
I never thought like that.

513
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:55,166
It's my fault
I came to surprise you today.

514
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,875
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

515
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,250
I promise.

516
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,041
All right?

517
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,500
Don't be mad at me, OK?

518
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,375
All right?

519
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,208
All right.

520
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:10,875
But you need to promise me that next time,

521
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,666
you will wait for me to call you
when I'm ready.

522
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,958
Gosh... Wine!

523
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,583
You're so mean.

524
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,958
We can talk via chat like usual.

525
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:25,166
But to meet up, I need to make some time.

526
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,958
That's what I mean.

527
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,958
Mm, OK.

528
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,458
I'm feeling better now.

529
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,875
Boy, my mom's calling me now. I gotta go.

530
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,625
Just now...

531
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,708
there was someone knocking at the door.

532
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,125
It was like...

533
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:29,875
he was trying to break into our place.

534
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,750
I was about to open the door,

535
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:35,625
but I couldn't move.

536
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,208
The sun was burning me.

537
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,916
I never thought it could be that hot.

538
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,750
It was burning me out.

539
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,458
Remember this.

540
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,875
If it's not me,

541
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,416
don't open the door.

542
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,541
It's dangerous.

543
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,666
You can kill me, please.

544
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:31,666
This is painful.

545
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,500
This is torture.

546
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,750
I can't take it anymore.

547
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,250
All right.

548
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:43,958
I will kill you.

549
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,916
I will let you die...

550
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,958
only if you eat this first.

551
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,041
You should be happy for one last time
before you die.

552
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,125
Did you ever love me?

553
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,333
Never.

554
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,791
I never stopped loving you.

555
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,375
Liar.

556
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
You're saying that because
you want me to let you go.

557
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,375
I don't need to lie to you...

558
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,333
because I'm dying.

559
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,500
Do you remember?

560
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,583
In sophomore year.

561
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:57,333
Me and my friends were talking
at the back of the classroom.

562
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,458
We were so loud
that the teacher was yelling at us.

563
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,583
You...

564
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,458
You were sitting in the front row...

565
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:10,750
and you turned to see me
like in slow motion...

566
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,625
and you were stunned by my charm.

567
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,791
I knew that.

568
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,208
Honestly,

569
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,958
I felt like...

570
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,666
I'd fallen in love.

571
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,708
But deep down,

572
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,458
I was telling myself...

573
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,750
not to love you.

574
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,958
"It's impossible."

575
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:53,000
But I couldn't help it.

576
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:57,458
Every time you came close to me...

577
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,791
I knew that you knew...

578
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,791
because you loved me, too.

579
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,041
Am I right?

580
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,250
Night.

581
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,625
Why are you sitting here?

582
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:52,541
I saw you went out to buy blood,
so I wanted to follow.

583
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,291
But you were walking too fast.
I couldn't follow you.

584
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,250
So, I was waiting for you here.

585
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,541
Move over. Let me sit with you.

586
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:11,166
Next time, don't follow me.

587
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,500
You might get lost.

588
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,125
All right.

589
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:19,250
Hey...

590
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,458
I can remember something about me now.

591
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:23,666
-I was...
-Wait.

592
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,708
Don't tell me.

593
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,125
I'm afraid.

594
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,791
I'm afraid that one day
your memory will come back,

595
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,041
and you will leave me.

596
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,666
I promise you,

597
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,333
no matter what my past was,

598
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,875
I will never leave you.

599
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,625
What about you?

600
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,791
If you know my past,

601
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,791
will you leave me?

602
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,208
I will never leave you.

603
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,708
So... you can relax.

604
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,541
What I can remember is...

605
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:13,500
I can sing and play a guitar.

606
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:16,833
Really?

607
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,708
Damn...

608
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:20,583
I was depressed!

609
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:24,625
I thought you were going to tell me
that you were married with kids.

610
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,291
How come?

611
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:32,958
I was just afraid.

612
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,250
Wine!

613
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,250
Wine?

614
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:08,250
Wine.

615
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,666
What are you looking for?

616
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,750
We've wandered around
too many garbage dumps already.

617
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,291
Have you ever believed in something
so strongly

618
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,125
that it really happened,
just like a miracle?

619
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:24,916
I used to believe that I would one day
find someone I really loved.

620
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,083
Loved like I could die for.

621
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,541
And that person would love me
the same way.

622
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,208
And then I found you.

623
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:37,333
But now I believe that...

624
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:39,458
if I keep looking,

625
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,666
I will find a guitar for you to play,

626
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,500
and you will sing a song for me.

627
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,125
And I found...

628
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:51,208
-this!
-Wow! You really found it.

629
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,666
But it doesn't have any strings.

630
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,291
Oh... you're right.

631
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,791
Wine.

632
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:31,708
I believe that...

633
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,375
if we believe in something strongly,

634
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,250
miracles will happen because of our trust.

635
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,458
That's why we met.

636
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,666
Because we think the same.

637
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,666
So...

638
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:55,666
even though this guitar
doesn't have strings,

639
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,083
I will still play it...

640
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,208
and sing a song for you.

641
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,041
And you will hear the guitar.

642
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,875
Do you believe me?

643
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:12,375
Yes, I do.

644
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:36,708
Please, don't ask me why

645
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:40,375
When your heart can't deny

646
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:46,625
Better let it be

647
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:54,125
Please, know that someone
Can do everything

648
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:59,625
Just for you

649
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:04,791
Because I love you with all my heart

650
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:12,833
Nothing can stop me

651
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:19,916
Even it's wrong, I'll still do it for you

652
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:27,375
Make it worth it
Rather that disappointing you

653
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:34,333
If love can make this world so beautiful

654
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:42,250
You are the clearest proof to me

655
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:46,916
No matter how much I lost, I would accept

656
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,791
No matter how they misunderstood
I would let them

657
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:57,708
Just don't go away from me

658
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:03,291
Let you and your heart be here with me

659
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:30,333
Surprise! Happy birthday!

660
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,083
Today is not my birthday.

661
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:36,708
You forgot my birthday.

662
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:40,458
No, I didn't. It's my birthday.

663
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,166
I had to break my promise
not to surprise you here.

664
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:48,875
If I have to guess
whether you'll remember my birthday,

665
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,875
this will never happen.

666
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:54,875
I called you.
I texted and left comments for you.

667
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:58,041
You never answered. You know
that it was driving me crazy.

668
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,708
Happy birthday, Boy.

669
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:14,041
I'm really sorry

670
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:17,666
that I couldn't remember the birthday
of the most important person.

671
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,041
I don't have any gift for you.

672
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,875
Lately, there is so much going on
at home and school.

673
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,875
-Can you forgive me?
-No.

674
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,000
I won't forgive you.

675
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:37,708
Until...

676
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:43,083
Until you have sex with me the way I want.

677
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,250
-OK?
-OK!

678
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,291
-Not here.
-Oh.

679
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:20,708
Why?

680
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,708
It's exciting here. I like it.

681
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,958
I don't want anyone to see us.

682
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:31,916
Ah... shall we go to our place?

683
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:38,250
No, Boy. Our place is boring.

684
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:41,000
I have somewhere else more exciting.

685
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,833
I guarantee you will like it.

686
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,083
So good, my dear.

687
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:53,291
You know...you're the best birthday gift
that ever happened in my life.

688
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,708
I love you, Wine. My little boy.

689
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:10,666
What do you want?

690
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,000
Tee has gone missing.
Don't you want to help search?

691
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,416
Yeah. You said you loved him.

692
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:20,541
He's been missing for days. His parents
said he'd come back in his own time.

693
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:24,208
The police didn't believe us
and never filed the report. Fucking shit!

694
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,583
Oh! Look!

695
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,666
Are you guys blind?

696
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,875
Who would care about
a bad boy like Tee now?

697
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:35,041
Let's go.

698
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:38,125
I want you to be happy, Wine.

699
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,875
I want you to rape me.

700
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,958
You just read my mind.

701
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:26,833
I've always wanted to rape you, Wine.

702
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:30,916
Let's do it for real now.

703
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,083
I like it.

704
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:34,750
It's so exciting.

705
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,500
What you just said is...

706
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,208
really turning me on.

707
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,125
So...

708
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:56,125
Boy!

709
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:00,500
Boy! Let's me go! Boy, don't do it!

710
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,750
Let me go, Boy!

711
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,750
Hey!

712
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,208
Wine! Stop!

713
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:15,916
Boy, stop it!

714
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,333
Boy, let me go!

715
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,250
Boy! Don't!

716
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,625
Please, be patient, Chart.

717
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,958
I understand the feeling.

718
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,416
When you or anybody sees me,

719
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,250
it's hard to resist.

720
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,708
It happened to everyone.

721
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,958
Wait for me.

722
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,458
Just five minutes.

723
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:34,791
Wine?

724
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,833
Wine!

725
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,000
Wine. Are you OK, Wine?

726
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,083
Wine!

727
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,458
I'm starving.

728
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,125
The buffalo blood tastes funny today.

729
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,125
Maybe a different buffalo.

730
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,625
It shouldn't be much different.

731
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,583
It still comes from a different buffalo
every day.

732
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,000
But today it might just be...

733
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,416
an older buffalo.

734
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:02,958
Hey.

735
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,750
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

736
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,500
Let me give you a hug. You'll be OK.

737
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,708
Wine.

738
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,583
What have I done wrong?

739
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:27,625
Why did you bring someone else
to our place?

740
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:32,000
-You said it was just for the two of us.
-Hey!

741
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:34,708
I don't know who the fuck you are
or where you're from.

742
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:37,416
I don't care
if this room belongs to anyone else.

743
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,291
What I know is, Wine is mine.

744
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,333
I love Wine and he loves me.

745
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:43,166
-We love each other, OK?
-Wine.

746
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,375
It's not true, is it?

747
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:46,291
Tell me the truth.

748
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,916
What I have done for you all this time...

749
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,333
-It never made you love me, did it?
-Wine.

750
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:53,375
Wine, tell him that you love me.

751
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:57,375
Tell him. Tomorrow I will tell my parents.

752
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,291
I will tell everyone at school
how much I love you.

753
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,083
I don't care what everyone says.

754
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:05,041
I don't care if they say I'm gay.

755
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,833
I just want you to tell him
that you love me.

756
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:16,208
Wine. I will ask my parents
to make a proper proposal.

757
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,625
We will get married. We will travel
around the world on our honeymoon.

758
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:23,416
If you want to go to university,
I will support you until you graduate.

759
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,250
Whatever you want in this world,
I will get it for you.

760
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,458
I will work hard for you, Wine.

761
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:31,625
Wine, don't listen to him.
You're not a money boy.

762
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,541
Don't you remember how we first met?

763
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,333
-Wine, listen to me.
-No! Listen to me!

764
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,458
Stop! Stop talking!

765
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,875
Night.

766
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:14,416
I'm sorry.

767
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,916
Night. Don't leave me.

768
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:39,416
Stay!

769
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,291
Wine.

770
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,000
What's wrong?

771
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,166
You're trembling.

772
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,333
A nightmare?

773
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,666
Yeah.

774
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,375
The worst nightmare.

775
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,958
I dreamt that you left me.

776
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,375
I couldn't take it.

777
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,416
I'm afraid that you're really leaving me.

778
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:03,791
I told you

779
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,333
that I will never leave you.

780
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:09,208
Trust me.

781
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:14,666
Sleep.

782
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:17,041
I will hold you all night.

783
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,375
Please let me die.

784
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,500
I can't take it anymore.

785
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:57,041
I'm sorry for what I've done to you.

786
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,791
But I've made a decision that...

787
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,041
I will go away with someone I love.

788
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,916
I will go somewhere...

789
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,208
far away from here.

790
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,791
Somewhere quiet.

791
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,500
I'll let you go...

792
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,791
if you promise me
that you won't tell anyone about this.

793
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:36,208
Can you?

794
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,000
Yes.

795
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,750
I promise.

796
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,000
Eat your meal.

797
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,583
When you regain your strength,
just run away.

798
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,791
Help!

799
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:58,500
Help! Help me!

800
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,208
Let me go.

801
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:08,875
Let me go!

802
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:22,666
Fuck you!

803
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,416
Let me go!

804
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,041
Listen to me.

805
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,583
I didn't mean to hurt you.

806
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:44,166
I just want your blood.

807
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:49,041
Just a lot of blood.
Because I have to travel a long way.

808
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,500
But I won't hurt you.

809
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,416
I won't kill you.

810
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,583
I know...

811
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:58,875
how much you love me.

812
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,291
Let me go!

813
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,500
Thank you so much.

814
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:08,291
And I want to apologize

815
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,041
that I can't love you.

816
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,958
No!

817
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:15,875
Please understand me.

818
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:19,333
I'll remove the duct tape...

819
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,083
if you promise you won't scream.

820
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:24,708
So we can talk nicely...

821
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:26,916
and you will understand everything.

822
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:29,000
Can you promise me?

823
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:49,833
Listen up, bitch!

824
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,541
I won't believe anything you say!

825
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:55,291
I played the fool all this time,

826
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,166
because I loved you.

827
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,583
But you were using me!

828
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:02,625
Fuck you!

829
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,916
Help!

830
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,375
Help!

831
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,333
Help!

832
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:19,875
No!

833
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,333
Dad!

834
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,041
Why are you doing this?

835
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:51,791
Listen to me, son.

836
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,833
I have to do it.

837
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,166
I love you.

838
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:03,625
I can't let you die.

839
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,958
How am I supposed to feel?

840
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:14,250
I can live if other people die?

841
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:19,958
Dad, you can't kill others
to make me survive.

842
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,291
I'd rather die.

843
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,541
You lied to me the whole time.

844
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,083
You lied to me that it was animal blood.

845
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:34,250
Dad, you never let me go out
to see the world outside.

846
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:36,916
You never let me see anyone but you.

847
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,375
Was it because I'm different?

848
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,291
Because I drink human blood, right?

849
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,791
What do you want me to do?

850
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:57,250
I love you, son.

851
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:03,875
Even if I had to kill
everyone in the world to save us,

852
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,125
I would.

853
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:08,500
To me...

854
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:11,416
you're not "different".

855
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,666
-I don't believe you anymore.
-Nam.

856
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:25,833
Nam. Where are you going?

857
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,250
Nam. Come back!

858
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:28,958
Nam!

859
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:49,791
Dad?

860
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:51,625
Dad!

861
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,625
Dad, wake up!

862
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:57,125
Dad?

863
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,375
Dad!

864
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,250
Wine.

865
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:31,958
Why did you do this?

866
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,125
Night.

867
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,125
I'm sorry.

868
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:53,041
I love you. I don't want you to die.

869
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,416
But I can't live my life...

870
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,375
by taking the lives of others.

871
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm sorry...

872
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,916
for making you do the wrong thing
for my sake.

873
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,708
I love you, Wine.

874
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:04,666
Don't look for me.

875
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,958
When I'm ready,

876
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,000
I'll find you.

877
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:19,041
And believe me...

878
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,625
we will meet again someday.

879
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,666
All right?

880
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,375
Please.

881
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,833
I'm sorry.

882
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,625
I'm sorry. Night.

883
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,708
I'm sorry.

884
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,583
Night. I'm sorry.

885
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:20,125
And you're still holding that guitar?

886
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,333
Can you really play?

887
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:35,291
I can't.

888
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:39,875
But I believe that holding it like this
will bring you back to me.

889
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:44,500
Come on.

890
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:46,458
Let me play it for you.

891
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:54,250
Please, don't ask me why

892
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:58,333
When your heart can't deny

893
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:03,583
Better let it be

894
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:10,583
Please, know that someone
Can do everything

895
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:15,416
Just for you

896
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:19,375
Because I love you with all my heart

897
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:25,166
Nothing can stop me

898
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:32,041
Even it's wrong, I'll still do it for you

899
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:37,708
Make it worth it
Rather that disappointing you

900
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:44,000
If love can make this world so beautiful

901
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:50,750
You are the clearest proof to me

902
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:53,791
No matter how much I lost, I would accept

903
01:41:53,875 --> 01:42:00,000
No matter how wrong they understood
I would let them

904
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:03,416
Just don't go away from me

905
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,875
Let you and your heart be here with me
