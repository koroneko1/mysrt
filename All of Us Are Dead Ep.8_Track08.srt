328
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,410
-What does SOS mean?
-It's a distress signal.

329
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,080
I know that. What does it stand for?

330
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,291
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

331
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,918
That makes no sense.

332
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,587
[On-jo] That's just how it is.
It doesn't mean anything.

333
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,672
Then rescue quickly…

if you're not gonna believe me?

I thought you'd know.

I do know. Look it up.
You'll see I'm right.

00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,061
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have a phone.

What?

340
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,525
I asked On-jo what SOS mean,

341
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,319
and she said it doesn't mean anything.

342

Just say you don't know next time.

Well, it's true.

It's true.

-Mm-hm. She's totally right.

What?

353
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,179
Are you sure SOS doesn't mean anything?
Isn't it supposed to be an acronym?

00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,307
-You don't believe me, either?

I was always second.

But it's okay now.

I think I was able to come in second,
because of Nam-ra.

Hey. Second's good too.

Who is she?

Do I know her?

You.

816

[scoffs]
Hey. Stop that.

819
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,083
He doesn't mean it. He's just kidding.

Ever since I was six years old,

826
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,270
I've always liked you, On-jo.

[Hyo-ryeong] You're the only one
who didn't know.

-[Wu-jin] I didn't, either.

838
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,205

You don't have to like me back.

Please don't.

844
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,184
I did it.

845
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,479
I said it all, so it's all good.

846

How is it all good? You're a jerk.

You were my best friend.

I-sak's gone and now you're gone too.

Would you please leave?
