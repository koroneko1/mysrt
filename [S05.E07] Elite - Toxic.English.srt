1
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,880
Benjamín and Armando
were running a network

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,960
that trafficked the data of people
who are powerful and influential.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,600
And? Why ask me about it?

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,440
Do you know anything?

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,079
No. Of course I don't.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, then.

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,000
Could you obtain evidence
that might implicate Benjamín in this?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,880
What?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
You have a rapport with Benjamín.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
He places a great deal of trust in you.

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,600
Maybe you can think of
a way to obtain information.

12
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,439
I no longer make deals with the police…
considering last time I got burned by it.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,159
Right.

14
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,679
You know, the prosecutor has agreed
to close your case if you collaborate.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,599
You help us,

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,719
Benjamín goes to jail, and you don't.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,400
Was your strategy
to let me rot in there?

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,200
Because mine was to rely on you.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,239
And you will still be able to rely on me.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,159
I promised you that
you wouldn't have to worry about anything

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,519
for the rest of your life.

22
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,840
You attack me for liking guys,

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,439
and it turns out you're gay?

24
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,319
Calm down, dammit!

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
We were drunk.

26
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,960
You guys also mess around
when you're drinking.

27
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,400
We drank, we let ourselves go,
and it happened. End of story.

28
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,240
End of story, my ass!

29
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,840
I opened my heart to you.

30
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,560
I told you I had feelings for him.

31
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,039
You wanted me to forget him
because you were jealous?

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,159
Iván, that's not the point!

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
You've been after me
since we met.

34
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,319
You didn't get me, so you went all crazy?

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,879
And believed it was a good idea
to go after my dad?

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
What for? To get revenge on me?

37
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,400
-You're not the center of my life.
-Yeah. Yeah, I am.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
You'll drive everyone around you crazy
to get whatever you want.

39
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,840
You lie, and you manipulate.

40
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,120
You can be so poisonous, Patrick.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,159
So, I manipulated you, huh?

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Did I also poison you
so you'd come looking for me?

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Listen.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,240
Man, I swear to you,
you better not come near me

45
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,080
or near my dad or near anything
that has to do with my life again.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,520
I don't want you around, Patrick.

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Samuel?

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,919
Samuel?

49
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,719
Samuel? Samuel, hold on!

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,759
Well, at least now you finally realized
you can't trust the Nazi, can you?

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't know
if I can trust the police.

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,759
Plus, I have no idea what the fuck
they even want me to find on Benjamín.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,919
A computer file labeled
"my shady dealings with Armando," or what?

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,240
-Holy shit.
-What?

55
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,159
Mencía.

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
What about Mencía?

57
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,120
Mencía said she found a SIM card
in the phone Armando gave her

58
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,039
that implicated Benjamín
in some suspicious shit.

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Wait, hold on. What?

60
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,800
Here's the deal.

61
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,479
That SIM card's at his house somewhere,
or it's here at the school.

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,639
So, it's up to you.

63
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,599
You have to make up with
the wannabe marquis, partner.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,159
Just to sneak into her house?

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Not to dredge up shit,

66
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,240
but that's exactly what you did to me
when you played me. Or pretty much.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,120
I'll make up with her,
sneak into her house,

68
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,319
and who will search here?

69
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,240
I know someone.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Where are you going?

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
Is this an apology or…?

72
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,519
Yeah. I acted like an arrogant asshole.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,399
You've done a lot for me.

74
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,199
And, I don't know,
this whole thing's been such a big mess.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Can we maybe start over?

76
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Tonight, you're gonna sneak into
Benjamín's office

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,839
and look for that SIM card.

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,439
What?

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Cayetana, you have access to everything.

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,600
Especially the security guards' uniforms.

81
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,600
It's for Samuel, to get justice.

82
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,480
Please.

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,319
Phillipe?

84
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,959
You have less than a minute to reply back

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,040
to one of my 700 messages that I sent you
before you'll be looking me in my eyes

86
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,399
and having to explain yourself
to me in person.

87
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,480
Isadora. Hi, uh, well,
we just wanted to ask you a favor.

88
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Sure. What is it?

89
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,600
We're planning a getaway
to, uh, to Ibiza this weekend,

90
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,800
and we're lookin' for VIP passes
to your club.

91
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,439
Okay, sure. I'll arrange it.

92
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,120
-Thank you so much.
-Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
-Hi, Isa.
-Hello.

94
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,079
I was just buying something.

95
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,879
What's up with
all this ghosting all of a sudden?

96
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,079
What ghosting? No, I'm just really busy.

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,240
Talk later, okay?

98
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,240
No, no, no, honey.
We'll do this right here.

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,079
What's the matter, Phillipe?

100
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,279
I thought you'd fight
for me like I fought for you.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,600
First, let's see if you can stay clean.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,920
I mean, one day's fine,
but it means nothing.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
What? Hold on.

104
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,480
Do you remember the person
that defended you against the whole world,

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,920
when the school was screaming
that you were a rapist? Remember her?

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,759
I'm that girl, Phillipe.
I decided to believe you.

107
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,560
You "decided"? What do you mean by that?

108
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,879
What are you telling me?
You don't believe me?

109
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,639
So, first, you lie to me,
convincing me that you trust me.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
Now I should simply trust you back?

111
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,439
I'm not gonna fight for a junkie

112
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,959
who's plastered in makeup and glitter
to cover the aching void she's got inside.

113
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,959
Look at you.

114
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,920
You have no one.

115
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,360
It's pathetic.

116
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,040
Try not to die of an overdose.

117
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Please have some class, Isa.

118
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,800
Good morning.

119
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,160
How are you?

120
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,160
Look, I know I really blew it
during our night together.

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,639
I think you mean our last night.

122
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,000
But…
…is there any way I can make it better?

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,959
I feel like… I feel like I didn't make
the best out of our final opportunity.

124
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah.

125
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,600
Um, Iván, the thing is,
Samuel's come back.

126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
He's talking to my dad.

127
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,080
So, no, it's impossible.

128
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
We're gonna go back to normal. All right?

129
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,600
We're planning another meeting
with the lawyers next week.

130
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,399
They're gonna try to get you
a good deal, but I won't lie to you.

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,039
-It'll be hard.
-I'm aware.

132
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,200
But I want you to know…

133
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
…in case it's not clear,

134
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,840
that I am tremendously grateful.

135
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,320
I know that.

136
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,799
Benjamín, what do you say

137
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,759
we talk more about this
tonight at your house?

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,279
My house? Why?

139
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,000
Figured we'd be more relaxed there.

140
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,200
We can talk about it over dinner

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,159
with Ari.

142
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
And with Mencía and Patrick, of course.

143
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
We can hang out together
as if things were really… back to normal.

144
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,840
If that'd be all right.

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,799
Of course. That sounds perfect.

146
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,720
Great.

147
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,639
Aren't you worried that…

148
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,120
that what we have now
might just be a kind of mirage?

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,320
I don't know.

150
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,960
Just, sometimes I feel

151
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,080
like our relationship will never work,
no matter how hard we try.

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,639
Well, I don't know. I have no idea.

153
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,799
But I mean, if it's just a mirage,
we'll have to enjoy it while it lasts.

154
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
-Mencía.
-Hmm?

155
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,240
And

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Rebeka.

157
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,600
Both of you.

158
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,480
Uh, Samuel's coming over
for dinner tonight, and, um,

159
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,559
I was thinking that,
if it's okay with you,

160
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,000
I'd extend the invitation to Rebeka.

161
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
Sorry, what?

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,039
I don't think I've thanked you enough
for what you've done for me and, well,

163
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,720
and for your family.

164
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,639
So, I think it's only natural
that your significant others

165
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,799
feel as much at home
at our place as at their own.

166
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,600
Uh, Patrick seeing anyone now, or…
What am I saying?

167
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,240
No, no. Of course not.

168
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,039
Okay, well, let me know what you decide.

169
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,399
What just happened there?

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Hello.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,679
Hi.

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,120
What's wrong? Are you okay?

173
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
As good as you, judging from your face.

174
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
Oh, really? Great. Is it that obvious?

175
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,720
Phillipe?

176
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, I guess.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,159
Kind of. Maybe a little.

178
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,759
Don't know.

179
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,679
And you?

180
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't know.

181
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,559
It's complicated.

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Painful.

183
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,720
Complicated and painful. I don't know.

184
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,919
Right now,
all I want is to get outta here.

185
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,639
Leave this school, Madrid, everything.

186
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,120
Hmm, trust me.
I understand you perfectly, babe.

187
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,159
Know what?

188
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
Let's bounce.

189
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
-Wait, what?
-Let's go.

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,559
Far, far away.

191
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,679
From Madrid, from this school,
from all these mediocre losers.

192
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,320
I mean, look at us.

193
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,159
We deserve to be so much more.
That is what we're gonna make happen.

194
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,879
-Let's go.
-What? Where to?

195
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,039
Do you trust me?

196
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,039
-Yeah, but--
-Let's go.

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey, guys.

198
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,000
-Hey.
-Hi.

199
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Uh, did you manage to,
uh, get the passes for us?

200
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,519
Mm, no. No. I got something much better.

201
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,919
Let's go.

202
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Come on!

203
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Attention, my dear passengers.

204
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,320
You better make sure
you buckle up super tight

205
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,639
because we're gonna be in for
a bumpy little ride to my empire.

206
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,080
'Cause, babes, we're going to Ibiza.

207
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,679
Hello!

208
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
Hi, my babies.

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Hello. It's so nice, so nice, honestly.
It's so nice to be home again.

210
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,399
And tonight, we'll take flight
like we always do.

211
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,559
I missed you guys like crazy.
I love you so much, everyone!

212
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,039
Shit.

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,159
Hello?

214
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
Hi.

215
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,759
I need to fly to Ibiza.

216
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,399
Jet or helicopter.

217
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,919
Immediately. Understood?

218
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Go, go!

219
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,360
Yeah!

220
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Tonight is ours. Just you and me, okay?

221
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Let's go, Ibiza!

222
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,000
When we come back after Easter,
we could maybe expand the debate team.

223
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
That way, we could participate
in international competitions,

224
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,039
and not just within Europe.

225
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,000
-What do you think?
-That's cool.

226
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,920
Patrick, mind being present with us?

227
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,839
Benjamín, why don't you just pretend
I'm not here and look after your guests?

228
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,079
Okay, I think that's enough now.

229
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,039
Hey, hey, hey.
I said leave me the hell alone!

230
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,359
Dude!

231
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,599
Oh my God, Patrick!

232
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,279
-What's wrong with you?
-Patrick.

233
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,680
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, thanks. Uh, um, I'm sorry.

234
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,319
-Get out of my face!
-Patrick!

235
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,240
-What is the matter?
-Patrick!

236
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,400
-Let's talk about it.
-I said no.

237
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,359
I don't know what's goin' on with my son,
but a father is allowed to be worried.

238
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,279
I mean, isn't he?

239
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,039
Go downstairs.

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
That's awesome, dude.
The office was upstairs, right?

241
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,200
Hurry. You get the card,
and I'm gonna say--

242
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,720
I just hate to see them like this.

243
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
Samuel,
are you starting to puss out?

244
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,119
A stomachache. That's what you have.
That's what I'm gonna say. So--

245
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,119
They're broken. I don't want them
to have to suffer anymore. Got it?

246
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
Oh, great. Would you rather go to prison?

247
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,279
No. But I also don't want to destroy
his life and tear apart his family.

248
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,000
Relax, man. I'll go.
You keep drinking and sitting on your ass.

249
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,519
Leave it. Hey, Rebe.
Stop it. Get back here.

250
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,440
You think that's normal?

251
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640
These violent outbursts,
just because of some boy?

252
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,559
Actually, I do. It's called being in love.

253
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,319
It's called hyperesthesia.

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,920
I could use
a little bit of empathy from my father

255
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,039
because I need someone to listen to me!

256
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,319
Is that too much to ask?

257
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,359
Okay, well…

258
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,000
tell me what…
So what is up with this boy? Who is he?

259
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,039
Is it Carvalho?

260
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,880
He hates me right now.

261
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,920
And why is that? What'd you do?

262
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,640
So, you're just assuming
that I'm the one to blame here?

263
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,000
Patrick, no one hates anyone
for absolutely no reason.

264
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,279
What did you do to him?

265
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,640
Nothing.

266
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
I went all out to meet him, and

267
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:36,880
we connected.

268
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,440
He toyed with my heart, jerked me around.

269
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,319
We hooked up,

270
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
and now he's over me.

271
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,960
I still don't see
any reason for him to hate you.

272
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,720
Because now he's over you?

273
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,640
Because I'm an idiot.

274
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,079
I fall in love
and give it my all, and they run.

275
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,759
You scare them off,
which isn't surprising,

276
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,920
given your obsessive-compulsive nature.

277
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,319
So, he ignored you,
and you threw a tantrum

278
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
and did something impulsive

279
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,720
to get back at him and get him
to pay attention to you. Right?

280
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,799
What'd you do to him?

281
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,480
I slept with
someone very important to him.

282
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,079
But it was 'cause I was really feeling it…
and 'cause he was over me.

283
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,119
What?

284
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,920
You realize this
is self-inflicted, don't you?

285
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,920
You're surrounded by people
who would do absolutely anything for you,

286
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,920
and you,

287
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,200
with your… your narcissistic ego,

288
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,559
all you do is hurt them.

289
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,039
I mean, hurt us because I'm including
myself and your sisters in that.

290
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
Patrick,

291
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,079
whenever you need me, I'll be here.

292
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,839
I do hope that at least you realize that.

293
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,559
But, son, you have to grow up.

294
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,759
I'll sort it out by myself.

295
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,599
But thanks.

296
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,440
-Thank you!
-Having fun? You're welcome, sweetie.

297
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,519
This is so sick!

298
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,759
I mean, it's legit. Seriously, dude.

299
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,240
Hey, everyone!
Let's move the party over to my suite.

300
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,240
-Let's go!
-Is… Is there a hotel here?

301
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,720
Honey, this place has everything.
It's Ibiza, baby! Let's go!

302
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,880
Go, go, Ibiza!

303
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,319
Oh shit.

304
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,599
Looking for this?

305
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,400
Did you get back together with me
so you could sneak into my house?

306
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,759
No.

307
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,279
I got back together with you
'cause I love you.

308
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,200
Oh, yeah?

309
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,279
But that has nothing to do
with wanting to help Samuel.

310
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,519
And to help Samuel avoid jail,
I need that card.

311
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,400
Are you seriously asking me
to betray my family for you?

312
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,839
Or for Samuel?

313
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,319
Fucking hell, Mencía.

314
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,319
-You're jealous of Samuel?
-This isn't about jealousy.

315
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,279
No. It's because you all lie.

316
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,079
Now I have no idea who to believe.

317
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
That's the problem here.

318
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,920
Because I just keep getting
slapped in the face over and over again.

319
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,039
-Menci--
-No.

320
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,240
Don't you dare call me Menci now, okay?

321
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,160
Don't you dare.

322
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,720
I just want my friend to get justice.

323
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,960
Because Samuel could wrongfully go to jail
for helping your family.

324
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,039
If you love me, you'll hand it over.

325
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,960
You wouldn't ask me for it
if you loved me, Rebeka.

326
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,440
I love you. I do.

327
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,440
You know that.

328
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,759
It's so hot here.

329
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,759
Okay, let's…
let's take all our clothes off.

330
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,839
Come on. Ciao.

331
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,359
-Baby, baby, baby.
-Huh?

332
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
Look at me. Look. Are you all right?

333
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,079
Don't worry.

334
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
-Just…
-What?

335
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,839
I'm just coming down. Comin' down.

336
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,400
Mm'kay. That means
you have to take some more.

337
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,680
-Okay.
-Yeah?

338
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,759
-All right.
-Mm.

339
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,960
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Mm-hmm. Okay, okay.

340
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,200
Whoo!

341
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,440
Just get…

342
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,160
…get outta my head.

343
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,119
Okay, well,
your brother went to take a little walk.

344
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
The fresh air will do him good.

345
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
-Something wrong?
-No.

346
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,119
Where's Mencía?

347
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,640
Mencía? Uh, no idea.

348
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
So, I'm actually really not feeling well.

349
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,759
I just got my period,
and I'm gonna make a giant mess here.

350
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,599
-Samuel, we'd better leave.
-Let's go.

351
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,960
No, please. Don't just leave.
I'll give you ibuprofen.

352
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,079
No, really. Don't worry. Honestly,
it wouldn't help. We should leave.

353
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,480
-Let's go.
-I'm sure there's nothing wrong with you.

354
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,960
Did you have a fight with Mencía?

355
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,559
No, we didn't. I told you,
I don't even know where she is. Samuel?

356
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,720
We're leaving.

357
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,720
Hi.

358
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,160
Excuse me?

359
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,440
Hold on, Samuel.

360
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
I'll be right there.

361
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
What's the matter now?

362
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,759
They just caught Cayetana
rifling through my office at the school.

363
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,680
What?

364
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,039
Okay, we have to go. Thank you.

365
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,039
-Everything was delicious, Benjamín. But--
-Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

366
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,799
-Did you two know anything about this?
-No.

367
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,599
No, we didn't know a thing.
Why would we know?

368
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,880
-Thank you again, seriously. See you.
-I'm sorry.

369
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm so sorry.

370
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,759
Isa, the doorbell!

371
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Are they kickin' us out?

372
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,119
No, no. 'Cause I'm the owner.
No one's gonna kick you out of here.

373
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,799
No one, so just chill out.

374
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,279
I'm going to see who it is. Okay?

375
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,759
Hey, what's the matter?
What's the problem?

376
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,920
Oh, sweetie.

377
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,960
You came! Come, come in here. Come on.

378
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,720
Does this seem normal to you?

379
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,640
What'd you say?

380
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,680
No. No, baby.

381
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,240
Honey, listen to me. Stop!

382
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,880
Baby. Wait. Baby, whoa.
I'm talking to you. Stop.

383
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,119
Not interested. Why'd I come here?

384
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,519
Because you care.

385
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,880
You care about me.

386
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,880
Love me?

387
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,839
Don't get cocky, all right?

388
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,599
I came here because

389
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,200
I can't watch you destroy yourself
and just stand by.

390
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,839
Right. I'll tell you what we'll do.

391
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,400
If you follow me in there,

392
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,599
then I swear…

393
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,440
Look at me.

394
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,119
I swear,

395
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,680
I will never do it again.

396
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,319
You know damn well
you won't keep that promise, Isadora.

397
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,799
Look at you.

398
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,640
Well,
if you really want me to quit,

399
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,559
then go in there and come get me.

400
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,279
EMPRESS SUITE

401
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,480
I don't know
what the fuck… 

402
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,920
…you did to me…

403
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,880
but this has never happened
in my fuckin' life.

404
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,240
I… 

405
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,359
Fuck.

406
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,519
I need you to disappear.

407
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,880
I need to fucking erase you,
once and for all, from my mind,

408
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,799
Patrick.

409
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,559
Shit. Just what I needed.

410
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,519
Iván isn't here.
I thought you knew.

411
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,240
I know.
That's why I came to see you.

412
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,599
That's a bad idea.

413
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,079
Cruz, I ran away from home.

414
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,279
Please.

415
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Okay, come in.

416
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,079
I'm sick of having the people
I care about end up hating me.

417
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,319
Iván adores you.

418
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,720
You know that.

419
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,279
Now, put yourself in his shoes.

420
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,319
He saw us together.

421
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,960
The best thing we can do is give him
some space until he clears his head.

422
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,920
-I'll give him space, then.
-You do that.

423
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,440
And you?

424
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,599
What about me?

425
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,799
Do you hate me?

426
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,319
Not at all.

427
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,279
What are you doing?

428
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,799
Well, then, since you don't hate me,
I don't wanna mess things up with you.

429
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,039
This is how you mess things up.

430
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,960
Stay away from me and Iván.

431
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,920
Please back off.

432
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,960
What's the matter?

433
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,680
Are you confused too now?

434
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,000
Or now you're thinking clearly
and want to push me away.

435
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,200
Honestly, I'm so disgusted with myself
that I can't look at myself in the mirror.

436
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,119
Why?

437
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,960
'Cause this can't happen again.
Understand?

438
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,519
Why can't it happen again?

439
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,279
What if it does?

440
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,880
I should stay away from you, Isadora.

441
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
You're more dangerous
than the drugs you take.

442
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,679
In the end,
you'll get addicted to me too.

443
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,480
I think she's unconscious.

444
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,519
Guys,

445
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,079
I think Isadora's passed out.

446
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,320
Come on, dude. Join us.
