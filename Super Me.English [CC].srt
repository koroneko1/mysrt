Instead, he focused on living
a fulfilling and simple life.

So he gave up ownership of all his work

Uh-huh?

00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,250
There are two kinds of people
in this world who succeed.

774
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,208
First group,

775
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,166
they're traitors.

776
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,958
They are willing to betray the things
that most people wouldn't.

777
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,458
These people betray friendship, love,
even family.

778
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,625
In exchange for their betrayal,

779
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,625
they get empty rewards they call success.

780
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,166
The other kind were called thieves.

781
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,333
Who think they're geniuses.

782
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:49,500
What else do you call someone
whose invention changes the world?

783
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,250
But they haven't really invented anything.

784
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,625
All of their inventions are discoveries.

785
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,041
Made in a different reality
that exists around us.

786
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,750
Usually, you can't see it or feel it,

787
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,541
but if you get the opportunity
to see that world,

795
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31,791
Now, this is what God intended.

796
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:36,125
Huh? He chose you
to use this power to help others.

797
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,125
I think I'm about
to get philosophical myself.

798
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,000
Throughout all of human history,

799
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:46,541
there are few principal factors
that have been a cause of misery.

800
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,708
There are natural disasters, obviously.

801
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,458
and then there is war.

802
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:54,375
So tell me, what's the main cause of war?

803
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,541
Isn't it poverty?

804
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:59,458
Therefore, if you eliminate poverty,

805
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,208
you eliminate war.

806
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,708
Seriously,
you could be the one who does that.

807
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,333

01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:32,125
together, they form the human psyche.

1170
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:36,416
In everyday life, the ego controls
how you see yourself in other people.

1171
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,875
But in dreams,

1172
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:41,375
it's the id that takes over
and reveals our animal desires.

1173
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:45,416
And then the super-ego,
the force that both holds the id at bay

1174
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,291
and keeps the ego
from getting carried away with itself.
