1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,604
Harper:
<i>Previously on</i> Secrets
of Sulphur Springs...

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,907
Who are you guys?
I'd know it
if you were campers.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,543
Uh, I'm Harry
and this is...

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,079
Um, Hermione.

5
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,680
Griffin:
<i>My dad said</i>
<i>he didn't know Savannah.</i>

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,215
He lied to me.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,184
It's every place
we felt a cold spot.

8
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,186
In the kitchen,
in the dining room.

9
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,888
There's a room
behind this wall.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,889
A secret room?

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,657
Ben:
<i>Probably boarded-up</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

12
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,393
(girl singing on recorder)

13
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,330
<i>* Under sugar maple shade *</i>

14
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,531
-(Ben exclaims)
-(music stops)

15
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,601
Griffin:
<i>Dad's been lying.</i>
<i>He knew Savannah.</i>

16
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,669
You got all this from Harper,
didn't you?

17
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,638
You and Harper
need to take a break.

18
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,307
Is that where you were today?
The Tremont?

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,408
Did you used to go
to camp there?

20
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,009
(scoffs)
Of course not.

21
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,512
You're wasting your time
on that freaky Savannah.

22
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,514
You must be new.

23
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,548
I'm Jessica,

24
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,717
but everyone calls me Jess.

25
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,453
Harper:
<i>My mother flat-out said</i>
<i>she never went to camp.</i>

26
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,522
<i>She's covering something up.</i>
<i>Just like your dad.</i>

27
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,889
(door creaking)

28
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,391
Griffin:
<i>How are we gonna</i>
<i>save Savannah?</i>

29
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,862
(door creaking)

30
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,331
Harper:
She's here.

31
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,137
Maybe we should
just throw it out?

32
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,471
No, no.
I can save it.

33
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,605
I just need...

34
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,875
Griffin. Perfect guy
for the job.

35
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,010
We'll put this thing
right in no time.
Won't we, bud?

36
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,847
All right.
I'll let you two guys
get to it.

37
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:21,949
(phone chimes)

38
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,520
Actually, now's not
a really good time.

39
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,089
Come on, Griff.
Let's show your mom
we can do this on our own.

40
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,191
It'll only take a minute.

41
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,126
What do you need?

42
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,728
Hold this straight
while I secure the base.

43
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,836
Looks good, huh?

44
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,538
Uh, yeah, sure.
Can I go?

45
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,039
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,576
(vehicle approaching)

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,218
Grandpa!

48
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,520
(chuckles)
Griffin.

49
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,590
What are you
doing here, Dad?

50
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,525
Better question, son.

51
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,160
What are you doing here?

52
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,898
Hey, go grab my bags
out of the car,
would you, Griffin?

53
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,533
I-- I would,
but I got to go.

54
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,268
Griffin,
help your grandfather,

55
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,571
though I can't imagine
he'll be staying long.

56
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,209
I'll stay as long as it takes
to talk some sense into you.

57
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,412
You shouldn't be here,
Bennett.

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,815
None of you should.

59
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,927
(theme music playing)

60
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,546
(objects clattering)

61
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,515
Wyatt:
It's not in here.

62
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,751
It has to be.
Look harder.

63
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,919
(clattering continues)

64
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,623
(door creaking)

65
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,825
-Wyatt.
-I'm looking!

66
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,295
(whooshing)

67
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,632
-Got it.
-(floorboard creaking)

68
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,271
(all scream)

69
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,706
You guys scared me.

70
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,308
We scared you?

71
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,443
Zoey:
Uh, what are
you doing here?

72
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,978
I thought you couldn't
come over anymore.

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,514
I snuck in to hang out
with Griffin.

74
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,584
What are
you doing down here?

75
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,687
No one else believes us
about Savannah's ghost.

76
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,722
So we're gonna catch her
on camera.

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,358
Just got to figure out
how it works.

78
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,060
Think it needs
a little cassette in there.

79
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,096
My brother's a geek
for that kind of stuff.

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,731
He can explain it better.

81
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,199
You should go find him.

82
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,836
You guys aren't supposed
to be down here.

83
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,037
Neither are you.

84
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,472
We won't tell Mom and Dad
if you don't.

85
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,809
Okay fine.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
-(footsteps receding)
-(door closes)

87
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,683
You don't think
they found the bunker?

88
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,785
No, but it'll ruin everything
if they did.

89
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,654
We have
to be more careful.

90
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,656
-Are you ready?
-Definitely.

91
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,959
We have to go back
and find out exactly what
our parents are hiding.

92
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,394
And fast.

93
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,029
When we felt Savannah's ghost
in your room last night,

94
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,032
I think it was her way
of urging us on, you know?

95
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,134
-Like she
wanted us to hurry.
-I know what you mean.

96
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,437
We don't have
much time though.

97
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,004
My grandpa just
randomly showed up,

98
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,906
and now we have to have
family dinner tonight.

99
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,107
You can't get out of it?

100
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,310
No way.
With my grandpa
being here,

101
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,245
my dad is acting
even weirder than usual.

102
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,549
I just don't get it.
As a kid, he was so chill.

103
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,018
What happened to him?

104
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,491
Why do you have
to be so bratty?

105
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,959
How can you be
so selfish?

106
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,495
Savannah:
I'm not being selfish.
I'm having fun.

107
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,729
You should try it sometime.

108
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:56,764
Jess:
Well, sorry if
my idea of fun

109
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,165
doesn't involve
stealing punch

110
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,733
and throwing it
around springs.

111
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,669
I mean, what if
you attracted
grizzly bears here?

112
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,003
Grizzlies?

113
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,538
In Louisiana?

114
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,073
Whatever!

115
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,541
You're going to keep
getting in trouble,

116
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,042
and you're going
to get Ben kicked out.

117
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,645
Ben can do what he wants,
and so can I.

118
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,948
Just because you act like
you're in charge
of everyone here, Jess,

119
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,884
it doesn't mean
you actually are.

120
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,658
Whoa, was that your mom?

121
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,260
Yeah.
She's a lot different now.

122
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,029
Griffin:
I'll go find my dad.

123
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,698
See if I can get him
talking about Savannah.

124
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,200
And I'll ask Jess.
I mean... my mom.

125
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,437
(exhales)
Man, this is so strange.

126
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,505
Tell me about it.

127
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,672
Do you think
she'll talk to you?

128
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,674
Don't worry.
I have a strategy.

129
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,410
Yeah.

130
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,412
Remember,
keep it subtle.

131
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,746
Way ahead of you.

132
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,785
(playing rock guitar riff)

133
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,763
Harry, what's up?

134
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,898
Get kicked out
of the hotel yet?

135
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,667
Not yet.

136
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,770
Why? You and Savannah
need help on your next prank?

137
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,772
As soon as we plan one,
we'll let you know.

138
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,107
What about
the camp dance?

139
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,809
You're probably
going together, right?

140
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,210
Nah.

141
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,947
Sorry. I thought
you liked her.

142
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,249
I mean, sure I like her.

143
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,017
Savannah's different,
you know?

144
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,186
Of course,
not everyone appreciates that.

145
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,394
Hey, you doing okay, Jess?

146
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,764
Do I not look okay?

147
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,667
Oh, no. You do.
I just-- I, uh--

148
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,735
I saw you and Savannah
fighting outside.

149
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,203
It was hardly a fight.

150
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,306
It was Savannah being
her usual obnoxious self.

151
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,477
Yeah, she was
pretty awful to you.

152
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,913
I know, right?
She thinks she's so cool but

153
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,882
it's so fake.

154
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,984
I can't believe
Ben doesn't see it.

155
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,752
Are you, um...

156
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,254
Are you jealous
of her and Ben?

157
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,924
Jealous?
Of Little Orphan Annie?
Please.

158
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,128
I just think
this place would be
a whole lot nicer

159
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,329
if she'd just...

160
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,766
like... go away.

161
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,640
(continues guitar riff)

162
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,274
What song is that?

163
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,544
Uh, just something
I've been working on.

164
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:24,945
You wrote that?

165
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,014
Uh, yeah.

166
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,317
I'm supposed to be practicing
for the talent show tomorrow.

167
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,285
My dad's coming,
and he wants me to play

168
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,122
something boring
and "classical."

169
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,256
I don't know.

170
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,326
(sighs)
I'd rather play
my own thing, you know?

171
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,894
Then you totally should.

172
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,796
That song you were playing
was awesome.

173
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,731
Really?

174
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,332
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

175
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,102
Uh, well, of course,
I actually need
to finish it first.

176
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,071
Uh, want to help?

177
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,174
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

178
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,079
(playing riff)

179
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,448
My mom was
definitely jealous
of Savannah.

180
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,450
Did you get
anything out of Ben?

181
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,485
Um, not a lot.

182
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,055
He showed me a song
he was working on, though.

183
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,290
I got to help with it.

184
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,259
Like actually helped
write it.

185
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,728
It was so cool finally getting
to play guitar with my dad.

186
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,297
Griffin! We're not here
to make friends
with our parents.

187
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,766
We're supposed
to save Savannah.

188
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,067
Yeah, I know that.

189
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,769
But Ben doesn't really seem
to be hiding anything.

190
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,871
We know he is.
Why else would your dad
be lying to us back at home?

191
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,405
Your mom lied too.

192
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,207
Which is why
I'm taking it seriously
when I question her

193
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,242
and not just giggling
over music together.

194
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,978
Ben and I didn't giggle.

195
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,313
You're just mad
that my dad, as a kid, is fun

196
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,148
and your mom,
as a kid, is...

197
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,784
kind of the worst.

198
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,953
We better get back.

199
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,755
Wouldn't want you
to miss dinner
with your fun dad.

200
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,626
(sighs)

201
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,262
Sarah:
I would have
fixed up the guest room

202
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,164
had I known
you were coming, Bennett.

203
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,266
-I hope it's okay.
-Oh, I'll make do.

204
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,868
Griffin,
we've been waiting for you.

205
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:55,969
Where have you been?

206
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,572
Just, uh...

207
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,974
Just doing homework.

208
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,142
All afternoon?

209
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,476
Good man, Griffin.

210
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:06,213
Study hard, rise to the top,
and do important things.

211
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,514
It's the Campbell way.

212
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,449
At least it was
until recently.

213
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,686
I am doing something
important here, Dad.

214
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,655
Don't you remember
what this place
used to be like?

215
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,123
All too well.

216
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,991
I'm worried that you're the one
with the faulty memory, Bennett.

217
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,761
You know, it's not too late
for you to go back to Chicago.

218
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,296
I can always get you
reinstated at the firm.

219
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,865
-You were doing so well.
-Ben: Dad.

220
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,299
Enough.

221
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,472
Kids, what are you
hiding under there?

222
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,976
We found it.

223
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,979
Hey, Grandpa,
you're really old.

224
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,381
Do you know how
to find something
called a cassette?

225
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,750
Wyatt!

226
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,484
-I am so sorry.
-It's okay.

227
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,988
So what are you hoping
to record with that thing?

228
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,257
-A ghost.
-Ah.

229
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,325
Savannah's ghost.

230
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,262
Savannah?

231
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,331
How many times
do I have to tell you

232
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,068
we're done talking
about ghosts?

233
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,619
You didn't say much
at dinner.

234
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,960
-What's going on?
-It's just...

235
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,664
Why are boys
so frustrating?

236
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,934
You talking about
any frustrating boy
in particular?

237
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,637
I hope it's not one
who lives in a certain hotel

238
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,107
that I most definitely
asked you to stay away from.

239
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,776
No, it's not Griffin.
Just...

240
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,845
boys in general...

241
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,446
can be so...

242
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,547
immature.

243
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,082
(chuckles)

244
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,351
Yeah, I remember
what that's like.

245
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,154
Come here.

246
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,428
Boys can make
you feel like you're crazy,

247
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,563
especially when
you have a crush.

248
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,701
Did your first crush
make you crazy?

249
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,871
If you count filling up
two notebooks
of Mariah Carey lyrics...

250
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,339
-(Harper chuckles)
-...then yes.

251
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,408
Um... How did it end?

252
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,344
Was it bad?

253
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,381
It ended the way
all crushes do,

254
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,284
with someone
getting crushed.

255
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,098
(door opens)

256
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,666
-(footsteps approach)
-(door closes)

257
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,008
Hey, Grandpa,
can I ask you something?

258
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,376
Yeah, sure.

259
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,612
Why are you so mad
at Dad for coming back
to Sulphur Springs?

260
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,114
Well...

261
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,684
I've always wanted
what was best for your father,

262
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,253
and sometimes we disagree
on what that is.

263
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,890
You think this place
is bad for my dad?

264
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,257
How come?

265
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,793
Well, look at it.

266
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,962
It's nothing but
a pile of old wood
and bad memories

267
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,931
sitting in
a backwater swamp.

268
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,366
No place for a Campbell
to end up.

269
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,637
Bad memories?
What kind of bad memories?

270
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,873
The past
belongs in the past.

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,741
Best to leave it there.

272
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,077

276

Topher, we heard
you were the guy to see

-You heard right.
-Great.

278
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,472
The sooner we get
Savannah's ghost on camera,
the better.

279
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,075
That's what the camera's for?

280
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,578
Your funeral.

281
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,115
Okay, now,
here's what you gotta do.

282
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:06,854
Sarah!

283
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,956
I see
you didn't take my advice

284
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,091
to get your family
out of that deathtrap
of a hotel.

285
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,227
Well, with my husband's
fix-it skills,

286
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,264
we've officially upgraded
from deathtrap to money pit.

287
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,769
Look, I know that
you asked Harper
to stay away from Griffin.

288
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,105
It's nothing personal.
Just protecting my daughter.

289
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,673
I completely understand.

290
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,442
It seems those two
are a bad influence
on each other.

291
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,612
I think it makes sense
to keep them apart,
at least for now.

292
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,984
Hmm. Might me easier to do
if there are two of us
keeping an eye out.

293
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,519
I'm glad
we're on the same page.

294
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,228
-I'm sorry, I--
-I was thinking--

295
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,464
Uh, look, I think
we can both agree

296
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,367
-yesterday was
kind of a bust.
-Yeah.

297
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,970
No matter what happens,
it's better when
we work together.

298
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,106
-As a team.
-Exactly!

299
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,341
And we definitely
still have work to do

300
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,543
if we really wanna find out
what our parents are hiding.

301
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,346
I wish we could
go back now.

302
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,847
How are we gonna
sit around all day,

303
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,483
learning about mitochondria
and eating bologna sandwiches

304
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,652
-when Savannah's life
is on the line?
-We're not!

305
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,254
I just paid Topher 30 bucks

306
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,123
to drop off notes
to the front office
saying we're sick.

307
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,425
So, are you ready?

308
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,569

309
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,439
What is this?

310
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,707
Griffin:
It must be that talent show.

311
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,477
Man:
Nice job!

312
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,079
Wow, what a talent!

313
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,680
Uh, next up...

314
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,517
Let's welcome
guitarist Ben Campbell
up to the stage,

315
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,954
playing <i>Greensleeves.</i>

316
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,890
I know I'm supposed to play
<i>Greensleeves,</i>

317
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,326
but instead,
here's something
I just finished writing.

318
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,033
(playing rock music)

319
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,536

(playing discordant notes)

322
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,071
Let's give it up again
for Ben Campbell!

323
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,240
(light applause)

324
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,579
Hey, hey, hey-hey.
You think I got off work
and came all the way down here

325
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,915
to listen to you
play that... garbage?

326
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,252
Clearly, sending you
to this camp
was a mistake.

327
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,054
You embarrassed me today,
Bennett.

328
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,156
You embarrassed yourself.

329
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,099
Wow! Has your grandpa
always been that mean?

330
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,667
Not to me.

331
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,703
Guess I've never seen him
alone with my dad.

332
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,074

Savannah's gonna win.

she's not gonna win,
my dad is.

355

I saw a picture of him
holding the trophy.

356
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,609
Maybe we changed things.

357
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,778
I did tell him
to play his own song.

Nope, just fixing a draft.

No reason.
