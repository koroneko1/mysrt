&lrm;<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.100
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.780
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

&lrm;[yawning] Finally!

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.900
&lrm;That villain was so tough!

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.020
&lrm;[sighs]

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.940
&lrm;-Good night, Tikki.
&lrm;-Mwah! Sleep tight, Marinette.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.980
&lrm;[radio]&lrm;<i> Rise and shine, everyone!</i>
&lrm;<i>Today is Heroes' Day,</i>

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.220
&lrm;<i>-a day when you too can be a hero.</i>
&lrm;-Heroes' Day?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.780
&lrm;I forgot to plan my good deed for today!

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.140
&lrm;And the fact you were up all night
&lrm;saving Paris isn't a good deed?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.420
&lrm;No, Tikki, because that was a secret
&lrm;and Ladybug's good deed.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.580
&lrm;Heroes' Day is when everyday citizens
&lrm;perform a good deed for others' benefit.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.860
&lrm;Come on, Tikki.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.980
&lrm;-Dad! Mom! It's Heroes' Day today!
&lrm;-Just like every year, sweetie.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.540
&lrm;I put one of every flavour in there,
&lrm;for each of your classmates.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.660
&lrm;Can't get much better than that
&lrm;in the good-deed department!

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.580
&lrm;You guys are my heroes!

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.660
&lrm;Ugh, Heroes' Day. We're already heroes!

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.300
&lrm;Come on! Let's go back to bed!

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.740
&lrm;Plagg, do you really have to eat that
&lrm;so early in the morning?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.300
&lrm;The fencing hall is booked for 6:05 PM
&lrm;and the Chinese classroom for 6:35 PM.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.900
&lrm;Remember you must make an appearance
&lrm;at the Heroes' Gala tonight.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.780
&lrm;I'll be there, for sure.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.620
&lrm;If it were to fail,
&lrm;I could never forgive myself.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.500
&lrm;You made a promise to your wife.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.300
&lrm;You've risked so much
&lrm;for the chance to bring her back.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.980
&lrm;Lila's harboured rage
&lrm;against Ladybug for months.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.180
&lrm;Today she'll see
&lrm;the object of her hatred everywhere.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.620
&lrm;And, as predicted,
&lrm;her anger will reach devastating heights.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.620
&lrm;-Your plan is perfect, sir.
&lrm;-And you're sure you want to do this?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.620
&lrm;I will always be here for you.
&lrm;We will succeed.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.140
&lrm;<i>-Hello, everyone!</i>
&lrm;-Hi, Lila!

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.020
&lrm;We can't wait to know
&lrm;what you've been doing.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.340
&lrm;Tell us about your week in Atchoo!

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.420
&lrm;<i>It's absolutely amazing!</i>

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.660
&lrm;Prince Ali invited me and my parents
&lrm;to his gorgeous palace!

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780
&lrm;Excuse me, but Prince Ali
&lrm;couldn't possibly have invited you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.980
&lrm;because he is in the United States!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.420
&lrm;[laughs]

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.660
&lrm;<i>I never said he was actually there,</i>
&lrm;<i>Marinette.</i>

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.860
&lrm;<i>I just said he invited us.</i>
&lrm;<i>His parents hosted the visit.</i>

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.100
&lrm;She's lying! And I'll expose her
&lrm;for the fake that she is!

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.340
&lrm;Oh, no, Marinette, not that again!

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.820
&lrm;She's not a liar. You're just jealous
&lrm;of Lila 'cause she tried to hit on Adrien.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.340
&lrm;Not true!

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.260
&lrm;<i>I miss you guys so much! It's so hard</i>
&lrm;<i>being away on this magical trip,</i>

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.180
&lrm;<i>so far from my friends,</i>
&lrm;<i>and especially on Heroes' Day!</i>

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
&lrm;Aw!

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.140
&lrm;Lila,
&lrm;what good deed are you planning today?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.860
&lrm;<i>Today, I'll be meeting up with Prince Ali</i>
&lrm;<i>to show him an idea I came up with.</i>

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
&lrm;<i>Marinette, Prince Ali is coming back</i>
&lrm;<i>to Atchoo today, isn't he?</i>

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.500
&lrm;-Yeah, that's right.
&lrm;-What idea is this, Lila?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.300
&lrm;-I'm sure it's amazing!
&lrm;<i>-Oh, it's nothing much.</i>

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.300
&lrm;<i>My diplomat parents have helped me</i>
&lrm;<i>convince the leaders of several nations</i>

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.100
&lrm;<i>to agree to reduce world pollution</i>

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.420
&lrm;<i>and I'm optimistic the prince will agree!</i>

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.380
&lrm;Oh, that's incredible, Lila!
&lrm;Thank you on behalf of planet Earth!

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.220
&lrm;<i>Well, sure! Ladybug might save lives,</i>
&lrm;<i>but doesn't care about the environment,</i>

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.460
&lrm;<i>so somebody has to come to the rescue.</i>

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.380
&lrm;Ladybug would be very impressed
&lrm;by what you're doing!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.340
&lrm;<i>Thank you for your encouraging words.</i>
&lrm;<i>I'm sorry but it's late here.</i>

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.260
&lrm;<i>As you can see behind me, the sun's</i>
&lrm;<i>already going down. See you soon!</i>

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.940
&lrm;Thank you so much for calling us, Lila,
&lrm;and good luck with your project!

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.620
&lrm;Bye!

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.940
&lrm;-Who was that on the phone?
&lrm;-Mum!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.460
&lrm;It was my boyfriend, Adrien.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.300
&lrm;He misses me so much
&lrm;he can't stop calling.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.420
&lrm;-And school still hasn't reopened?
&lrm;-No, it's too dangerous,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.140
&lrm;-with all these akumatizations!
&lrm;-[phone rings]

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.820
&lrm;Ah! There he is now,
&lrm;your school principal!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.660
&lrm;Do not answer him!
&lrm;He's been akumatized too!

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.460
&lrm;Another poor soul
&lrm;that useless Ladybug was unable to save!

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.740
&lrm;[cheering]

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460
&lrm;All these akumatizations
&lrm;are quite concerning.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.740
&lrm;I'll bring it up
&lrm;at our next embassy meeting.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860
&lrm;<i>Ciao, bella</i>&lrm;. &lrm;Your lunch is in the fridge!

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.060
&lrm;-I'll try not to be home too late.
&lrm;-Grr!

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.060
&lrm;Lila's parents must be caught
&lrm;in that typhoon overseas.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.540
&lrm;I can't get ahold of them!
&lrm;It is now the hour of the Owl!

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.180
&lrm;Hoo! Hoo!

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.180
&lrm;Well, it won't be easy
&lrm;living up to Lila's standards,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.420
&lrm;but let's not forget
&lrm;we can all be heroes for this one day!

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.940
&lrm;We may not all have
&lrm;Prince Ali as a friend, but...

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.780
&lrm;We do have imagination! Hoo! Hoo!

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.500
&lrm;This year,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir have been our heroes,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.380
&lrm;protecting us from Hawk Moth!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.620
&lrm;They've shown us heroism
&lrm;is beyond comic books and fairy tales!

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.420
&lrm;Heroism is real and it is up to you
&lrm;to show how Ladybug and Cat Noir

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.300
&lrm;have brought out the best in all of us,
&lrm;by being everyday heroes!

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.980
&lrm;So, what heroic deeds
&lrm;have you all planned? Nino?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.060
&lrm;I gotta admit, I never used to do
&lrm;anything for anyone before,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.420
&lrm;but Ladybug and Cat Noir showed me
&lrm;what being cool's really about!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.220
&lrm;So, this year, I'll visit the elderly
&lrm;down at the retirement home

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.700
&lrm;-and play them all their favourite songs!
&lrm;-[cheering]

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.900
&lrm;Adrien?

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.220
&lrm;I've planned to give my fencing classmates
&lrm;a lesson in Chinese

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.100
&lrm;and my Chinese classmates
&lrm;a lesson in fencing!

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.500
&lrm;-Alya?
&lrm;-Last year, I wrote an article

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.900
&lrm;about providing disabled access.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.020
&lrm;But after seeing Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;going that extra mile, every single day,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.500
&lrm;I decided I could do better!

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.820
&lrm;So I got the Mayor to improve facilities
&lrm;so handicapped kids can attend our school!

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.340
&lrm;-What about you, Marinette?
&lrm;-Uh... so, I... yeah...

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.580
&lrm;I have... macarons.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.460
&lrm;Wow, like every year?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.540
&lrm;You obviously went above and beyond,
&lrm;Dupain-Cheng.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.340
&lrm;Hey! She did what she could.
&lrm;It's better than nothing!

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.380
&lrm;Hey! I am doing something!
&lrm;Now that I'm a superhero myself,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.220
&lrm;I'll be signing autographs
&lrm;for anyone who wants one!

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.140
&lrm;Wait! It's not just macarons for us!

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.300
&lrm;I'm actually organising
&lrm;a schoolwide macaron tasting!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.100
&lrm;-Oh!
&lrm;-Yeah.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.780
&lrm;And there'll be more than just macarons.
&lrm;There'll be pastries, pies, fruits,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.100
&lrm;and cakes!

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.540
&lrm;I invite everybody to the biggest
&lrm;tasting ever at the park tonight!

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.020
&lrm;-Cakes for everyone!
&lrm;-Yeah!

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.900
&lrm;Oh, wow... that's...
&lrm;not the same as every year, Marinette.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.740
&lrm;How about just half, then?
&lrm;500 macarons, 100 pies,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.940
&lrm;300 buns and a thousand croissants.
&lrm;That should be enough!

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.060
&lrm;If I didn't have this giant Ladybug cake
&lrm;to finish by tonight,

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.860
&lrm;I'd gladly rise to the challenge.
&lrm;But there's simply no way I can do both.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.340
&lrm;I've committed myself, Marinette.
&lrm;I can't let the Mayor down!

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.060
&lrm;I committed myself way over my head, and
&lrm;now I'm going to let my whole class down!

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.780
&lrm;It's not too late to tell them the truth.
&lrm;Your friends will understand.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.500
&lrm;But it won't be very... heroic.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.380
&lrm;Yes, it will. Being brave enough
&lrm;to face one's mistakes is heroic.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.780
&lrm;You're right. If I get to it right away,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.580
&lrm;I'll have enough time
&lrm;to make the macarons by myself!

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.740
&lrm;Sir, Adrien has a special request.
&lrm;He'd like to go to a picnic tonight.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.580
&lrm;Fine. The plan is already in motion.
&lrm;Soon, Paris will mourn their heroes.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.620
&lrm;Liar! Traitor! Coward!

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.540
&lrm;<i>In honour of the wonderful Ladybug,</i>
&lrm;<i>who has saved my son, Adrien, and myself,</i>

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.980
&lrm;<i>and who relentlessly protects us everyday,</i>
&lrm;<i>I have financed this tribute to Ladybug.</i>

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.020
&lrm;<i>Because Ladybug is the only true hero,</i>
&lrm;<i>unlike her mediocre imitations,</i>

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.420
&lrm;<i>such as Volpina!</i>

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.460
&lrm;[gasps]

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.220
&lrm;I hate you, Ladybug!

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.580
&lrm;<i>It will air</i>
&lrm;<i>on all Paris TV channels today!</i>

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.700
&lrm;You were right, Nathalie.
&lrm;It's all going according to plan.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.100
&lrm;Nooroo, dark wings rise!

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.460
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.820
&lrm;and evilise the one who's been awaiting
&lrm;your return for so long!

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.020
&lrm;[gasps]

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.300
&lrm;-Volpina...
&lrm;-Hawk Moth!

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.860
&lrm;Your dreams were once a reality until
&lrm;Ladybug turned them into a nightmare!

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.700
&lrm;Regain your power of illusion

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.540
&lrm;and make this Heroes' Day
&lrm;a nightmare for all Parisians!

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.780
&lrm;With great pleasure, Hawk Moth!

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.340
&lrm;Look at all these Parisians,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.900
&lrm;so happy to be parading
&lrm;in honour of their heroes.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.820
&lrm;Look, Mommy! Ladybug looks weird!

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.100
&lrm;Sweetie, that's not Ladybug, that's...

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.100
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.860
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.420
&lrm;Move out of the way!
&lrm;She's been akumatized!

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.420
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha! Is that fear I smell, Kitty?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.580
&lrm;If you're looking for trouble,
&lrm;you found it!

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.500
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir are fighting.
&lrm;This is incredible, ladies and gentlemen!

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.620
&lrm;It's over, my sweet little kitty.
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous!

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.460
&lrm;If Hawk Moth wants a ring,
&lrm;he can make one himself!

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.900
&lrm;It's not nice to deny a request
&lrm;from a friend of a friend!

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.700
&lrm;We probably won't be friends again
&lrm;until you're de-akumatized!

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.900
&lrm;Meanwhile,
&lrm;I have a nice gift for Hawk Moth!

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.860
&lrm;A very cool... Cataclysm!

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.380
&lrm;Cataclysm to you, too!

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.300
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.020
&lrm;I've won! Hawk Moth has won!

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.820
&lrm;Fear, people of Paris!
&lrm;There's no one left to protect you!

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.580
&lrm;Is Ladybug a baddie now?

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.620
&lrm;So much sadness. So much disappointment.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.580
&lrm;I can feel the chasm of despair and fear
&lrm;about to open and swallow up

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.380
&lrm;every single Parisian!

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.100
&lrm;Dear Volpina, you've performed
&lrm;your role well for the time being.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.220
&lrm;We will meet again, very soon.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.340
&lrm;I'll be waiting, Hawk Moth!

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.740
&lrm;[sobbing]

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.660
&lrm;Are you ready, Nathalie?

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.540
&lrm;They've been keeping you
&lrm;from your dream for too long.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.380
&lrm;I will go to any length
&lrm;to end the reign of Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.740
&lrm;Good.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.660
&lrm;Catalyst, you have always been
&lrm;my most loyal supporter.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.260
&lrm;I give you the ability to boost powers!

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.580
&lrm;Hawk Moth, I give you the power
&lrm;to release as many akumas as you desire!

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.140
&lrm;From now on,
&lrm;you are the almighty Scarlet Moth!

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.100
&lrm;Fly away, my little akumas!

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.700
&lrm;Find the Parisians as they despair
&lrm;over Cat Noir and Ladybug's final hour

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.220
&lrm;and evilise each and every one of them!

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.980
&lrm;I've got 32 minutes left.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.540
&lrm;At a rate of ten macarons per minute,
&lrm;that works out to... Aaah!

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.620
&lrm;One big fail. Argh! Tikki, help me!

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.260
&lrm;-Want me to go back and fetch more sugar?
&lrm;-Why not transform me into Ladybug?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.740
&lrm;With a bit of luck, my Lucky Charm
&lrm;will give us a giant electric whisk

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.700
&lrm;or an ovenful of quiches.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.100
&lrm;I know. It wouldn't be
&lrm;very hero-like of me to use my powers

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.580
&lrm;just for my own purposes.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.700
&lrm;Just tell your friends the truth,
&lrm;Marinette.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.500
&lrm;But that'll spoil the whole party!

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.940
&lrm;Today's Heroes' Day, Marinette.
&lrm;Nothing could spoil the party!

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.140
&lrm;Well, anyone can get carried away
&lrm;from time to time.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.700
&lrm;Marinette! My father gave me permission
&lrm;to come to your tasting!

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.580
&lrm;I... I... Huh?

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.460
&lrm;-You didn't bake enough pastries for me?
&lrm;-Oh, no, we've got plenty! You're so cute!

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.020
&lrm;Uh... I mean, it's so cute... cool.
&lrm;It's cool you can make it!

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.700
&lrm;What's going on?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.980
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir defeated. Ladybug in the clutches</i>
&lrm;<i>of the terrible Hawk Moth.</i>

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.860
&lrm;<i>This is Paris' worst nightmare!</i>

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.460
&lrm;<i>Ladybug's defeated?</i>
&lrm;<i>Nothing will ever be rock'n'roll again!</i>

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.660
&lrm;<i>We'll have to cancel the concert?</i>

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.940
&lrm;<i>You're right, Clara. There's no sense</i>
&lrm;<i>in celebrating Heroes' Day either.</i>

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.620
&lrm;[commotion]

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.220
&lrm;<i>-Aaah!</i>
&lrm;<i>-That is horrible!</i>

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.500
&lrm;<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.060
&lrm;<i>Dear viewers, what does make sense</i>
&lrm;<i>is getting ready for the coming of...</i>

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.860
&lrm;<i>Our new lead rock star...</i>

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.860
&lrm;<i>Scarlet Moth!</i>

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.180
&lrm;[gasp]

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.620
&lrm;Oh!

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.700
&lrm;It's OK. No need to panic.
&lrm;I know what I have to do!

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.700
&lrm;No! No! No!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.380
&lrm;Mylène!

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.820
&lrm;No!

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.060
&lrm;This is bad.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.940
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
&lrm;-Real bad! Aaah!

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.260
&lrm;Don't let fear control you, Juleka!

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.340
&lrm;Remember now,
&lrm;there's a hero in every one of us!

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.620
&lrm;As long as we show we're not scared.
&lrm;Hoo! Hoo!

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.940
&lrm;But I am scared!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.820
&lrm;That's it!
&lrm;We can't let fear get the better of us!

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.780
&lrm;It worked!

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.340
&lrm;Nora, whatever you do, don't let fear
&lrm;get ahold of you, you got me?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.500
&lrm;Fear? Ha!

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.460
&lrm;-Little sister, fear is afraid of me!
&lrm;-Yeah!

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.260
&lrm;Too many have been akumatized!
&lrm;It'd be foolish to try to fight them all.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.500
&lrm;We must go see Master Fu right away!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.820
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.700
&lrm;Grr!

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.140
&lrm;Roar!

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.700
&lrm;Good, Gorizilla!
&lrm;Whatever happens, do not release Adrien.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.180
&lrm;His safety is your number-one priority!

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.660
&lrm;Now come to me,
&lrm;my dear akumatized friends!

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.060
&lrm;What are they doing?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.900
&lrm;Do not let her out of your sight,
&lrm;Vanisher!

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.980
&lrm;She's probably going to recruit other
&lrm;superheroes to help her battle my army.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.260
&lrm;Without knowing it, she's going to
&lrm;lead us to the Guardian of the Miraculous.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.020
&lrm;-See that? I barely destroyed anything!
&lrm;-You're a true hero.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.900
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.260
&lrm;I knew it!

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.580
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.260
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.060
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.900
&lrm;Ladybug?
&lrm;Is this really you? The real Ladybug?

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.660
&lrm;-Of course.
&lrm;-We all saw you akumatized.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.740
&lrm;You destroyed Cat Noir. Then who took
&lrm;his Miraculous to Hawk Moth? It was...

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.940
&lrm;An illusion.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.660
&lrm;[gasps] Volpina!

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.140
&lrm;I'm going to tell them all
&lrm;not to lose hope,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.500
&lrm;'cause the real Ladybug
&lrm;is still going strong!

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.700
&lrm;It is Heroes' Day, after all,
&lrm;and I wouldn't miss it for the world!

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.220
&lrm;Vanisher,
&lrm;why have I lost contact with you?

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.900
&lrm;Ladybug must have found you out.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.020
&lrm;But she won't be able to figure out
&lrm;what I have in store for her next!

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.540
&lrm;I always knew that Hawk Moth would one day
&lrm;realise just how powerful he could be.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.340
&lrm;That day has come, Marinette!

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.700
&lrm;Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
&lrm;you must pick an ally you can trust

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.220
&lrm;to fight alongside you on this mission.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.540
&lrm;Once the mission is over,

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.580
&lrm;you will get the Miraculous
&lrm;back from them and return it to me.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.740
&lrm;Take them all, Marinette!

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.860
&lrm;There need to be
&lrm;as many of us as possible!

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.460
&lrm;No. In this case less is more.
&lrm;I won't have time to explain everything.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.460
&lrm;I need allies who already know
&lrm;what needs to be done.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.380
&lrm;If I may, Master?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.500
&lrm;So you want the Miraculouses, Hawk Moth?
&lrm;Then that's what you're gonna get!

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.060
&lrm;-Cat Noir!
&lrm;-No way I was gonna miss this party,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.620
&lrm;-especially with all these guests!
&lrm;-How many?

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.660
&lrm;One... two.. three... too many to count!

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.420
&lrm;Hawk Moth's made
&lrm;quite an army for himself!

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.060
&lrm;It's just as well.
&lrm;I'm planning to do the same.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.740
&lrm;-Milady!
&lrm;-I've got a mission for you.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.820
&lrm;Oh.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.260
&lrm;When this is over,
&lrm;I'll take you to the movies!

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.380
&lrm;No, I'll take you to the movies!

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.140
&lrm;Alya! Nino!
&lrm;You guys like action movies, right?

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.540
&lrm;-Ladybug? The real Ladybug? But...
&lrm;-I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.060
&lrm;I'm revealing your secret identities,
&lrm;but...

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.140
&lrm;I don't have time
&lrm;to give them to you separately.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.420
&lrm;Rena Rouge and Carapace, I need you both!

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.460
&lrm;-You're Rena Rouge?
&lrm;-Course I am!

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.260
&lrm;And you never told me?

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.020
&lrm;It was supposed to be a secret, right?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.140
&lrm;Trixx, let's pounce!

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.780
&lrm;So awesome! But aren't you at least
&lrm;a bit surprised that I'm Carapace?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.660
&lrm;My sweet, clueless boy! Just transform.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.780
&lrm;-Dude!
&lrm;-Dude!

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.980
&lrm;Wayzz, shell on!

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.380
&lrm;Oh! I was starting to wonder
&lrm;what was taking you so long!

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.420
&lrm;What? Ladybug sent over her second fiddle?

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.780
&lrm;Know what? I'm sure I can find Ladybug
&lrm;a much better Queen Bee!

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.500
&lrm;OK, OK! We're good!
&lrm;Give it to me! We've got work to do!

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.500
&lrm;What's the magic word?

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.460
&lrm;Oh, come on,
&lrm;everybody knows that it's "buzz on"!

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.180
&lrm;-Uh, uh, uh!
&lrm;-Oh. That magic word.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.620
&lrm;[sighs] Could you give me my Miraculous,
&lrm;Cat Noir... please?

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.580
&lrm;I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.180
&lrm;Please!

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.300
&lrm;Greetings, my Queen!

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.380
&lrm;Pollen! Buzz on!

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.540
&lrm;Why don't we fight already?

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.180
&lrm;We won't be able to defeat them
&lrm;if we don't know what they're planning.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.460
&lrm;Huh?

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.260
&lrm;Good luck, Scarlet Moth.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.500
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir, behold my powerful army

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.220
&lrm;and have no doubt
&lrm;that today belongs to Scarlet Moth!

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.380
&lrm;Ha! I told you so!
&lrm;If that flyweight's talking to them,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.380
&lrm;it means Ladybug and Mr Whiskers
&lrm;are still around, on the good guys' side!

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.020
&lrm;Yay! Ladybug! Ladybug!

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.220
&lrm;Don't get too cocky, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;I'm gonna sting you where it hurts!

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.580
&lrm;It's only ten villains to every one of us.
&lrm;Who wants Hawk Moth?

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.500
&lrm;How about we toss for him?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.620
&lrm;-I got your back!
&lrm;-No, I've got your back!

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.700
&lrm;-No, I do.
&lrm;-No, I do.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.780
&lrm;-No, I do.
&lrm;-No, I do.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.460
&lrm;So, what's the heroes' plan, Milady?
