1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,250
ARCHIN PANJABHAN

2
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,458
FAILED

3
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,041
EXPELLED

4
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,208
SECOND YEAR FINAL EXAMINATION RESULTS
FACULTY OF ENGINEERING

5
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,541
That was me.

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,000
A young man
who was expelled from university

7
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,875
in 1949.

8
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,666
I was penniless, unemployed,

9
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,958
hopeless, timid,

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,208
and nearly broken-hearted.

11
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,458
YOU'LL BE A MESS
IF YOU KEEP SMOKING AND DRINKING.

12
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,458
YOU WANT TO WORK?
I'LL SEND YOU TO A MINE IN PHANG NGA.

13
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,750
That piece of paper

14
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,833
was the most valuable thing

15
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,666
among all of my worthless possessions...

16
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,041
although it could only boast the knowledge

17
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,458
of a second-year engineering student.

18
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,041
No one knew that,

19
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,583
on that day,

20
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,458
I put all of my hopes there.

21
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,791
The tin mine

22
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,958
was to be my last chance

23
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,708
in keeping my hopes high
and my stomach full.

24
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,583
When I was a little kid,

25
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,541
the district of Takua Thung

26
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,416
was a small area with so little importance

27
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,583
that map-makers gave it no interest.

28
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,416
And the sub-district of Krasom

29
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:30,333
wasn't even important enough
to be placed on maps.

30
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,666
Hey! What the hell is that? Help!

31
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,208
But that day,

32
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,583
Krasom became a reformatory

33
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,666
my father was sending me to.

34
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,791
Of course, it wasn't a place
meant for holidays

35
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,416
or adventures,

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,833
where you would savor
the good things in life.

37
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,541
KRASOM

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,500
We're finally here.

39
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,291
-Can you tell me where the office is?
-That way.

40
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,541
Again? Are you using it for work
or are you selling it?

41
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,958
You use too much. Now go.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,916
What do you want?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,208
Is the manager here?

44
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,166
No. Do you need anything?

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,583
-I'm looking for a job.
-No. No jobs here.

46
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,166
Hey, I said no jobs, got it?

47
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,500
-Any kind of job.
-No. I said no jobs!

48
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,916
Go away. Don't hang around here.

49
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,958
Go away. All positions are full.

50
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,750
Can you handle manual labor,
university boy?

51
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,458
Can you handle manual labor?

52
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,583
Well?

53
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,041
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,166
For a miner's standard monthly wage?

55
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,791
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,041
And why is that?

57
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,083
Okay, then.

58
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,458
Come.

59
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,708
I like people who work.

60
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,083
And you like to work.

61
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,083
So I like you.

62
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,666
You mean I'm hired?

63
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,166
As a laborer, okay?

64
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,500
Your place is close to the cemetery.

65
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,875
If you're not afraid of ghosts,

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
you'll find it quite comfy.

67
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,208
But if you can't handle it,

68
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,541
you can stay with me at the market.

69
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,625
We're both from Bangkok, after all.

70
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Now, you're good to go.

71
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,208
Good luck, then.

72
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,625
I mean, it's nice.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,625
Lights off at 11, okay?

74
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,625
That marked the beginning of
the months and years of laborious work.

75
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,333
FRESHMAN

76
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,708
A part of me was feeling valiant

77
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,333
to grind away like a man
in the intense and grueling work.

78
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,833
I just ran off. I kept telling myself,
"Don't stop!"

79
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,166
But the other part of me

80
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,250
was yearning and begging
to go back to Bangkok.

81
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,416
Hey. Look at the Bangkok boy.

82
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,833
Hey!

83
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,291
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry.

84
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,166
-That rice reeked of gasoline.
-I see.

85
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,833
Hey.

86
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,958
I saw the dog chewing on this.
I thought it might be yours.

87
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,458
That was hot.

88
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,291
This southern-style soup tastes bland.

89
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,291
Oh, I added some water.

90
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,500
Hey.

91
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,416
What are you doing out here
in these woods, anyway?

92
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,958
You would get better food in prison.

93
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,291
There aren't any movies

94
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,333
or girls to see.

95
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,875
I came here to save up some money.

96
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,708
Save money for what?

97
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,208
I'm going to get married.

98
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,875
You're getting married?

99
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,416
That's good.
Just don't get into debt later on.

100
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
What's that?

101
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,125
What?

102
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,666
Oh, your sweetheart.

103
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, she's a looker.
You should hang on to that.

104
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,750
You know,

105
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,791
there's an old saying.

106
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,541
"If a man goes away to China,

107
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,208
to sea,

108
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,458
to Java,

109
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,458
or to Phang Nga,

110
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,708
his girl should wait three years for him.

111
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,125
But after three years,

112
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,666
she can take a lover

113
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,833
without being blamed."

114
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,375
-Get on the pickup truck.
-Hurry.

115
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,666
Get on. Now.

116
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,583
Hey, you.

117
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,458
Have you seen them yet? At your house?

118
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,416
-The ghosts?
-Yes.

119
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,041
No, not yet.

120
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,916
Where are you off to this morning?

121
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,416
The Singaporean clerk is sending me
to get the mail.

122
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,375
Take this one. And this one, too.

123
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
Has Office Boy come back?

124
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,750
Is Office Boy back yet?

125
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,583
Where is he off to, anyway?

126
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,916
He went to town.

127
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,583
Waiting for a letter
from your girl, aren't you?

128
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,541
A round trip is 50 kilometers!

129
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
Why didn't he take a car?

130
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,708
None of them are available.

131
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,041
It's a small task. No big deal.

132
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,375
But he's already old.

133
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,166
About your mail,

134
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,083
there wasn't any.

135
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:29,333
No mail for you.

136
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,875
-No mail!
-It's a pity.

137
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
In that house at nighttime,

138
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,750
a girl would come walking,

139
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,583
stark naked, with her tongue flapping
and eyes bulging.

140
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,791
Her hair is up to her shoulders.

141
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,083
People say she's the ghost
of Choom's late wife,

142
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,458
who died with the baby in her womb.

143
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,083
One night, Aom went out for some coffee

144
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,708
and left his wife there alone.

145
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,708
She saw her with her own eyes.

146
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,375
Jong and Joi saw her too.

147
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,375
They were scared half to death.

148
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,166
Actually,

149
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,666
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

150
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,208
It's the sound of her walking
that scares me.

151
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,208
Want to make a bet?

152
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,708
Ten bottles of hooch to one.

153
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,208
You'll see her tonight for sure!

154
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,375
A woman. Hair up to her shoulders.

155
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,875
No clothes.

156
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,791
With a belly ready to burst!

157
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,750
That's Mrs. Cham, all right.

158
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,083
The previous chief's wife.

159
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,041
She died while she was pregnant.

160
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,958
-Dang.
-What did you say then?

161
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,625
I prayed and told her

162
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,541
that I had come from far away.

163
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,541
I asked her to let me stay
because I needed a job.

164
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,416
What did she say?

165
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,083
She just nodded her head.

166
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,000
That's one scary encounter.

167
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,583
Unbelievable!

168
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,958
And then,

169
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,458
my first task came
in the shape of an oil drum.

170
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,916
They wanted to make a trash can out of it.

171
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,666
And I was assigned to do it.

172
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,458
Shit!

173
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,833
Shit!

174
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,083
What happened?

175
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,583
Let me see it.

176
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,625
Don't pull away. Hold still!

177
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,541
It's okay. Let it go.

178
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,916
Here.

179
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,916
Oh, shit!

180
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,291
Hey, it's not shit. You'll get better.

181
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,833
Daydreaming, are you?

182
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,791
Thinking about your girl?

183
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,625
For me, the tin mine

184
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,583
seemed like an entirely new world.

185
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,583
It was cut off from the outside world,

186
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,166
with tens of kilometers
between it and the highway.

187
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:38,958
Who's that?

188
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,583
How the hell should I know?

189
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,958
My first real test came

190
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,583
when the dredging engineer
went on holiday.

191
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,958
The boss

192
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,875
let me work as his substitute

193
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,166
 and write request forms in English.

194
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,791
One day, you'll become
an engineer for sure.

195
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,458
All right.

196
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,500
Building materials, accounting, English.

197
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,625
I had studied all of that back in school.

198
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,291
The only thing that went wrong
was that I didn't manage to graduate.

199
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,500
Hey.

200
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,625
Hey!

201
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,000
Where are the requested materials?

202
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,041
The boss is checking the dredger.

203
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,875
So?

204
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,125
Where are the materials?

205
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,041
Have you been dallying?

206
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,291
The man at the warehouse said that,

207
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,458
"A bolt is male and a nut is female.

208
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,583
You can't just ask for nuts.

209
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,833
You need both nuts and bolts together."

210
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,125
What about the 30 nails I requested?

211
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't tell me they only come with hammers.

212
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,000
Nails are requested by the pound,

213
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,375
not by the piece.

214
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,083
You were wrong from the beginning.

215
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,333
Sorry, chief. Give me another chance.

216
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,625
Chief, the light
in the steam room went out.

217
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,166
One frosted light bulb.

218
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,333
Don't request them by the dozen.

219
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,250
Understood.

220
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,750
A pearl light bulb.

221
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,125
P-E-A, is that right?

222
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,208
I really began to like my Australian boss.

223
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,625
He opened the tin mine's gates for me.

224
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,708
I wanted to show him

225
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,791
that he could always count on me.

226
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,583
"Why don't we take the belt off

227
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,875
when the steam pressure is
at its highest?"

228
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,666
Well...

229
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,291
Oh, they're so cute.

230
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,291
Here, little one,
buy yourself a new shirt, okay?

231
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,458
Hi, little one!

232
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,375
The boss's name was Mr. Sam.

233
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,958
-He was 56 years old.
-Spend it on a shirt.

234
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,833
He is the role model that I aspire to be.

235
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,541
-Three-nine.
-He loved to have fun.

236
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,833
Seven-two. Twenty baht.

237
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,166
-That's enough
-Eight-five. Twenty baht.

238
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,750
That's enough.

239
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,208
He's generous and kind.

240
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,375
His own car is used freely

241
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,416
-as if it was for charity.
-Please get on.

242
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,291
Stop. Chai, stop!

243
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,291
Hey.

244
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,291
How dare you treat human remains this way?

245
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,500
Put down the drink
and take good care of it.

246
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,125
His fellow Australians wouldn't know

247
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,333
how proud Thai people were of him.

248
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,708
Whenever he had too much to drink,

249
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,833
he would show us the souvenir

250
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,583
-he got in the war.
-I, Corporal Sam,

251
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:45,166
wore this anklet while building
the bridge on the Kwai River.

252
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,375
It's called a shackle, boss.

253
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,250
-What?
-It's called a shackle!

254
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,791
Right. I see.

255
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh, look!

256
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,791
The baby's got one too!

257
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,458
The boss's younger brother,

258
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,208
Mr. Tom, worked here too.

259
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,916
He worked outside of the office

260
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,291
and was the dredger's chief engineer.

261
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,583
All right.

262
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,166
Push hard!

263
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,000
But there's one thing

264
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,208
the brothers could never agree on.

265
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,791
Which was

266
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,291
the older brother would hire anyone
under the influence of alcohol,

267
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,916
while the younger brother
would be the one to fire them one by one.

268
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:42,666
The two bosses
were every working man's heroes.

269
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,625
They taught me the meaning of the phrase,

270
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,083
"duty unto death."

271
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,458
When the dredger's roller
fell into the water

272
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,333
and stopped working,

273
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,791
we had to take turns working nine shifts,

274
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:58,083
while Mr. Sam stayed up
for 72 hours straight

275
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,583
and never took a break.

276
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,041
We got the dredger up and running again,

277
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,291
thanks to this Australian commander

278
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,750
and another leader of the mineworkers,

279
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,625
John,

280
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,416
the foreman of our dredger crew.

281
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,750
The chief is here!

282
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,291
Fuck! You always get the bike!
Wait until it's my turn.

283
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,208
The way John stood,

284
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,750
there was a show of power and dignity,

285
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,791
-a chief who is in control.
-He's here.

286
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,166
In an instant,

287
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,125
he would let you know he was in charge.

288
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,958
Huan! Black coffee.

289
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,041
-Double bitter!
-Yes, Mr. John.

290
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,041
Tomorrow,

291
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:09,125
Mr. Henry, the big boss from Penang,
will come to check the dredger!

292
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:13,458
If you don't wear a shirt tomorrow,
I won't sign your time card!

293
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,625
Hey!

294
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,750
Mr. Henry, the big boss from Penang
is coming tomorrow to check the dredger!

295
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,666
Whoever comes to work without a shirt
will not get his time card signed!

296
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,625
Pook.

297
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:29,041
No shirt, no time card signed!

298
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,125
John spoke so fast and so fluently
in so many languages,

299
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,041
you would think a fan was blowing
the words out of his mouth.

300
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,458
He's a foreigner.

301
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:39,375
Don't let him look down on you
and call you jungle savages,

302
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,708
who work naked under the sun!

303
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,916
He's a foreigner.

304
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,375
Don't let him come over and say

305
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,083
that we are a bunch of illiterates

306
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,958
who work naked!

307
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,791
Attention!

308
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,083
John drank even more than we did.

309
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,958
He smoked more, too.

310
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,666
And he ate so much food...

311
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,708
So it took him a longer time
to take a dump.

312
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,291
Wow, I just took a big shit!

313
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:55,375
Must have been a foot long!
And in one piece!

314
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,083
There was just no stopping his craziness,

315
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:03,041
especially when he had
his team of loyal warriors with him.

316
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,833
Like Kong the Mechanic.

317
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,500
And Weng the Tinsmith.

318
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,583
I was only hoping they would let me
join them as their d'Artagnan.

319
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,791
-Hey, how's it going, Mard?
-Just fine, chief.

320
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,208
What is this? Where are you going?

321
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,916
All you do is disturb people.

322
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,333
Are you in this too?
Why are you doing this? This is wrong.

323
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,750
He can ask me nicely
if he wants me to work.

324
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,708
Hey!

325
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,208
You want to go blind?

326
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,083
Put your mask on!

327
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,958
You've got to write "cotton waste,"

328
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,458
not "waste cotton."

329
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,708
Heaven might have sent John
to our tin mine,

330
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,583
but it sent Ying too,

331
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,041
to give John a taste of Hell.

332
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,583
Ying, how many pounds exactly is this?

333
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,666
Getting senile, are you?

334
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,458
I'm not an expert on the steaming machine.

335
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,791
What kind of mechanic foreman are you?

336
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,750
The foreman has to know everything.

337
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,875
I do know everything.

338
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,708
-I know Thai boxing, too.
-Don't push me, Ying.

339
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,125
I'll push you more than that, John.

340
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,708
I may not be the gangster I once was,

341
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,583
but I can still teach you a thing or two!

342
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:41,625
-You want to fight me? You're on!
-Hey, guys! It's a fight!

343
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,875
The chiefs are going to fight!

344
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,666
Shit! Everybody, back to work!

345
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,041
TO ARCHIN
ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU

346
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh, Jieng.

347
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,458
I'm cloud gazing, like you.

348
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:29,000
I might see a lucky number up there.

349
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,041
At the tin mine,

350
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,750
any dry place to sleep in when it rains
is considered home.

351
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,500
I've got the runs!

352
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,583
Our toilet was the nearest bush,

353
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:58,041
and our kitchen was
the boiled rice noodle stand.

354
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:03,083
-I'm out, go that way.
-Then don't eat. Give us some.

355
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,958
Our lounge and living room

356
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,250
were set up in the local coffee shop.

357
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,708
Can I put this bottle on my tab?

358
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,791
Sure, whatever.

359
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,291
-It was also our clubhouse.
-Hey.

360
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,333
Have a drink with us?

361
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,208
No, me and alcohol
don't get along too well.

362
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:20,458
I thought it was you and your wife
that didn't get along!

363
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,958
The shop owner was tight-fisted,

364
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,583
but he was the president of the club.

365
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,875
The shop was our recreation center...

366
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,083
Pretty.

367
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,875
...and our office of public affairs.

368
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,083
This newspaper says that

369
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,125
the Korean War was the fiercest war yet.

370
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,750
If they fought here,

371
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,666
near our home and our mine,

372
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:49,833
we would be filthy rich!

373
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:50,833
And why is that?

374
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,416
They're shooting up everything in sight

375
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,666
and they're using lead bullets to do it.

376
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,458
Our mine is a lead mine, right?

377
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,625
So if we wouldn't get rich,

378
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:02,916
who would?

379
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,875
Sometimes, the coffee shop became
our courthouse as well.

380
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,166
The mine here sure looks small to me.

381
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,833
The mine might be small,

382
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,666
but the people here aren't.

383
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,833
What's that?

384
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,333
The mine might not be so big,

385
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,500
but the miners here are big enough.

386
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,875
Right.

387
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,083
What's so great about digging
a little hole in the ground?

388
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,833
You might use a ten-baht shovel
to dig your holes,

389
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,291
but here,

390
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,208
we use a ten million-baht dredger
to dig ours.

391
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,333
-Yes, that's right!
-And what about that?

392
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,083
-Don't go out, stay behind me.
-Oh, no! My shop!

393
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,583
Stop!

394
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,625
-Stop!
-Come here!

395
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,541
I'm doing my job to feed all of you.
Leave me alone!

396
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,291
But the shop's most important function

397
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:16,000
was to serve as our casino.

398
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,333
And the shop owner was the one

399
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,833
who initiated it, reeled people in,

400
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,333
and dealt the cards.

401
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,041
Man!

402
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,333
Wait and see. Win or lose.

403
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,916
The hottest games were

404
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,958
the "guess the number
of durian seeds" game...

405
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,041
Seven, eight.

406
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,875
Okay, pay up! Everyone, pay up!

407
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,583
The "smash the sardine can" game...

408
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,958
Will he break it or not?

409
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,208
-No!
-Yes!

410
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,291
Break it!

411
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,583
It's not broken! Pay the dealer!

412
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:52,541
The "guess the number of petals
under the mangosteen" game...

413
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,750
Pay the dealer!

414
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,583
-Two baht on 500 grams!
-Place a bet.

415
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,291
I say 700 grams.

416
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,000
-Are you sure?
-Bet on it!

417
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,875
The "how heavy is the milk can" game...

418
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,625
Five hundred grams!

419
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,083
-Seven hundred.
-Five hundred.

420
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,041
Five hundred!

421
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,291
And the "guess the height
of the candle" game.

422
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,500
It's 7.9!

423
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,041
No, it's 8!

424
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,416
You're looking at it sideways.

425
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,791
Dude, one shot of whiskey over here.

426
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,875
Pien has been having labor pains
since this morning,

427
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,125
but the baby is still not out.

428
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,250
Stillborn, you think?

429
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,083
Okay, let's bet on it.

430
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,541
Pien's having a baby today.

431
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,583
Will the baby be dead or alive?

432
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,625
Place your bets!

433
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,166
-Alive!
-Hold on.

434
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,458
-Alive!
-Okay, give it to me.

435
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:41,125
Hey!

436
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,250
Here's your cut.

437
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,916
The coffee shop was also

438
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,541
like a sanitarium

439
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,000
when I needed a cure for my homesickness.

440
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,416
Go away! Hey, go away!

441
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,208
What?

442
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,875
Catch the thieves tonight at 3 a.m.

443
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,041
Catch the thieves.

444
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,458
Me?

445
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,083
Come on.

446
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,375
Make it snappy! Hurry it up!

447
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,875
Are you the one stealing our tin?

448
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,000
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

449
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,541
Just give me a minute.

450
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,125
What are you waiting for? Go ahead!

451
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,416
What are you afraid of?

452
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Move it!

453
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,041
Get going.

454
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,666
Hold on.

455
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,708
Stop right there.

456
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,000
The boss's orders.
Everything goes back to the dredger!

457
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:16,750
Hey,

458
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,791
you had better remember
who's in charge here.

459
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,833
Oh, you're the senior man here, all right.

460
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,500
But this is the boss's direct order.

461
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,625
And what country is he from?

462
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,833
And which country did you come from?

463
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,708
This is Thai tin.

464
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:39,000
And the land you're standing on
is Thailand.

465
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,541
The tin beneath Thai soil
belongs to the Thai people!

466
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,583
And what about the permit,

467
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:46,458
the dredger,

468
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,291
the tools, and the machines?

469
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,958
They belong to the boss, don't they?

470
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,708
And the wages you get, who pays them?

471
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,666
Who hired you to work here?

472
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,916
What kind of asshole steals from the man

473
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,666
who puts a roof over his head?

474
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,791
I don't care about that foreigner.

475
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,708
Try and stop me if you can.

476
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,541
Go back and suck on your milk bottle, boy.

477
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,708
You got pampered by a foreigner,
and now you forgot your roots.

478
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:16,916
Wait.

479
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,916
Hey.

480
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,208
What? You got a problem?

481
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,208
Don't get in my way
or you'll get in trouble!

482
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,833
-Then so be it!
-Hey!

483
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,000
-He made you a foreman,
-Well, who wants to work

484
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,750
-and you repay him like this?
-for him forever?

485
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,750
Piss off!

486
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,833
Guys.

487
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,166
Maybe we should all
talk this over together.

488
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,583
John?

489
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,875
Look,

490
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,291
it wasn't all for myself.

491
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,041
We split it up among us.

492
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,375
The money goes around,
no matter how little we get.

493
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:50,583
Joi, Jerm, Tab, Hued, Huan, and Kong.

494
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,291
A little bit for each of us.

495
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,625
How are they supposed to feed
their families?

496
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,416
You think getting
ten baht a day is enough?

497
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,250
We're only getting
a few more baht from this.

498
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,583
What's the big deal?

499
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:04,458
After a few years,

500
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,458
when the mine shuts down,

501
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,291
who will care about us?

502
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,666
What about the taxes
the boss pays for mining this land?

503
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,916
How could you still steal from him?

504
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,416
Why shouldn't we steal it?

505
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,375
Because it's illegal!

506
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,125
Illegal?

507
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,000
You're mixing up our laws
with that foreigner's.

508
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,250
Working men go by the laws of life!

509
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,000
Move it!

510
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,125
Boss.

511
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,333
I'm going to resign.

512
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,750
I'm going back to Bangkok to drive a taxi.

513
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,083
Are you really quitting?

514
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,666
Doing honest work for you

515
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,083
makes me a traitor to my country.

516
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,875
Here.

517
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,083
Tell you what,

518
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,083
how about I give you a raise?

519
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,125
Come here.

520
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,458
I have to apologize.

521
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:24,666
This is how I test every worker
who is going to...

522
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,125
get a raise.

523
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:38,916
Archin,

524
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,875
that school must have taught you
pretty well.

525
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,458
Most of the guys who got tested

526
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,416
only cared about how much they're paid.

527
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,416
Here.

528
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:51,916
Eat with no shame.

529
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,000
Die with no fear.

530
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,833
Strive with no tears.

531
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,291
If you die, you're out!

532
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,583
Your university taught you
to love your country,

533
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,583
but this tin mine

534
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,458
taught you to love your life.

535
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,083
From that day on,

536
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:14,291
I was proud to be part of the tin mine.

537
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,208
We had all come
from different regions and schools.

538
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,875
And also...

539
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,041
I do everything. I don't pick my job.

540
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,666
We had all heard
different stories as kids.

541
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:07,666
The things that led each of us
to this tin mine

542
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,166
are all different too.

543
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,625
If I were a soldier,
I would wear a lieutenant's cap

544
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,208
and sit straight, but I'm not.

545
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,333
But we lived together like a family,

546
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,625
rather than a bunch of workers.

547
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,625
You smelly ass,
you drank yourself silly again.

548
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,625
-So we go...
-Are we all up?

549
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,541
Under the harsh words we spoke
were familial bonds.

550
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,375
And we could feel
the honesty, the sincerity,

551
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,125
-and the goodwill
-Pull!

552
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,708
in the effort

553
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,791
that each of us put in the work.

554
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:52,166
SOPHOMORE

555
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,500
I progressed so quickly
during my first year at the tin mine

556
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,375
that some of the workers
envied my rapid promotion.

557
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,916
But what they didn't know
was that loneliness itself

558
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:05,166
was taking its place in my hopeless heart.

559
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,666
Young guys like you

560
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,916
shouldn't work in a place like this.

561
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,041
No vacation

562
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,916
for New Year's.

563
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,083
The sun sure is bright today.

564
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:21,333
Would you like to bet?

565
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,291
When the sun's this bright,

566
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,791
there's sure to be a storm by noon.

567
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,958
Want to bet on it?

568
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,208
Sure.

569
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,083
I'll bet you two bottles of whiskey.

570
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,458
This New Year,

571
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,583
there's no celebrating,

572
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:40,083
peeing on a building wall while drunk,

573
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:44,541
or lying on the ground and stargazing,
as I had done in years past.

574
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,708
Well,

575
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,916
it looks like you lost.

576
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,958
Look, it's raining.

577
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,291
I only said it minutes ago.

578
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,958
It's raining.

579
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,916
Hey, you.

580
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,250
Is the New Year this much fun in Bangkok?

581
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,333
Regardless of what day it was
at the tin mine,

582
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,333
we were more concerned
with ourselves than with nature.

583
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,958
We didn't have time
to watch the sunrise or the sunset.

584
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,916
We only worried about
getting to work each day.

585
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,250
Looks like you've had enough.

586
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:26,458
If you're still planning on
going to work tomorrow.

587
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,416
Here.

588
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,375
For us, the moon itself was meaningless.

589
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,166
It was only the waning moon

590
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,250
at the end of each calendar month

591
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,291
that we cared about.

592
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,125
We didn't have time
to look at the moon in the sky.

593
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,791
Instead, we looked for it
at the bottom of a glass.

594
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,291
Days, months, years, life at the tin mine

595
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,833
became a bigger part of my body each day.

596
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,041
No mail for you today.

597
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,083
The love letters from Bangkok

598
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,708
grew fewer and fewer.

599
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,666
Old Man Dang, why is the soup so cold?

600
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,041
Just eat it! Your stomach will warm it up.

601
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:15,583
Cold and flavorless.

602
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,333
I slept in a lonely hut at night

603
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:28,416
with the sound of the dredger
as my only lullaby.

604
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,458
I worked on the ground sprinkled with dust

605
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:40,208
from the tin we mined below.

606
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,500
And the rain that fell down on my head

607
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,875
was mixed with the ashes
of that tin as well.

608
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:53,708
That day,

609
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,083
I felt ready to face any challenge
the mine could give me.

610
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,583
And on that same day, the same rain 

611
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:06,333
dropped a new friend onto my head as well.

612
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:19,333
Hands are up to greet, head down to feet
Saying hello to both men and women

613
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:23,208
Hello, brothers and sisters

614
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:24,833
That was Kai,

615
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,541
a teenager with nothing

616
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,291
but his brawn to call his own.

617
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,958
A guy who knew no sorrow.

618
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,250
Hey, that umbrella's for the camera!

619
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,208
Hey!

620
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,166
-I just set the mark with that!
-He had a smile

621
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,666
as big as a pond.

622
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,083
Hey, Kai!

623
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:11,208
Your father will hear about this.

624
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,875
As a surveyor,

625
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,083
every square meter of the forest
was my concern.

626
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,000
We were there to map the terrain,

627
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,416
not go on a camping trip.

628
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:23,833
Kai!

629
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,166
You go back down there

630
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,958
and find the boundary mark.

631
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,833
Again?

632
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,083
-Come on.
-I have been working since morning.

633
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,875
-This last one will only take a minute.
-I'm really tired.

634
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,916
Please!

635
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:43,333
And we weren't there

636
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:46,416
to pick the most scenic spot in the woods.

637
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,583
I'm so tired.

638
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:52,166
That one meal wasn't enough for this.

639
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,791
It's time to clock-out. I'm off.

640
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,166
-I'm hungry.
-Hey, gather up the gear before you go!

641
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:00,583
Hey!

642
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,791
Every day,

643
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:06,041
the locals would see
how democratically we worked together.

644
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,041
Kai carried the gear into the woods...

645
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,583
I say we are here, Norah
I love her so much

646
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,000
...and I carried it back out again.

647
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,458
Kai.

648
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,208
Give me a hand here.

649
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,041
Working hours are over.

650
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,708
Kai, do you know what time it is?

651
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,166
I ran as fast as I could.

652
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,000
Even so, working with Kai

653
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,791
-had its delights as well.
-Hey.

654
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,875
Try some of this grain with coconut.

655
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,916
Go on, it will spoil soon.

656
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,958
Come on, try it.

657
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:47,375
How is it?

658
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,333
Good, right?

659
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,208
Kai?

660
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,500
Archin! Look out below!

661
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,541
Kai, are you trying to kill me?

662
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,583
Kai was my assistant by day...

663
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:21,833
and my massage therapist by night.

664
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,916
I always thought of him
as a bit like my son,

665
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,041
even if he seemed
like my father sometimes.

666
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,583
But more than anything,
we were like brothers in the mine.

667
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,333
-Kai.
-Yes.

668
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:44,458
Pull it up.

669
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,750
Based on the map,

670
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,875
it looks like that old Kleum moved
this marker 20 feet further in.

671
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:51,416
What?

672
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,750
That's not right.

673
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,750
He's trying to cheat us.

674
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:56,916
Hey, you!

675
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,583
Get away from there!

676
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:00,625
Don't mess with my boundary markers.

677
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,916
-Get lost or I will kill you!
-Boss, get over here.

678
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,375
-I'll chop your head off.
-You moved the markers.

679
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,583
You're cheating the company.

680
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,208
Why should I care?

681
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,958
Just let me move the marker back.

682
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,416
An old guy like you

683
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,458
shouldn't waste your breath on this.

684
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,583
Are you mocking me?

685
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,291
-Are you mocking me, boy?
-He isn't.

686
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,083
-He's cursing you.
-I'll cut you!

687
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,958
-Stupid brats!
-Follow us if you can!

688
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,250
-I'll kill you!
-Follow me. I dare you!

689
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,416
Kai,

690
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,583
pull it up!

691
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,833
Do it and I'll cut you!

692
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,125
Then I'll shoot you.

693
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,791
Boss, I'm afraid.

694
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:01,625
I'll do it myself.

695
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,833
You're dead!

696
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,875
My sacred Buddha amulet has protected me!

697
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,958
Not even bullets can harm me now!

698
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,125
His holy power is watching over me.

699
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,375
He has protected my life.

700
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,583
Blessed guardian.

701
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,333
-Let me see that.
-Bullets cannot harm me.

702
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,958
I've never seen an amulet
that can stop bullets.

703
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,583
-Let me see.
-This is Phra Ruang.

704
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,708
-Here.
-This is an old and sacred relic.

705
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,333
He has taken the amulet off.

706
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,083
Kai, go move that marker.

707
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,958
You tricksters, give me my amulet back.

708
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:39,916
-Give it back.
-Move the marker and I'll give it back.

709
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,666
I'll kill you first.

710
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,833
I'll cut you.

711
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,541
The amulet's with me now.
Do you dare try it?

712
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,333
Okay then, let's give it a try!

713
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,541
I'll cut his head clean off!

714
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,791
Those who wear sacred images

715
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,125
-Don't!
-should know that cheating is a sin.

716
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,958
Sacred amulets
won't protect sinful people.

717
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:00,583
If I'm so sinful, why isn't there a bullet
inside me right now?

718
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,041
Because I didn't load the gun!

719
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,291
All right, move the marker
and give me my amulet back.

720
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,500
Boss.

721
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,416
As a reward for my bravery,

722
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:31,916
can I ride in the big boss's car
to watch a movie in town?

723
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,333
-That's not up to me.
-What?

724
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,166
Then how come you get to ride it?

725
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,625
Not a chance!

726
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,750
Archin and I sit in the front.

727
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,458
The big boss

728
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,833
and his woman sit in the back,
so how can you come along?

729
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,583
But, please, sir!

730
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:49,791
No! Not a chance.

731
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,958
I'll sit between the big boss
and the madam.

732
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,458
You're not their son.

733
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,916
Sitting in the middle
won't mean that I'm their son.

734
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:04,041
What about those two hookers
I saw sitting on either side of you?

735
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,583
Are you their son?

736
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,166
You want a ride?

737
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,291
Ride in the trunk!

738
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,416
Kai, we've got trouble.

739
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Kai,

740
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,041
how did you get here?

741
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,791
Come lend a hand with these durians.

742
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,208
I took the bus.

743
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:27,541
I rode in the trunk.

744
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,750
You said you came by bus.

745
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,666
Were you lying to me?

746
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,750
I was afraid you would be angry with me.

747
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,291
Well, why are you telling the truth now?

748
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:41,958
Aren't you afraid anymore?

749
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,458
I don't want to walk back.

750
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,291
If you come in the trunk,
you go back in the trunk.

751
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,791
He who lies,

752
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,625
rides in the trunk

753
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:03,791
along with the durian.

754
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:06,208
-Is that a good idea?
-It's a good idea, sir.

755
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,333
No, I'm just kidding.

756
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,833
You can ride at the front.

757
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:14,208
That's okay, I like it back there.

758
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,916
-Hey, Kai.
-That hurts!

759
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,375
These kinds of bruises,

760
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:32,958
I can treat them at my clinic.
They'll be gone in two days.

761
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,416
Come to the cemetery.

762
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,708
The cemetery? You go first.

763
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,041
With your age,
you're most likely to go there first.

764
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:41,333
Hey, where's your bike?

765
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,041
The tires blew out,

766
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,416
so the clerk told me to walk.

767
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,666
-That ass...
-Here's your mail.

768
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,750
TO ARCHIN PANJABHAN

769
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:54,875
Hello.

770
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:56,708
One, two, three.

771
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:10,041
The crying sound is calling me
Through the wind

772
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,208
It's like it wants me to sway by

773
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,333
It must be yours

774
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:15,541
-Is that your voice?
-Tong!

775
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,083
Tong, get home this instant!

776
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:21,958
-Wait. Why?
-Head back now!

777
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:26,541
It soothes my heart

778
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,541
-Come drink with me!
-No, thanks.

779
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:33,333
Archin, come up and dance with us!
The band's from Bangkok.

780
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:36,250
The crying sound is calling me
Through the wind

781
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:39,166
It seems like a promise
You'll love me forever

782
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:42,458
But when I really listen to it,

783
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:46,375
It seems like
You're just playing with my heart

784
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,333
WEDDING INVITATION

785
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,666
THE WEDDING OF WORAPHOL AND TIDAWAN

786
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,125
Hey, just burn it.

787
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,000
No!

788
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,208
I'll keep it,

789
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:56,708
just like how I've kept
a lock of her hair.

790
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:58,583
Forget about her.

791
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,833
Never.

792
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,208
I want to remember.

793
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,041
This will be a memento
of a woman's wicked ways.

794
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,916
Wicked ways don't need to be remembered.

795
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,708
You think I've kept mementos

796
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,833
of your wicked ways?

797
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,208
What have I done to you?

798
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:19,041
You complained about my soup
and threw it away.

799
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,458
That letter will only make you miserable.

800
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,083
Why would you keep it?

801
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,416
That night,

802
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,041
the reason I haven't gotten any mail
from Bangkok for months

803
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,083
finally became clear.

804
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:39,208
On that night, I thought

805
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,291
that love was the only thing
I had to look forward to.

806
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,166
I felt as if my future

807
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,166
had been smashed to bits.

808
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:57,916
STARVE NOW, DIE TOMORROW

809
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,250
"Dreamt in the past.

810
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,166
Starve now,

811
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,083
die tomorrow."

812
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:12,458
Why so much heartache, young man?

813
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,750
DREAMT IN THE PAST.

814
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,833
STRIVE NOW.

815
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:35,083
ENDURE.

816
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:38,791
Together, and without
either of us realizing it,

817
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,958
the relationship between
that old man from the countryside

818
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:44,833
and this messed-up university boy

819
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,333
became an unbreakable bond

820
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,333
in that hut deep in the woods.

821
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:54,250
That's how time went by for the miners.

822
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,083
Days, months, and years

823
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,291
were scooped in at the front

824
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:01,458
and dumped out through
the back of the dredger.

825
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:07,875
JUNIOR

826
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,750
Boss, it's the New Year.
Aren't you going anywhere?

827
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,791
I don't have money for that.

828
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,333
I hate you. Clean that up, asshole.

829
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,875
The earth that we dug up each day

830
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:29,833
would become letters
on the report tomorrow.

831
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,791
What's up? Your wife ran away?

832
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,250
Huan!

833
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:38,250
Black coffee. Double bitter!

834
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,333
Months and years of ups and downs

835
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,291
gradually made me charred and coarse.

836
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,916
I toiled away at work every day

837
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:50,083
so I could tell myself
that I wasn't an idler.

838
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:55,375
I pulled silly acts

839
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:57,333
for occasional amusement.

840
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,083
Too lonely to stay at home.

841
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,916
And I kept drinking liquor

842
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,916
-to soothe my dry throat.
-My glass is empty.

843
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:09,958
And your tab is full.

844
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,083
And you're not paying again.

845
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,291
The debts I had from all that drinking

846
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,125
soon turned into a large hand

847
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,666
that gripped me tight
and kept me from escaping.

848
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,791
-Hey!
-Oh, you fuckers!

849
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,166
You begged for drinks,

850
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,833
and now you're acting like thieves?

851
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,416
Whenever I drank,

852
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:49,583
it was like a magic spell
would come over me.

853
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:52,083
It made elephants look as tiny as pigs.

854
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:11,916
If you can't drink, why be born at all?

855
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,416
What you ought to say is,

856
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,916
"If you can't get a free drink,

857
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,291
why be born at all?"

858
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,791
If you don't respect the elders,

859
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,291
you'll get an old woman as a wife.

860
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:30,000
Booze was the rural folks'
main source of entertainment,

861
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,166
a vitamin

862
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,458
for their tired bodies

863
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,416
and a ray of light from an angel's halo

864
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,958
-that brightened their lonely hearts.
-Five, four.

865
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:44,750
The sound of you calling me
Comes along with the wind,

866
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:50,500
Like wanting to take me...

867
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,000
Hey, watch out.

868
01:03:55,208 --> 01:04:00,208
I know the voice comes from you

869
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:11,416
Just like what they say
The beauty's words can soothe the heart

870
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,625
-Of those who need it...
-Hey.

871
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,666
Hey, the boss is here.

872
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,916
What is it?

873
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,375
My wife's not around.

874
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:39,291
-So, no worries.
-It's party time.

875
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:57,708
Keep it

876
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,250
for when you're cold.

877
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,125
I mean, for when you're lonely.

878
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,583
No.

879
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,000
I mean cold.

880
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,791
No! Lonely!

881
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,708
Let's drink!

882
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:03,958
Cheese?

883
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,208
Only rats eat cheese!

884
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,791
Which one is the most expensive?

885
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,208
This one.

886
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,125
Solid gold from Switzerland.

887
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,583
A real leather strap.

888
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,583
It's 4,500 baht. Interested?

889
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,916
Isn't it beautiful, Archin?

890
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,666
Yes, it is.

891
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:29,958
I'll take it for 4,500 baht.

892
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,583
And I'm buying it for you.

893
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,875
The best watch

894
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:42,333
for the best watch seller!

895
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,750
Hey, stop.

896
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:54,250
Archin.

897
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,416
Give...

898
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:58,666
this little boy 100 baht.

899
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,291
For what?

900
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,083
He's got no shirt.

901
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,208
Give him the 100 baht.

902
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,083
Here, keep it.

903
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:11,000
I'll hold it. The kid will only lose it.

904
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,166
Get in line.

905
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,333
Go buy yourself a shirt.

906
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,958
How do Southerners say, "I love you"?

907
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,166
We say,

908
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:39,958
"I love you."

909
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,166
"I love you."

910
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,291
-Yes, "I love you."
-"I love you."

911
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:47,833
"I love you."

912
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:49,125
The slobs in the front office

913
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,708
aren't worth a miner's spit.

914
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:55,500
While they're out
buying lottery tickets in Phuket,

915
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,541
we're working our asses off,
digging for tin.

916
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,916
Say something! Come on!

917
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,041
At least, the people at the reception

918
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,541
are graduates from Penang.

919
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,416
Which school did you graduate from?

920
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,125
Archin, you finished school

921
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,666
or did school finish you?

922
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,708
I finished.

923
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,916
No brawling!

924
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,708
Remember who the boss is here.

925
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:53,916
Working hours are over!

926
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:56,166
You're right,

927
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,291
but this is my land,

928
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,291
and this is my house.

929
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:04,750
And your clothes

930
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,458
were bought with the money I paid you.

931
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,750
-Yes, that's right.
-Go on.

932
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,041
Why not take off your pants, too?

933
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,416
I paid for them, too.

934
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:35,541
I'm here to resign.

935
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,541
I crossed the line last night.

936
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,666
If you quit, then I had better quit too.

937
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,875
I was supposed to set a good example,

938
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,833
not get you boys drunk.

939
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,458
Hey! Wait.

940
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,541
I've got to get going.

941
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,833
To where?

942
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:08,916
-I want to get my hair cut in town.
-No need! Let's drink first.

943
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,416
No, it will be dark soon.
What if I see a ghost?

944
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,666
No need to go.

945
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,333
I'll cut your hair for you.

946
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:16,500
I can do it.

947
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,958
I used to be a good barber.

948
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,333
Drink!

949
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,416
Another one!

950
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,416
Bloody hell! Madam's here!

951
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,875
Oh, shit! She's here.

952
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,416
She's here.

953
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,625
Hey!

954
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,583
The boss told us to bring firewood.

955
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,291
Hey, Kai.

956
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:36,166
Where are you?

957
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,250
Give me a hand with the wood!

958
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,166
A bottle of whiskey, please.

959
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,625
Kai, who's that guy?

960
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,916
A local tribesman.

961
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,041
Come and sit! We're all humans.

962
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,041
I need medicine for a wound.
Someone got stabbed.

963
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,333
What's your name?

964
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:17,333
I don't know. You?

965
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,333
I'm Kai.

966
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,166
This is my boss, Archin.

967
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,875
This old drunkard is Tamah.

968
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:25,583
How old are you?

969
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,958
-Don't know.
-What?

970
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,166
Your folks never told you?

971
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,500
I don't have any.

972
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:34,166
"Don't have any"? How were you born, then?

973
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:37,208
Well, how were you born?

974
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,708
Moron!

975
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,416
I'll kick your ass!

976
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,750
Hey.

977
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:44,875
Those went bad ages ago,
why didn't you toss them out?

978
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,833
Toss them out? Are you nuts?

979
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,958
What are you, a public health officer?

980
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,500
A stab wound's likely to develop tetanus.

981
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,958
Hey, look.

982
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:58,291
He wants medicine. This is Merbromin.

983
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:01,041
These people are too scared
to go to a hospital.

984
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:03,916
-I would be crazy not to sell them to him.
-Have you eaten?

985
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,625
I only see you drinking.

986
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,208
What food are you talking about?

987
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:13,625
PRASART THONG MERBROMIN

988
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,833
Tomorrow, I'll bring you corn in exchange.

989
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:18,083
I won't accept spoiled ones, okay?

990
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,208
Okay!

991
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,416
You're rich enough to get the floor done.

992
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,833
Why are you so stingy?

993
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,875
You'll go to hell for sure.

994
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,791
In business,

995
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:35,166
there's no heaven and hell.

996
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:37,666
In business,

997
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:41,833
there's only profit and loss.

998
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:55,958
Hurry up, bring it in.

999
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:57,958
You carried it all this way?

1000
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:00,041
Come on. You're almost there.

1001
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,083
Oh, the corn looks nice and ripe.

1002
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:03,333
Come on in.

1003
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:06,041
Where was that guy stabbed?

1004
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,791
In the arm,
but it has stopped bleeding now.

1005
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,291
The medicine worked so well.

1006
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:13,583
We cleaned the wound with the first bottle

1007
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:15,541
and let him drink the rest.

1008
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,166
He drank the Merbromin?

1009
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,291
Yes.

1010
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,125
You are definitely going to hell now.

1011
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,708
You should be praying to God,
not the rain.

1012
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:01,041
You're hoping it'll wash away your sins?

1013
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:04,333
You know what I'm praying for?

1014
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,291
That they don't send you to prison?

1015
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,458
That the medicine's so old.

1016
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,291
It's as harmless as rainwater.

1017
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:32,541
And that was
the greedy merchant's morality. 

1018
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:35,500
The owner of a miserable shop
in the middle of nowhere,

1019
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:38,416
in one desperate moment of remorse,

1020
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,125
suddenly felt all his greed

1021
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,875
fall away.

1022
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:48,750
Go over there. Faster!

1023
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,333
Hey, could you write a letter for me?

1024
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:56,250
Sure,

1025
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:57,583
I'm all ears.

1026
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,250
Who's it for? The boss?

1027
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,333
No.

1028
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,916
It's for a woman.

1029
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,166
I want it written
in a sophisticated style.

1030
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:09,458
This Southern tongue doesn't have
enough syllables to charm a girl.

1031
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:10,916
This girl,

1032
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,166
does she know you're married?

1033
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,750
You scoundrel.

1034
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,083
-She doesn't?
-You!

1035
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,166
Mind your own business. Back to work!

1036
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,333
No, of course not.

1037
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:23,583
She's very pretty. Her name's Laied.

1038
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,583
She just moved in nearby with her brother.

1039
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,500
Mister.

1040
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,416
Who's out there?

1041
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,416
It's me.

1042
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,083
Mister.

1043
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,208
I got this letter last night.

1044
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:57,625
It's from Mr. John.

1045
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,541
Can you read it for me?

1046
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:03,541
I can't read.

1047
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,958
Did you know

1048
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:18,708
my brother's from Baytong?

1049
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,125
He's my cousin, actually.

1050
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,333
Guess what?

1051
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:25,666
I'll be 20 years old this year.

1052
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,333
We've got scars in the same place.

1053
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:10,166
Hey, Kai!

1054
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:13,375
Stay here and watch these things.

1055
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,791
I'll go get the car and come pick you up.

1056
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:52,666
One, two, three!

1057
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,666
One, two, three!

1058
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,708
Shit!

1059
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,041
We're screwed!

1060
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,416
The wood is swollen.

1061
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,916
The boss loves this one so much.
It's bloody expensive, too.

1062
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:03,541
When is he getting back from Phuket?

1063
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,458
I'd better get back to work.

1064
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,416
That was quite a storm last night.

1065
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:00,791
Yes.

1066
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm glad you made it across the river.

1067
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,541
With half of my bachelor's degree
completed,

1068
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,583
I had learned about work
from the miners...

1069
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:25,666
And I learned about empathy from the boss.

1070
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:31,500
So I, who had once been a careless kid,

1071
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:34,000
was now a very detail-oriented man

1072
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,958
who was studying every inch of the maps.

1073
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,083
I had to work hard

1074
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,000
to prove to myself

1075
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:44,000
that I was not just a leech in the mine.

1076
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,791
SENIOR

1077
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,208
That was the fourth year

1078
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,625
I had become like a missing person

1079
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:31,708
to my friends and family in Bangkok.

1080
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:33,083
Any letters for me?

1081
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:36,333
-No.
-In the fourth year,

1082
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,583
my face and my life
became so familiar in that town

1083
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,666
that it was as if
I had always been its native son.

1084
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,250
Looks like it'll rain during the New Year.

1085
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:47,000
If you can stop the rain from falling,

1086
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,750
then you won't have to worry
when it falls.

1087
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,833
Happy New Year!

1088
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:02,958
Those four years,

1089
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:06,791
We didn't have any bus to ride
to and from work.

1090
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,583
When in the doctor's hands,
Norah is no longer worried

1091
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:11,250
Under the burning sun
and the pouring rain,

1092
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,333
we would walk to the dredger,

1093
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,291
-which inched forward every hour,
-Drunk Archin scrubbing off his dead skin

1094
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,875
and then back to the crumbling hut.

1095
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,083
What the hell?

1096
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:32,208
Sometimes, the rain would pour down
for ten days straight.

1097
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,583
It was too much that we got fed up.

1098
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:38,708
The mountains got so soaked
that they crumbled,

1099
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:40,541
and the tree leaves
wouldn't lift their heads.

1100
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:43,041
Stop now!

1101
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,583
Stop now!

1102
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:51,291
What's the rush, fucker?

1103
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:54,791
Those Southern rains came down so hard,

1104
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:58,041
that I realized,
if we had been mining for rainwater,

1105
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:01,000
we would all be rich by now.

1106
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:07,958
Finally,

1107
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:11,000
we surrendered to the forces of nature.

1108
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:15,458
We must learn to be people of the forest,

1109
01:25:18,416 --> 01:25:20,083
children of the cold,

1110
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:24,208
and friends to the constant rain.

1111
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,291
Down in this valley,
with mountains around us

1112
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:37,250
and a ceiling of clouds
that kept pouring rain,

1113
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:39,083
our destinies

1114
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:41,291
fused together,

1115
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,208
like separate paths that merged into one.

1116
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,833
The lifeline of the tin mine

1117
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:18,125
had once again been stretched to its limit

1118
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:21,916
when we reached a challenging area.

1119
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,083
-The dredger got stuck for a month,
-To the right.

1120
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:28,000
two months,

1121
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:31,041
and then three.

1122
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,916
We lost all hope of finding tin.

1123
01:26:40,916 --> 01:26:42,416
All we were mining was mud.

1124
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,750
The money in the office was running out.

1125
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:49,541
We were forced to dig through
our waste dump,

1126
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:53,166
searching for tin scraps
to sell as salvaged pieces.

1127
01:26:56,625 --> 01:27:00,333
Mr. Sam became best friends
with liquor and loneliness.

1128
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:04,125
And his brother grew quieter

1129
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,416
and quieter,

1130
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,166
until he eventually resigned.

1131
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:10,208
I later found out

1132
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:13,500
it was the map-maker's negligence
that had done us in.

1133
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,583
What he should have noted

1134
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:18,333
in Western measurements

1135
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,666
as "0.01 tin per cubic foot"

1136
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:24,333
was accidentally noted as "6.01."

1137
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:38,416
Finally,

1138
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:41,041
we could free the dredger
from the mountain fork.

1139
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:44,166
But the home office needed a new engineer.

1140
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:46,833
Fall in!

1141
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:50,333
Attention!

1142
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,166
His name was Mr. Norman.

1143
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:11,916
This is the new engineer they've sent us?

1144
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,541
The insurance company in Penang decided

1145
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:19,083
they would only cover us if we had
two non-Thai bosses on the books.

1146
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:22,833
Well,

1147
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:26,375
you'll have your work cut out for you,
training this guy.

1148
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,708
As if.

1149
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,000
When I'm looking for another job, that is.

1150
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:42,083
If I don't quit now,

1151
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:45,375
people down here will spit in my face.

1152
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,166
They'll think,

1153
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:48,625
"John has sold himself out,

1154
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:53,041
taking orders from a clown like this
just for a pittance."

1155
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:13,208
Don't worry, I won't die!

1156
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:50,625
I'm Lert.

1157
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:54,416
The foreign boss sent me over from Ranong.

1158
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,291
I'm your new chief of staff.

1159
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:58,083
I'm the chief of the staff here...

1160
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,000
but I'm resigning today.

1161
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:03,708
The name's John.

1162
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,666
Oh, John.

1163
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:07,291
I've heard about you.

1164
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,791
Why are you quitting?

1165
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,791
A guy like me can find work anywhere.

1166
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,708
I would say the same about myself.

1167
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:14,416
I can fit in anywhere.

1168
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,875
Where are you planning to stay?

1169
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,791
You might as well use my place.

1170
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,416
I won't be using it anymore.

1171
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,833
If I won't work here,
I won't sleep here either.

1172
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:24,708
Me neither.

1173
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:26,583
If I'm not working here yet,

1174
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:28,291
I'm not sleeping here either.

1175
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:30,458
As for the place you're offering me,

1176
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,083
why not leave it for the termites instead?

1177
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:39,333
We haven't exchanged any blows yet.

1178
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:40,875
Too bad the bell already rang.

1179
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:49,833
Here's your black coffee.

1180
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:51,333
Double bitter, right?

1181
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,541
That asshole Lert
needs a kick in the teeth.

1182
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,541
No.

1183
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,333
If I were a stranger in a new place,

1184
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,416
I would have done the same thing.

1185
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:10,291
Anyway, no matter what happens,

1186
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,583
be sure to take care of Laied for me.

1187
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:24,208
Time went by, following
the undeterred course of the sun.

1188
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,541
My senior year courses proved to be

1189
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,333
the most difficult yet.

1190
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:35,666
After John showed us

1191
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:38,291
the vicissitudes of life

1192
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,166
by quitting,

1193
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:45,333
Huan got caught in the jaws of the dredger

1194
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,916
and had to sacrifice
one of his legs to the mine.

1195
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:56,916
And Jieng,

1196
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,958
that cloud-watching pal of mine,

1197
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:02,291
dreamt himself
right into the middle of a flash flood.

1198
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,500
But it was Lert

1199
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,500
who was the biggest problem
I had to solve.

1200
01:32:12,625 --> 01:32:14,541
You guys need to remeasure
out here every day?

1201
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:16,416
If I want to.

1202
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:21,291
Be careful, that compass's strap
is wearing thin.

1203
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,041
Everything here is old.

1204
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,750
The dredger's starting to sink as well.

1205
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:30,416
Then we need to start fixing things.

1206
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:33,666
Whenever you say so.

1207
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:36,291
I had decided to act on my wish

1208
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,916
for John to return
by surveying the area in complete detail.

1209
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:42,083
I was searching for anything
that might prove

1210
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:44,750
that John was a better foreman than Lert.

1211
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,083
Archin,

1212
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:50,166
didn't we just measure
this section yesterday?

1213
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:53,875
Yes, but I have to prove
that Lert is the wrong man for this job.

1214
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,250
If he finds less tin
than John finds in a week,

1215
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:00,958
I'll make sure
everyone else knows about it.

1216
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:03,041
I want this area completely clean, got it?

1217
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:05,333
Be efficient.

1218
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:09,666
Take last night's diggings to
the dredger first, then come pick me up.

1219
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,875
Fifteen barrels, sir.

1220
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:14,916
-Is that all?
-Yes.

1221
01:33:18,708 --> 01:33:20,041
Oh, shit!

1222
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:33,875
What the hell are you doing?

1223
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:36,541
My compass fell in the water.
I have to get it.

1224
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,416
Get out!
Do you want to get yourself killed?

1225
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,958
The engine is running
and the drill pipe is right down there.

1226
01:33:43,041 --> 01:33:45,291
Even an elephant could get
sucked down that hole!

1227
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,083
Guys, stop the engine!

1228
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:12,875
I can't find it.

1229
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,250
I remember that moment vividly,

1230
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:32,916
the moment Lert dove down

1231
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:37,291
to find the weapon
I had planned to kill him with.

1232
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,958
Those were the days

1233
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:44,333
when everything seemed
to be hanging desperately.

1234
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:47,666
Although we were getting
smaller amounts of tin each day,

1235
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:49,416
Lert...

1236
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:53,166
seemed to be gradually winning over
everyone's hearts...

1237
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:55,833
You better wear this helmet instead.

1238
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:58,666
It'll give your thick skull
more protection than that tweed cap.

1239
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,541
-Fine. I'll wear it.
-Stop using this.

1240
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:01,666
Good. I'll wear this instead.

1241
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,666
...even the tough-hearted Kong

1242
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,416
began to call our new foreman "Chief."

1243
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,791
You want a smack to your head?

1244
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,708
Weng, you're showing off!

1245
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,333
How many?

1246
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:19,583
-Fifty.
-Fifty?

1247
01:35:19,666 --> 01:35:20,916
Double yesterday's haul.

1248
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,791
I can't remember the last time

1249
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41,958
-I could fully breathe like this.
-Finally!

1250
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,083
Haul it!

1251
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:53,958
Hey! The ladder!
The dredging ladder has snapped!

1252
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:56,500
Stop the engine!

1253
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,583
We are doomed.

1254
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:02,916
It was an accident none of us saw coming.

1255
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:08,083
As we waited for the reaction
from the Penang office,

1256
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:14,500
you could hear every miner's heart
beating heavily with hope.

1257
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:45,041
I've received a reply from Penang.

1258
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:47,791
Close down the mine.

1259
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,083
We're out of business.

1260
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:08,083
Our tin mine was broken down
and sold off for scrap.

1261
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:22,083
The dredger became forsaken

1262
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:25,833
and as empty as a giant metal coffin.

1263
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,916
We opened less office windows
with each passing day.

1264
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,083
Eventually,
only the night watchman remained.

1265
01:38:34,666 --> 01:38:37,000
We had all worked together
for so many years

1266
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,791
only to go our separate ways again.

1267
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,791
We were all wanderers once more.

1268
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,208
We'll head for this address in Surat

1269
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,541
and wait for you there.

1270
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:51,791
Okay,

1271
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:55,541
but I'm waiting for a certificate
from the boss to put up at home.

1272
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:56,833
It might take a few days.

1273
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:00,625
Archin,

1274
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:03,166
even if you killed me,

1275
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:04,500
I would love you just the same.

1276
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:30,333
Your certificate has to be
better than others'.

1277
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,125
I woke up at the tin mine
that final morning.

1278
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:49,166
I felt that the same old days

1279
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,708
-have ended.
-Got any black coffee?

1280
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:52,625
I already packed up the coffee pot.

1281
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:55,583
Want to chew on some dry coffee grounds?

1282
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:00,666
Mr. Sam bought me
a plane ticket back to Bangkok

1283
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,416
as a last token of his appreciation.

1284
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,250
Hey, kid. I guess I'll head off first.

1285
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:08,416
With only that?

1286
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,583
I came here with only this.

1287
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:15,166
Might as well go the way I came.

1288
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:19,041
Besides, I'm proud of my uniform.
I wear it with honor.

1289
01:40:20,291 --> 01:40:21,333
So long.

1290
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,041
Well...

1291
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,291
What?

1292
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,375
Old Man Dang's right, you know.

1293
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:36,916
I like it.

1294
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:38,666
Well said.

1295
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:42,708
He said he would go the way he came.

1296
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:45,958
Maybe you should do the same.

1297
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:48,458
You came here without debt.

1298
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:51,166
How about paying for your tab
before you go?

1299
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:54,083
Look here.

1300
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:55,791
Here.

1301
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:59,791
-Take it all.
-Thanks, kid.

1302
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:03,416
-That's all I've got.
-I left the tin mine

1303
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:05,958
with the same amount of money I came with.

1304
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:07,583
Not a single baht.

1305
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,583
Good luck!

1306
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:19,958
The tin mine had become
a memory of my precious past,

1307
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:23,791
and it would remain
a part of my inner life forever.

1308
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:27,875
Hey, take a look.

1309
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,416
Stop here for a minute.

1310
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:46,416
I guess this is goodbye.

1311
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:01,583
Archin.

1312
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:05,583
How much does it cost to get to Bangkok?

1313
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:10,583
You've got plenty of time
to think about that.

1314
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,416
Bangkok's so far away.

1315
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:25,166
I don't think I might reach it.

1316
01:42:28,416 --> 01:42:30,833
I would no longer exist here.

1317
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:32,458
Even my shadow

1318
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:35,500
followed me home to Bangkok.

1319
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:39,291
My unfinished future seemed to
have collapsed once again

1320
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:42,583
just as I had seen it happen
once or twice in the past.

1321
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,708
In the four years
I had spent at the tin mine,

1322
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:50,083
freshmen at regular universities

1323
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:53,166
would have graduated by then.

1324
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:56,583
As for me, I had no diploma

1325
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:59,291
to carry home from the tin mine.

1326
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:02,500
Instead, my hand held something 

1327
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:05,458
that could never be taken away from me,

1328
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,291
from a school no one knew about.

1329
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:53,583
IN 1953, ARCHIN FINALLY WENT HOME
TO BANGKOK

1330
01:44:53,666 --> 01:44:56,500
AFTER SPENDING 3 YEARS AND 11 MONTHS
OF HIS LIFE AT THE KRASOM TIN MINE.

1331
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,333
IN 1954, ARCHIN'S FIRST
TIN MINE SHORT STORY

1332
01:44:59,416 --> 01:45:02,291
BECAME A FAVORITE AMONG THAI READERS.

1333
01:45:02,833 --> 01:45:04,708
IN 1984, ARCHIN'S BOOK
OF TIN MINE STORIES

1334
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:08,500
HAD AROUND 142 CHAPTERS.

1335
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:11,000
IN 1991, ARCHIN WAS NAMED
A NATIONAL ARTIST

1336
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:14,875
BY THAILAND'S MINISTRY OF CULTURE.

1337
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:19,125
IN 2005, THE SHORT STORIES
WERE ADAPTED INTO A MOTION PICTURE,

1338
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:23,916
WHICH ALLOWED FOR A REUNION
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL ALIVE.

1339
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:29,250
Where did you work
during the past few years?

1340
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:31,416
-At a private company.
-For the Tawee Brothers?

1341
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,875
-Right, that one.
-I know it.

1342
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:34,541
-That big company in Phuket.
-Yes.

1343
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:35,500
Let's go.

1344
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:39,375
Give me a hand, I've gotten old.

1345
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:43,416
You too, but you've still
got to take care of me.

1346
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:45,750
-Let me do it.
-Okay.

1347
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:47,541
-Let me take your hand.
-Okay.

1348
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,250
I'm 77 years old now.

1349
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,000
-I am...
-You're 75.

1350
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:52,708
-You're 75. A few years younger.
-I'm 73.

1351
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,208
-Right, 73.
-Yes, 73.

1352
01:45:55,666 --> 01:45:57,958
Well, we met again
because of that book I wrote.

1353
01:45:58,041 --> 01:45:58,958
That's right.

1354
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:00,791
Remember when you helped me
with the survey?

1355
01:46:00,875 --> 01:46:01,833
I do.

1356
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:49,916
