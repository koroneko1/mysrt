1
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,000
What's going on? Are you sick?

2
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,519
Don't be stubborn.

3
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,879
You've never acted like this before.

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,640
Your Grandma has been waiting.
Come inside.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,760
Come on, give it to me.

6
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,000
No!

7
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,280
Sweetie,

8
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,560
would you like to move
to your dad's house in Rayong?

9
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,879
No. Why would I?

10
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,959
He doesn't want me to go live with him.

11
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,280
It's not like that.

12
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,640
He knows you're a big boy,

13
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,959
and you have to look after Grandma here.

14
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,640
So why don't you just move there with me?

15
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,200
I can't, dear.

16
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,760
Can't you see I'm an old woman?

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
I don't want to move anywhere.

18
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
You're selfish.

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Do you still have some left?

20
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,680
You know how to do it?

21
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,960
-Show me.
-Look.

22
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
-See?
-Do you have to blow it hard?

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Let's do it together. One, two.

25
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,919
Damn it!

26
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,520
Yuck!

27
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,639
-I didn't know how to do it.
-What did you do?

28
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,319
You're lousy at it! Solid hits on him!

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,680
-Eat this one! Eat it!
-No! no!

30
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,800
Eat this one!

31
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,680
Grandma!

32
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,360
Grandma!

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,159
Grilled chicken! I love grilled chicken!

34
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,719
My favorite.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,879
So who will say grace?

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,479
Me again?

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,199
-The last one to arrive will do it.
-Yes.

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,639
What are you chewing, Tong?

39
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,000
Is it chewing gum again? Spit it out now!

40
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,800
How many times I've told you
not to chew gum?

41
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,879
What if you choke on it?

42
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,159
Tang, you should tell your brother!

43
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,479
Come on. He's already spat it out.

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

45
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,960
Bless us, Our Lord, and thy gifts

46
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,800
which we are about to receive

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,199
from thy bounty through Christ Our Lord.

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
Amen.

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,639
Grandma.

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,959
Grandma.

51
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,519
Are you angry at me, Grandma?

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Grandma!

53
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,360
What are you playing?

54
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,639
You'll wreck Grandpa's piano
if you play it like that.

55
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,639
Move over.

56
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,720
This is how you should play it.

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,839
Why do you like this song?

58
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,720
Your Grandpa played it to me all the time.

59
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,360
He must be really good.

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,879
Sure he was.

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,199
Do you want to play as well as he did?

62
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,000
Why should I?

63
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,839
Maybe one day,

64
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,800
you can use a song
to say something to someone.

65
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,879
Just like your Grandpa did to me.

66
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,399
What did Grandpa say to you?

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,079
Listen.

68
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,319
He said he missed you.

69
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,600
One day if Grandpa came back
and nobody's here,

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,519
he'd feel very lonely.

71
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Sweetie, stay with me for a while, okay?

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,240
What should we do after school?

73
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,199
-Man, what are you up to?
-Damn you!

74
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,160
That's harsh.

75
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
-Harsh?
-Hey, look at him.

76
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,680
-Is that Mew?
-Mew, the piano player.

77
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,839
The queeny one.

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,199
Hello, Mew.

79
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,519
Hey, let's go. Tease him.

80
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,600
Can we see your big dick?

81
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,680
-Can I see?
-Grab him.

82
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,800
Let me go.

83
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,839
-Hey, you!
-Damn it!

84
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,920
You jerk!

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,839
Shit!

86
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,920
You still got the nerve.

87
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,800
Do you really think you can hide it?

88
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,440
Of course.

89
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,960
You'll get a good one.

90
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
We're home.

91
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,399
Aren't you going to give me a hand?

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,759
Tong.

93
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,559
-Not helping?
-Have you cleaned out the supermarket?

94
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,879
I forgot to tell you that I have to go
to Chiang Mai on business this weekend.

95
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
I'll take you guys along.

96
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,519
Chiang Mai!
Yes, we're going to Chiang Mai.

97
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,840
I've bought you a shirt.

98
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,879
-Tong.
-Thank you.

99
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,399
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,879
So I'll be as cool as you are, dad.

101
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,759
-Do you call that cool? Here's your shirt.
-It's lovely.

102
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,919
That fits you.

103
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,279
I don't like purple.

104
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
It's yellow!

105
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,759
Purple!

106
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
It's yellow!

107
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,559
Take off the shades and look.

108
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,240
You take it.

109
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,759
It's really yellow.

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,840
What happened to your eye?

111
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,320
-A football hit me.
-A softball.

112
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,639
So what is it?

113
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,320
-A football.
-A softball.

114
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,919
Are you sure it's a football?

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,039
I swear. An accident with a football.

116
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,679
Yes. A football, sir.

117
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,120
You want me to knock out the other one.

118
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,679
Tang, are you done?

119
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,759
Yes.

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,320
There's no need to bring
a lot of stuff along.

121
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,879
Mom...

122
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,720
can I stay on for a few more days
with friends?

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,759
I already asked dad,

124
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,559
but he told me to ask you.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,519
Please, mom, please, please.

126
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,120
She's a big girl.
It won't hurt her to go out with friends.

127
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,080
Hey, what's up? I'm back!

128
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,200
Did you have a good time?

129
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,279
I did. Here's a souvenir for your Grandma.

130
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,840
And this one is for you, Mew.

131
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,759
What is it?

132
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,840
"A little palm in the garden."

133
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,200
What is it?

134
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't know. It's a treasure hunt.

135
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,879
Look at the back.

136
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,919
A LITTLE PALM IN THE GARDEN

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,200
A PIER

138
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,799
Why so complicated?

139
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
Don't you think it's fun?

140
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,480
Yes.

141
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,519
It's kind of fun.

142
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,399
How did you know this game?

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,080
My dad.

144
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
That's the way we give presents
to each other at home.

145
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
Your house must be a lot of fun.

146
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,039
A LOPSIDED TREE BY THE RIVER

147
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Are you done?

148
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm off.

149
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,279
Yes.

150
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,919
Go.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Too bad...

152
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,039
the nose is missing.

153
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,360
It's okay.
I'm happy enough you bought it for me.

154
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,159
Are you sure?

155
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,600
Well...

156
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,000
You'd better ask your mother.

157
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,600
So are you coming home?

158
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,399
Not yet. I mean...

159
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,679
You said you'd be back today.

160
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,440
Just one more day, Mom.
I'll be home on the 24th.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Okay.

162
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Give you an inch you ask for a mile,
next time I won't let you go on your own.

163
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
Thanks a lot!

164
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,200
Come on, she's a big girl.
Don't be too strict.

165
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,919
You always give in to her.

166
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,799
Aren't you worried,
young girls traveling by themselves?

167
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,399
TONG'S CHRISTMAS SCHOOL PLAY

168
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,080
Silent night

169
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,840
Holy night

170
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,200
Son of God

171
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,519
Love's pure light

172
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,399
Radiant beams from

173
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,639
The holy face

174
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
With the dawn

175
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,279
Of redeeming grace

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,279
Jesus, Lord

177
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,039
At thy birth

178
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth

179
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,279
Hello.

180
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,600
Grandma, he's over there.

181
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,519
I haven't finished here.

182
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
Are you with Mew?

183
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,240
You go back with Mew's Grandma first.

184
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,559
Yes, Mom.

185
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Tong, come take a photo with us.

186
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,600
Go stand next to Mew.

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,039
Put your arms around each other.

188
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,440
Say cheese.

189
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,120
Hail Mary, full of grace.

190
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,879
The Lord is with you,
blessed are you among women,

191
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,799
and blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

192
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,279
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

193
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,240
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.

194
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,240
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

195
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,039
Tong.

196
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,720
After we got back from Chiang Mai,

197
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,759
Tang stayed on and went trekking
with her friends in the jungle...

198
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
and she must have gotten the wrong path.

199
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
Now she's gone missing.

200
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,120
Maybe she must have gotten lost.

201
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,640
The jungle is so big.

202
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
Tang probably can't find her way back out.

203
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,799
What will you do, Tong?

204
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,599
Tong said he's still waiting
for his sister to come back.

205
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Do you think she'll be all right?

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,519
THE HIGHEST SPOT OF THAILAND

207
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,640
If we hadn't let her go...

208
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,519
If we had told her to come home...

209
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,279
In the name of Father--

210
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,359
Tong.

211
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
No need to do that.

212
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Sunee.

213
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,839
Tong.

214
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,359
Mew...

215
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,799
we're going to be moving.

216
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,799
Are you not going to wait for Tang?

217
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,039
Not now, Mom.

218
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,400
-Why not?
-I want to hear this song first.

219
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,240
Do you have an extra class today?

220
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,400
Yes.

221
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,720
What time should I pick you up?

222
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,519
I'll call you.

223
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,519
Watch the bag for me, Jeng.

224
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,759
Okay, go.

225
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,000
Tong.

226
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,759
Tong.

227
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,880
Your phone.

228
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
What the...?

229
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
Yeah, what's up?

230
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,200
Let's meet up tonight.

231
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,359
What do you forget?

232
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,440
Don't drink too much.

233
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,000
I know.

234
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,599
-Who are you looking for?
-Mew.

235
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Over there.

236
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,160
Hi, Mew. Hi, X.

237
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,759
How are you?

238
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,079
Did you hear our song playing
on the school's loudspeakers?

239
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,279
I did.

240
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,079
What did Odd say?

241
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,359
He said it's cool.

242
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Hey, wait. Please listen to me!

243
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,880
I think your song is brilliant.

244
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,200
But let me give you some advice

245
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,319
about the lyrics.

246
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,400
You should make it more accessible.

247
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,920
You should write songs
that can reach everybody.

248
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,359
But plenty of people
already like our song.

249
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
That's true.

250
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,599
But don't you want an even wider audience?

251
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,799
Musically, you're brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

252
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,440
I can see that you're trying

253
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,359
to introduce a new sound to pop music.

254
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
That's perfect.

255
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,240
But why don't you make it more accessible?

256
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,039
You should write songs about the feelings

257
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,039
that everybody can identify with.

258
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,839
That will be even better for you.

259
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
For example?

260
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
Love songs, young man.

261
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,960
95 percent of all chart-toppers
are love songs.

262
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,160
I think it's only natural
for a man of your age

263
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
to be inspired to write love songs.

264
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,799
Really?

265
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,079
Yes. Believe me. At least try.

266
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,799
Odd.

267
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,559
June, come inside.

268
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes.

269
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,200
Boys, this is June.

270
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,279
Hello.

271
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,480
From now on,
June will take care of you guys.

272
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
She'll arrange your practice sessions
and book shows.

273
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
Now let's get back
to talk about love songs.

274
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,519
I really want one to use
as your debut single.

275
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,119
Mew, can you do it quickly?

276
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,279
Why didn't you answer my call?

277
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,559
I was busy, studying, playing football.

278
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,359
Football?

279
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,680
You've been really cold to me, Tong.

280
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,920
Have I?

281
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,559
What's on your mind?

282
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,000
Don't you want to be
my boyfriend anymore?

283
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,319
I don't know.

284
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,400
Why, Tong?

285
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,799
You don't love me anymore?

286
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,240
June is really cute.

287
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,559
Well-observed.

288
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,799
Where are you going?

289
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,559
June reminds me of someone I know.

290
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,119
-Who's that?
-Mew.

291
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,839
-I'm not sure.
-Mew!

292
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
Hey, guys!

293
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,799
-Can you ask June to call me instead?
-Listen.

294
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,519
-Same old you.
-Our album is sold out.

295
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,279
-What?
-What?

296
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,119
Our album is sold out!

297
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,519
Isn't that totally awesome?

298
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,839
-Really?
-Yes.

299
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,559
If it's selling,
why does he want me to change the lyrics?

300
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
Forget it. Let's go rehearse.

301
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,440
Do you have the album by the band August?

302
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,519
It's sold out.

303
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,359
But one of the band members
was here just now.

304
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,720
Go ask him. He's over there.

305
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,359
-Tong?
-Mew?

306
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,279
-Yes.
-How are you? I haven't seen you in ages.

307
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,440
It's nothing much going on.

308
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,839
-And you?
-Same here.

309
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,119
Are you in the band?

310
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,119
Yes, I'm the lead singer of August.

311
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,759
Hi.

312
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,759
-How do you know that, Tong?
-The guy at the stall told me.

313
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm here to buy your CD but it's sold out.

314
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,839
Really? I can make you a copy.

315
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,400
It's all right. I'd rather buy it.

316
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,799
You might have to wait for a while.

317
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,920
The sold-out album
might not get re-released.

318
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,480
Well...

319
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,559
give me your number,

320
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,079
I'll make a copy
and we can arrange to meet here tomorrow.

321
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,680
Okay.

322
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,599
It's zero, eight, three...

323
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,960
-nine, zero, one...
-Mew.

324
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,000
eight, three, two, zero.

325
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,680
I'll ring you.

326
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,880
How was school?

327
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,279
It's fine.

328
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,680
Which subject did you study today?

329
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,559
Chemistry.

330
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,720
Could you follow the lesson?

331
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,480
Sure. Why?

332
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,000
Because your book
is still in the back of the car.

333
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,880
We studied from VDO and hand-out sheets.

334
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
Are you sure you went to class?

335
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,000
Of course.

336
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,480
Why such a long face?

337
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Mom's always nagging me.
She can just complain about anything.

338
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,119
What did you do to her?

339
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,200
I didn't do anything.

340
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,480
Mew, what are you up to?

341
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,480
I'm writing a song.

342
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,640
What is it about?

343
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,640
About...

344
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
love.

345
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Love?

346
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
It should be a piece of cake.

347
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,400
Well,

348
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,079
I just don't know...

349
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,680
what it feels like.

350
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,920
You still don't have a girlfriend?

351
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,839
Really? You still don't have a girlfriend?

352
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
Really, Mew?

353
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,519
I shouldn't say more.

354
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,039
If you want to know what it feels like,
I can help by being your girlfriend, okay?

355
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,160
You're nuts!

356
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
-Why?
-No.

357
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,519
Ah Ying!

358
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,799
Ah Ying! Come back home!

359
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,759
-I have to get going.
-Okay.

360
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,440
Think about what I said.
It's only natural.

361
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,920
I will.

362
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,240
Wait, Tong.

363
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,640
Set another plate for Tang.

364
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,039
Tang isn't here anymore.

365
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,039
She's not coming back again.

366
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,680
HOW TO WIN A MAN'S HEART

367
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,799
TAKE SOME HAIR OF A PERSON YOU LIKE,
PUT IN TEDDY BEAR

368
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,839
PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW

369
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,079
Who's that?

370
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,559
It's Mew.

371
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,680
Mew, what's up?

372
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,319
I'll bring a CD

373
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
to Siam Square tomorrow.

374
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,799
Sure. What time?

375
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,640
In the afternoon.

376
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,160
Hello. Tong!

377
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,440
I'll call you tomorrow.

378
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,519
Sure.

379
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,000
See you then.

380
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,719
You haven't taken a shower yet?

381
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
I am going to.

382
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,559
Hey.

383
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,159
What the hell is wrong with you?

384
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,519
-Why are you so fucking quiet?
-Tong.

385
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,559
Did you have a fight with Donut yesterday?

386
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,559
Where did you hear that?

387
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,199
I chatted online with her friend.

388
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,639
What did she tell you?

389
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,079
She said you're a jerk
who never cares about her feeling.

390
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,800
So you've slept with her
and now you're going to dump her?

391
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,360
I don't get it.

392
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,760
Donut has so many boys
lining up to be with her,

393
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,199
but she chose you.

394
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,239
Why don't you take care of her?

395
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
I don't know.

396
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,599
This is how I am. She'll never understand.

397
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,360
You're an idiot.

398
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,599
Really, Tong,
do you want to break up with her?

399
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,159
Hello, Donut?

400
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,199
Draw a slip from the box

401
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,760
and perform the resuscitation technique
indicated on it.

402
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,360
-Banjong.
-Yes, teacher.

403
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,280
Pick one.

404
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,159
Pick it!

405
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,800
Quickly!

406
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,000
CPR.

407
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,599
What is CPR?

408
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,559
I've already taught you that one.

409
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,320
-Should I flunk you?
-I just know.

410
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,480
Seriously, teacher?

411
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,679
Or will you take a zero?

412
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,079
Hey! Hey!

413
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:43,000
Do it!

414
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,280
Don't close your eyes!

415
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,519
Mew, you creep!

416
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,199
Why did you French me?

417
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,400
Asshole, I didn't.

418
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,239
Your tongue was in my mouth!

419
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,440
Shut up, idiot!

420
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,599
Saliva.

421
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,840
AUGUST BAND'S MEMBERS

422
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,360
X, where is Mew?

423
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,320
I have no idea.

424
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,800
X, I heard you and Mew did a tongue kiss?

425
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,000
Hey, I'm only curious.

426
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,679
The number you're trying to reach
cannot be connected.

427
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,159
The number you're trying to reach
cannot be connected.

428
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,719
You still have it.

429
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,639
Yes.

430
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,039
-Mew.
-Yes?

431
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,159
Play me that song.

432
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,360
Which song?

433
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,079
The one you played when we were children.

434
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,360
This one?

435
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,639
Someone has moved into my old house?

436
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,679
Yes.

437
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
Did you see her come back?

438
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,920
Who?

439
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,480
It's nothing.

440
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,519
You haven't forgotten about her.

441
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,159
If you had a chance to see Tang again,

442
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,679
what would you say to her?

443
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,960
I don't know.

444
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,239
Maybe I'll ask her...

445
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
why.

446
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,960
Why what?

447
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,519
Why did she leave us?

448
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,320
It's not her fault to leave you.

449
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,079
I don't know you have a guest.

450
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,519
I'd like to borrow a dictionary,
but I can come back later.

451
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,960
That's all right.

452
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,440
Mew, I should go home.

453
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,039
I can walk you out.

454
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,280
No worries, find her a dictionary.

455
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,559
See you.

456
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,360
Is he your friend?

457
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,119
He's cute!

458
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,199
Ying!
You never stay home, always at Mew's.

459
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,679
If everyone knows,
it might be talk of the town.

460
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,480
-Too bad.
-Grandma, there's no need to worry.

461
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,400
Everybody around here knows Mew is gay.

462
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,440
Watch what you're saying! Mew isn't gay.

463
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,519
He's a real man!

464
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,159
Brother, you're such a foul-mouthed!

465
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,320
It's been a long time

466
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,920
Since we parted

467
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,159
It's beautiful, really beautiful.

468
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm going to release this single
to promote your band.

469
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,719
-June, this evening take them to practice.
-Yes.

470
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,960
Book a studio at Saw Record for them.

471
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,239
Sure, boss.

472
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,719
It's beautiful.

473
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,360
Where was Tang when we took this photo?

474
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
I don't know,
maybe she'd already left with her friends.

475
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:14,239
Why don't you put a photo
that has Tang in?

476
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,679
Because she's not here anymore.

477
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,920
Mew.

478
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,039
How do you play the G#Aug7 chord?

479
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,320
Ask Wan, he plays the keyboard.

480
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,119
G#.

481
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:42,119
C.

482
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,840
-E.
-E.

483
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:45,599
G.

484
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:46,840
And maybe F#.

485
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,960
Yes, it's F#.

486
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:49,360
-F#.
-F#.

487
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,480
-Here.
-It's complicated.

488
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,719
Yes, just like that.

489
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,239
F#

490
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,480
G#Aug7.

491
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:01,719
It's a devil chord!

492
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:11,360
Are you upset with him?

493
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:14,000
No, nothing.

494
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,079
You're in the same band.
Talk to him nicely, don't fight.

495
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,280
It's just a nonsense.

496
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,239
They say only people who care deeply
about each other

497
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,360
fight over nonsensical stuff.

498
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,280
So it's true!

499
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,440
You're nuts!

500
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,360
That's not it.

501
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,039
Okay.

502
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,960
Break's over.
Let's get back to the studio.

503
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:47,960
I'll go buy some snack.

504
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,679
-Do you want something?
-Yes, yes.

505
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,880
-Two crispy crackers.
-And a pack of Lay's.

506
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,159
I'll be back. Go rehearsing.

507
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:15,880
What's up, Mew?

508
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,079
Are you free?

509
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,840
I want to show you something.

510
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:22,519
Sure, where are you now?

511
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,639
Tong, where are you going?

512
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,119
Just around here.

513
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,239
Hey.

514
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,039
Do you feel the same?

515
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,440
When you're by my side
The stars shine so bright...

516
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,719
Tong, Come on in.

517
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,760
Let's go through it one more time.

518
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,440
It's been a long time since we parted

519
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,039
Since you took your path and I took mine

520
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,480
A million people passed by

521
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,639
A million feelings in my mind

522
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,800
But it's only you who make me feel alive

523
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,440
Maybe I haven't found what I've lost

524
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:40,599
Maybe I've chosen the wrong card
And paid the cost

525
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,920
I can't find the way
Back to where I once was

526
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,159
I've tried my best

527
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,320
I have a life but I've been mostly dead

528
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,719
Do you feel the same?

529
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,039
When you're by my side
The stars shine so bright

530
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:04,800
When you're by my side

531
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,800
The whole world comes alive

532
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,239
June, this is Tong.

533
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,159
Tong, this is June.

534
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,719
STEWED DUCK NOODLE

535
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,199
Your friend is quiet.

536
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,920
Is he from the same school?

537
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,519
No, we're from different school.

538
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,199
Really?

539
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,119
So how did you know each other?

540
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,719
We used to live close to each other.

541
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,400
You don't eat this?

542
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:58,760
What about me?

543
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,159
I'll take this too, okay?

544
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,519
-What's left for me then?
-Okay, I'll give it back.

545
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,719
Bye.

546
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,079
-Bye.
-Get inside.

547
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,280
-See you around. Bye.
-Bye.

548
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:17,639
Bye. Good luck, Tong.

549
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,519
Bye, Tong. Bye, Mew.

550
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,719
Bye, bye.

551
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,719
Tong, how do you go back?

552
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,599
What time is it?

553
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,119
Do you think June looks like Tang?

554
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,119
She does. So alike it's creepy.

555
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,199
Do you think it's possible?

556
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,800
It's impossible, Mew.

557
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,079
There are plenty of people in the world
who look alike.

558
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,360
How have you been lately?

559
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,519
Good.

560
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,280
I have fun with music.

561
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,960
Don't you feel lonely?

562
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,559
So lonely it's scary.

563
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,760
What do you mean?

564
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:46,000
When I was young,

565
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
I was lonely when friends weren't around.

566
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,800
But when I grew up...

567
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,920
loneliness...

568
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,960
was so painful.

569
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,880
Painful? How?

570
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,719
It's hard to describe.

571
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,920
It began in the summer

572
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,119
when I was in grade eight.

573
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,880
My dad took my grandmother away
for a few days,

574
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,320
-and when she came back...
-Sweetie.

575
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,880
I heard that you didn't behave yourself
when I was away.

576
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,880
It's not easy at all.

577
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,960
I miss Grandma more and more every day.

578
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,079
It got me thinking...

579
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:01,440
if I love someone that much,

580
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,880
can I stand the pain...

581
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,519
of losing that person forever?

582
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,599
Saying goodbye...

583
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,920
is part of life.

584
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,559
You know that well.

585
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,840
Do you think it's possible

586
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,000
to love someone

587
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,159
without being afraid of losing them?

588
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,199
But at the same time,

589
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:48,320
is it possible

590
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,960
to be alive in this world

591
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,599
without loving anyone at all?

592
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,880
This is loneliness for me.

593
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,320
I've been living with it for five years.

594
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,039
How can I not know how badly it hurts.

595
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,599
What about the rest of my life?

596
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:13,559
Mew.

597
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:51,320
YOU WERE SLEEPING
DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU UP

598
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,400
SAFE TRIP HOME-MEW

599
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,880
X.

600
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,239
Do it again.

601
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:40,559
Okay, let's roll.

602
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,039
You're using the machine,
so why am I here?

603
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,800
Relax, man.

604
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:53,360
Cut it, X!

605
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,239
Calm down, let do it again.

606
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,679
Joy, the spell didn't work.

607
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,239
If you have such a big crush on him,
just go tell him.

608
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,039
Don't believe that stupid book.

609
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,639
You're an idiot to really believe
anything written in it.

610
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,199
But I nicked that book from you.

611
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,159
From me?

612
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,559
I didn't know she could even read!

613
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,000
Hey, girls.

614
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,079
This is my friend, Tong.

615
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:18,880
-Hey.
-Hi.

616
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,119
-Hey.
-Come sit here, come.

617
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,599
There's a microphone behind you.

618
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,880
X, did you tune your guitar?

619
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,079
It's all right. Let's do it again.

620
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,480
June.

621
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:43,719
Yes, boss.

622
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,280
-Get me a pack of painkillers.
-Yes.

623
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,199
Just one?

624
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,000
-Whose boyfriend?
-Lame joke.

625
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,039
So funny!

626
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,679
Aren't you gonna eat anything, Ying?

627
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,880
She won't. She's into voodoo now.

628
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,719
What kind of voodoo?

629
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,920
Don't listen to her. I'm just on a diet.

630
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,880
I have to tell you guys this.

631
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,239
She read that if you want someone
you have a crush on to fall for you,

632
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,679
put his hair in a teddy bear,

633
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,519
and abstain from eating meat
for three days.

634
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:18,639
Cheeta.

635
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:19,960
Who have you got a crush on?

636
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,360
The boy who lives across from her.

637
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,840
Joy!

638
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,360
Nosy again.

639
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,159
-Get out of the way.
-Where are you going?

640
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,199
Wait for me. I'll go with you.
Wait for me.

641
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,320
This is weird.

642
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,719
-Hey!
-This is so weird.

643
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,719
Hey. Hey!

644
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,480
Damn.

645
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,360
Shit. Who's gonna pay now?

646
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,320
-I don't have any money.
-I don't either.

647
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,960
Don't look at me. I'm just a freeloader.

648
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,679
What the hell is wrong?

649
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:03,320
Shit.

650
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:05,519
Your mom's here.

651
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,519
Go, go.

652
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,199
I was still mad at you the other day

653
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,920
and didn't want to see you.

654
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,760
Is this one pretty?

655
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,639
Yeah, I guess so.

656
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:29,639
And this one?

657
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,719
It's all right too.

658
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:34,679
Which one is prettier?

659
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,280
Which one do you prefer?

660
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,880
I don't know. I like them both.
Choose one for me.

661
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,800
I know nothing about earrings.

662
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,559
Will you buy one for me?

663
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,840
Sure.

664
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,000
Do you like it?

665
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,119
Can you give me a discount
on the wooden figure?

666
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,679
I can't, boy.
I'm losing money on it as it is.

667
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,800
So, can I just buy part of it?

668
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,000
Are you kidding me?

669
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,599
If you buy part of it,
what can I do with the rest?

670
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:24,760
Why don't you just buy the whole thing?

671
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:28,840
Because I bought you the earrings,
now I don't have enough money.

672
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,000
Is the doll that important to you?

673
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,320
I didn't know
you were into such stupid toys.

674
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,639
I didn't want it for myself.

675
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,719
Then for who?

676
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,840
It's for a friend.

677
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,760
Friend?

678
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:44,079
Which friend?

679
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,519
A girl?

680
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,760
A boy.

681
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:53,639
You have no problem buying things
for someone else.

682
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:00,079
You're underage.

683
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,800
I can't sell it to you.

684
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,239
I'm just three months short, bro.

685
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,639
No. It's a law, son.

686
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,960
-Hey.
-What do you want?

687
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,599
A pack of LM menthol
and a pack of Paracetamol.

688
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,320
-How much in total? 56 baht.
-56 baht.

689
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,280
SMOKING CAUSES BAD BREATH

690
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,119
Smoking is bad for you.

691
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,719
Do you want to check out
Mew's recording session? Come, it's fun.

692
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,400
Will it run on late?

693
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,639
I'm not sure,

694
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,199
but it's supposed to be.

695
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,880
Then I don't think I can go.
My mother is picking me up.

696
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,400
You still have your mother pick you up?

697
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,840
I got to dash.

698
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,199
June. Please say hi to Mew for me.

699
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:53,559
I will.

700
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:42,800
Mom.

701
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:46,159
Well...

702
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,159
What if I know someone
who can make him feel better.

703
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:52,639
Who?

704
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:54,119
Who can make him feel better?

705
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,360
For Christ's sake, shut up!

706
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,920
Ninety-nine thornless red roses.

707
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:49,559
Mom.

708
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,280
What did you just tell me about your work?

709
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,679
I manage a band.

710
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,760
And before it?

711
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,360
I was a freelance event organizer.

712
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,760
I was also on a film production crew.

713
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,000
Where is your hometown?

714
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,159
I'm from Chiang Mai.

715
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:26,760
And your family?

716
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,880
They are all dead.

717
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:34,000
So who are you staying with?

718
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,159
I'm on my own.

719
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,360
So what's this job
you want to talk to me about?

720
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:48,960
Well...

721
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:53,480
It might sound a little strange to you.

722
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,599
Dad.

723
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,079
Tang, where have you been?

724
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,000
Dinner's here.

725
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:15,599
So who will say grace?

726
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:17,320
Tang, would you?

727
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,360
But we haven't said grace
in quite a while.

728
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:25,760
We can do it today.

729
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,760
It's all right. I'll say it.

730
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,800
Every plate of rice is precious.

731
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Treasure it, don't waste it.

732
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,880
Our farmers have to work hard
to grow rice for us.

733
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,400
We must have sympathy
for all the poor people.

734
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,400
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

735
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,880
A new kind of grace?

736
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:56,960
They are Catholic.

737
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:01,639
That's how they say grace on the mountain.

738
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,840
Tell me what it's like up there.

739
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:12,199
Tell him what happened
after you got lost in the jungle.

740
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,760
Tell him like you told me in the car.

741
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,559
After I got hit by the car,

742
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:22,320
two Hmongs came to rescue me.

743
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,199
When I woke up,
they told me they'd saved my life.

744
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,000
I don't remember much about what happened.

745
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,679
They fed me and took care of me.

746
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,880
At first we couldn't
communicate with each other,

747
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,719
but after a while, we got on very well.

748
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,239
Everything was all right.

749
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,719
Let's eat, okay?

750
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:45,559
The food will get cold. Let's start.

751
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:46,800
Have some fish, dad.

752
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,400
It tastes really good,
also improves your memory.

753
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:11,719
Do you think you can handle this?

754
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,320
Yes.

755
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,400
But I have to come back regularly.

756
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,079
If he wakes up and I'm not here,

757
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,760
will he be okay?

758
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,599
I don't know.

759
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,639
Maybe he won't remember a thing.

760
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,280
What's this?

761
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,159
Please take it.

762
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:52,679
Thank you.

763
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,400
June.

764
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,480
Where did you get the plot
about you getting lost in the jungle?

765
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:12,639
From "Jungle Lovers".

766
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:14,760
"Jungle Lovers"?

767
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,720
The movie with that famous pretty boy.

768
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,359
I see.

769
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,760
See you soon.

770
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Bye.

771
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:37,720
THANKS SO MUCH. WITHOUT YOU

772
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,199
ALL THE GOOD THINGS
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-TONG

773
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,399
It's really sweet, Mew.

774
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,640
Who inspired you to write it?

775
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:08,479
Don't use those crazy chords again.
Have sympathy for your guitarist.

776
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,800
Are we going to use this song
for the audition?

777
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,000
Yes, Tong.

778
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,640
I see.

779
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:28,199
Where are you?

780
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:32,640
Today?

781
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,720
Yes.

782
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,960
Sure.

783
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:39,119
Yes.

784
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:40,640
See you soon.

785
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:47,199
Continue.

786
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:04,159
Aren't you going to school?

787
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:12,079
I've dropped out, dad.

788
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,600
Well...

789
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,319
You're not doing well,
how can I leave you?

790
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,520
You have to take the pills
and drink a lot of water.

791
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,279
When you recover, I can go back to school.

792
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,079
I'll take the plate away.

793
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:18,600
What's this?

794
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,920
Dad wants to play treasure hunt with you.

795
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,199
What is it?

796
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:25,720
We used to play it when I was a kid.

797
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,920
It means dad has a gift for you.

798
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,840
Really?

799
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,159
Did you keep the clue?

800
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,319
No. I put gum in it and threw it away.

801
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,920
Will it be okay?

802
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,000
Yes. Tomorrow he won't remember a thing.

803
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,640
Really?

804
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,079
Okay then.

805
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,640
-I have to go. See you soon.
-Bye, June.

806
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,800
Bye.

807
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,439
Tong, are you free on Sunday?

808
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,680
We're throwing a party for June.

809
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,880
Do you think it's a good idea?

810
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,640
I don't know. But when dad insists,
no one can talk him out of it.

811
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,279
Things are looking up in your family.

812
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,520
Who's that?

813
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,880
Just an old friend.

814
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:40,039
I thank you for the good things
you've brought into my world

815
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:46,000
I thank you for your promises,
and your pure soul

816
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,800
-I once lost
-Just today.

817
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,399
The strength to go on

818
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,239
Doctor also drinks.

819
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,039
Tang, how are you?

820
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:56,960
You're...

821
01:13:57,039 --> 01:13:59,279
-Ae, Oui's girlfriend.
-Ae.

822
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:01,960
-Oh, hello.
-You didn't recognize me?

823
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,560
You've grown so much.

824
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

825
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,680
-Make yourself at home.
-Want someone who care

826
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,199
Feel blessed every single day
you're by my side

827
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:15,079
I learned sweetness

828
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,199
First I stayed with a Hmong family
and later moved to Chiang Mai.

829
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,520
I see. Why didn't you come home then?

830
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,720
I had amnesia.
I couldn't remember how to get home.

831
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,720
It sounds like "Jungle Lovers".

832
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,439
Exactly.

833
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,399
I couldn't even remember that
my name is June, I mean, Tang.

834
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,239
Tang, let's get some ice.

835
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:47,079
Please excuse me.

836
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:48,640
I'll go get some ice.

837
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:54,720
June, keep a low profile
or the lie will get away from you.

838
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,600
This is kind of fun actually.

839
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,680
It won't be fun
when people find out the truth.

840
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,239
Come on, don't get too tense.
This is a party.

841
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,920
Let's go watch Mew.

842
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,720
I'll take this.

843
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,319
Next on is our brand new song
we've just written.

844
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:35,439
We haven't performed it anywhere yet

845
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:38,079
and decided to premiere it here.

846
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,279
Let's see if you'll like it.

847
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,640
If I'm telling you
I wrote this song just for you

848
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:51,319
Would you believe me?

849
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:00,680
It may sound so very simple

850
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:07,079
But a love song is possible

851
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,800
Only with the poetry of love
in one's heart

852
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:15,880
Because of you,

853
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,039
I could write these simple words

854
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:28,279
Unlike the thousands love ballads
you've already heard

855
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,760
Mine is an exception,
since you're my inspiration

856
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,000
Love gives life a meaning,

857
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,840
and it's here in every line I'm singing

858
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,680
I hope you get the meaning

859
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,560
Because it's in every word I'm singing

860
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,359
You know?

861
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,000
I think Tang's the luckiest person
in the world.

862
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,680
Why is that?

863
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:27,399
I mean,

864
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:31,640
nobody has ever thrown
such a nice party for me.

865
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,000
Tang would be so pleased...

866
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,399
Well, I'm not sure about that.

867
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,840
It's not what you think.

868
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,159
I mean, when Tang was with us,

869
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,439
we never thought of throwing her a party.

870
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:52,279
Seriously,

871
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,880
do you think Tang is still alive?

872
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,840
Your new song is beautiful.

873
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,319
How did you write it?

874
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,319
Without you, there wouldn't be this song.

875
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,079
Now you've heard it, what do you think?

876
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,359
I'm not sure.

877
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,119
What's wrong?

878
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Are you all right?

879
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:20,439
You want me to pick you up later?

880
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:24,439
No, I'll take a bus.

881
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:16,439
Mew.

882
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,239
What's your relationship with Tong?

883
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,800
We're just friends.

884
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,640
I saw you and Tong last night.

885
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,079
I understand everything.

886
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:42,039
Listen to me, Mew.

887
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,760
You realize what my family
has gone through, don't you?

888
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:50,920
You know how we've suffered from the loss.

889
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:57,720
Tong is the only precious thing
I have left in my life.

890
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:02,399
I don't want to see him
taking the wrong path.

891
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,039
What do you mean?

892
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,520
Tong will soon graduate.

893
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:15,960
He'll look for a job.

894
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:17,720
He'll save up some money

895
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:22,079
and find a good woman to marry.
He'll build his own happy family

896
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,199
and they'll take care of each other
until they grow old.

897
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,439
This is life, Mew.

898
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,760
This is how I raise my son to be.

899
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:37,840
Do it for Tong's sake,

900
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,800
no matter how you love him,

901
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:46,880
please end this relationship.

902
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,640
I think you'd like to see him
leading a good

903
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,119
and happy life too, right?

904
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:00,600
Aunt Sunee,

905
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:03,560
we're just friends.

906
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:12,000
You will understand it someday.

907
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,359
Tong,

908
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:21,119
do you want me to pick you up?

909
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,880
I've called, but he turned the phone off.

910
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,680
Is he mad at any of you?

911
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,079
I don't think so.

912
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:44,199
June, can you please track him down?

913
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:46,319
Yes.

914
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:49,119
I'll go look for him.

915
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:50,760
Yes, please.

916
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:53,199
Just a second. Let me check with them.

917
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:54,520
They keep saying that.

918
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,960
So is he coming or not?

919
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,319
Of course he will.

920
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,720
Is everything all right?

921
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:28,079
Tong.

922
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,479
Tong, where are you going?

923
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:31,960
To a friend's house?

924
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:33,560
Which one?

925
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,920
Mew's.

926
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:37,239
I forbid you to go.

927
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,640
Stop visiting Mew from now on.

928
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,640
Why?

929
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,479
I know everything.
I've already spoken to him.

930
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:49,800
Did you go to talk to Mew?

931
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,840
Do you realize what you did?

932
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:07,960
Of course I realize what I've done.

933
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,800
You're not me,

934
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:13,039
you're not part of this family.

935
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,880
What do you know?

936
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,119
Mew.

937
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,920
Mew.

938
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,680
Mew.

939
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,159
Mew, are you home?

940
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,760
I'm down here. Mew!

941
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,560
Stop it, kid. People are sleeping.

942
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,479
Go find your friend somewhere else.

943
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,199
Look at you.

944
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,640
Who can stand your temper?

945
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,439
Look who's talking. Have you ever cared
about anything in this house?

946
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,520
You only care about your booze.
Do you ever think about our problems?

947
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,720
-Have you ever listened to anyone?
-Why should I?

948
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,000
Why should I listen to a loser like you?

949
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:25,239
You're a loser.

950
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,319
-Leave me alone
-Stop it!

951
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,000
Leave me alone.

952
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:31,720
You asshole!

953
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:17,720
You're fast.

954
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,279
Come, come.

955
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:21,479
Are you drunk?

956
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,720
Come sit here.

957
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:24,439
You're late.

958
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,640
I was waiting for him.

959
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:31,199
What mess have you gotten yourself into?

960
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:33,800
If you were happy,
you wouldn't show up here.

961
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,920
Wae, fix him a glass.

962
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:41,039
Go get them.

963
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:47,600
Hey, you two.
Our friends are here. Come inside.

964
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,840
Come on.

965
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,560
Cheers!

966
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,880
To all the trouble in the world!

967
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:05,399
Cheers!

968
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,239
There he is.

969
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,039
I know what happened.

970
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,479
But I need to give Odd
a really good explanation.

971
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,439
Your disappearance last night...

972
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:39,880
has caused us a lot of trouble.

973
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,159
I was sick.

974
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:53,880
Odd asked if you still want to go on.

975
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,039
He already had a booking
for you to play at a Christmas party.

976
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,560
Are you still up for it?

977
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,840
I'll do my best.

978
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:31,239
Everywhere I look, I can't see the light

979
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,199
I feel like a blind

980
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:38,640
And my heart is so fragile

981
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,880
This long and lonely night!

982
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,079
I look at the sky

983
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:48,399
And ask myself why

984
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,039
My soul is shivering
and my heart trembling with fright

985
01:33:52,119 --> 01:33:58,560
Will this long night ever come to pass?

986
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:02,159
Will the sun come up and show me the path?

987
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,800
Will the sun come up and show me the path?

988
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:12,119
How long this pain will last?

989
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:15,399
I'm waiting in the terrible beauty

990
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:21,720
Of this night
that would last until eternity

991
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:54,560
FEE $1,000
ENTRY FEE $300

992
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:24,760
What have I done?

993
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:38,680
What have I done to deserve this?

994
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,119
Isn't what I do good enough?

995
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:05,640
Will this lonely night ever come to pass?

996
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,000
Will someone ever show me the path?

997
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:12,840
Will someone ever show me the path?

998
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:19,199
But I know the sun will soon shine

999
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:21,800
Morning will come

1000
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,479
And everything will be fine

1001
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,159
Pain strikes like lightnings

1002
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:34,039
In a stormy night

1003
01:37:34,119 --> 01:37:40,720
And the heart sings the song of misery

1004
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,520
Will night every turn into day?

1005
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,800
When the sun rises the pain will go away

1006
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:53,199
This night seems to last forever

1007
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,640
Buy day will come,

1008
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,279
Then I will

1009
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:06,359
No longer suffer

1010
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:08,920
What do you want to do when you grow up?

1011
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,239
I want to be a film director.

1012
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,079
What?

1013
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,000
Hey, Wae, continue. Continue.

1014
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,640
Tong, let me ask you frankly about Donut.

1015
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,319
What about her?

1016
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:23,199
You've got yourself a trophy girlfriend,

1017
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:25,000
why don't you take care of her?

1018
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:26,520
Right.

1019
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,560
Seriously,

1020
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,399
just tell me yes or no.

1021
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:32,000
Are you gay?

1022
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:33,000
What?

1023
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,840
People see you going out
with a boy from St. Nicholas School.

1024
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,159
What did you hear that from?

1025
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,319
Wae.

1026
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:42,479
Damn you! Don't blame it on me.

1027
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,119
Honestly, I heard from some people

1028
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,520
who saw you with that boy at Siam Square.

1029
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,960
So, are you or aren't you?

1030
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,840
You're full of shit.

1031
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,960
-It's your fault.
-What?

1032
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,079
I didn't say anything.

1033
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:08,920
-You said he's gay.
-Don't leave me here.

1034
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,479
Did you blow the whistle on me and Mew?

1035
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:24,520
No, Tong.

1036
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,880
-I don't know...
-Do you want to know if I am and I am not?

1037
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,840
It's not like that, Tong.

1038
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,079
-It's not like that, Tong.
-Do you really want to know?

1039
01:39:31,159 --> 01:39:32,439
I don't mean it that way.

1040
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,520
Tong!

1041
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:36,800
Tong, don't do like this.

1042
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:26,560
What am I, Ying?

1043
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:28,600
What am I?

1044
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,479
It's all right, Tong.

1045
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:40,840
It's all right.

1046
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,439
I let people down
because I don’t' know what I really am.

1047
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,319
Everything will be all right.

1048
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,880
Dad, you're in this photo.

1049
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:08,880
Why did Tong has a bruise under his eye?

1050
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,960
He was hit by a football, remember?

1051
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,159
Don't you remember...

1052
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:17,520
that he had a raccoon eye
during the entire trip?

1053
01:41:21,319 --> 01:41:23,159
Where were you in this picture?

1054
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,079
I'd already left with my friends.

1055
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:30,000
We must have asked someone
to snap this photo for us.

1056
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,680
Dad, are you okay? You look tired.

1057
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,000
I think...

1058
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:44,760
you should get some rest.

1059
01:41:58,039 --> 01:41:59,079
Wait.

1060
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,600
Where did you get those stories?

1061
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,239
I looked at the photos and made them up.

1062
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,760
It's just...

1063
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:12,119
something he wants to hear.

1064
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:24,560
June.

1065
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:27,039
Who are you?

1066
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,920
What do you mean? I'm just me.

1067
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,760
I mean, where are you from?
Who are your parents?

1068
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,560
I already told you.

1069
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,680
You can tell me again.
I want to know the whole story.

1070
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:47,520
Why do you want to know?

1071
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:52,399
I have to right to know
because you're working for me.

1072
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:54,479
It'd be preposterous for me to hire
a total stranger

1073
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,880
to work and live in my house.

1074
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,880
You're right.

1075
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:06,520
I'm just a stranger.

1076
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,439
Korn!

1077
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,760
Korn!

1078
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:48,960
Korn!

1079
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:50,840
Tang.

1080
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,680
Tang.

1081
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:54,319
Where is she?

1082
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:57,079
Korn, are you okay? Are you all right?

1083
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,600
Korn!

1084
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,560
June! June!

1085
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,920
The number you're trying to reach
cannot be connected.

1086
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,279
Tang, call Tong.

1087
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,880
The number you're trying to reach
cannot be connected.

1088
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,159
His liver is in bad shape

1089
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,039
and that disrupts his blood pressure.

1090
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,199
The blood vessels
in his colon are protruding

1091
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,479
and have ruptured.

1092
01:44:36,199 --> 01:44:37,760
How serious is it?

1093
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,399
Korn has already
lost 80 percent of his liver.

1094
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,880
We can only wait and keep our hope high.

1095
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,079
The number you're trying to reach
cannot be connected.

1096
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:32,439
When I told them
I wanted to come to study in Bangkok,

1097
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:36,560
my parents didn't want me to leave...

1098
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:40,640
because they didn't have the money
to support me.

1099
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,279
But I ran away.

1100
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:49,920
I knew I'd be stuck in a dead end
if I remained in Chiang Mai.

1101
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,199
My life would mean nothing.

1102
01:45:57,079 --> 01:45:59,000
When I got here,

1103
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:02,119
I didn't contact them.

1104
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:04,760
I was determined that...

1105
01:46:05,319 --> 01:46:06,960
I would only go back

1106
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:08,840
when I became successful.

1107
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,039
I didn't want to crawl back
to them as a loser.

1108
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,039
But well...

1109
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,600
can you guess what happened?

1110
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,359
When I'd saved up

1111
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,720
and finally went home,

1112
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,479
my mom and dad were already gone.

1113
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:40,399
They died a year
after I ran away to Bangkok.

1114
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,680
What happened to them?

1115
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,399
Some kind of accident.

1116
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,640
Some kind of accident,
I don't know for sure.

1117
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:02,000
I don't want to know.

1118
01:47:04,439 --> 01:47:05,680
I just know...

1119
01:47:06,439 --> 01:47:07,880
that they died...

1120
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,159
without knowing
that I tried to do everything

1121
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,600
to make them happy.

1122
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,840
They died...

1123
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,760
and I didn't have any chance
to make them feel better,

1124
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:26,600
or to apologize.

1125
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:30,359
I didn't have any chance...

1126
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:33,399
to tell them how much I loved them.

1127
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,479
You're lucky to still have that chance.

1128
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:53,600
Is this a true story? Or are you just
telling me what you think I want to hear?

1129
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,279
Is the sun getting in your eyes?

1130
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,079
Where is Mom?

1131
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:29,079
What?

1132
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:31,840
Where is Mom?

1133
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,600
She went to get some stuff.

1134
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,960
Do you want anything?

1135
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:46,119
Will I ever get out of this place?

1136
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:52,119
You will.

1137
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,640
Dad,

1138
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,119
I need to tell you something.

1139
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,680
Mom.

1140
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:42,680
Where have you been?

1141
01:50:49,239 --> 01:50:51,760
Tong, aren't you going to school?

1142
01:50:56,319 --> 01:50:58,840
The doctor gave him
some medication to clean out his liver.

1143
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,520
He's getting better

1144
01:51:01,479 --> 01:51:03,439
and should be released in a few days.

1145
01:51:07,479 --> 01:51:08,960
Having me here...

1146
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,720
may improve his mental health,

1147
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,640
but it doesn't stop him from drinking.

1148
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,239
Do you think everything we're doing...

1149
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:25,479
is really helping him?

1150
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,640
Dad.

1151
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:35,880
I have to go.
There's something I have to do.

1152
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,039
Bye.

1153
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:55,960
Tang.

1154
01:51:58,039 --> 01:52:00,399
Are you coming back for Christmas?

1155
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:23,920
AUGUST BAND'S GOLDEN RULES
MEW DIDN'T FOLLOW ANY OF THEM!

1156
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,640
It's been a long time since we parted

1157
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:36,119
Since you took your path and I took mine

1158
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,600
Go on.

1159
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:03,640
AUGUST BAND'S MEMBERS

1160
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,159
Mew.

1161
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:48,600
What are you doing?

1162
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,560
This song.

1163
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:57,319
This one?

1164
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,680
Yes.

1165
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,920
Do you want to borrow it?

1166
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:03,039
No, it's all right.

1167
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,039
I want to get the feel of its melody.

1168
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:12,399
Chinese songs
always have touching meanings.

1169
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:14,199
Yes.

1170
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,640
What's the meaning of this word?

1171
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,920
Which one?

1172
01:54:24,279 --> 01:54:26,359
I don't know that one.

1173
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,239
I'll go ask my brother.

1174
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:24,880
MAKE HIM TO LOVE YOU

1175
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,039
Mew! It means...

1176
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:12,960
What does this mean?

1177
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,359
It means that...

1178
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,439
if you have love,

1179
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,239
you always have hope.

1180
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,800
Are you still hoping?

1181
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,840
Should I be?

1182
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,479
Ying, you're my good friend.

1183
01:57:26,359 --> 01:57:27,800
Grandma! Why?

1184
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:31,560
Why?

1185
01:58:03,239 --> 01:58:04,479
So who's going to sing the song?

1186
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,079
This one.

1187
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,600
There's a possibility that he could do it

1188
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,720
because no one's actually seen your faces.

1189
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,680
I have no problem with it
if this guy can sing.

1190
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,439
But are you sure Mew's okay with it?

1191
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,640
Let me think...

1192
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,960
June.

1193
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:29,359
June.

1194
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,199
Talk to him nicely.

1195
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,600
Sit Down.

1196
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:55,960
Yes.

1197
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,399
You know August's having a problem?

1198
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:03,279
Yes, I do.

1199
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,199
And do you know why did I hire you?

1200
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,920
To take care of August.

1201
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,159
Exactly.

1202
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,560
To take care of August,
to solve their problems.

1203
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,319
And right now the band's having a problem

1204
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:16,960
but you're not here to fix it.

1205
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,600
I asked you to supervise their rehearsals,

1206
01:59:20,119 --> 01:59:22,079
but you're always late or not here.

1207
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,000
I don't get it, June.

1208
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:27,960
Maybe...

1209
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:30,840
you want to switch to do something else.

1210
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,000
What do you forget?

1211
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,680
Korn,

1212
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,399
eat something and take your pills.

1213
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,159
How are you keeping up?

1214
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:58,920
Same old. Don't you ever think
about coming back to us?

1215
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:08,199
I got to go. Take this.

1216
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,520
What is it?

1217
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:16,600
You'll see when you open it at home.

1218
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:25,840
You got to go. Your friends are waiting.

1219
02:03:35,079 --> 02:03:36,079
Tong.

1220
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:41,720
You family is the coolest.

1221
02:03:42,359 --> 02:03:43,840
Make sure you take care of each other.

1222
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,920
Let's go to that fried rice shop...

1223
02:04:57,319 --> 02:05:00,840
TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AGREEMENT

1224
02:05:02,359 --> 02:05:04,680
Are you so mad at me?

1225
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,199
I wasn't upset
that you messed up our audition.

1226
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,880
I just don't know
how come you've changed so quickly.

1227
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:17,079
What do you really want?

1228
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:21,359
If I upset you that much,

1229
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:23,279
I...

1230
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,960
apologize.

1231
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,239
I'm not mad at you.

1232
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,760
I just can't sing that song anymore.

1233
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:34,159
Why not?

1234
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,199
I don’t feel it anymore.

1235
02:05:40,119 --> 02:05:41,279
You wouldn't understand.

1236
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,159
Even though I don't,

1237
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,600
I'm still your friend.

1238
02:05:56,279 --> 02:05:59,199
Why do you always think
nobody cares about you?

1239
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:07,359
Are you tired, mom?

1240
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,680
Of what?

1241
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:16,399
Of everything.

1242
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:19,399
Of course I do.

1243
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:21,079
But what choice do I have?

1244
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:26,840
And how are you doing?

1245
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,119
I'm fine.

1246
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,760
I don't know. I'm fine.

1247
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:37,840
Plug in the lights.

1248
02:07:48,359 --> 02:07:50,279
Put the angels on the tree.

1249
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:05,680
Is it good here?

1250
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,239
Anywhere's fine.

1251
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,640
What about this one?

1252
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,039
Anywhere's fine.

1253
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,920
What if I put these two together?

1254
02:08:29,399 --> 02:08:30,840
Just do it.

1255
02:08:36,039 --> 02:08:39,680
You'll scold me
if I don't do it the way you want.

1256
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,880
Do what you think is best.

1257
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:20,520
WANNA COME TO CHRISTMAS FAIR
AT MY SCHOOL?

1258
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,399
I don't know.
You have to decide for yourself.

1259
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,319
Do you want it?

1260
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,720
Yes.

1261
02:10:58,079 --> 02:10:59,640
But I just want the nose.

1262
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:01,319
The whole thing is too expensive.

1263
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:10,520
I'll see what I can do.

1264
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:20,520
-What am I supposed to do with the rest?
-I beg you, please. I beg you.

1265
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:23,119
-I can't even sell the whole thing.
-Please. I beg you.

1266
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:24,800
My friend needs it so badly, please.

1267
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:33,520
-Okay.
-Thank you!

1268
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:35,880
-Here it is.
-Thank you so much!

1269
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,880
Thank you so much!

1270
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,600
WILL WAIT AT CENTERPOINT AROUND 6:30 PM

1271
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,640
Tong,

1272
02:12:03,159 --> 02:12:04,520
don't come home late.

1273
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,119
I won't, mom.

1274
02:12:06,199 --> 02:12:08,119
Have you seen June lately?

1275
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,399
No. Why?

1276
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:13,439
Will she come to the party?

1277
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:19,279
Mom,

1278
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:21,479
there's something in the cupboard.

1279
02:12:22,039 --> 02:12:22,880
What is it?

1280
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:26,720
Nothing, mom. I got to go.

1281
02:12:59,159 --> 02:13:00,760
I WONDER HOW YOU CAN KEEP GOING ON...

1282
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:22,159
Loneliness of my heart

1283
02:13:26,039 --> 02:13:27,600
TRANPORT COMPANY LIMITED

1284
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:48,199
STILL WAITING

1285
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:59,560
Everybody, the fun has just started.

1286
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:02,600
Let me hear your voices!
Are you all doing fine out there?

1287
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:12,119
You're late again. Are we going now?

1288
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:14,840
I'm sorry. I need to tell you something.

1289
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:18,119
You can tell me when we get there.
We're running late.

1290
02:14:18,199 --> 02:14:21,600
Next we have a fresh-faced boy band
who are making their debut. Please welcome

1291
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:24,000
August!

1292
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:41,199
Hurry up!

1293
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:48,159
If I'm telling you
I wrote this song just for you

1294
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,319
Would you believe me?

1295
02:14:53,479 --> 02:15:00,479
It may sound so very simple

1296
02:15:03,159 --> 02:15:07,000
But a love song is possible

1297
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,720
Only with the poetry of love
in one's heart

1298
02:15:12,279 --> 02:15:15,960
Because of you,

1299
02:15:16,039 --> 02:15:21,279
I can write these simple words

1300
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,119
Unlike the thousands love ballads
you've already heard

1301
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:28,359
Donut.

1302
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:31,920
I'm sorry. I can't go with you.

1303
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:34,680
But you said you would.

1304
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:36,680
Well...

1305
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:39,079
I mean...

1306
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,319
I think it's over between you and me.

1307
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,039
I'm so sorry.

1308
02:15:46,159 --> 02:15:48,880
You should've told me earlier
so I could go with someone else.

1309
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,520
Love gives life a meaning,

1310
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:59,119
And it's here in every word I'm singing

1311
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:03,479
Let this song rhyme our souls

1312
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:08,039
When your voice and mine become whole,

1313
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:13,119
Let it carry us high above

1314
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:18,920
Where we recite our poetry of love

1315
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,079
That when there's love then there's hope

1316
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:30,840
Your love is my light,
and it'll get us through the night

1317
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:39,520
Sometimes I wonder
how you guys can keep going on.

1318
02:16:39,879 --> 02:16:43,760
But I believe you can lean on each other

1319
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,079
without me there to help you.

1320
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,239
I know you love each other so much,

1321
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:52,159
maybe too much,
and too much love could hurt you.

1322
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:56,200
But believe me, when the time comes,
you'll understand...

1323
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:59,200
that there's
no such thing as too much love.

1324
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:09,920
In love there's truth

1325
02:17:11,879 --> 02:17:17,520
I've spent years searching for its meaning

1326
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,360
Everything you do makes

1327
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:28,120
My heart trembling

1328
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:33,280
If life is a song,
you're the words I'm singing

1329
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:37,360
And it makes my poor heart beating

1330
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,639
Let this song rhyme our souls

1331
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:45,040
When your voice and mine become whole,

1332
02:17:46,159 --> 02:17:50,040
Let it carry us high above

1333
02:17:51,399 --> 02:17:55,360
Where we recite our poetry of love

1334
02:17:55,440 --> 02:18:00,440
That when there's love then there's hope

1335
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:07,680
Your love is my light,
and it'll get us through the night

1336
02:18:17,879 --> 02:18:21,600
Sometimes we make a wrong choice
out of love.

1337
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:23,520
But that's better...

1338
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:26,280
than when we never do anything for love,

1339
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,479
isn't it?

1340
02:18:28,079 --> 02:18:29,840
Life always means opportunities.

1341
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,280
We can start over...

1342
02:18:31,879 --> 02:18:34,360
after we've learnt our mistakes.

1343
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:39,120
I hope you can make the best
out of your opportunities.

1344
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,399
Thank you for everything.

1345
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:46,040
And if it's our fate, we'll meet again.

1346
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:36,040
THANK YOU FOR EVERTHING
AND IF IT'S OUR FATE, WE'LL MEET AGAIN

1347
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,719
P.S. I'M NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM

1348
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:49,559
What's this picture?

1349
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:55,280
It's from our Chiang Mai trip.

1350
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,680
She had left us then?

1351
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:06,159
Yes,

1352
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:11,079
the four of us were still together.

1353
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:15,079
But Tang wanted to be
the one who took the photo.

1354
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:22,360
Look at you.

1355
02:20:25,159 --> 02:20:26,760
You looked so proud...

1356
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,120
that finally Tang
knew how to take a picture.

1357
02:20:37,399 --> 02:20:39,239
It's a small thing,

1358
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:45,559
but it's one of a few things...

1359
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,959
Tang made us proud.

1360
02:20:57,719 --> 02:20:58,799
Korn.

1361
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:01,760
Korn.

1362
02:21:09,719 --> 02:21:10,959
I know.

1363
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:14,959
I know.

1364
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:35,000
Here she is!

1365
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:37,760
Where have you been?

1366
02:21:41,399 --> 02:21:42,479
Where's Tong?

1367
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:45,319
I guess he's gone home.

1368
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,600
He must have gone home.

1369
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,840
He's a Catholic.
He has to go wait to see Santa Claus.

1370
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:52,600
Who told you Santa comes tonight?
Tomorrow's night is his night.

1371
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:53,959
Tonight.

1372
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,200
Tomorrow.

1373
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,120
God! Is that what they teach you
at school?

1374
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:58,200
What's the matter?

1375
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:03,040
Are you all right?

1376
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,440
-Are you okay?
-Why do you cry?

1377
02:22:07,479 --> 02:22:09,399
-You can tell me.
-Yes, tell us.

1378
02:22:23,799 --> 02:22:24,879
Mew.

1379
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:39,840
Hi, Tong.

1380
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:42,840
Your song is beautiful.

1381
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:47,840
What do you think about it?

1382
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:50,000
I don't think...

1383
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,559
I can be your boyfriend.

1384
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:04,440
But it doesn't mean I don't love you.

1385
02:23:10,639 --> 02:23:11,799
Thank you.

1386
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:18,360
I have to go.

1387
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:19,959
The band's waiting.

1388
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:22,280
Wait, Mew.

1389
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:25,479
This is for you.

1390
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:33,040
What is it?

1391
02:23:33,319 --> 02:23:34,920
A Christmas present.

1392
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,239
Thank you.

1393
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:48,280
I got to go.

1394
02:23:55,399 --> 02:23:56,280
Good luck.

1395
02:23:56,799 --> 02:23:57,799
Good luck.

1396
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:03,159
What is it, Mew?

1397
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:44,520
Did June come?

1398
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:48,000
No.

1399
02:24:49,479 --> 02:24:50,959
She won't come back here again.

1400
02:24:55,639 --> 02:24:57,399
From now on, it's only three of us.

1401
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:39,040
Thank you.

1402
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:37,440
