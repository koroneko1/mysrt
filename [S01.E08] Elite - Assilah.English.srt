1
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,719
On the first of June, around 9:30 p.m.,

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,120
you entered the school pool.

3
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,239
Marina was there.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
You had an increasingly heated argument...

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,800
until you picked up the trophy,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
and hit her
in the back of the head with it.

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,600
She didn't die instantly,
which means you left her there,

8
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,920
bleeding to death.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,119
This is what we believe happened,
and, more importantly,

10
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,399
what the judge believes happened.

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Nano?

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,319
I'm going to pick you up from school
a little early.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,799
Make your escape during the party,
and we will do the handover at ten.

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,599
Hey. What's wrong?
Are you getting cold feet?

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
Tell me about Morocco.
About Asilah. What is it like?

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
It's a bit small. A bit dirty.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,480
You can only reach it by car,
taking crappy roads...

19
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,560
But, know what?

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,239
It has a beautiful beach,
right next to the souk.

21
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,640
One day, you can pick me up
from my friend's garage,

22
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,519
and we can go together
to watch the sunset, which is awesome.

23
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,159
I was looking at
where I can get medication,

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,040
and there's a clinic nearby
where they need volunteers.

25
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,680
Maybe I could help people
who have just received their diagnosis.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,759
I've been through that.

27
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,240
OK, I'll pick you up, then.
But we'll watch the damn sunset.

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,479
OK.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,479
Sorry, Nano, I'm just a little...

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,039
nervous.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,479
I need one of your hugs.

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey. Tomorrow, all right?

33
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,479
All right.

34
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,719
What happened?

35
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,759
-Are you all right?
-What do you think?

36
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,719
Do you think we're all right? Huh?

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,120
This is the second time
our home's been broken into

38
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,639
by people looking for who knows what
since you got out of the slammer.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
What a coincidence, huh?

40
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,360
Your brother could have been killed.

41
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,080
Are you listening to me?

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Your brother could have been killed.
I could have been killed!

43
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,639
Do you even care about us?

44
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,240
-Do you even care about us?
-Mom!

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,319
-Why don't we have a cup of herbal tea?
-Right now, I'd prefer some whiskey.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,879
Let me have a look.

47
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,319
Come on.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,719
-What a mess Mom's made.
-Was shaking.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
-You or her?
-Both of us.

50
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,400
-I'm sorry about your fucking watch.
-Don't be.

51
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,199
-It wasn't here.
-Who has it?

52
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,039
Of course.

53
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,719
Good. The sooner you have the money,
the sooner you'll be gone.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,639
Right?

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,240
We're getting out of here.

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,759
Both of us.

57
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,280
Tomorrow.

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
-Why are you telling me?
-I'm sick of lying to you.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,319
Of not being able to look you in the eye.

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
-I swear that--
-You'll never lie to me again,

61
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,680
because I'll never listen
to anything you say again.

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
You are no longer my brother.

63
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,240
It's just a small party
to celebrate the end of the school year.

64
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,800
Are you not going to let me
say goodbye to my classmates?

65
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,879
I want you home
as soon as you get the grades.

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
Why won't you let her go?

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,720
She's done nothing wrong.
She just wants to say goodbye.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
Mind your own business.

69
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,439
She just wants to say goodbye.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,000
Omar, don't start with me.

71
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,120
I don't care.
I'm tired of having to put up with you.

72
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,639
-Tired of--
-Of what?

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,160
Of your father?
The one who gave you life?

74
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,319
The one who raised you, fed you?
In return, you've only brought him shame.

75
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,399
Please, don't argue.
If I'm not allowed to go, I won't.

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,560
She only wants to say goodbye.

77
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,160
Fine.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So parents can go?

79
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,879
And brothers?

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,639
Since you're so eager to talk,
you will come.

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
That way,
you can apologize to the principal.

82
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,600
-Me?
-Yes.

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,600
In this family, when you are in the wrong,
you apologize.

84
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,279
We will leave that school
with our heads held high.

85
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,680
You went after my family,
you son of a bitch. That will cost you.

86
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,680
We had a deal.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,839
You broke it when you sent your thugs
to steal the watch.

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,000
-Now it will cost you a million.
-You are crazy, kid.

89
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,399
You're the crazy one.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,759
The way you're going,
those documents will end up in the papers.

91
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,560
And you won't see a penny, then.

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm used to being penniless.
To a shitty life. What about you?

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,480
How will you feel
about losing your business,

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,439
your house, and your damn family?

95
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,560
Think about it a bit more, kid.
One million.

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,120
You have until seven o'clock tomorrow.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,279
Morning.

98
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,360
Morning.

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,079
Are you coming to the party?

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,360
-It starts at seven.
-We have nothing to celebrate.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Tomorrow morning,
we have an appointment with the doctor.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,920
What's wrong?
Now you have nothing to say?

103
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,839
I love you very much.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,279
And I hope someday you'll forgive me.

105
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,480
Hello. What?

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
Are you shitting me?

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
What do you mean, you don't have it?
Did they search for it?

108
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,120
Of course,
they searched everywhere for it.

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,839
They turned the place upside down.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,839
I don't know.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,360
That guy has no brain.
He could send us all to jail,

112
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
whether we pay or not.

113
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,439
Do you realize what you've done?

114
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,920
No, we can't give in.

115
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,279
We have to put an end to this,
or they'll ruin our lives.

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,879
-Did you really cancel the Croatia trip?
-Somebody had to do it.

117
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,079
Did you expect our families
to travel together

118
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,120
as if you and I were still a couple?

119
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,920
Let's leave the families out of it
until things are definite.

120
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,879
Carla?

121
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,199
-Maybe we can still work things out.
-What parallel world are you living in?

122
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,839
Did you hear her?

123
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,439
Polo, I'll ask you one more time.

124
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,759
Are you really going to let that guy
steal your girlfriend?

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
See how she ignores me?

126
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,399
-She won't listen.
-So stop talking.

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,160
Show her that you love her.
Take action. Do something!

128
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
Sure. It's so easy for you to say.

129
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,480
-How?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?

130
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
Guzmán... can we talk?

131
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,360
I guess they will take advantage
of the party for Marina to sneak out.

132
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,360
With the blackmail money, right?

133
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,959
So your brother takes your share,
and you rat him out?

134
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,839
I don't give a crap about him.

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,399
Believe it or not,
I do care about your sister.

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know what to do.
She won't listen to me.

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
She won't listen to me either.
But you can do something.

138
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,279
You can talk to your parents.
They can stop it.

139
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,600
I could. But I won't bother.

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
What do you mean?

141
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,679
She can move to the moon, if she wants to.
I'm sick of her.

142
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,919
Sick of protecting someone who wants
to jump off every cliff she sees.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,399
Well, let her jump, then. If she survives,
she might learn something.

144
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,639
-She's your sister.
-And the girl that screwed you over.

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
You, me, and my entire family.

146
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,039
She stole from and blackmailed us...
with your brother's help.

147
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,519
Why don't you talk to him?

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,679
For the same reason
I won't talk to my sister.

149
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,679
Because you know if something happens
to them, maybe they had it coming.

150
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,399
Hey.

151
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
-Do you know anything about...
-Omar?

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,919
They won't let me see him either.

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
What's up, guys? Last day!

154
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,919
Olé.

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,240
What's up with the long faces?

156
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm the one with four failed classes
for September.

157
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,639
You both passed everything,
and you look like your parents died.

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,000
Here, have a drink.
There's much to celebrate.

159
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,759
No.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Want some?

161
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,759
Do you know what Nano's doing?

162
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,480
Being awesome, that's what he's doing.

163
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,639
Your brother's an ace, Samu.
Don't you see he'll have a future now?

164
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,440
And you and I,
a house in Morocco on the beach

165
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,919
for this summer.
What more can you ask for?

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,039
Cheer up, man!

167
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,039
And you, don't down the whole bottle!

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,320
-Let me.
-Don't you dare.

169
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,759
-Let me help you.
-Help me?

170
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,360
Do you know what you're doing
to your family and mine?

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,960
You should be ashamed,
betraying your people like this.

172
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,600
They will be all right, Carla.

173
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,039
If your father pays.
You have plenty of money.

174
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,480
Right, like we can trust your boyfriend.

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,600
How do I know he won't
take the watch to the papers?

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,559
He won't, I assure you.

177
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,679
Right. Like I'd believe you!

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,039
The watch is in good hands.

179
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,480
Do you have it?

180
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,240
Your sister has it.

181
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
-Did she tell you so?
-Almost.

182
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,320
-What does she think she's doing?
-She's running away with Samuel's brother.

183
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,919
They probably planned it together.

184
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
When is she leaving?

185
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,679
My parents are watching her,
so probably tonight during the party.

186
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,240
-I don't think she'll even stop at home.
-Why do you ask?

187
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,600
That means she has the watch here.

188
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,000
-Aren't you getting changed?
-In a while.

189
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm delaying it as much as I can.

190
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,519
It's the last time I'll wear this.

191
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,799
Will we see each other again?

192
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,360
My father is making me change schools
precisely so I won't see you again.

193
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,039
Well, hello. How's the happy couple?

194
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,759
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here to contribute some glamour.

195
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320
Well, a lot of glamour,
to this celebration.

196
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,159
It actually looks a bit cheap.

197
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,399
But, Nadia, why are you leaving?

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,279
I'm not an obstacle to your relationship
and your happy ending.

199
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,840
Really, you can stay.

200
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,080
Dear, I mean it.
This woman is very difficult.

201
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,799
-It's going to be hard for you.
-Happy?

202
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,600
Yes.

203
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,879
Who am I to get in between the two of you?

204
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,159
In the end,
there wasn't really anything between us.

205
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,200
-Where's the catch?
-There's no catch here, Guzmán.

206
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,120
Sure, sometimes my competitive side
gets the best of me,

207
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,120
even if the prize isn't worth it.

208
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,799
HAPPY END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

209
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,559
Give us two.

210
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
No, no punch. Thanks.

211
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,440
Look.

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,240
Have a drink.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,360
Distract the waiter. OK?

214
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,039
Excuse me,

215
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
do you have any bottles, or something...

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Hi.

217
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,279
Can you force a locker open?

218
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,600
Why would I know how to force a lock?

219
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,799
Well, I know how to do a lot of things.
That's how it is in the school of life.

220
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,960
Polo has some photos of me on his phone.
I'm afraid he'll post them online.

221
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,120
He's so resentful now,
I think he might do it.

222
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,399
-I'll beat the crap out of him.
-No, that would be worse.

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,120
Could you get me his backpack?

224
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,360
It's in locker 134. Please!

225
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,559
OK. I'll see what I can do.

226
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,000
Excuse me. Could we talk for a moment?

227
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,919
There's nothing to talk about.

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,279
Just a moment. I want to propose a deal,
so that Nadia doesn't leave the school.

229
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,240
If you let her stay one more year,
I swear, on all things sacred,

230
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,000
I will stay away from her.
I won't even say hi.

231
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,080
-Have you tired of her?
-No.

232
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,879
No.

233
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
But you know as well as I do
that we have no future together.

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,799
But she has a future at this school,
so don't end it.

235
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,000
You can trust me.

236
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,720
I have many flaws, many.

237
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,799
But I'm a man of my word.

238
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,759
-I have to get back.
-Damn!

239
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,960
Is this the way it will always be?
When will you be free of your father?

240
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,519
And you of yours?

241
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,759
How many matches
will you play this summer?

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
And how many do you really want to play?

243
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,639
I only want to be with you.

244
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,240
We're screwed.

245
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,120
My father watches me all day long.

246
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,320
He only leaves me alone when he goes
to the bank in the afternoon.

247
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
Ten minutes of freedom.
That's all I can offer you this summer.

248
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,039
For one of the students
in the penultimate year,

249
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,440
this trophy not only means
the satisfaction of a job well done,

250
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,880
but also a scholarship to study
at our high school in Florida.

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,960
From there, you can go on
to an Ivy League college.

252
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,119
And the winner is...

253
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,000
Marina Nunier.

254
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,319
Hi.

255
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,559
Thank you for the award,
but I think someone else deserves it more.

256
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,359
I don't really have much
to be proud of this year.

257
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
So I wanted to take this opportunity
to apologize.

258
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
Sorry for all the damage
I may have caused.

259
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,079
For letting down those I love the most.

260
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,440
And the person who's made me feel
so much in a short time.

261
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,839
I tried to stop it all.

262
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,599
I tried...

263
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,480
to be a good daughter, a good sister.

264
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
I tried to live up to your feelings,
Samuel.

265
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,880
I wish we had our time machine to go back
and start from scratch.

266
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,680
But I was myself.

267
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,279
Stubborn, unafraid of danger...

268
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,119
and...

269
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,000
always getting in trouble.

270
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,839
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Why are you here?

272
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
And you?

273
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,799
I needed to think, Samuel.

274
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,200
Marina,

275
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,640
stay.

276
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,400
Please.

277
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,279
I don't want you to stay for me.
I want you to do it for yourself.

278
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,440
Did you see the way people looked at me?

279
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
I have nothing here, nobody.

280
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,400
They all hate me, with good reason.

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,279
I don't hate you.

282
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,640
Not because I don't want to,
but because I can't.

283
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,799
I'm sure if I've forgiven you
after what you did to me,

284
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,519
the rest can, too.

285
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
I don't see how.

286
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,319
Well, it's not by running away.
That is not the way.

287
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Much less after blackmailing your family.

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,079
And after throwing away your future
to go with a guy you don't know.

289
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,799
Please, don't do something you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

290
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Please.

291
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,279
No.

292
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,839
NANO, FORGIVE ME, BUT I CAN'T DO THIS.

293
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,799
I CAN'T LEAVE, I'M SOR

294
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,599
I'm on my way.

295
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,559
I'm not sure about this.

296
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,319
I don't know.

297
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,720
Where are you?

298
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,839
I'm at the swimming pool. I'm--

299
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,200
OK, I'm on my way.
I'll be there in a minute. Don't move.

300
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,839
-Guzmán!
-What are you doing?

301
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,319
I just talked to her.
She's leaving for good. Do something!

302
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
-Who?
-Marina.

303
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,359
-I just talked to her, and she's leaving.
-Leave me alone.

304
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
-Go away. Leave me alone.
-Please!

305
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,640
Did you get the backpack?

306
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,279
-You couldn't force the lock?
-I didn't want to.

307
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,359
You don't fool me.
That is Marina's locker.

308
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,359
So what?
I asked you because it matters to me.

309
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,920
-You can still--
-No, I don't want to.

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,359
I am not your lapdog,
and I won't do everything you ask.

311
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,880
Does she want to fuck? We fuck.

312
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,839
Does she want a backpack stolen?
I steal it for her.

313
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,839
No.

314
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
-What's the matter with you?
-I am fed up, Carla.

315
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,839
I want you to see me as an equal.

316
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,759
I want to be your boyfriend, for real.

317
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,400
And I know I am poor
and you are a marchioness,

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,839
and our relationship is only possible
in Disney movies.

319
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,880
But if we're going to try,
I want to really try. To go all in.

320
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,279
I don't want to be your gigolo,
or your thief, or someone you can use.

321
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,160
So laugh all you want now.

322
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,440
Can I tell you something

323
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,519
without you thinking
I see you as a gigolo?

324
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,000
Or like someone I go to
for sex or to steal?

325
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,039
You just turned me on.

326
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,039
-Why are you here?
-The watch, Marina, please.

327
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,160
What?

328
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,200
Give me the watch, please.
Can't you hear me?

329
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
-Give me the watch.
-No.

330
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,480
-Give me the fucking watch, please!
-No!

331
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,839
Why the hell do you have to get involved,
huh?

332
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
-You stole from my girlfriend!
-She's not your girlfriend anymore!

333
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,400
What?

334
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,960
So...

335
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,319
You thought
that if you got the watch back for her,

336
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
she would take you back? Shit!

337
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
What are you laughing at, Marina?

338
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,119
What the fuck are you laughing at?
Know what you are?

339
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,599
Huh? You know what you are?
A damn thief, that's what you are!

340
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
Yes! Betraying your people

341
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,079
for the first guy from the hood you meet.
Asshole!

342
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
-Yeah! Watch it.
-Know what your girlfriend's doing?

343
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,799
Falling for the first guy
from the hood she meets. She's using you.

344
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,759
-Don't fuck with me.
-It will be worse still, know why?

345
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,759
-She's not going back to you!
-Give me the fucking watch.

346
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,880
-She's using you, Polo!
-Is it in your pocket? Answer me.

347
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,319
-She's using you!
-Give me the watch, Marina!

348
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,720
She's using you, Polo!

349
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,279
Like they all do! Like my brother does!
You are their puppet!

350
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,039
I pity you!

351
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,400
Shit.

352
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
What the hell?

353
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,400
What happened?

354
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,279
Polo, what have you done?

355
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,640
I don't know.

356
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,839
-But I think she's not breathing.
-Who's not breathing?

357
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,599
Did anyone see you?

358
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
Polo, did anyone see you?

359
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,400
Good.

360
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's get the blood off you. Come.

361
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,000
All right. Your hands. Give me your hands.

362
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,559
Fucking shirt.

363
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
-Christian.
-What?

364
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,599
Do you have a shirt to lend him?

365
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,880
-Can you explain to me--
-Get a fucking shirt!

366
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Look at me!

367
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,079
Get rid of the trophy.

368
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,440
Nobody can see you with it.
Do you hear me?

369
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,119
Can you tell me
who the hell is not breathing?

370
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,519
Polo! Damn it,
who the hell isn't breathing?

371
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,920
Marina.

372
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,119
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention?

373
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,319
I need you to leave the room
in an orderly fashion.

374
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,440
There's been an incident.

375
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,559
I repeat, in an orderly fashion.

376
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,440
Thank you very much.

377
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,319
-Can you calm down, please?
-How can you ask me to calm down? Fuck!

378
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,279
The police are talking to everybody.
They will call on me.

379
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,920
You won't say a word.

380
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,160
-Because you saw nothing.
-But I did! He killed Marina, damn it!

381
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
That would be covering it up!

382
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,480
You wanted to be my boyfriend, right?
To be one of us.

383
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,880
For me to treat you like an equal.

384
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,680
Then you must know that, among us,
we always, always protect each other.

385
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Like Polo did.

386
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,319
He did it for me.

387
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,319
And if you had opened that locker,
he wouldn't have had to do it.

388
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,079
You realize what you've done, right?

389
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,000
This is much more serious, damn it!

390
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,559
You want your Disney movie?

391
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,079
Because you've just been given
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

392
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,759
Seize it.

393
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,599
Excuse me, are you Guzmán?

394
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Yes.

395
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,079
-May we speak for a moment?
-Why me?

396
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,119
-Come with me, please.
-Where's my sister?

397
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,160
-Guzmán.
-Where's my sister?

398
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,519
-Calm down, Guzmán. Come with me.
-Where's my sister?

399
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,240
I said, where's my sister!

400
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,000
-Calm down, Guzmán, please. Let's talk.
-Where is my sister? Damn it!

401
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,759
Polo.

402
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
Did you get rid of...?

403
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,200
Good.

404
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,240
They'll realize. When they question me,
they'll figure it out.

405
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,839
-I-- I know they will.
-No, listen to me.

406
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,319
You went home because you were very drunk.

407
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,960
Then I texted you to come
because something serious had happened.

408
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,440
Repeat that.

409
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,400
Polo, repeat that.

410
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,559
I was very drunk, and I went home.

411
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,840
My mothers had gone out for dinner.

412
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,760
Carla, my girlfriend, called and said
something terrible had happened.

413
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,119
Then I went back to school.

414
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,599
-At what time did you leave the party?
-I don't know.

415
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,039
-Around nine, I think.
-And you went straight home?

416
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:32,480
Can anybody confirm
the time you got home?

417
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,800
There was nobody home.

418
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,599
Are there security cameras
in your housing complex?

419
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,119
Maybe we could check the footage
to confirm the time of your arrival.

420
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,480
Sorry, am I under suspicion?

421
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,599
No, these are routine checks,
nothing to worry about.

422
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,880
If the cameras confirm the time
you gave us, it will all be all right.

423
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
We are done.

424
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,480
Are you all right? Is anything wrong?

425
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,840
Yes, I'm fine.

426
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,719
Listen...

427
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:28,159
How about later today
we prepare the summer schedule?

428
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
No hurries.

429
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,519
It will take our minds off this.

430
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,280
I don't want to go to any championships.
I want to stay here this summer.

431
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
And I don't want to play tennis.

432
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,880
Losing a classmate is terrible.

433
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,840
I can't even imagine how you feel.

434
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,679
But life goes on, Ander.

435
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,800
And no matter how hard it is,
life must go on.

436
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,639
I know. And I want it to go on.

437
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,840
But I want it to be my life that goes on.
The life I choose.

438
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,920
And I don't want to play tennis anymore,
Dad.

439
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
It's over.

440
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,039
Over there.

441
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,599
Thanks for coming.

442
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,000
I love you.

443
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,559
When they check the cameras,
they'll see I arrived much later.

444
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,440
They'll know I lied, and they'll catch me.

445
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,000
Fuck, I never should have said
I went home. That was stupid.

446
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,519
-That was stupid.
-No. You were drunk.

447
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,360
It could've taken you longer
than you thought to get home.

448
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,960
We can make something up.
I'm not going to let you end up in jail.

449
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,000
It was an accident.

450
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,840
Look at me.

451
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,840
What happened was an accident.

452
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,559
-And you can't pay for that.
-I killed her, Carla.

453
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,960
It was a fit of rage, you know me.
I didn't want to.

454
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,760
-Don't talk nonsense.
-I'll pay for it.

455
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,639
We must keep a cool head.

456
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,000
Why are you helping me?

457
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Because you helped me
and saved my family.

458
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,880
Listen to me. You and I are not together.

459
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,599
What's more, let's say we hate each other.

460
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,039
That would mean you had no motive
to kill Marina.

461
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
Why would you want the watch? You see?

462
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,199
It wouldn't make sense.
You'd have no motive.

463
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,880
Nobody will think it was you, OK?

464
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,039
We are not together.

465
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,800
Where's Marina?

466
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,519
Why won't they bring her body?
I want to say goodbye.

467
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,639
-They need to perform an autopsy.
-I don't care!

468
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,360
I want them to bring my daughter now!

469
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,679
-What is it? What are you looking at?
-Mom, that's enough.

470
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,719
Guzmán.

471
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Where's Marina?

472
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,239
Where is she?

473
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,280
-Omar, I'm off to the bank. Be right back.
-All right.

474
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,880
Ten minutes, right?

475
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,360
I'll cover for you.

476
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,440
Until Dad gets back.

477
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Come.

478
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,840
I can't stop thinking
about that poor girl.

479
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,039
I don't know what I would've done
if it had been you.

480
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,599
Dad, I'm all right.

481
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,639
I never liked that school.

482
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,920
What does the school have to do with it?
That could have happened anywhere.

483
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,519
You still want to go?

484
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,639
Fine.
If you want to go back next year, you can.

485
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,800
But I don't want to hear
about that boy again.

486
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,639
I don't want you to go near him.
I don't want you to do anything but study.

487
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,440
You can go back.
But only on that condition.

488
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,039
No.

489
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,400
If I go back,
it will be with no conditions.

490
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,119
If I go back,
it will be to be a student like the rest.

491
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,079
I don't know if anything
will happen with Guzmán,

492
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,199
or with someone else.
Or if nothing will happen at all.

493
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,199
But if I go back,
it will be unconditionally.

494
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,079
You see? See how they've changed you?

495
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,559
Dad, maybe I haven't changed.

496
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,440
Maybe the old Nadia wasn't me.

497
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,920
She was a girl who tried
to please her parents above all.

498
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Maybe I'm different.

499
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,119
Like your sister?

500
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,079
No.

501
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,119
I don't know who I am yet.
But I'm going to find out.

502
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,920
I hope you and Mom can accept it
and love me.

503
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,440
But I'm going to be myself, Dad. Myself.

504
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,360
We know who killed her.

505
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,639
On the first of June, around 9:30 p.m.,

506
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,920
you entered the school pool.

507
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,679
Marina was there.

508
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,639
You had an increasingly heated argument...

509
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,639
until you picked up the trophy,

510
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,920
and hit her
in the back of the head with it.

511
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,159
She did not die instantly,

512
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,800
which means you left her there,
bleeding to death.

513
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,960
Come with me, please.

514
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,320
This is what we believe happened,

515
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,159
and, more importantly,

516
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,679
what the judge believes happened.

517
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,719
You'd save us a lot of work if you told us
where to find the murder weapon,

518
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
the trophy.

519
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,039
Oh, right,

520
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,840
you don't have a shred of evidence.
Nothing.

521
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,360
It's him.

522
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,400
You're under arrest
for the murder of Marina Nunier.

523
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,920
-What?
-Hold him tight.

524
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:52,199
What the fuck are you saying?

525
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,519
-Grab him!
-What the hell are you saying?

526
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,599
Look me in the face and say it again!

527
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,840
We have a witness, your brother.

528
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,159
A motive.

529
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,559
As her messages prove,
she'd changed her mind about running away.

530
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,880
That's why you killed her.

531
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,480
Samu! You know I'd never hurt Marina.

532
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,159
-Get him!
-You know I'd never hurt Marina, Samu!

533
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,519
They killed her for that watch.

534
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,880
The pen drive had a lot of dirt
on her father, and we wanted money for it.

535
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,039
Those people are nasty.

536
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,000
They broke into my house,
assaulted my brother.

537
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,199
Come on! Look me in the face!

538
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,800
Marina had... She had that watch.
Somebody killed her and took it.

539
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,480
One of those rich fucks.
The marchioness, for example.

540
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,079
-She stood to lose the most.
-We don't have the watch.

541
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,159
Or any proof of that blackmail.

542
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:38,119
You have the cell phone
I used to talk to that guy.

543
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,239
You have no proof of what you're saying.

544
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,559
Of course, I'm the one who needs proof
to accuse those rich people.

545
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,760
Breakfast is served.

546
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,000
Darling, are you all right?

547
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm fine.

548
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,320
Or I will be.

549
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,239
It's all over.

550
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,039
Come, they've made pancakes,
and they are positively yummy.

551
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,920
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

552
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,280
Yes.

553
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:21,920
Go to hell.

554
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,440
We can get this to go, and go home.
You've had enough.

555
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,119
Son of a bitch!

556
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,239
If you hadn't come to our school,
this wouldn't have happened.

557
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,760
-Is it my fault?
-Your murderer brother's and yours.

558
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,559
Because you introduced them, right?

559
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,360
Live with that.

560
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
No. You could have stopped it,
and you didn't.

561
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,199
You did nothing.
If you're looking for a guilty party,

562
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,599
-look in the fucking mirror!
-What do you mean?

563
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,239
Hey, no! Enough, Guzmán!

564
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,079
For your own good, don't even think
of returning to our school, you hear?

565
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,159
You've been told so many times
that you own the world

566
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:23,039
that you actually believe it, huh?

567
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,239
See you in class, Lucrecia.

568
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,599
That's if they let you go back.

569
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,679
Guzmán.

570
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,920
What are you doing there?
Can you get down, please?

571
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,039
Samuel was right.

572
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,039
If I had talked to my parents,
or to Marina, she'd be alive.

573
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:07,960
No.

574
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,440
The only one who is to blame
is the one who killed her. Nobody else!

575
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,480
My sister is dead.

576
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,880
I know, sweetie.

577
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,480
And I know it hurts a lot.

578
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,159
I know because...
if something happened to you, I would die.

579
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,119
And so would your parents.

580
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,440
So please...
don't cause any more pain, will you?

581
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,679
And get down from there already!

582
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,840
I need to hold you.

583
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:47,920
Come.

584
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,400
Guzmán!

585
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,719
Please.

586
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,000
Come.

587
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,800
Do something like this again,
and I'll kill you myself, you hear me?

588
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,639
Thank you. You're always there.

589
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,280
Where else would I be?

590
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,000
I need you.

591
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,400
No.

592
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,679
I need you, Lu.

593
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,559
ARE YOU COMING?
WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU

594
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,400
It's because of me.

595
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,239
They arrested my brother because of me.

596
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,480
I was so mad at him,
I thought he was capable of killing her.

597
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,599
-You are not to blame for anything.
-I accused him.

598
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,320
-And he's not guilty.
-I know.

599
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,199
There must be a way to prove
it wasn't him.

600
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,280
Even if we had seen the murderer
with our own eyes,

601
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,000
who would believe us, Samu?

602
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,360
It wouldn't do any good.

603
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,519
Christian, I need your help.
He's my brother and your best friend.

604
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,960
We need to do whatever we can.

605
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,280
There must be some evidence, something.
You have to help me.

606
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,039
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

607
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,679
