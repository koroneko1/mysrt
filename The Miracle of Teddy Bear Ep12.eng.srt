1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,960
…The person I thought would take my side

2
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,479
and protect me

3
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
turn against me like that.

4
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm so sorry.

5
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,639
Mutual understanding

6
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,199
requires an open mind.

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
When did you get so smart?

8
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,400
Do you like it?

9
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,479
I like it.

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,199
What happened to you in the past

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,439
made you lose faith in love,

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,039
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

13
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,560
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

14
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,840
-Dress up tomorrow.
-Yes?

15
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,479
We are going shopping tomorrow.

16
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
Nut.

17
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,319
This is Mr. Nobu.

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,080
He wants to buy your show
and broadcast it in Japan.

19
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,520
Hello.

20
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,560
Hello.

21
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,639
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,280
I am from Tokyo. My name is Nobu.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,439
Please be kind to me.

24
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,319
This is Mr. Yoshi.

25
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,159
He is an entertainment reporter.
He's here to interview you.

26
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,479
Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,439
-Mr. Nobu.
-Yes?

28
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,000
We will go and sign
the contract in my office.

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,960
And leave Nut and Mr. Yoshi here
for the interview.

30
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,639
-Mr. Nobu.
-Yes?

31
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,400
Want some Japanese sake?

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,240
I love sake.

33
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,800
-Rice whiskey?
-Whiskey.

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,719
Mrs. Na,

35
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,319
Nut has not read it yet.

36
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,560
He is probably busy.

37
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,960
That’s all right.

38
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,719
We can go by ourselves.

39
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,160
How about these?

40
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,680
They're a bit bright.

41
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,639
People can see them from miles away.

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
How about some plain ones?

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

44
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,199
Do you have other colors?

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,439
We do. Please wait a moment.

46
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,920
Do they fit well?

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,639
They are a little tight.

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,519
-Miss.
-Yes?

49
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
Do you have a bigger size?

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,519
Of course. One moment please.

51
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,600
I will take a look over there.

52
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Okay.

53
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,399
Are they comfy?

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,639
Try walking in them.

55
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,120
Anything you like?

56
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,120
They are all pretty. I can't pick one.

57
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,319
Why don't we let Nut pick one for you?

58
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,279
Shall we?

59
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Nut.

60
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,519
Can you pick something for your mom?

61
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,759
I told him

62
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,360
that your phone is broken.

63
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
What about this one?

64
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,560
Would it suit Mom?

65
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,679
It looks good.

66
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,879
We should get the right color.

67
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,639
I think she would like a pink one.

68
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,200
Thank you, son.

69
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,360
Let's go.

70
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
What color would you like?

71
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,039
The one that best suits my mom.

72
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,879
Then I recommend this shade.

73
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
It should suit you.

74
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,720
Do you like it?

75
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,159
How much is it?

76
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,440
It is 599 baht.

77
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,320
I stay home most of the time,
so I don't wear much makeup.

78
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,639
You can look pretty at home too.

79
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,080
Are they both your sons?
They're so handsome.

80
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes.

81
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,200
He is my son.

82
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
He is also my son.

83
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,120
The three of us are a family.

84
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
What about those two? Are they yours too?

85
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,360
They've been looking over here.

86
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
Song.

87
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,320
Why are you following me?

88
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
Who followed you?

89
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,679
I was passing by and got a little curious.

90
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,679
All this time, I have never seen you
go out with your mother.

91
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,399
So I was wondering

92
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,480
what has gotten into you today.

93
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,399
Nothing much.

94
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I just brought my mom to the mall.

95
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,039
I am glad you are happy.

96
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,080
I've been waiting for this day.

97
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,039
What about you?

98
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,759
Why is he with you?

99
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
You and he…

100
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
Well, I…

101
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,360
What about us?

102
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,879
Well?

103
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
So?

104
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
This kid…

105
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,960
is not with me.

106
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
It's me…

107
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
who is here with him.

108
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,240
So, are you two together?

109
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,799
Yes, as you can see.

110
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,960
You said you didn't like younger guys.

111
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,799
Did I?

112
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,559
When was that? I can't recall.

113
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,919
Well done.

114
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,399
I will reward you with something later.

115
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
You are the sweetest.

116
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,360
Why aren’t we ordering something?
I'm hungry.

117
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,399
Go for it, Tofu. Tell me what you want.

118
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,960
Today, I am so happy
that I will treat you.

119
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,960
-You said it.
-Of course.

120
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll order, then.

121
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,679
Alright. Go ahead.

122
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,720
-I want this one.
-This one?

123
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,879
-And this.
-And this?

124
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,679
-This one and this one.
-Those two?

125
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,879
This one and this one. I want all of them.

126
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,679
-Good job.
-All… all of them?

127
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,080
Yes.

128
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,399
You want all of them?

129
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,639
Are you sure?

130
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,279
-You said it was a treat.
-Really?

131
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
-You said you would pay.
-I will.

132
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,559
Eat what you like and I'll swipe my card.

133
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,799
Hurry up and grow.

134
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,559
There is a kid waiting to eat you.

135
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,240
You're in a good mood today.

136
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,519
You went on a date, right?
I saw Song earlier.

137
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm in a good mood because of Nut.

138
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,200
I saw Nut. He took
his mom and Tofu shopping.

139
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,639
Nut made up with his mom.

140
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,440
Really?

141
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,519
A lot of time was wasted though.

142
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,879
What I mean is…

143
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,240
had they reconciled earlier,

144
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,559
they would have spent
much more time together, right?

145
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,159
You too, Gen.

146
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,960
Don’t make love difficult.

147
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,000
You never know what is going to happen.

148
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:30,840
Be good to each other,
so you don’t regret it later.

149
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,240
You know me.

150
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,679
You are my son after all.
Of course, I know you.

151
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,759
Thank you so much.

152
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,320
I had a great time today, son.

153
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,600
This has made becoming human worthwhile.

154
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,679
At the very least,

155
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,759
I get to help in healing the rift
between Nut and his mom.

156
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,679
It made me realize

157
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,799
that whether you are a mother or a child,

158
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,080
everyone makes mistakes.

159
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
I’m going, Mom.

160
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,279
What about…

161
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,200
my lunchbox?

162
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,680
I'm going.

163
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,279
All right.

164
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,799
By accepting each other’s flaws

165
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,759
with love and understanding,

166
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,799
only then can the void be filled.

167
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,599
Seeing this

168
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,119
has been worth it,

169
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,400
even if

170
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,400
I might be gone forever one day.

171
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,160
You're here early, Gen.

172
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
You are late.

173
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,920
Hey, Gen. Let go.

174
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,319
You're suddenly so possessive.

175
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,160
-Won't you share anymore?
-No.

176
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,920
It's a good thing Prib isn't here.

177
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,599
Or else she would ask you for some.

178
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,319
You are right.

179
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,519
Where is my niece?

180
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,519
Kuenchai.

181
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,119
Why are you barking?

182
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,519
Prib?

183
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,640
I need to talk to you.

184
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,759
Do you know Tatarn?

185
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,559
Do you know him too?

186
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,079
Did Nut tell you about him?

187
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
Nut told me about his ex.

188
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,519
He never told me the name.

189
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,960
I found out his name is Tatarn.

190
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,880
You are friends with him on Facebook.

191
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,759
Can you take me to see him?

192
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,240
I have to ask him something.

193
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,480
I would like to,

194
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,319
but Tarn is in a coma and has not been
responsive for months now.

195
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,000
I really shouldn’t tell you this

196
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,599
as it might be hard for you.

197
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,319
But this is a really important matter.

198
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,200
I want Nut to visit Tarn.

199
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,559
A miracle could happen.

200
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,920
Even if it doesn't,

201
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
at least,

202
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,880
Tarn gets to see Nut one last time.

203
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,680
Can you help me just this once?

204
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,640
I've heard people say

205
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,119
that happiness often doesn’t last.

206
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:20,319
It is actually my secret,

207
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,319
but I will tell you about it.

208
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,279
Before I was into Nut,

209
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,200
I used to like Tarn.

210
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,920
It's a small world sometimes, Tofu.

211
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,480
Two people I liked used to be in love.

212
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,440
And that’s also why I want to help Tarn.

213
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,240
That's why Tarn asked you
to draw him with Nut.

214
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,279
He never mentioned Nut
in that page or on Facebook,

215
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,680
but I can tell

216
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,200
from all those photos and messages

217
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,920
that he wanted Nut to know.

218
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,119
Tarn still loves Nut, doesn't he?

219
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I don’t know about that.

220
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,759
All I know is that

221
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,519
Tarn never wanted to trouble Nut.

222
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,400
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy.

223
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,519
He wants him to do the job he loves

224
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,839
and be surrounded by good people.

225
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,519
And what happened between them

226
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,039
should just be left as a happy memory.

227
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,119
Isn’t that obvious?

228
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,400
If he is still in love with Nut,

229
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,799
why didn’t he come back for him?

230
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,880
I know why.

231
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,279
What did you just say?

232
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,799
Well,

233
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,319
you were wondering

234
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,160
why they didn’t get back together.

235
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,880
I think the guy is not sure
if the girl wants him back.

236
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,359
Though they used to love each other

237
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,480
and they broke up out of necessity,

238
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
no one stays the same forever.

239
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,680
Now that the girl has feelings
for that other guy,

240
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,799
the guy who has been waiting

241
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
is now afraid to act.

242
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,039
Well…

243
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,480
How do you think it will end?

244
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,160
Just wait and see.

245
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,519
TATARN KLAIANANT

246
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,359

TATARN KLAIANANT, AN ARTIST WHOSE ART

UNCOVER TATARN KLAIANANT,
A YOUNGBLOOD ARTIST AND ENVIRONMENTALIST

249
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,200
SPECIAL INTERVIEW WITH TATARN KLAIANANT

250
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,519
AN AWARD-WINNING ADVERTISER AND ACTIVIST

251
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,319
TATARN KLAIANANT AND HIS FAMOUS WORKS

252

TATARN KLAIANANT AND HIS FAMOUS WORKS

253
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,319
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

254
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,200
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

255
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,160
ENTHUSIASTIC ADVERTISER, TATARN KLAIANANT

256
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,319
The world is not fair.

257
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,680
Why is he so good at everything?

258
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
He is skillful,

259
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,079
cool,

260
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,920
and probably rich.

261
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,119
If only he were here

262
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,519
instead of a useless amnesiac like me…

263
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,640
What do you think?

264
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,000
Does it still smell good?

265
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,720
-It smells so good, Tarn.
-Of course.

266
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,559
Try some.

267
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,440
-How is it?
-Amazing.

268
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,279
How sweet. Now, get back to work.

269
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,000
If Nut had stayed with him,

270
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,160
he might have been happier
than he is with me.

271
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,839
Tofu.

272
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,559
Can you smell something burning?

273
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,720
Tofu!

274
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,720
You're miles away. It's burnt.

275
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Oh, gosh.

276
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Hey.

277
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,880
Jeez!

278
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,559
How am I supposed to eat that?

279
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,160
Don't eat it if you don’t want to.

280
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,000
I thought you wanted fried pork,
so I made some.

281
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,440
If it's that bad,

282
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,640
then get someone else to cook for you.

283
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,960
I will give this to Kuenchai.

284
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,559
Kuenchai, come here.

285
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Here.

286
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,359
Eat it.

287
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
What is it, boys?

288
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,119
It's nothing, Mrs. Na.

289
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,160
I burnt the fried pork.

290
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,799
I’m heading to the market.

291
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,480
I get Nut now, Kuenchai.

292
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,519
I didn’t mean to be unreasonable.

293
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,400
I couldn't help it.

294
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,519
I lost, Kuenchai.

295
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,039
I couldn't compete with him.

296
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,319
Maybe…

297
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,519
I should just tell him.

298
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,319
Tell me what?

299
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,160
I thought you went to the market.

300
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,279
I didn't make it that far.

301
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,279
What did you want to tell me?

302
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,039
I was going to say…

303
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,559
I’m sorry.

304
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,039
I don’t know what's up with me.

305
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,640
I know.

306
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
How did you know?

307
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,880
Because I’m the best.

308
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,400
I’m your boyfriend,

309
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,960
so I know what you are thinking.

310
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,440
Don’t make that face.

311
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,240
People will say I'm picking on a kid.

312
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,319
Stop overthinking.

313
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,160
I don’t know if I did something that made
you feel insecure.

314
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,119
I will tell you this one more time.

315
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,519
You are you,

316
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,440
and I love that about you.

317
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
I didn’t want to feel this way.

318
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
I just can’t help it.

319
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,599
Let me stay like this a bit longer.

320
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
What’s the matter with you, Tofu?

321
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,519
If I’m unreasonable like this again,

322
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,039
will you still love me?

323
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,039
I’m like that all the time,

324
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,200
and you still love me.

325
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,039
What if…

326
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,359
you meet someone better than me,

327
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
someone you are happier with,

328
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,319
and isn't a burden like me?

329
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,640
Will you leave me for him?

330
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,240
All right.

331
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,640
Even if you always burn the pork,

332
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
I won’t leave you.

333
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,160
Are you satisfied?

334
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,480
I promise

335
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,440
that I won’t give you cancer.

336
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,079
I will fry the pork beautifully next time.

337
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,720
I'll make it like

338
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,880
how you used to have it.

339
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,000
When did I ever tell you
that the fried pork I used to eat

340
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
was so good?

341
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,519
Where did you get this from?

342
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,279
Why do you ask? Do you want some?

343
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,559
I only asked where you got it,

344
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,079
so that I won’t eat there.

345
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,319
I made it myself.

346
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,240
It might not look great,

347
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,440
but it tastes amazing.

348
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,400
Want to try it?

349
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,680
Yuck.

350
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,920
Try it. I put a lot of effort into it.

351
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Here.

352
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
How is it?

353
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,079
Delicious, right?

354
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Hey,

355
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,319
it's great.

356
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,240
If you want more,
then eat with me every day.

357
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,079
I live alone.

358
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,960
How about I make you Thai barbecue

359
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
over at my condo?

360
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
It looked…

361
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,480
It looked just like the stuff you made.

362
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,240
It was all in your head
and you blamed me for it.

363
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,920
Don’t get all upset
about me remembering it.

364
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,480
It was just one of the first times
we ate together. That's all.

365
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,160
Do you remember
the first time we ate together?

366
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:55,440
Are you looking for something
to argue about, Tofu?

367
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,200
Stop comparing yourself with someone else.

368
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,440
Be confident in yourself.

369
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,039
And trust me.

370
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,119
You said you wanted me
to be patient with you.

371
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,400
You should be patient with me too.

372
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,799
I promise

373
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,599
that I won’t be like this…

374
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,119
too often.

375
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,960
Tofu.

376
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,440
THE LITTLE PRINCE

377
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,799
Where have you been?

378
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,960
Did you get the pork?

379
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,759
I’m sorry I made you worry.

380
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,319
Also, I didn’t get any pork.

381
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,680
That’s fine.

382
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,200
Never mind. Nhong brought
some stir-fried rice noodles he made.

383
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,640
I'll set the table.

384
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,519
Let me help you.

385
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,880
I'll pour the water.

386
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,239
THE LITTLE PRINCE

387
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,159
THE LITTLE PRINCE

388
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,760
Is your work done?
You're checking holiday spots.

389
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,920
Do you want me to only work
and ignore Mom and you?

390
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,559
Would you like that?

391
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,639
No.

392
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,119
Don’t tell me

393
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,960
that you're taking us on holiday.

394
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
Yes.

395
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,440
I saw Mom reading The Little Prince
over and over.

396
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,360
She might want to travel like he did.

397
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,639
You guys will go out of your minds
just staying at home.

398
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,199
Let's take a trip and relax.

399
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,079
This time,

400
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,719
we'll go as a family.

401
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,400
We can go as a couple next time.

402
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,280
Deal.

403
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,199
Help me pick a place.
Where should I take Mom?

404
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
We haven't been anywhere together
for ages.

405
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,400
Well…

406
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,880
How about we ask your mom?

407
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,960
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

408
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,039
I don't mind. You decide.

409
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,239
See? I told you.

410
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,679
You are her son.
Of course, you know what she thinks.

411
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,039
If Mom won’t choose,

412
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,400
then I'll let you choose.

413
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,519
Where shall we go?

414
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,480
I can choose?

415
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,800
I want to go to Chiang Mai.

416
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,320
What is it, Kuenchai?

417
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,400
Don't give me that look.

418
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,920
You don’t get to go.

419
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,280
Stay home.

420
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,840
TOFU: NUT, MRS. NA AND I
ARE GOING TO CHIANG MAI.

421
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,320
PRIBPREE: SORRY I GAVE YOU A HARD TIME,
TOFU. I WAS BEING SELFISH, WASN'T I?

422
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,360
TOFU: EVERYONE CAN BE SELFISH,
ME INCLUDED.

423
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,239
I didn't promise Prib anything.

424
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,760
Maybe not,
but you're dragging Nut to Chiang Mai.

425
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,679
I want to see if you can stand
not telling Nut about it.

426
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,599
I know this is important.

427
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,679
It is a matter of life and death,

428
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,440
but I don’t want to tell him about it.

429
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,519
I’m afraid.

430
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,039
Humans need to be
a little selfish sometimes

431
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,480
in order to avoid getting hurt too badly.

432
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,880
I don’t want to be that kind of human.

433
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,719
They are so fearful, dishonest,

434
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
envious,

435
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,960
and even jealous.

436
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,000
That is because you are in love.

437
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,519
You'll learn more about life as you grow.

438
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,280
I know Nut
will always be there to help you.

439
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,079
Tofu.

440
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,039
Why aren't you packing?

441
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,719
We’re leaving tomorrow.

442
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,840
Here.

443
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,719
What’s wrong?

444
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,360
I'm tired.

445
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,880
Well…

446
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,480
This trip is kind of sudden.

447
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,599
Are you sure Juea won't mind?

448
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,920
Why would he mind?

449
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,320
I worked day and night
to finish the script.

450
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,719
He has a lot to work on.

451
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,199
What about Gen?

452
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,760
Can you go pack now?

453
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,679
I can’t. I’m exhausted.

454
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,840
Do you feel better now?

455
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,559
Nut is going to Chiang Mai.

456
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,760
Right.

457
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
He said he is taking his family on a trip.

458
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,960
-I see.
-So what?

459
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,599
I’m envious.

460
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,559
I haven’t taken a vacation in ages.

461
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,079
Then take the vacation now.

462
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,639
And I'm going with you.

463
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,880
Hey.

464
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,400
Here to deliver food?

465
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,800
No.

466
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,760
I’m here to see my boyfriend.

467
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm just kidding.

468
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,800
I’m here to pick up my check.

469
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,920
What are you talking about?

470
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,599
Well, Nut is going to Chiang Mai.

471
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,199
Gen wants to go too,

472
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,440
so I’m going to take him there.

473
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,199
We can go and see my dad too.

474
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,360
Who said I’m going?

475
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,119
I’m going.

476
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,320
Who's that?

477
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
Hello?

478
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Tofu.

479
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,039
What's taking you so long?

480
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,519
You seem more excited than me.

481
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,159
You talk too much.

482
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,760
Go pack your suitcase.

483
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,639
Go.

484
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,800
Is anyone there?

485
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
Keep an eye on the house for us.

486
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,480
-Okay.
-Don't worry. We'll tend to your house.

487
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,960
If something happens, give me a call.

488
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,639
Thank you so much.

489
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,880
No problem. Have a good trip.

490
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
I hope you all have a great time.

491
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Okay.

492
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,039
Where is Kuenchai?

493
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,360
Is he going too?

494
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,440
-Hey.
-Hey.

495
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,719
He's in the car.

496
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,079
Kuenchai.

497
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,519
He probably wants to go.

498
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,159
-There he is.
-You can't go. Come here.

499
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,519
There he is.

500
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,079
-Kuenchai.
-Kuenchai.

501
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,360
Hey.

502
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,039
Kuenchai. Come here, boy.

503
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,639
Sit.

504
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:12,239
Be a good boy, all right?

505
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,920
I’ll be back soon. Okay?

506
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,639
Be good.

507
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,280
Don't be a bad boy.

508
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,880
-Let's go.
-Kuenchai.

509
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,760
-Nhong.
-Sorry to bother you.

510
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,719
-Come here.
-Kuenchai, sit.

511
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,280
Here, turn that way.

512
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,480
I’m sorry we can’t take you with us.

513
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,000
I'll buy you some treats, okay?

514
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,239
Have fun.

515
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,079
Shall we go?

516
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,280
Let’s go.

517
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,679
Thanks for your help. Take care.

518
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,320
-Goodbye.
-Have a safe trip.

519
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,639
-Thank you.
-Bye, Kuenchai.

520
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,440
-Bye.
-Bye. Be good.

521
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,239
-Wave goodbye.
-Bye.

522
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,320
It’s beautiful.

523
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,199
Oh, wow.

524
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,039
Nut.

525
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:12,679
What's up, bro?

526
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,039
-Hello.
-Hello.

527
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,360
How was the drive? Are you tired?

528
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,039
Why are you so hyper?

529
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,880
Are you tired, Mrs. Na?

530
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,239
Just a little.

531
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,440
Well, well…

532
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:27,400
You don’t look like someone
who has just traveled for ten hours.

533
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,159
I’m envious.

534
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,800
I want to take a road trip too.

535
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,679
-I'm going to check in.
-All right.

536
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,159
Mom, Tofu, let’s go.

537
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,760
-Do you need me?
-Of course. We need your ID card.

538
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,320
Coming by plane is better.

539
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,000
Your food delivery motorbike
is not a big bike.

540
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,119
Even if it were, I wouldn't ride with you.

541
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,719
You might get weird and take orders
along the way.

542
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,400
I could drive your car here.

543
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,039
Why trouble yourself driving?

544
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,079
Just enjoy the trip, all right?

545
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,199
We get it. You care about Song.

546
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:03,960
Are we done?

547
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,599
I’m sick of this lovey-dovey vibe.

548
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:07,719
That's harsh.

549
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,559
You could've told me so.

550
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,119
-I'm so touched.
-What are you doing?

551
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:15,599
There are people here.

552
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,679
Will you spend the night
at my dad's place with me?

553
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,880
So Prib can relax by herself. All right?

554
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,719
Your dad might have a heart attack.
He doesn’t know about us.

555
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,199
All done.

556
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,599
I’m too tired to go anywhere today.

557
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,320
Let’s split up.

558
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,679
See you tomorrow.

559
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,119
Let's go.

560
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,199
Please let me be with Nut.

561
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,760
I wish that he will love me forever.

562
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,239
-I'll take a picture for you.
-Nut.

563
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,639
That's a great picture.

564
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,280
Can we go inside?

565
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:52,599
Song. Come here.

566
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,360
Your mom looks so happy.

567
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,360
She's a history teacher after all.

568
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,719
When I was little,
she used to read me stories.

569
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,440
When we had finished them all,

570
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,039
she then told me stories
about Thai history and foreign history.

571
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:30,960
How nice.

572
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,400
I want to hear them too.

573
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,519
Can you tell me some stories at bedtime?

574
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,239
Go ask my mother.

575
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,639
I don’t like history like she does.

576
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,239
Why not?

577
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,920
History depends on who's writing it.

578
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,039
It's what you choose to believe.

579
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,000
We like to believe in what we agree with.

580
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:57,400
A lot of people use belief as a weapon

581
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:00,079
to hurt those who think differently.

582
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,679
Some use it as a tool hiding the truth

583
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,360
to serve their purpose.

584
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,480
The same way my parents used to tell me

585
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,159
that being who I am is a sin.

586
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,039
When I grew up,

587
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,199
I realized

588
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,920
that there are other beliefs

589
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,199
that no one else had told me…

590
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,559
except…

591
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,320
Tatarn, right?

592
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Yes.

593
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,320
He was the one who made me understand

594
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,960
that being gay isn't a disease.

595
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,960
It's not down to bad karma,

596
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,800
or an emotional disorder.

597
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,719
And it's not a joke.

598
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,480
Being gay

599
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,119
doesn't mean we love every one
of the same gender.

600
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,920
We can love someone
as sincerely as anyone else.

601
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,400
That’s why I became a writer.

602
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,480
I want to use my stories as a weapon

603
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,920
and erase those wrong beliefs.

604
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,440
You really are your mother’s son.

605
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,079
She likes to tell stories.

606
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,119
You also have something to tell.

607
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,559
Perhaps

608
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,039
her history lessons

609
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:36,559
motivated you to become a writer.

610
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,840
I’m sorry, Nut.
I got carried away walking around.

611
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,679
Where are we going next?

612
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,840
Where do you want to go?

613
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,280
It's up to you.

614
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,000
You want me to decide?

615
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:56,960
Oh, wow.

616
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,320
You wanted to come here?

617
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,000
I never thought I would get to come here.

618
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,079
I never knew you would like
something so extreme.

619
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,039
I've always wanted to give it a try.

620
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:31,039
Smile!

621
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,920
Nut!

622
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,840
That was fun.

623
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,599
Are you all right, Tofu?

624
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,519
Are you all right, Tofu?

625
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,159
I'm fine.

626
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,039
Can we go somewhere less exciting next?

627
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,159
I knew it.

628
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:02,239
Nut has finally fulfilled his mom's dream.

629
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,599
If you want to go somewhere, just tell me.

630
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,199
I will take you there.

631
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,679
I’m glad I got
to take a trip with you before…

632
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,519
while I still can.

633
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,679
You are still healthy, Mrs. Na.

634
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,280
You still have enough time to travel
the world with Nut.

635
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,840
It’s just that he's probably too busy
to take you.

636
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,519
Wrong. I can't afford it.

637
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,079
Being a writer doesn't make you rich.

638
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,079
But actors like me are quite rich.

639
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,800
I can take you to travel the world
many times.

640
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,320
You are rich, are you? So rich?

641
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:46,880
I think,

642
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,239
for the next place,

643
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,559
let's go somewhere Tofu will like.

644
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:53,760
All right.

645
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,960
I know the perfect place.

646
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,000
How is this a place for Tofu?

647
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,119
Why? You don't think it suits him?

648
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,039
She probably wondered why it suits Tofu
better than her.

649
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,440
Gen, I was just curious.

650
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,119
Flowers don't have to be for girls only.

651
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,519
They can also go well with men.
Right, Mrs. Na?

652
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,840
That's right.

653
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,639
I remember wondering

654
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,239
why people associated flowers
with one gender.

655
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,639
When we give someone flowers,

656
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,400
no one tells us the gender of each flower
or who are they suitable for.

657
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,039
We give someone flowers because we know

658
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,480
their meaning
and the reason we give them to someone.

659
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,719
-Right?
-That's right.

660
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,719
Let's go.
I'm sick of the people around here.

661
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,800
Let's go over there.

662
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,360
-Did she mean me?
-Yes.

663
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,880
Nut.

664
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,000
Did you bring me here

665
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,559
for a particular reason?

666
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,119
Look there.

667
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,559
They are the same kind of orchid,
and yet they are different.

668
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,360
Each flower is different.

669
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,800
So are we.

670
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,599
We all have value.

671
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,239
There's no need to compare.

672
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,639
Each of us is a unique flower.

673
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,960
You are a special flower

674
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,280
that belongs to me.

675
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:01,840
Let's take some photos.

676
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,280
I'll take lots of it.

677
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,920
Okay.

678
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,960
One, two, three.

679
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,079
-Gen.
-What?

680
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:27,960
Do you want some flowers?

681
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,280
I will buy whatever you like.

682
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,119
Which one do you like?

683
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,280
Black-eyed Susan?

684
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,960
Black-eyed Song sounds better.

685
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,679
Let's just take more photos.

686
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,239
What are you doing, Tofu?

687
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,880
I'm choosing a photo.

688
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,039
Which one do you like better?

689
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,400
I'll post it on my Facebook.

690
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,320
Save it as a good memory.

691
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,920
Which ones?

692
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,360
This one and this one too.

693
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,920
I like this one.

694
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,239
This?

695
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Yes.

696
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:26,119
I want to post it too.
Can you send me that photo?

697
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,320
Of course.

698
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:31,400
In that case,

699
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,559
I'll create a family group chat
and post the photos in there.

700
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:36,480
So you can save photos from there.

701
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,239
Yes, Juea.

702
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,519
Nut, I'm sorry.
I need you to revise the script.

703
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,119
I sent my comments to your email.

704
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,519
I need it by tonight.

705
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:05,679
Tonight?

706
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,880
Yes. I was kind enough to let you go.

707
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,000
I want it by tonight.

708
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,760
All right.

709
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,119
Juea is probably upset
that he has to shoot alone.

710
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:20,679
Maybe.

711
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,199
Well then, that's it for today.

712
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:31,079
We should head back now.
Nut can also get some work done.

713
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,599
Gen and I have to excuse ourselves.

714
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:38,280
We are going to have dinner with my dad.

715
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,159
I'm going to visit some more places.

716
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,679
I want to find a good spot to sketch.

717
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,400
I'll go with Prib then.

718
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,840
You have to work.

719
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,440
I won't be much help here.

720
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,880
Hey.

721
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,440
So you would rather go somewhere
than be with me?

722
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,719
Nut, a little time alone won't kill you.

723
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,039
All right, all right.

724
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,239
You can go.

725
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,480
Take care of yourself, okay?

726
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,840
Look after Prib as well.

727
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
I'm sure she'll be okay, though.

728
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,000
You didn't just want
to hang out with me, did you?

729
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,880
Tofu.

730
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,039
Are you okay?

731
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:54,400
I was a little overwhelmed.

732
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:56,639
I just feel a bit dizzy.

733
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:02,360
What happened to him?

734
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,840
He was attacked.

735
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,039
The police are investigating the case.

736
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,519
I think he was involved
in some conflict of interest.

737
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,920
He was a protest leader
in the Hollow Forest project.

738
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:28,800
Tofu.

739
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,039
I know you are confused right now.

740
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:35,960
I didn't come here to pressure you
for an answer.

741
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,840
I was just worried.

742
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,840
I turned your trip
that should be filled with joy into this.

743
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,239
It would be nice
if I could help you with something.

744
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,119
I understand.

745
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:02,199
I get it all,

746
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,039
but it still hurts.

747
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,280
Before this,
I had always wanted to meet Tatarn.

748
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,519
At the same time,
I didn't want to see him,

749
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,760
for fear that he might separate
Nut and me.

750
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,480
Now, I want him to wake up,

751
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,719
as he might hold the answer to my miracle.

752
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,039
But if he doesn't wake up,

753
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,320
I might be able to prolong my happiness.

754
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,119
I still don't know
what will happen to me though.

755
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
Tofu.

756
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:01,199
Do you still want to hang out?

757
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,400
I used to come here with Tarn.

758
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,639
We both like art.

759
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,239
It was around the time
he got back from Japan.

760
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,760
He was getting involved
in political activities.

761
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,559
He joined a workshop here.

762
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,960
The way I saw it, Tarn was a warm person.

763
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:38,800
But his paintings
were bursting with emotion.

764
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,679
His paintings showed two men

765
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,239
with satirical scenes about social
and political issues, the environment,

766
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,679
religion, faith, and even love.

767
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:52,159
He just took it all.

768
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:58,880
I asked about the inspiration
behind these paintings.

769
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,480
When something can't be said,

770
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,039
then let art speak for you.

771
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,800
Art is the most peaceful form
of expression.

772
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,280
Its voice is subtle
and you need to interpret it.

773
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,440
Yet it is a powerful way of communication.

774
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,199
Too bad.

775
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,320
Who would care about art

776
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,639
when their stomachs are empty?

777
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,800
That sounds depressing.

778
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,119
Right?

779
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,239
That's why Tarn and I studied art abroad.

780
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,639
But you guys came back to do art here.

781
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,760
That's because we're hopeful.

782
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,840
Especially, Tarn.

783
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,199
He wasn't just hopeful for art.

784
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,920
He was hopeful for everything.

785
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,960
He hoped for things
that are normal in other countries.

786
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:03,000
He didn't want to see our country
destroyed and held back anymore.

787
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,679
So he started the Hollow Forest,
something personal.

788
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,079
I just want to live a normal life

789
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:13,280
in a society where everything is normal.

790
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,519
Everyone is equal.

791
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,840
No matter your sexuality,
no one is seen as different.

792
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,719
I used to wonder

793
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,119
why he was so bold and true to himself.

794
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,079
Why was that?

795
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,039
It's because of his family, Tofu.

796
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,800
He told me that before.

797
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,840
He must have told Nut the same thing.

798
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,960
Can I ask you something?

799
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,360
How do you accept it so easily?

800
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,400
That I like boys?

801
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,840
Weren't you ever confused?

802
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:33,480
Everyone is.

803
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:36,440
I just knew myself early.

804
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:40,119
When I told my parents about it,

805
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,960
they even told me
that I didn't have to come out.

806
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,239
Even though I'm their child,

807
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,719
we are all human.

808
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,480
My mother also said

809
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,239
that gay

810
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:58,000
also means joyful.

811
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,039
Being gay is not wrong.

812
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,000
We can have fun in our lives like others.

813
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:10,760
Your parents are nice.

814
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:12,519
Yes.

815
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,119
My mother grew up abroad.

816
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:19,440
My father, though he worked
for his Chinese family,

817
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,880
later decided to start his own company.

818
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,960
So I had some freedom.

819
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:31,079
Unlike me.

820
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,559
In my household…

821
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
My parents would never understand.

822
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,039
You don't need people to understand you.

823
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,440
If telling them

824
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,000
means being uncomfortable
or causing problems,

825
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:52,199
then don't tell them.

826
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,840
If telling them about it makes you happy,

827
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,440
then tell them when you are ready.

828
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,519
If I can prove myself to them,

829
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,480
so that they accept me,

830
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,639
-then--
-Why?

831
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,039
Why should you struggle to be accepted
just because you are gay?

832
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,159
Do gay men have to be good-looking,

833
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:18,960
capable, and respectable

834
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,079
to be accepted?

835
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,960
Why can't they just accept us
as human beings?

836
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:39,400
You have nothing to prove.

837
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,280
You should just be yourself.

838
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,840
Live the life you want to live.

839
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:48,519
Got it?

840
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,720
You didn't say you would bring a friend.

841
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,680
He is not my friend.

842
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:35,079
I see. You're one of the film crew, right?

843
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,119
He looks older.

844
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,479
I guess he's not your age.

845
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,960
He is actually older than me.

846
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,880
But…

847
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,920
-Gen and I--
-Excuse me.

848
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,560
We're still waiting for our food.

849
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:04,760
Actually, Gen and I…

850
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,279
We are…

851
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,760
Oops!

852
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,520
How clumsy of me.

853
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,960
Excuse me. I spilled some water.

854
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,920
Dad.

855
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,880
So, Gen and I…

856
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,279
We…

857
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:33,359
are…

858
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,479
How are you, Suwat? I'm good.

859
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,119
Long time no see.

860
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,079
What? Your kid got married?

861
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,039
When?

862
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,720
I can't believe your daughter
is old enough to even get married.

863
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:56,000
My son is in his freshman year.
There's no hurry.

864
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,199
Kids these days grow up fast.

865
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,960
They are one thing today,
but tomorrow, they may change.

866
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,479
I'm not that old. I can wait.

867
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,039
I'll get a grandchild one day.

868
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,760
You never gave him a hint?

869
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,159
I wanted to tell him in one go.

870
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,520
More like you plan to kill me
along with it.

871
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,880
This is not how I thought it would go.

872
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,720
My dad seems quite open-minded.

873
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,239
Some parents are open-minded
about other people's kids.

874
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,600
When it comes to their own child,

875
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,199
they may be disappointed.

876
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:54,800
Don't give up just yet.

877
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,760
Let me talk to my dad first.

878
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:00,840
Let's make him accept us.

879
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,520
I won't give up.

880
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,399
You won't give up either, right?

881
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:12,319
How can I give up?

882
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:14,119
You flirted with me first.

883
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,479
And I'm confident

884
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,319
that I'm good enough.

885
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,960
What right does he have
to disapprove of me?

886
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,159
If you think he really is open-minded,

887
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,399
then we might have

888
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:36,680
just caught him off guard.

889
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:39,600
So we should just take it

890
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,039
one step at a time

891
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,520
until he gets used to it.

892
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:47,960
Just like what you said to your fans.

893
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,159
I'm glad I get to love you.

894
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,520
There, there.

895
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:05,960
You crybaby.

896
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,159
Come here.

897
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,760
I will console you.

898
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:12,479
You want to console me?

899
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,680
You got it.

900
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:17,079
What are you doing?

901
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:18,760
Song.

902
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,039
No. Don't!

903
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:22,119
No, Song!

904
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,760
Come here.

905
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,119
Here. Get this.

906
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,159
-Here.
-Song, what's wrong with you?

907
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,960
Stay in there.

908
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:51,359
Hey.

909
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:54,159
I'll get a new room and send you the bill.

910
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,760
Don't!

911
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,760
Don't.

912
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,359
I was just

913
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,840
fooling around with Song.

914
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,920
You can leave now.

915
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,600
See you tomorrow.

916
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,600
Don't worry about it.

917
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:15,840
We will get through this.

918
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,560
I'll call you when I get to my room.

919
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:23,720
All right. Go carefully.

920
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,439
Go.

921
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,119
Leave already.

922
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:38,239
Do you want some too?

923
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:27,279
When did you get back?

924
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,039
You love your work more than me.

925
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,479
I got back ages ago.

926
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:35,920
You didn't even notice me.

927
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:38,680
You chose going sightseeing over me.

928
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:40,520
Now, we are even.

929
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,520
Isn't it boring

930
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,199
having to work while on a vacation?

931
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,960
I'm used to it.

932
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,359
But I'm not.

933
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,159
You keep checking your phone.

934
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:00,319
You don't have enough time
to eat or sleep.

935
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,479
You don't get any exercise.

936
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,119
And not to mention the benefits,
there's none.

937
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,520
When the show was on-air,
you still took all the criticism.

938
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:11,680
I know how much you love your work.

939
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,840
What's up with you?

940
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:16,960
You're being weird lately.

941
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,640
I'm worried about you.

942
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,960
I know

943
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,079
how much you love this job.

944
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:39,880
Are you really okay with it?

945
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,199
Of course, I am.

946
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,520
I knew doing this job
in a country like this wouldn't be easy.

947
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,960
At first,

948
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:53,159
I just liked writing

949
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,319
as my dad didn't let me do much.

950
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,399
Once I got to do it as a job though,

951
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,039
I found out

952
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,960
that writing can heal me.

953
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:10,600
It enables me to express
what I can't say directly.

954
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,720
Whenever I'm exhausted

955
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:16,760
or I feel like giving up,

956
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,520
I look back to the day
that I chose this path.

957
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,640
Can you guess
which scene I liked the most?

958
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:37,560
The CGI one?

959
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:39,479
You know me well.

960
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,960
The CGI scene is so seamless
and beautiful. I love it.

961
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,319
Now, I will try to guess
which scene you like?

962
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,479
Which one do you think I liked?

963
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:52,279
The ending.

964
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:55,359
How did you know?

965
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,359
Because I know you.

966
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,760
I wanted to know

967
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,119
at the end,

968
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,960
if the character has to choose one way,

969
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:04,319
what is it going to be like?

970
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,239
If you really want to know,

971
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,800
why don't you write your own ending?

972
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,359
Do you really think I could do it?

973
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,600
If you like it, then give it a try.

974
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,680
My parents wouldn't like it.

975
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,520
If you're doing what you love,

976
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:33,000
why wouldn't they like it?

977
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,279
I believe in you.

978
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,319
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

979
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,520
I still remember that feeling.

980
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:49,760
It's like falling in love.

981
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:52,039
It's like you finally found someone.

982
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:55,439
I'm lucky to have found what I like early.

983
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,560
Though along the way,

984
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,159
it wasn't easy at all.

985
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,680
Nut.

986
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,880
What's wrong?

987
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,319
I didn't get in the short story contest.

988
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:17,800
I didn't get a prize.

989
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:21,960
Were you confident that you would win?

990
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,239
Of course, I was.

991
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,119
I put a lot of effort into it.

992
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,239
I thought I might win something, at least.

993
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,600
Writing is like art.

994
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:37,800
There's no right and wrong.

995
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:39,479
When you turn it in,

996
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:42,159
it's a matter of what the judges like.

997
01:19:43,239 --> 01:19:44,479
Don't forget

998
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,760
that art serves no one

999
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,439
and it is a slave to none.

1000
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,359
Therefore,

1001
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:55,680
I don't want you to pressure yourself
just to win.

1002
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,039
It is okay to lose.

1003
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,520
Whether you make it or not is fine.

1004
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:02,800
Along the way,

1005
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,439
I hope you are happy with it.

1006
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:10,399
But happiness won't feed you.

1007
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,960
I wanted the prize money
to pay for my tuition,

1008
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,880
in case I have to support myself

1009
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,039
when I go to college.

1010
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,600
You can try again.

1011
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:27,159
Gain more experience by trial and error.

1012
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:31,119
I believe that

1013
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:34,840
one day, someone will like your work.

1014
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,239
You've got this. I'm here for you.

1015
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,760
Juea really likes your work.

1016
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:54,399
So…

1017
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,479
did you work with Juea from the beginning?

1018
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,079
Juea and I get along.

1019
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,000
So working together is easy.

1020
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
Still, I can't say that I'm successful.

1021
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:11,760
But if I keep going,

1022
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,560
I can still write what I want to say.

1023
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,520
What do you want to tell people

1024
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:25,079
from the story you are working on?

1025
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:30,600
I want to tell them

1026
01:21:31,239 --> 01:21:33,640
that the country that exports shows
about boys' love,

1027
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,520
has the prettiest transgender people,

1028
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,680
and has gay couples as net idols,

1029
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,720
doesn't support the rights
for those people,

1030
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,199
as they aren't truly accepted there.

1031
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,079
I also want to tell him

1032
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:59,439
that even though it has been a decade,

1033
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,800
I still want to apologize,

1034
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:06,560
and express my gratitude.

1035
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,039
He is a good memory,

1036
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:16,840
an inspiration that made me who I am,

1037
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:21,000
and the one who made me love myself.

1038
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,960
Then…

1039
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,840
your show should have
a happy ending, right?

1040
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,800
Hey. Are you jealous of my work now?

1041
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,399
I'm just curious.

1042
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:46,479
Don't forget that I'm a fan of your work,

1043
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:49,000
and a fan of yours.

1044
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,039
It will have a bad ending like my life.

1045
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,800
I don't want to turn back time.

1046
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,039
I want to move forward.

1047
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,880
And don't make me tell you

1048
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,439
who…

1049
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,239
keeps me going.

1050
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,800
Nut and Tatarn

1051
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:01,479
reminded me of a quote
from a book that I read.

1052
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,039
It said,

1053
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:07,800
"Good love makes us want to grow
into a better person,

1054
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,760
and makes us love ourselves more
as we love that person."

1055
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,319
Nut is who he is today

1056
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:18,439
as a result of Tatarn's love.

1057
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,680
Therefore,

1058
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:23,880
at such a critical time for Tatarn,

1059
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,079
if Nut can help him,

1060
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:29,640
then I should be glad.

1061
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,000
Right?

1062
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,960
Didn't you get any sleep?

1063
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,880
Are you all right?

1064
01:24:57,279 --> 01:24:59,720
A lot of strange things
have been happening lately.

1065
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,840
I'm beginning to see some images.

1066
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,159
There was a place.

1067
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:12,560
There was a person.

1068
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:18,960
Are you regaining your memory?

1069
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,079
I'm not sure about it.

1070
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,560
Let's go to the doctor.

1071
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:34,159
I don't want to remember it.

1072
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:38,479
I'm afraid,

1073
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:43,079
but also curious.

1074
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,079
Tofu.

1075
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,680
It's okay.

1076
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:56,640
I will be here for you.

1077
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:04,159
Nut.

1078
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,119
The real reason
I brought you to Chiang Mai

1079
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,600
is that I saw an image of a man

1080
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,960
here.

1081
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,479
So, did you used to live here?

1082
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,199
I don't know.

1083
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,479
Can we go somewhere?

1084
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:36,159
Being there,

1085
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,960
I might find out the truth.

1086
01:26:57,239 --> 01:26:58,239
Tofu.

1087
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,039
Are you scared?

1088
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:05,720
I don't know…

1089
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
what will happen to me

1090
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:12,800
if I take you to see him.

1091
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,640
We will finally get to know who you are.

1092
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,880
You're afraid
that we can't be together, right?

1093
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:41,319
That's right.

1094
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,720
If he's really someone in your family,

1095
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,359
we can talk to him

1096
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:56,479
and ask if you can stay with us.

1097
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:59,600
My mother and I don't look like
bad people, do we?

1098
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,479
Why did you bring us to the hospital?

1099
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,680
Tofu's cousin may be a doctor,
like your mom.

1100
01:28:11,239 --> 01:28:12,359
Am I right?

1101
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,960
Is he sick?

1102
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:20,600
Why is the person you saw in the hospital?

1103
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,039
Who is he?

1104
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:26,359
Tarn.

1105
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:45,359
Is that Tarn, Neung's friend?

1106
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,359
The person you remembered is Tarn?

1107
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:14,800
I was scared that if I brought you to him,

1108
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,560
I would lose you.

1109
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:24,920
Na must be really happy that her son…

1110
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,079
Everybody has a gender.

1111
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,479
You can be any gender you wish to be.

1112
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:33,520
And every gender is equal.

1113
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,079
I'm glad you can be yourself

1114
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,039
whenever you are with me.

1115
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:42,920
If something is troubling you,

1116
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:45,239
I'll be the one to ease your mind.

1117
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:57,319
