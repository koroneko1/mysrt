1
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,200
Press that button.

2
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,039
What's that?

3
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,759
It's a time machine.

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Press that button.

5
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,719
We're going back in time now.

6
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,880
To Monday of last week.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,799
To the moment when you told me.

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,039
I am HIV-positive.

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,880
But this time, I don't stand there
not knowing what to say.

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't care.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,359
That's not true, I do care.
It makes me like you even more.

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,599
Something huge happened,
and you've overcome it.

13
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,359
It makes me want to know you
more than before.

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Have I fixed it?
If not, I'll keep trying until I do.

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,879
Nailed it the first time.

16
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,319
Great, because this was a doorbell
for science class.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,959
I was never able to make it ring.

18
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,000
Congratulations.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
This exam deserves a ten.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,079
Well, so did one of your classmates',

21
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,319
and you know
that here we grade on a curve, so...

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,519
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,719
Excuse me, on a what?

24
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,199
Didn't they explain this to you?
Let me show you. Look.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,199
This curve maps human intelligence.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,639
On one end is a minority
with low intellectual ability.

27
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,879
On the other, there is a minority
which is extremely intelligent.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,599
And the majority...

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
falls here in the middle.

30
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's assume the class
is a sample of society.

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,639
There's one with a ten, one with a zero.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
The rest are here.
There can never be two tens, or two zeros.

33
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,000
So the grades are assigned
before the exam.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,759
That's right. If you're in the lower 20%,
you fail even if you did well.

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
-Damn, that's why I always flunk.
-Isn't that a bit unfair?

36
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,759
Guys, this prepares you for life.

37
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,879
Out there, if you're in the lowest 20%,
you don't get anything.

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,759
And on the podium,
there can't be two people.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,319
If you have any complaints,
come to my office hours.

40
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,360
LEARN ABOUT
ADOPTION AND OLDER CHILDREN

41
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,919
Sorry.

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,080
OMAR, ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU NOT GOING
TO TALK TO ME? FORGIVE ME

43
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,960
HELLO...

44
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,280
Hello.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,800
-When is our next dinner for three?
-I don't know.

46
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,240
The fish was actually very good
the other night,

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
the meat, not so much.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
You didn't even try the meat.

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
How about dinner just for the two of us?

50
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,240
You know that can't be.

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,120
No problem, I'll go on a diet, then.

52
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,000
Too bad, I was looking forward to it.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
Shame, I am tired of feeling
like a dick with legs.

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,479
I am good for a lot more.

55
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,560
It's true. You're right.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,319
Want to come to a party
with celebrities?

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,439
It's a benefit cocktail party.

58
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,600
Some 100 guests gorging themselves
on seafood and champagne,

59
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,480
because they're super worried
about world hunger.

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,360
And then, with the funds they raise,
they buy cans of chickpeas for the poor.

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,399
Right.

62
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,959
I'm going because my father's making me.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,959
Champagne, luxury, seafood...

64
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,000
What a drag!

65
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,639
Would you like to come with me?

66
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,480
Would you like me to go?

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,439
Of course.

68
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,959
Tell me about Pablo Ruiz.

69
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,680
They say you expelled him two years ago
for having sex with Marina.

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
She was 14, he 17.

71
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,519
I didn't expel anybody. He left.

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Do you have any way of contacting him?

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,160
No. Is there anything else?

74
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,439
Is this another plan
you hatched with your friend?

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
I don't talk to Lu anymore, Nadia.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,519
I want to make it up to you.
What I did was wrong.

77
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,160
I was an asshole.

78
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,000
A gift only proves
you're an asshole with money.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,360
What do you want? I've tried everything.
I mean it.

80
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,439
Tell me what to do, so you'll forgive me.

81
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,759
In my culture,

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,240
you haven't only insulted me,
but also my family.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,079
-So first, you'll have to go through them.
-Sorry?

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,439
Precisely.

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,560
Ask for their forgiveness. Muslim style.

86
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,360
Go before my parents

87
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,920
and explain to them that you tried
to take my virginity,

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,519
to then mock me.

89
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,759
And ask for leniency...

90
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,199
-on your knees.
-On my knees?

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,959
Is your family from Game of Thrones?

92
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,120
With this, we'll forget about the money.

93
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,920
The address is on the back
of the photo.

94
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,120
No.

95
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,439
No way, I'm not killing anybody.

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,879
Who said anything about killing?
A warning, on the leg.

97
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,639
So he learns he should pay his debts.

98
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,000
How do you feel?

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,240
Like fucking James Bond. License to brag.

100
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,319
But this is too much.

101
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,759
Federico, how about we take it in
a bit more there?

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
He's gonna make you look great.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
Don't let him fix anything,
or I'll have to buy it.

104
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,839
The moment he walks in the door,
Federico accepts the charge.

105
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,240
He's like a plumber, then,
charges just for showing up.

106
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,680
What does a suit made to measure
like this cost?

107
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't worry about that.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,879
He's always worked with us and gives us
a discount. Charge it to our account.

109
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,040
No way!

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,560
OK, it's a loan.
You'll repay it when you can.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
So how much is this suit?

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
More than 300 bucks?

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,319
More than 500?

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,639
More than 1000?

115
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,519
Could we have a moment?

116
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,360
I don't care how much it costs.
It's a present.

117
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,560
It's not my birthday or my name day.

118
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,480
I haven't passed all my classes...
or any, for that matter.

119
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,039
What you've given us
is worth much more than a suit.

120
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,480
Before we met you,
Polo and I were not doing very well.

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
And now, look at us... better than ever.

122
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,399
Since we're here, I can't imagine 007
with a cheap watch.

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,919
Which one do you like?

124
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,519
This one's cool, huh?

125
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,960
SO, SHOULD I BUY THE SUIT?

126
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,039
No! Only those people are attending?

127
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,039
And you're telling me now?

128
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,159
Make something up.
Tell them there's canapés,

129
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,759
you'll see how many come.

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Dad?

131
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,879
-I'm going to need another invitation.
-For whom?

132
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
For Samuel, the boy from the party.

133
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Not a chance.

134
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
Why not?

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,919
I don't want him in the photos,

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
in case somebody
from the press recognizes him

137
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,679
and they start talking
about the school again.

138
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,720
Is that reason enough?

139
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,679
When it suited you,
you wanted to have photos taken with him.

140
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Darling, we organized this
to put that issue behind us.

141
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,120
Oh! I thought it was about the homeless.

142
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Marina, we all win here.

143
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,639
OK? I get good press, yes,
but they get a roof over their heads.

144
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,559
Don't they?

145
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,000
As long as it doesn't fall
on their heads...

146
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't play with tomorrow's event.

147
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,519
OF COURSE, ALREADY HAVE YOUR INVITE

148
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,559
Is my pronunciation that bad?

149
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,240
Open the fucking door!

150
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,519
What are you doing here?
I don't give a damn about your friend.

151
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,039
OK, you don't give a damn about Ander,
I don't give a damn about you. Move.

152
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,639
Are your parents here?
I need to talk to them.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,279
It's OK. I'm used to seeing her
like this at school.

154
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,480
What?

155
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,120
Hello.

156
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,320
Sit with us.

157
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,320
Do you need a fork?

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,120
I've been to Egypt,
but they didn't eat like this.

159
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
What do we have to do with Egypt?

160
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
It's mansaf, typical of Palestine.

161
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,159
Thank you. Thank you for your hospitality.

162
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
We would have done it for anybody
who came to our home.

163
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,519
Even if we don't know
what they're here for.

164
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,080
I've come to ask for forgiveness.
For the other day at the store.

165
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,360
I wanted to apologize
for trying to deceive--

166
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,039
Goodbye.

167
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,320
Goodbye.

168
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,320
What are you doing?
And you told my father about the scarf!

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
How was I to know you hadn't told him?

170
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,320
-I only did what you asked me to do.
-Because I thought you wouldn't dare.

171
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
That it was the only way
you'd leave me alone.

172
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,120
Now you know it takes a lot more
to discourage me.

173
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,879
For you, all of this
is just another challenge, huh?

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,759
First, taking my virginity,
now, getting me to forgive you.

175
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
What's next, conquering Everest?

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,879
After you, Everest will be nothing.

177
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,320
If you don't want to be a challenge,
why make it so hard?

178
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
Guzmán...

179
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,559
I don't want anything with you.
Because I think you're a bad person.

180
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,759
Tomorrow...
we're throwing a benefit gala

181
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,840
to raise funds for the homeless.

182
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,960
Would a bad person do that?

183
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,879
I don't think so.

184
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,639
You're invited.

185
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,840
Please, I'll pay you back
when I get paid at La Cabaña.

186
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,720
I couldn't lend it to you if I wanted to.
I don't have that kind of money.

187
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,200
Because you spend it all on smokes,
that's why.

188
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,960
There are factors that give Nadia
an advantage, things that-- Lu.

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Please.

190
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,919
All the things
that she's been able to overcome.

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,480
-Her coming from a worse school, midyear--
-And is that my fault?

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,360
I'm just trying to balance things
so there's a little more justice.

193
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,159
That's all. OK?

194
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Martín,
all of this about peace in the world...

195
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,440
is it because of the adoption thing?

196
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,159
-Sorry?
-The web page on your laptop yesterday.

197
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
It belonged to a foundation
for adopting older children.

198
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,720
Very generous.

199
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,960
But I think people prefer small children.

200
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,279
Unless they're not approved for adoption.

201
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,399
I guess it's on account
of your shitty salary

202
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,360
and your wife being unemployed, right?

203
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,799
-Have you been investigating us?
-No, not investigating.

204
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,840
This is the 21st century.
Everything's on social media. For example,

205
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,000
that she hasn't had a job in two years.
That's on LinkedIn.

206
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
She's a preschool teacher,
so she likes children.

207
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,279
According to Facebook,
you've been married for eight years...

208
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,600
and nothing.

209
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,879
And on Twitter, she follows all of Spain's
adoption and foster care agencies.

210
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,960
-She seems a bit desperate, right?
-What are you doing, Lucrecia?

211
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,840
My father has excellent contacts
in Mexico.

212
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,120
A few phone calls,
and you could have a beautiful child.

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,720
Faster than you can have a pizza
at your door.

214
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,399
-Color and size of your choice.
-And you want nothing in return, huh?

215
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,679
Just to be the best beyond any doubt
at the end of the school year.

216
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,559
-Because I am the best.
-Get out.

217
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,759
Not having children can result
in a separation.

218
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,080
And it would be very sad
if the next profile of your wife's I see

219
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,000
were on Tinder.

220
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,759
Pablo gave up a scholarship to study
at the country's best school.

221
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,919
No.
Marina's parents persuaded him to do it.

222
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,000
How?

223
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,399
With money, what else?

224
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,159
Pablo had sex with a minor.

225
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,480
If they wanted to get rid of him,
they just had to report him.

226
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,320
They actually paid him
not to go to the police.

227
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,720
So he wouldn't report what happened
that Monday afternoon.

228
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,960
It's fine, right? As good as new.

229
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,840
It's not swollen.

230
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,639
Does it hurt a lot?

231
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
Yes.

232
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,360
I'd be cautious
and leave it bandaged another week.

233
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,159
Then, if things persist,
we'd run further tests

234
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,039
to see what the problem is.

235
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, that's it, then.

236
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,600
Do you wear your hijab in class?

237
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,159
Don't lie to me, Nadia.

238
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,519
Not you.

239
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,879
They forbade it, Dad.

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,519
I had no choice.

241
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,480
I would have been expelled.

242
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,399
Why do you want to keep attending
a school with those rules?

243
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,679
Because thanks to that school,

244
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,519
I can one day be
one of those who make the rules.

245
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
Not one who needs to obey them.

246
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,279
-Don't let them change you, Nadia.
-Dad, why are you always saying that?

247
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,160
Because they're already doing it.

248
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,119
You didn't use to keep things from us.

249
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
DISCREET19
HELO. WHAT'S UP?

250
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I LIKE YOUR PROFILE
WANNA MEET?

251
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,079
What's up, man?

252
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,839
Well.

253
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
How much was that?

254
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,240
Doesn't matter.
I'll return it tomorrow.

255
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,519
Unbelievable, man.

256
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,400
Now that you go to that good school,
you're a total punk.

257
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,480
So, what about this girl?

258
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
-Are you serious?
-You mean Marina?

259
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,920
Of course.

260
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,680
-I don't know, why?
-Nothing in particular.

261
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,599
It's just that now you'll ignore me.

262
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Even more.

263
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Which is normal,
when one gets a girlfriend.

264
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,039
What's weird is for a girl to like you.

265
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,839
I had lost hope already.

266
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,680
Get a girlfriend yourself,
and then we can go out together.

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,160
Lu's decided to come.

268
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,480
Hey, if it isn't Miss Mexico!

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,400
Look at me, in formal attire!

270
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,960
Like a soap opera leading man from 1999.

271
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,559
Thank you.

272
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
This is my charitable act for the night.

273
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,160
Lu, if you're mad at me,
don't take it out on him.

274
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,720
-Why don't we try to have a good time?
-OK.

275
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,720
But it's quite clear you don't need me
to have a good time, dear.

276
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,799
Then you're not mad.

277
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,400
You're jealous.

278
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,519
Let's go, boys.

279
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,839
Pathetic!

280
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,160
Let's talk for a moment, please.

281
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,160
If you want to take your pet for a walk,
that's OK, but not here, Polo.

282
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,319
He's a classmate, man. It's not a problem.

283
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,000
If you want to ruin things by letting him
into your relationship, fine,

284
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,160
but don't bring him here.
Much less in front of me.

285
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,839
This is Carla's mother's place.

286
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,319
-I can invite whoever I want.
-Do you do the inviting, or does she?

287
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,680
-You see how she controls you, right?
-You'd rather control me yourself?

288
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,920
I've been your best friend
since grade school!

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,119
And I've been yours.

290
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,799
And I remind you
that we've done things I'm not proud of.

291
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,160
Things I haven't told anybody.

292
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,799
And all because of you.

293
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,920
Don't you ever forget that.

294
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,839
Are you still not talking to me today?

295
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,000
What is this? Miracle of Marcelino?

296
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,759
Please!

297
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,880
Now we just need the Muslim girl.
You didn't invite her, right?

298
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,759
Oh, Guzmán.

299
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,920
Please! She's not coming, of course.

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,720
What happened?
Did she give you the Muslim brush-off?

301
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Great, isn't it?

302
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,480
Looks like we are all
expanding our circle of friends.

303
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,599
-Hello.
-Hello.

304
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Samuel García.

305
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,319
Samuel García...

306
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,799
You're not on the list.

307
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,559
-I'm not invited?
-No.

308
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,839
-What's wrong?
-His name's not on the list.

309
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,279
Do you know who I am?

310
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,279
The hippie's gutsy.
Not even I would dare to say that.

311
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,279
Marina, darling, we already said
you couldn't invite any friends.

312
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
Mom, he's not my friend.

313
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,000
He's my boyfriend.

314
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,880
Samuel, let's go.

315
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,519
Where are you going?

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,839
What are you doing?

317
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,279
Your tag's come out.

318
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, he was going to return it!

319
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,839
Try not to get it too dirty.

320
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,000
You are an asshole, Guzmán.

321
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
-Samuel.
-What?

322
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,400
Why did you make me come
if I wasn't invited?

323
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I was mad that at the other party
you were used for my dad's pictures,

324
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,599
-and you weren't allowed here.
-You're using me now.

325
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,119
I'm an excuse to rebel
against your parents.

326
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,880
Look, I had imagined many times

327
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
the moment when we would decide
to be a couple. Many times.

328
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,599
But it was never like this,
I assure you.

329
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,759
Do you have your time machine on you?

330
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,240
I'd love to go back...
a half hour, more or less.

331
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,240
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,759
Do you like me, Marina?

333
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,640
-If this is about the HIV--
-You don't know me.

334
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,720
Do you know what I thought when...
I found out Pablo had infected me?

335
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,680
That...

336
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,519
somehow that secret,
that thing we both shared,

337
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,119
would bring us together.

338
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,519
That thanks to the HIV,
we would always be together.

339
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,519
That really is sick...

340
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,400
and idiotic.

341
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
And then he left. Without saying goodbye.

342
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,359
Can I tell you a secret?

343
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,440
You can't travel through time.

344
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,480
Or change the past.
So why not stop looking back...

345
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
and start looking forward?

346
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,200
Is this closer to what you had imagined?

347
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,200
You have lipstick.

348
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,559
You too.

349
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,359
Marchioness!

350
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,200
Your winery is the bomb,
and the wine, amazing!

351
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,079
Delicious.
By the way, will there be a proper dinner?

352
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,319
You wouldn't know
how to choose your cutlery.

353
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
From the outside in.

354
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
I've seen Titanic twice.

355
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,640
Don't think you're the only one
who knows about movies.

356
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,279
Hello.

357
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,720
-Christian, right?
-Polo hasn't told us about you.

358
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,319
-Do you like Las Encinas?
-Yes, actually, I do.

359
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,480
That said,
I don't think the school likes me.

360
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,519
I don't pass a single test, man.
And I do try.

361
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,559
Some business about a curve,
some weird shit they have there.

362
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,440
-What would you like to do?
-I want to be famous.

363
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Famous for doing what exactly?

364
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,640
Good question.
The truth is, I don't know yet.

365
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,599
Begoña, you're behind the times.

366
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,519
Today, they don't want to do anything.

367
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,839
They just want to be somebody,
and the less effort to get it, the better.

368
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,960
-Right.
-Mom,

369
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,599
how much effort did it take
to become a marchioness?

370
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,400
Christian, I think it's very good
that you want to be somebody important.

371
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
That shows ambition.

372
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,079
We'd love that for our son.

373
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,119
Mom!

374
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
Dad, the photographers are here.

375
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,160
WHEN TYRANNY IS LAW
REVOLUTION IS ORDER

376
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,480
Why are you here?

377
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
Are you here to see Fer?

378
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,640
What's up?

379
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,279
Need dough, right? Some extra money.

380
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,960
-Who's this?
-He's Nano.

381
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
A friend.

382
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,440
Nano, this is Fer.

383
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
I can give you stuff.

384
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,759
-That's your territory.
-I don't care.

385
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,240
There's plenty of customers.

386
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
You're good to the point of being stupid.

387
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,440
That's why I like working with him.

388
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,160
Nobody thinks he's a dealer.

389
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,160
-SENDING LOCATION
-OK

390
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,720
But you...

391
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,519
I have to go.

392
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,279
Hope it goes well.

393
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,359
Can I trust you?

394
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,160
When did you get out?

395
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,680
It's written all over your face.

396
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,079
Not long ago.

397
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,759
-Already trying to get back in?
-What about you?

398
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,599
I have to pay for schools, diapers,

399
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,680
and...

400
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,559
for a big mess I got into
while in the can.

401
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,200
What do you want? Pills, coke, pot?

402
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,839
I want you to get your family
and go far away.

403
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,000
Because the next guy they send
won't be as stupid as me.

404
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,400
I'M HERE

405
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,240
Hey.

406
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,640
I am Discreet19.

407
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,519
Come on, man, fuck off.

408
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,480
Hey, wait! Let me apologize at least.

409
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,759
-You made me come here for that?
-No.

410
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,839
I made you come for the same reason
I created a fake username.

411
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
I want to see you.

412
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,319
I want to be with you.

413
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,960
Kiss you, finish what we started.

414
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,279
Don't you?

415
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,880
This is what I get for meeting someone
who spells "hello" with one l.

416
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,119
Besides, if you leave...

417
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,079
you won't know what the 19 is about.
It's not my age.

418
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,319
If the 19 business is as real
as the discreet part...

419
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,599
there must be cameras here.

420
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,559
I know some hideouts.

421
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
He's an ace.

422
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,240
-He is, better than his father.
-Excuse me.

423
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,920
Better than his father?

424
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,960
-We are improving the species.
-OK, then, my son is better than me.

425
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,240
By the way...

426
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,799
I LOVED IT. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENT.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT

427
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,559
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU COME HERE?

428
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Wait.

429
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,400
Do you want to find out
if it's a girl or a boy?

430
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,519
-I'm going to the bathroom, OK?
-Sure.

431
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,079
What are you doing here?

432
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
It can't be.

433
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,279
What can't be?
That your athlete friend is gay?

434
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,720
Or that he's involved
with a Muslim from the hood?

435
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,359
-He could have told me, he's my friend.
-That's what I was thinking, too.

436
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,000
Let them be.

437
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,319
-I'll pay you for the suit tomorrow.
-Don't worry about it.

438
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,160
Your parents... are mothers.

439
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,359
They are two mothers.
Which is totally fine by me.

440
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,839
I love lesbians. I could say I'm a fan.
I never miss any of their movies.

441
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,480
You can keep them.

442
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,000
Come on, my parents are tough on me, too.

443
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,720
Would they also like you to be a writer,
or a musician, an artist?

444
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,839
Somebody important, I mean.

445
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
No, not at all.

446
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,599
They'd be happy if I don't end up
on the streets, under a bridge.

447
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:39,880
I see.

448
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,240
At least they don't remind you
that you disappoint them.

449
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,319
No.

450
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,400
It's better to be reminded
that you're useless.

451
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,440
And that they don't expect
anything from you.

452
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,000
My mother's tired of showing off
the winery.

453
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,400
Now she wants to show us off.

454
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,680
She wants to introduce us to friends.

455
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,960
Shit, if they were famous, maybe.
But I don't recognize any of them.

456
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,799
The whole room might not even add up
to 10,000 followers!

457
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,079
They're waiting.

458
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,079
With all due respect...

459
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,240
Fuck them!

460
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,559
Let's go to your apartment
and finish the party there. I'm hungry.

461
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,000
Come on!

462
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,799
Marchioness, thank you very much.

463
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,039
It's been a pleasure.
I love your winery, it's the bomb.

464
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm leaving.

465
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,359
Thank you for the cava, marchioness!

466
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,839
Carla!

467
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,319
Come on!

468
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,799
Hey.

469
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,199
Why the hurry to see me?
What is it? Did you and Marina do it?

470
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
Careful, I don't want details.

471
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,880
How was your night?

472
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,880
More boring than yours, I'm sure. At home.

473
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,039
Omar, I know.

474
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm not the only one. Guzmán knows.

475
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,239
What I don't know
is why you haven't told me.

476
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,800
I only do it to make some money.
Don't freak out.

477
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Do you charge?

478
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
Of course!
Did you expect me to do it for free?

479
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,119
An NGO, "Dealers without Borders."

480
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,920
-What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?

481
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,880
Omar, how could you get into that shit?

482
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,320
I told you, Samu. You're not the only one
with friends from your new school.

483
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,480
Yeah, but those friends
will make you end up like my brother.

484
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,400
-Is that what you want?
-No.

485
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,800
I want money, that's all.

486
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,440
Then go and serve burgers.

487
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,039
Like I do.

488
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,079
I should remind you that we took
our resumes to La Cabaña together.

489
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,280
But who did they call? Not the Muslim boy.

490
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,000
The Muslim boy can only deal drugs, right?

491
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,480
No, it's not that.

492
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,159
-But that's easy for you to say.
-No, nothing's easy for me.

493
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,800
Nor for your sister.

494
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,840
Look at where she is and where you are.

495
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,679
Why don't you fuck off
with your fucking girlfriend...

496
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
and leave me alone, huh?

497
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Nice hijab.

498
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,239
I wish I could say the same
about your shades.

499
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,400
They're for the hangover.

500
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,480
So, did you have a good time?

501
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,880
Did you raise a lot of money?

502
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,199
It doesn't matter. It was a farce.

503
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,679
-How come?
-Just marketing for my father's company.

504
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,280
I knew it.

505
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,599
I participated, as usual.

506
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,760
It was also so you would forgive me.

507
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,800
If I were your father,
I wouldn't let you date me.

508
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,199
Who said anything about dating?

509
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,039
OK.

510
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,679
Friends, then.

511
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,719
I could use one.
I don't know if I have any left.

512
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,519
-If you're trying to get me to pity you...
-I'm not trying anything, Nadia.

513
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,719
There's no plan.
I don't want you to forgive me.

514
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,480
I don't deserve it.

515
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,599
I don't deserve you.

516
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Now you do.

517
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,079
After...

518
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,760
a complaint during office hours,
I've decided to change the grades.

519
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,760
Nadia, you have a nine point five now.

520
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,079
Um, well...
I'd also like to file a complaint.

521
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,920
I've already decided.
No need to go over it.

522
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm very sorry.

523
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,079
Besides, being second in your class
is no tragedy.

524
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,840
Let's continue...

525
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,519
What happened
on the afternoon of April 12, 2016?

526
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,280
And don't say you don't remember.

527
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,559
An incident took place.

528
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,239
A fight.

529
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,159
From what I know,
this was more of a beating.

530
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Who was involved?

531
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
Pablo...

532
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,639
and other students from the school.

533
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,320
And why say nothing until now?

534
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,599
Because...

535
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,039
one of those students is my son.

536
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,719
Hey.

537
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,679
I'm sorry about last night, man.

538
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,119
I got to the party,
but saw you with other people...

539
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,559
I got bored and left.

540
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,840
-Don't you get tired of lying?
-What?

541
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,360
Do you think at this point
anybody cares if you are into guys?

542
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,679
-No.
-Ah. Then why are you acting so weird?

543
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,840
Why are you avoiding us?

544
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,880
Why the fuck are you using?

545
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,599
Ander!

546
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
-Calm down.
-Let go of me!

547
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,880
-Easy. Look at me.
-It doesn't hurt!

548
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
It doesn't hurt, Guzmán! Let go of me.

549
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,079
Look at me! Calm down.

550
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,559
Do you think you're the only one I lie to?
I've been lying for years!

551
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:27,480
-I have a lot of practice!
-What are you talking about?

552
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,320
Ander, the tennis player.
It feels like my fucking last name!

553
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,119
Well, I don't like it!

554
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,119
You know? I don't like it one bit.

555
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,880
Why don't you quit?

556
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,199
What about my parents?
All the money they've spent on me.

557
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,840
All those years of sacrifice, for nothing.

558
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,360
I don't know where he is.

559
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,639
A neighbor saw him leaving this morning.

560
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,239
Suitcases and all.

561
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,119
Bad luck for us, huh?

562
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,000
And good luck for you.

563
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,920
I tried, but...

564
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,519
Oh, well.

565
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,079
Come on.

566
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,840
Don't worry. We'll see if we can find him.

567
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,159
Damn.

568
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,880
Boy, are we good!

569
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,599
Was it that hard
to do what was asked of you?

570
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,800
No.

571
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,760
Do you know what this will cost you now?
Another 20,000 bucks.

572
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,519
If you raise my debt,
how do you expect me to pay?

573
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,199
I'm not here to give you advice.

574
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:00,239
I'm here to give you a warning.

575
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,599
The last one.

576
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,320
Press the button.

577
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,039
Press it, and travel to whenever you want.

578
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,880
Shall I walk you home?

579
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,960
-OK.
-Give me five minutes.

580
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,119
Shit.

581
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,559
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. Where are my mom and Samu?

582
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,159
She's at work. Samu's in the bathroom.
Should I get him?

583
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
No, they'll ask questions. Help me up.

584
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,039
OK, come on.

585
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,239
-Shit.
-Come on.

586
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,920
Come on.

587
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,280
Let's see.

588
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,760
-Shit! You have to go to a hospital.
-No.

589
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,320
This is just a warning cut.
Maybe next time.

590
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,159
You have to tell them who did this.

591
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,400
No. They did this
because I owe 40,000 bucks.

592
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,960
You got stabbed
for owing a measly 40,000 euros?

593
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,840
Look, in the real world...

594
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,559
people kill for less, you know?

595
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,960
Even if it's small change to you.

596
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,639
I don't know. There must be a way
to get that fucking money.

597
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,239
I'm going to help you.

598
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,559
How?

599
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,280
For now, I'm happy
if you don't tell my brother, OK?

600
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,119
What's going on?

601
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,920
Nothing, a couple of...

602
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
beers too many, and they went to my head.

603
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,320
Let's go, he's a little drunk.

604
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,239
Yeah.

605
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,960
Let's go.

606
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,159
Nothing.
Nothing has been published anywhere.

607
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,000
There's no news in the papers anymore.

608
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,880
It's all YouTube clips...

609
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,119
-and fucking gossip.
-Well.

610
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,880
Don't worry, you did what you could.

611
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,360
I did, unlike other people.

612
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,960
What did I do now?

613
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,280
The scene you made over your boyfriend?

614
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,199
He's a child.

615
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,320
Who's not ready to...

616
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,119
Who's not ready
to be in a relationship with you.

617
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:02,440
He knows, Mom.

618
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
And he doesn't care.

619
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,360
He doesn't care how I got infected.
Or who I did it with.

620
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,519
Or what stupid things I've done.

621
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:14,679
Because he doesn't look at me
as if I had the plague.

622
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,639
The way you do.

623
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,760
Do you have complaints about us?

624
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,159
About how we deal with all the problems
you bring us, day in and day out?

625
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,519
All the ways you've found
to fuck with our lives?

626
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,159
Why don't you leave her alone?

627
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,519
I did not expect this from you, Guzmán.

628
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,480
People can surprise you.

629
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,599
I haven't seen her smile like this
in a long time.

630
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,880
So if she's happy with him,
it's not the end of the world.

631
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,960
That afternoon, you, Polo, and Guzmán
waited for Pablo to leave class.

632
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,320
But that has no bearing
on what has happened.

633
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,639
Was Guzmán very angry?

634
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,400
He had just found out
that guy had infected his sister.

635
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,559
What did you do to him?

636
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,800
Hey, Pablito.

637
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,519
He got a couple of punches.

638
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,559
Guzmán found out
his sister was about to run away

639
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:24,599
with a boy who had impregnated her,
a boy like Pablo.

640
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,880
What if he confronted her
in a fit of rage and killed her?

641
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:30,239
He says he's incapable
of doing something like that.

642
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,800
That he barely touched Pablo.

643
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,440
Tell me the truth.

644
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,320
Is that true?

645
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:46,400
Guzmán!

646
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,800
It's true.

647
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,320
He barely touched him.

648
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,440
