1
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,958
I'm an invisible man.

2
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,750
Can you see me?

3
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,750
But I don't have any special powers.

4
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,958
I'm going to tell you

5
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,125
how am I invisible.

6
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,250
My name is Denchai.

7
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,333
I've been working here
in the IT department for many years.

8
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,500
Hold on. Your ID, please.

9
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,875
But the security guard
doesn't even remember me.

10
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,833
Here, I finished installing the program.
Thank you.

11
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,250
Hey, you.

12
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:58,833
Yes, you.

13
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,666
Sign here for me.

14
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,666
Sometimes I wonder,

15
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,875
is my name really that hard to remember?

16
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,166
I'll have my usual.

17
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,041
So, what's your usual?

18
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,541
Too many customers. Who can remember!

19
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,166
She never remembers my order.

20
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,500
Fried noodles with no veggies.

21
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,625
Every year on my birthday,

22
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,166
the only person who remembers is this one.

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,416
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,625
FREE CALLS TODAY!
CALL 6988984 FOR DETAILS OF THIS OFFER.

25
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,583
Actually, calling this
a "person" doesn't sound right.

26
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,708
-Tee.
-What?

27
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,500
Tonight, we're going karaoke.
Do you want to go?

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,583
Yes, let's go.

29
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,875
Only once in a blue moon
does anybody ask me out.

30
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,125
And...

31
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,875
you can come too if you want?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,541
But they only do it for one reason.

33
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,000
To be polite.

34
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,250
I'm not going.

35
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,458
Why did you even invite him?

36
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,833
What was I supposed to do?
He was right there.

37
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,000
What if he really comes?

38
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,541
The only time I'm needed is when...

39
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,583
Hey, can you check my computer?

40
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,958
The Internet is down again.

41
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,500
Why is the font all weird?

42
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,916
There's a virus again.

43
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,458
So what's wrong with this computer?

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,875
You clicked on a website
with an embedded script.

45
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,583
It sets off a Trojan
that installed a program

46
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,750
which makes your computer slow because....

47
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,500
Yes, I'm betting on two teams.

48
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,125
One is Barcelona.

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:28,916
All right.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,958
But it seems like
nobody really wants to talk to me.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,458
The person I talk to the most

52
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,000
is my computer.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
It is my best friend.

54
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,291
It does exactly as I say. 

55
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,958
Press CTRL+P, it prints.

56
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,041
CTRL+S, it saves.

57
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,125
If you make a mistake,

58
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,500
 you can just press CTRL+Z to undo it.

59
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,750
I wanted to say thank you for fixing
my computer. It's way faster now.

60
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,416
No need to thank me.

61
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,208
Actually, you should learn
to do it yourself,

62
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,958
so you don't have to rely on IT people.

63
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,125
Just delete the files in Temp
and do a disk cleanup.

64
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,208
Even a primary school kid can do it.

65
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,833
Okay.

66
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,625
Geez!

67
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,750
What the hell, Den!

68
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,625
Dude, the way you talked to her,

69
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,208
why didn't you just call her an idiot?

70
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,708
What did I say wrong this time?

71
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,708
Do you know you make all of us
in IT department looks bad?

72
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,125
Well, I admit we do look bad.

73
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,916
But nobody is as bad as you.

74
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,041
At least, we are not rude like you.

75
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,125
HI, DENCHAI. DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

76
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,416
Who is that?

77
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,375
A friend from high school.

78
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,375
YES.

79
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,666
Damn, she's cute.

80
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,916
ARE YOU FREE? LET'S EAT.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,291
She's inviting you out.

82
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,791
Dude, get off your ass.

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,458
I haven't seen her in ten years.
I don't know what to talk about.

84
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,916
There's no need for chitchat
for a girl this cute.

85
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,208
Do something else.

86
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,791
Actually, you aren't that bad looking.

87
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,750
If you do your hair and dress up a bit,

88
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,833
you'd look good.

89
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,208
Right now, Tesco has a sale on clothes.

90
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,458
Go shopping!

91
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,208
You should also trim those nose hairs.

92
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,541
Tarzan can swing on those hairs.

93
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,125
Den.

94
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,083
How are you? It's been a long time.

95
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,833
You're still the same.

96
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,791
You are the same too, miss.

97
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,333
Miss? That's way too formal.

98
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,250
Do you still talk to
any of our classmates?

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
Really?

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,333
So, what do you do now?

101
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,666
I work on computer stuff.

102
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,541
Hey, that sounds like fun.

103
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
I'm not good at computers at all.

104
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,125
Teach me when you're free.

105
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,541
Okay.

106
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:44,333
So, haven't you ever thought of having
your own business?

107
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,541
Sometimes, I wish people had a push button

108
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,791
that you can press and make them
say exactly what's on their minds.

109
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,000
I do direct sales.

110
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,875
I've never used any of this stuff.

111
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,708
But please buy a lot of them.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,833
I saw your profile on Facebook.
You look easy to fool.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,916
Look at my computer.

114
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,166
I clicked on a porn site
and caught a virus.

115
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,291
Do you want to go karaoke?
But I'm only inviting you to be polite.

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,708
Yes, if you really come,
that'd be so awkward.

117
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,041
Den.

118
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,625
Damn it, Den!

119
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
That new girl in the marketing department,

120
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,875
her computer has a problem again.

121
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,458
Go and help her out.

122
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,625
Sorry I have to bother you again.

123
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,708
I tried hitting print many times already.
It won't come out.

124
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,708
Here.

125
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,041
I'm so dead.

126
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,291
I was late again. I drove around,
looking for a parking space for an hour.

127
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,666
You...

128
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,958
You have to come before 8 a.m.

129
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,875
My house is in the suburbs.
Who gets up that early?

130
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
Is the cable loose?

131
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,625
Here's some scotch tape.

132
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,041
Sticking it on won't help.

133
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm sorry. I'm so low-tech.

134
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,291
Our computers are so slow, right?

135
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:37,958
Yes.

136
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,125
Actually, we want to upgrade
the specs of the computers,

137
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
but this year is a Tock year.

138
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,250
We thought it's better to wait
until next year which is a Tick year.

139
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,750
What are Tick and Tock years?

140
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,958
In Tock years,
the IC will shrink many nanometers.

141
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,208
As for Tick years,
the value of the clock increases.

142
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,875
The onboard graphics will be
more powerful.

143
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,125
Plus the RAM and BUS...

144
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,291
The printer isn't broken.

145
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,166
It's just connected to the main printer.

146
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,458
You have to go to the 19th floor.

147
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,541
Okay.

148
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,208
I will...

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,541
I'll get going, then.

150
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:51,291
You know,
all those things you told me about?

151
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,041
I want to know more about
all the Tick and Tock years stuff.

152
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,958
I like the words, they sound cute.

153
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
Thank you very much, Denchai.

154
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,250
You remember my name?

155
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,083
Of course I remember. Denchai Sewatanont.

156
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,041
It's there.

157
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,583
I'm Nui Passarapa Wattanatrakul.

158
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,666
I have to go to a meeting.

159
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,791
Finally, someone sees me.

160
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,208
Ever since that day,

161
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,875
I've become her number one fan.

162
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,791
Joy, when did you arrive?

163
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,208
The first thing she does
when she arrives at the office is

164
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,291
checking out her farm.

165
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,000
She takes only half a spoonful of coffee
because she's afraid she won't sleep.

166
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,833
She doesn't like trendy hit songs
like most people do.

167
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,583
The DJ didn't say the song's name.

168
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,833
Maybe the DJ wasn’t born yet.

169
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
Funny.

170
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,458
She dreams that for once in her life,

171
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,208
she will get to visit the Snow Festival.

172
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,625
She smiles all the time.

173
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,958
I'm hungry. Let's go.

174
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,666
What?

175
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,083
What's wrong?

176
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,458
And she smiles more than usual...

177
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,125
Nothing. It's just my contact lens.

178
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,166
...when she isn't smiling on the inside.

179
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,333
Let's go. I want to eat papaya salad.
Yummy.

180
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,291
All right. This is the final question

181
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,583
to see if Mr. Denchai

182
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,541
is really Ms. Nui's number one fan.

183
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,083
The question is,

184
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,375
out of all the Japanese dishes,

185
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,083
what is Ms. Nui's favorite?

186
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,833
A whiteboard, please.

187
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,833
Here you go. Go ahead.

188
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,500
For the dish that
Ms. Nui orders most often,

189
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,458
there are two possibilities,

190
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,291
Hamachi fish or uni sea urchins.

191
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,333
This year, out of 40 times
that she has eaten Japanese food,

192
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,875
the dish that she ordered first
every time is...

193
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,750
I'd like to answer!

194
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,625
Are you sure?
You can't change your answer.

195
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,583
-Go ahead.
-My final answer is

196
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,416
Uni sea urchin!

197
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,958
Uni sea urchin!

198
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,500
Your answer is...

199
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,375
Right. Right.

200
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,791
Is it right or not?

201
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,083
Right. Right.

202
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,166
It's right!

203
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,000
Congratulations, Mr. Denchai.

204
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,750
You are the ultimate number one fan of
Ms. Nui Passarapa.

205
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,416
And the grand prize is...

206
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,083
Nui, I have to go talk to
some media agencies.

207
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,250
Please go with me.

208
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:37,958
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,041
-Joy, I'll be back later.
-Okay.

210
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,250
They're going out for a meeting again.

211
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,333
Be quiet.

212
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,125
This is the third time already this week.

213
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,916
I wonder if she did all her work.

214
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,875
-She'll do it.
-Do what?

215
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,375
Den, take a look at
Mr. Top's computer for me.

216
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,791
A CD got stuck inside. I have to go.

217
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,208
My mom forgot her house key.

218
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,250
Yes, darling. I'm on the way.

219
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,416
Just pick the restaurant.

220
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,041
I guess it's true what Tee says.

221
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm abnormal.

222
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,958
Everybody lies.

223
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,791
Some people lie about
not being in love anymore.

224
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,041
And some people lie to themselves,

225
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,541
desperately hoping that
he'll get a divorce for her.

226
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,625
I see you.

227
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,041
Top, I got to hang up,
my safety pin is poking me.

228
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,250
Hey, don't you think they're too obvious

229
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,250
coming as Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell together?

230
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,291
Come on, they work on the same project,
so they dressed up the same.

231
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,958
That's normal, right?

232
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,375
Joy's on this project too.
Why did she dress up as a donkey?

233
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,541
Good point.

234
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,541
What the hell!

235
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,083
How long has he been standing there?

236
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:23,666
Before we announce the winner
for best costume for tonight,

237
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,125
Mr. Top Thanon, our handsome president,

238
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,416
has something to say.

239
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,250
Let's hear it for Mr. Top Thanon!

240
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,041
Thank you.

241
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,250
As you know, since this year's economy
isn't very good,

242
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,250
we didn't reach our target.

243
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,583
You mean this target here?

244
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,875
Not this target.

245
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,375
So...

246
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,583
our company outing this year can only
be somewhere close by.

247
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,166
Somewhere basic.

248
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,875
You might be disappointed
because we can only go to...

249
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,416
Hokkaido!

250
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,583
I remember someone saying
they wanted to go to the Snow Festival.

251
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,333
Just now, when I said we didn't hit
our sales target, I was joking.

252
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,791
Everybody did great.
Thank you all very much.

253
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
So who wants to go skiing?

254
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,125
Raise your hands up high!

255
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,166
We are going all out on this trip!

256
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,583
When Hokkaido people take photos,
they say, "Taraba kani."

257
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,041
Show me your fingers. Two fingers.

258
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,083
-One, two, three.
-Taraba kani!

259
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,958
Good. Okay.

260
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,125
One more picture, please.

261
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,500
It's New Year,

262
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,791
but I haven't seen anything change.

263
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,708
-You got it?
-I have this already.

264
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,416
My Prince, do you have another coin?
I might get a secret figurine.

265
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:30,875
I'm all out.

266
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,375
Turkey, how much more?
Do you want to buy the whole machine?

267
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,791
If we do that, it wouldn't be fun
anymore, my Prince.

268
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,541
We're not staying two more days

269
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,250
just to look for these machines, right?

270
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,833
Good idea, my Prince.

271
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,541
Turkey, did you know I have magic powers?

272
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,875
Don't you believe me?

273
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,291
Five.

274
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,666
Four.

275
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:57,916
Three.

276
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,458
Two.

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,916
One.

278
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,875
Tada!

279
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,375
Cool, right?

280
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,291
You're so not funny.

281
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,625
Nui was still enchanted by
the same old magic tricks.

282
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,416
Top, let's go look at those music boxes.

283
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,750
-Let's go.
-Come on.

284
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,250
There's a lot of office staff there.

285
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,291
I see.

286
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:37,916
Nui.

287
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,083
Will you marry me?

288
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,958
I know you're suffering.

289
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,458
And I've talked about this a lot.

290
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,416
But when I go back this time,

291
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,791
I'll try to cast a vanishing spell
on this ring for you.

292
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,583
I could only hope that

293
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,041
this time, his magic powers
will really work. 

294
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,708
-Top.
-What?

295
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,708
You know the restrooms here
have a button to play music?

296
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,708
A button?

297
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,375
It's a button that you press
and music plays.

298
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,875
They use it to cover up the sound
when you fart.

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,083
So was the music loud?

300
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Because if it's not, it can't cover up
the sound of your fart.

301
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,291
Gross.

302
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,791
Here you go.

303
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,041
Damn it, Den!

304
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,500
My Prince, give me a hand.

305
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,666
Turkey!

306
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,291
Are you okay?

307
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,125
I thought that guy was you.

308
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,041
You're so clumsy.

309
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,083
I saw this one travel program

310
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,458
and they said whoever rings this bell

311
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,958
can pray for a happy love.

312
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,083
Give it a ring.

313
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Maybe you'll get a girl.

314
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,583
Wow, that's beautiful.

315
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,750
All I ask for is just one day.

316
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,500
Sorry, I forgot something in my room.

317
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,916
You can go down first.

318
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,833
The bus is here. Please get ready.

319
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,500
We are going to the Snow Festival.

320
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,958
Top.

321
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,708
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

322
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,333
I just finished my work.

323
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:20,500
I see.

324
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,041
We're here, sweetie.

325
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,500
Do you miss me?

326
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,750
Are you cold?

327
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,291
Top, do we check in here?

328
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,041
Yes.

329
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,375
See? Nui didn't even dare to come.

330
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,333
She said she has a headache.
She's resting at the hotel.

331
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,750
I don't blame her for having a headache.

332
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,041
And how about her staying longer with Top?

333
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,125
How's that going to work?

334
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,958
They can all go together.

335
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,500
Wife and mistress. A big happy family.

336
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,541
I feel sorry for her.

337
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,416
Sorry?
You're the one who can't stop laughing.

338
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,083
You started it.

339
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,791
Hi. Welcome.

340
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,791
Thank you.

341
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,416
Look, shrimps.

342
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,125
Crabs too.

343
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,291
It's reserved already.
Let's go over there.

344
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,041
Come and sit together.

345
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,750
Come. Don't mind us.

346
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,958
Ms. Nui, is your headache gone?

347
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,333
Yes.

348
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:23,333
Ms. Joy is here already.
I will take you inside.

349
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,916
This way, please.

350
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,291
Where did he go?

351
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,958
Over here.

352
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,541
That's okay.

353
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,541
Then, we can seat you at Ms. Nid's table.

354
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,625
This way.

355
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,500
Are you going back with us tomorrow too?

356
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:36,166
Not yet. I plan to stay longer with Top.

357
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,083
I will drag him to Tokyo.

358
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,041
The shopping in Hokkaido isn't very fun.

359
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,250
That's true.

360
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,291
I agree.

361
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,708
Oh, yes. Top, have you told your friend?

362
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,333
What?

363
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,916
Well, you told me
you're staying longer to sightsee

364
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,958
with your Japanese friend.

365
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,666
Oh, yes. I'll call him later. I forgot.

366
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,791
I'd better travel as much as I can now.

367
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,666
Soon, I won't be able
to travel for a while.

368
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:07,791
Why?

369
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,083
Top doesn't even know yet.

370
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,708
Taipan is going to have a sibling.

371
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,416
What?

372
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,333
Congratulations, Mrs. Chu.

373
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,833
That's great news.

374
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,208
Taipan,

375
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,166
did you think of a nickname?

376
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,416
-Tell your dad.
-What's the name?

377
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,750
Ben 10.

378
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:33,250
Ben 10? It doesn't go with Taipan.

379
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,208
-Ben 10, that's cute.
-You seem to really like the cartoon.

380
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,875
Is this seat taken?

381
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,291
I'm in the ladies' room.

382
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,125
It's okay.

383
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,666
You just go to Tokyo with Mrs. Chu.

384
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,125
I can stay here by myself.

385
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,708
Us getting married or not isn't important.

386
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,833
I can wait.

387
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,375
I've been waiting for three years already.

388
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,375
I'm not being sarcastic.

389
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,416
I really mean it.

390
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,625
I'm okay.

391
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:18,083
Tonnam, come and help me.

392
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,041
How much did you pack in here?

393
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,708
We're ready to go. Please board the bus.

394
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,833
This way, please.

395
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,708
PRINCE AND TURKEY ON TOUR

396
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:09,625
Nui!

397
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,458
Nui!

398
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,375
Nui!

399
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,666
Nui!

400
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,583
Nui!

401
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,750
Nui!

402
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,125
Nui!

403
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,375
Nui!

404
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,416
Nui!

405
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,625
Passarapa Wattanatrakul.

406
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,375
Hold on,

407
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:19,625
why are you all speaking English?

408
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,958
Nui, can't you remember anything?

409
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,708
Do we know each other?

410
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:47,541
ONE DAY

411
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,375
Is it really 2016 already?

412
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,875
I thought it was still 2012.

413
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,958
And all of a sudden, I'm in Japan now.

414
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,666
Nui.

415
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,666
Here, our company took us on a trip.

416
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,250
Hey...

417
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:23,708
I do work at Thanon Food for real.

418
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,416
So weird.

419
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,583
This is the first time
I'm hearing that name.

420
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,208
And how about you? Do you work here too?

421
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,958
I'm the one in the back.

422
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,791
I can't remember anybody at all.

423
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,666
Where did everyone go?
Are they at the hotel?

424
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,833
They went back to Thailand already.

425
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,000
Why are we the only two left?

426
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,041
We extended our stay
to do some sightseeing.

427
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,708
Only the two of us?

428
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,125
Yes.

429
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,583
Are you a tootsie?

430
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:22,750
No.

431
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:23,708
Gay?

432
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,375
Judging from your outfit, probably not.

433
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,666
But I can't think of why
I would be with a guy alone.

434
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,291
I'm not the type to travel alone either.

435
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,916
There are only two possibilities.

436
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,666
If you aren't one of my gay friends,

437
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,083
you must be my boyfriend.

438
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,208
So how did I end up here with you?

439
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:11,958
What does that mean?

440
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,833
Number two.

441
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:15,833
I am

442
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,458
your boyfriend.

443
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:26,791
But from what I remember,
I don't have a boyfriend.

444
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,625
You lost your memory.

445
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,083
That's true.

446
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,208
It's not that...

447
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,750
I don't believe you.

448
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:39,666
But...

449
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,916
can I see a picture of us together?

450
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,250
Well...

451
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,291
I don't like taking pictures,

452
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,208
so I don't have any pictures of us.

453
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,833
What kind of couple has no pictures?

454
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,458
In the group photo,
you weren't even next to me.

455
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:59,250
Nobody knows that we're seeing each other.

456
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,500
How come?

457
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,250
Well...

458
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,958
Well, it's...

459
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,708
I'm your boss.

460
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,791
-If people knew--
-You are my boss?

461
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,666
Yes.

462
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,458
Where is my phone? Do you know?

463
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,833
It's probably still damp from the snow.

464
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,458
Let me borrow yours.

465
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,208
Hello, Mom.

466
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,416
Why are you calling
so early in the morning?

467
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,708
Are you back?

468
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,583
You said you're staying longer
with your boyfriend.

469
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,958
Did I tell you that?

470
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,500
Yes. Are you all right?

471
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,250
Mom, what is my boyfriend's name?

472
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,000
Why are you asking me that?

473
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,541
Come on, just tell me.

474
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,625
His name is Top.

475
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,708
What's going on?
Are you on some sort of game show?

476
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,833
No, Mom.

477
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,666
What's your name?

478
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,250
Top.

479
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,041
Mom, what does Top look like?

480
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,250
What is going on?
Why are you acting weird?

481
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,208
Nothing, Mom, just tell me.

482
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,250
Nui, Nui, actually, I'm...

483
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,333
Not now!

484
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,416
Mom, what does he look like?

485
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,416
What does he look like?

486
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,541
I don't know. How would I know?

487
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,875
You haven't brought him to see me.

488
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,291
I've never seen his picture.

489
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,083
I don't know why it's such a secret.

490
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,625
Are you and Top having problems?

491
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,125
No, Mom. I got to go.

492
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,666
I'll call you when I get back.

493
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:06,250
And how many years have we been together?

494
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,458
Three years.

495
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,000
Three years and I never took you
to meet my mom?

496
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,666
Never.

497
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,041
And how am I supposed to know
if you're really my boyfriend?

498
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,500
There's no proof.

499
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,083
And why do you need any proof?

500
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,958
I am really your boyfriend.

501
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,583
How am I supposed to believe you?

502
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,250
There's no picture of us.
You've never met my mom.

503
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,250
I woke up with no memory.

504
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,833
You could be some stranger from anywhere.

505
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,833
You have a birthmark
under your left chest.

506
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,083
What?

507
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,666
You have a birthmark
under your left chest.

508
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,625
There is a mirror over there.

509
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:50,666
Nui.

510
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,666
It's okay. I'm not cold.

511
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:59,666
Are you okay?
Do you still have a headache?

512
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,083
Sorry.

513
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:05,250
How intimate have we gotten?

514
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:07,958
Which base?

515
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,041
You said

516
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,708
you've seen my birthmark.

517
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,333
So have we...

518
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,708
done it?

519
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,916
Yes. We're a couple, you know.

520
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,041
Just a second.

521
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,166
Nui,

522
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,166
it will be another hour

523
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,041
before the hotel shuttle comes.

524
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,791
Shall we walk around the city first?

525
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,958
Actually, we don't need
to go back to the hotel.

526
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,833
Turkey, you look much better now.
We should go sightseeing.

527
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:10,041
Here, look.

528
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:13,000
Turkey, you've been planning
this trip for months now.

529
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:13,916
Hold on.

530
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,625
What did you just call me?

531
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,875
Sometimes, we call each other
by our nicknames.

532
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,583
I call you Turkey Neck.

533
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,833
And you call me your Prince.

534
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:33,208
Here, these are the places
we visited together already,

535
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,708
and these are the places we will go next.

536
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,333
And why is it all torn apart like that?

537
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,541
You were the one who tore it apart.

538
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:44,916
Well...

539
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,625
At first, I couldn't stay longer
to go with you,

540
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,500
so you got really mad.

541
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,791
Did I want to go with you that badly?

542
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:59,000
Yes. But I finished all my work already.

543
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,333
We can go together now.

544
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,541
It's all right. I don't want to go.

545
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,958
Please, let's just go.

546
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:09,541
In the evening,
I will take you to Sapporo too.

547
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,208
Let's go to the Snow Festival.

548
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,000
You wanted to go to this event very much.

549
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,125
You have pictures
all over your desk at work.

550
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,708
I don't remember anymore.
Don't you understand?

551
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:18,708
I'm not going.

552
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,416
Please go. Today is the last day too.

553
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:26,250
Can you stop bothering me?
I told you I can't remember anything.

554
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,750
Snow Festival? I've never heard of it!

555
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:36,333
Nui, did you know I have magic powers?

556
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,791
If you don't believe me, watch this.

557
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,583
Five.

558
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:42,541
Four.

559
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,666
Three.

560
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:44,833
Two.

561
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:45,958
One.

562
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,875
Tada!

563
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:55,666
Oh, please!

564
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:03,666
Wow, Nui,

565
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,458
the music boxes here are so intricate.

566
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,541
Right?

567
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,833
Nui, they have sushi too.

568
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,583
Here's uni. Do you want it?
I'll buy one for you.

569
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,291
Luckily, it didn’t go
over my credit limit.

570
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,833
There's a famous sushi place around here

571
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,958
recommended by TripAdvisor.

572
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,916
Turkey, let's go eat.

573
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,875
What?

574
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,500
Turkey, what's wrong?

575
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,666
Stop calling me Turkey, okay?

576
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,958
I don't like it.

577
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:42,041
Why? We call each other this all the time.

578
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,583
We might be a couple,

579
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,416
but today let's just break up.

580
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,000
Save it for another day!

581
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,875
Waking up and losing my memory
is bad enough.

582
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:56,041
Now, I have to put up with a guy like you
as my boyfriend!

583
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,583
A guy like me? What do you mean?

584
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:07,833
Like this!

585
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:35,166
Hey, you.

586
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,750
Hey!

587
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:42,416
Hey!

588
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:44,875
Top!

589
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:22,791
Hey...

590
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,458
Just now, I...

591
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,041
I found the sushi place.

592
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,958
It's right around the corner.

593
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:33,250
Let's go. Come on.

594
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,833
Nui, do you want Set C?

595
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:56,166
It has the uni and hamachi you like.

596
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,500
Then, I'll order
some extra wasabi for you.

597
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,791
Hey,

598
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,041
I can order it myself.

599
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:05,333
I just lost my memory. I'm not an idiot.

600
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,250
-Yakisoba.
-Yakisoba.

601
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,291
What are you laughing about?

602
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,541
Nothing.

603
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:57,500
You're in Japan and you're eating
yakisoba, seriously?

604
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:01,916
Try this. Eat it with wasabi.
It's out of this world.

605
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,041
Are you okay?

606
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,166
I don't eat wasabi.

607
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,875
What a baby!

608
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,125
The sea urchin is so fresh.

609
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:00,625
Did you know that
uni isn't sea urchin eggs?

610
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,333
It is actually the testicles.

611
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,791
You should say,

612
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:08,208
"Their testicles are really fresh."

613
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,708
Right?

614
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:14,250
Thanks a lot.

615
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,083
My pleasure.

616
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,708
The bruise on your face, what happened?

617
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,666
From skiing.

618
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:34,250
What were you trying to do?

619
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,208
I don't know how to ski.

620
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,250
If you don't know how, why did you go?

621
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,291
You dropped this.

622
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,666
You said I've been planning this trip
for months, so how could you drop it?

623
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,333
Sorry.

624
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,833
Compared to being stuck at the hotel,

625
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:10,041
I think this plan sounds more interesting.

626
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:19,291
I mean I'll go with you.

627
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,333
This place has a strange name.

628
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:09,708
The Valley of Hell.

629
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:12,166
The Japanese gave it this name because

630
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,958
this hot spring has boiling mud pots

631
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,125
that have steam gushing
out of it all the time.

632
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,041
Like a copper frying pan in hell.

633
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,458
And how do you know this?

634
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,208
I Googled it.

635
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,791
No wonder you sounded so technical.

636
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,916
Can I ask you something?

637
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,416
When you're talking to me,
why don't you look into my eyes?

638
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,958
I look at your eyes.

639
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,333
When?

640
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:39,625
Right now.

641
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,666
No, you aren't looking at all.

642
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:45,083
Why are you looking at my ear?
Is there something stuck in my ear?

643
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:46,708
I'm looking.

644
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,083
See? You're still looking away.

645
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,875
I've been like this since I was a kid.

646
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,041
I'm just used to it.

647
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,125
How about this?

648
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:01,041
Look into my eyes for one minute.

649
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,458
No looking away.

650
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,458
Okay?

651
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,666
Start counting. Go.

652
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:18,916
Nui, it...

653
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,375
See? You can do it.

654
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,958
That was just 32 seconds.

655
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,416
You kept track?

656
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:16,458
Yes.

657
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,541
Am I your first girlfriend?

658
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:25,708
Yes.

659
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,291
How did you get me to like you?

660
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:30,083
You can't even look me in the eyes.

661
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,125
It's like what I told you.

662
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:38,208
-I am your boss, so I found ways--
-Come on.

663
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:40,083
I want details.

664
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,958
There was this one day,

665
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,416
17 February 2013.

666
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,000
That day, you wore a long white dress

667
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,833
with small floral prints.

668
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,875
And you wore an orange belt
and high heels.

669
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,041
You remember all of that?

670
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,875
You wanted details, right?

671
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:07,541
That day, your printer broke,

672
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,791
so I came to fix it.

673
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:12,083
You’re the boss and you fix
the computers for your staff?

674
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,583
Well, I sort of know quite a bit
about computers,

675
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,583
so I went to help you.

676
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:21,416
And...

677
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:27,208
I liked you from that day.

678
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,791
But I never tried to hit on you.

679
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,000
What? I hit on you first?

680
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,791
No, it wasn't like that.

681
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,541
You didn't hit on me.

682
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:40,125
And I didn't dare to hit on you either.

683
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:44,250
All I did was...

684
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:50,875
figure out you were always late

685
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,833
because you couldn't find a parking space.

686
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,625
So, I'd come early and

687
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:02,291
secretly save a space for you.

688
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:08,250
And you're addicted to that farming game.

689
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:13,041
So I hacked into your account

690
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:18,291
and collected all the wood
and nails for you.

691
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:21,875
Hey, something happened to my game.

692
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,583
I got a whole bunch of wood.

693
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,125
I've been looking for some forever.

694
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,291
Your desk is very messy.

695
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:35,166
So I organized your desk after hours.

696
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,833
Aunt, I bought something for you.

697
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,958
Thank you for cleaning my desk.

698
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,666
You like to listen to old songs.

699
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,958
Some are so old that

700
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:03,125
you've never heard of their names before.

701
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,625
Hey, have you ever heard this song before?

702
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:15,708
How am I supposed to know, butthead!

703
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,291
You hum like a dog choking on food.

704
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,416
What kind of melody is that!

705
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,250
So, I would go look for those old songs

706
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,958
and secretly put them in your computer

707
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,833
every day.

708
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,458
One song a day.

709
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:51,041
And I never knew it was you?

710
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,416
No, you didn't.

711
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:58,041
Sounds a bit like a psycho.

712
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,541
Don't take it the wrong way.

713
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:04,208
It's sweet.

714
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Right.

715
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:17,291
TESSEN POND

716
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,833
Who is that?

717
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,250
Another girl?

718
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:31,416
No. Not at all.

719
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,041
Let me see.

720
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,333

FREE CALLS TODAY!
CALL 6988984 FOR DETAILS OF THIS OFFER.

722
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,375
Is today your birthday?

723
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,125
-Yes.
-Really? How old are you?

724
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:45,291
Thirty.

725
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:49,583
So old. You're six years older than me?

726
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:54,041
This year, you'll be 28, not 24.

727
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:56,541
Oh, yes.

728
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,625
I feel so strange.

729
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,166
It's like I'm in a time machine.

730
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:06,125
So now who's the prime minister?

731
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,458
Uncle Tuu.

732
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:10,916
Who is Uncle Tuu?

733
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,791
It's a long story.

734
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,208
Then let's talk about entertainment news.

735
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,750
Right now,

736
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,708
who are the most popular artists?

737
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,416
Justin Bieber. Is he still famous?

738
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,666
He is.

739
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,250
Is he still with Selena Gomez?

740
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:30,791
No.

741
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,041
I thought he'd be married
with kids by now.

742
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,291
Not yet.

743
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:42,250
I used to think that
I wanted to get married before 30.

744
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,166
Work for about seven to eight years.

745
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,916
So if I have kids,
I could be their friend too.

746
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:51,958
Time flies. I'm 28 already.

747
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:53,208
So darn fast.

748
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:58,041
Hey, have I ever talked
about this with you?

749
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,208
No, not yet.

750
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,041
Or maybe...

751
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:09,125
I'm not serious about you?

752
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:12,333
Maybe you're just a fling?

753
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,541
What?

754
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,250
Just kidding.

755
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:00,708
What is it?

756
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,625
I'm looking for
the secret figurine for you.

757
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,875
What secret figurine?

758
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:09,375
It's a secret.
Nobody knows what it looks like.

759
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,333
This one.

760
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,208
It's very hard to get.

761
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,333
You're missing just this one.
You almost have the entire set.

762
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,791
Again!

763
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,583
You already have this one.

764
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,583
Nui, I found it.

765
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,666
When I was a kid, I like to do this,

766
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,208
so my friends wouldn't steal any.

767
01:09:51,041 --> 01:09:53,291
Coconut ice cream with lots of palm seeds?

768
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,125
Is there anything you don't know about me?

769
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Hold this for a second.

770
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,541
My first car, what brand was it?

771
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,416
If your answer is wrong, you'll get it.

772
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,041
Yellow Honda Jazz.

773
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,416
Wrong!

774
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:21,666
BM...

775
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,125
BMX!

776
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:25,958
Try again.

777
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:31,416
How many boyfriends have I had?

778
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,791
Four.

779
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:34,375
Wrong!

780
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,666
Three.

781
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,375
How come you didn't know?

782
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,333
And how about your current one?

783
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:44,125
I forgot. Sorry.

784
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,666
Okay.

785
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:47,958
Hey...

786
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,625
Hey, my phone is working now.

787
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,500
JOY SINGLE-ON-CERTAIN-DAYS
TAGGED A PHOTO OF YOU.

788
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,208
Who is Joy Single-on-certain-days?

789
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,208
Is she my friend?

790
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:01,708
Yes.

791
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:03,166
This one.

792
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,375
Hey, look.
I really do collect these things.

793
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:15,083
How cute.

794
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,875
Who is this guy?

795
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,875
Why?

796
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,916
He looks familiar.

797
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:46,916
I remember now.

798
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:52,750
Well--

799
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,583
He's the guy next to me
in the group picture.

800
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:56,708
Who is he?

801
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:01,750
He works in the IT department.

802
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,250
The IT department? This handsome?

803
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,458
-Yes.
-He's really overdressed.

804
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:18,166
JR TRAIN STATION

805
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:43,791
Excuse me.

806
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,041
Excuse me.

807
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,000
Calm down. We can check again.

808
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,083
Excuse me!

809
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:58,708
Hey, he might yell at you.

810
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:07,416
Excuse me.

811
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,666
I think I'll go outside to check again.

812
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,416
Hey! Wait!

813
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,875
The train still isn't running.

814
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,166
But I saw a car rental company.

815
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,250
We could drive there ourselves.

816
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,625
Are you crazy?

817
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:56,791
We can't drive in a snowstorm like this.

818
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,416
We don't have to go.

819
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,916
We can go. We can.

820
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,083
It's okay.

821
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,791
Maybe we can come back some other time.

822
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,708
I only have today.

823
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,000
What?

824
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,583
Today is the last day of the festival.

825
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,708
But they have it every year, right?

826
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:23,041
We can come back next year, okay?

827
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:41,833
Here.

828
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:44,666
Thank you.

829
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,750
Hold on. Have you made a wish yet?

830
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:20,416
Make a wish first.

831
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:21,791
Okay.

832
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,458
Here.

833
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,416
What did you wish for?

834
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:42,291
I wished for the storm to clear.

835
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,625
You'll take me there
no matter what, is it?

836
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,708
Who makes wishes for other people
on their own birthday?

837
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:56,875
And why do you make a wish for me?

838
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:58,750
We aren't a couple.

839
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:08,916
I broke up with you this morning.

840
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:26,000
How about...

841
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,458
I'll give you another chance to hit on me.

842
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,166
Come on.

843
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:37,041
I'll pretend that
I'm looking for something here.

844
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:38,791
And you come by and hit on me.

845
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,125
I don't know how to hit on girls.

846
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,500
It won't work.

847
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,833
Well, how did you make it happen before?

848
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,708
Hurry.

849
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,333
Get up.

850
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:51,625
Hurry up.

851
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,041
Go. Start over there.

852
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,000
Excuse me.

853
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:15,125
Did you hurt yourself...

854
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:19,541
when you fell from heaven?

855
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:24,291
I mean you're like an angel.

856
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:28,833
An angel who fell from heaven.

857
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:30,916
I got it the first time.

858
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:32,541
I'm just still in shock.

859
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:37,125
Stop it. You Googled that line, right?

860
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:38,458
Yes.

861
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,458
I don't want that.

862
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:42,166
I want something sincere,
straight from your heart.

863
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,125
Simple. Just be yourself.

864
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:46,500
-Try again.
-Straight and simple.

865
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,291
I'm not starting yet.
I just came to grab something.

866
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,166
Your hair is so wet.

867
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,583
Nui.

868
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,958
Do I know you?

869
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,416
You don't know me

870
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:32,708
but...

871
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:35,875
I've been watching you for a while.

872
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:39,708
Actually, for a few years.

873
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:41,833
I just

874
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,500
want to tell you

875
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:49,583
that I'd like to get to know you.

876
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,791
Are you hitting on me?

877
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,208
A guy like you?

878
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,916
Are you sure?

879
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:00,791
I know.

880
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:05,000
For a loser like me,
just to look at you is already wrong.

881
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:10,791
But I...

882
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,375
I really do like you.

883
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:18,625
I like your eyes.

884
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:21,791
When you talk to someone,

885
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:25,458
your eyes light up

886
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,708
like you're excited

887
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,708
and really interested in
what they're saying.

888
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,333
And I like your smile.

889
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,833
When you smile,
your eyes squint like this.

890
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,166
Like a little kid.

891
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:44,166
Just like this.

892
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,791
And I don't like girls with big breasts.

893
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:59,000
Your breasts are not too big.

894
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:02,166
Plus you have wide hips.

895
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:07,041
My mom said
women with wide hips give birth easily.

896
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,041
You almost had me.

897
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:12,875
Why?

898
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,333
Because I talked about breasts and hips?

899
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,708
Do you even have to ask?

900
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,750
Enough. I'm not playing anymore.

901
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,041
You can't get me to like you.

902
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,416
Wait, Nui.

903
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,583
Have you heard the story about

904
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:31,375
the people who climbed Mount Everest?

905
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:35,833
Along the way, many of them fell and died.

906
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,583
And the guy who walked

907
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,958
a high-wire across the World Trade Center?

908
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:44,125
Your point is?

909
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,541
I'm not done talking.

910
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:47,791
Sorry.

911
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:52,625
Before this,

912
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:54,958
I never understood

913
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,708
why they would do such things.

914
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:01,916
Until...

915
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:06,625
Until I met you.

916
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,916
You once asked me

917
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,500
why I even dared hit on you, right?

918
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:18,250
Today, I finally know.

919
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,458
When you really love something,

920
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,583
you don't need a reason.

921
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,833
Love

922
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:37,000
makes us dare to do
the most irrational things.

923
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,166
Nui,

924
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,875
you are my Mount Everest.

925
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,541
You're the other side of
the World Trade Center

926
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:55,916
that I want to walk across to.

927
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,625
You said you didn't know
how to hit on girls.

928
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,458
That was smooth.

929
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,291
The train is here.

930
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:18,625
-The train is here.
-Thank you.

931
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,041
The train is running again.

932
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,791
Hey, let's go.

933
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,458
Hey!

934
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,000
Is this the one?

935
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:11,291
This one?

936
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,458
-Yes, you got it!
-It really is!

937
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:16,708
Yes, it is the one.

938
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,458
I have all of them.

939
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,666
But why should I be happy?

940
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,625
I don't even remember I collect them.

941
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:30,666
Look, the snowman
wears glasses just like you.

942
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,333
So cute.

943
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:36,375
Are you complimenting the snowman or me?

944
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:39,291
Both then.

945
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:13,125
I want to sleep all night

946
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:17,583
And dream of us

947
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:20,333
I don't want to wake up

948
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:26,958
I want to sleep all night long

949
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:32,875
Can I stop time to dream?

950
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:36,041
Can I, please?

951
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:42,250
Our hearts have yearned for each other
Since we first met

952
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:46,875
We both felt it

953
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:54,000
But dreams are unfair
They aren't for real

954
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:57,333
We're lost in the moment

955
01:24:57,708 --> 01:25:00,166
We only met once

956
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:06,583
We only spoke for a moment
It's not enough

957
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:11,083
I want it like in my dreams

958
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:13,083
Where I was more than happy

959
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:16,583
The two of us are embracing

960
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:19,375
Whenever we want to meet

961
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,375
Just close our eyes and dream away

962
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:24,958
So our hearts can be as one

963
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,333
Let's take a picture together.

964
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,333
Nui, no, it's okay.

965
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,208
What?

966
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,333
You don't like taking pictures that much?

967
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:41,791
We finally made it all the way here.

968
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:43,291
Just one picture.

969
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:44,416
Nui.

970
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,000
We can just remember it.

971
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:52,166
You are really weird.

972
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,875
When you told me you were my boyfriend,

973
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:57,291
I wondered what was I thinking?

974
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,666
Was I drunk or pregnant?

975
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,916
But right now, I think I understand

976
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,333
how I became your girlfriend.

977
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,041
Nui, Nui.

978
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,541
There it is. Do you remember?

979
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,333
I told you
this is the highlight of the year.

980
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,333
It's beautiful, right?

981
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31,500
What a shame, though.

982
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:34,458
All the effort to build it, and for what?

983
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,541
Tomorrow, they'll just let it melt?

984
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:39,958
How would the people who made it feel?

985
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:08,458
What is it?

986
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:17,583
What are you doing?
We're going to be in trouble.

987
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,083
What?

988
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:34,666
Nui...

989
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,916
Will you marry me?

990
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,708
What?

991
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:41,250
Right now.

992
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,750
Are you crazy?

993
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:46,000
No way.

994
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,250
You told me that

995
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,541
you wanted to get married before 30.

996
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,875
Yes, I do.

997
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:56,833
But I didn’t mean today, did I?

998
01:27:57,333 --> 01:28:00,125
Getting married in Japan would be
really cool though.

999
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,083
What are you doing?

1000
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,916
Nui, will you take me as your husband?

1001
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:24,208
Isn't that what the priest is
supposed to say?

1002
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:26,166
The priest isn't here.

1003
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,250
So will you?

1004
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:49,458
Is there anybody who objects?

1005
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,583
That's okay. I have more.

1006
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:18,458
This one is mine.

1007
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:34,041
Gosh!

1008
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:37,208
Years have passed
and my room is still messy.

1009
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,791
The view is so beautiful.

1010
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:58,458
You need help?

1011
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,708
Yes.

1012
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:05,875
It's nice...

1013
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:09,250
to see you up close like this.

1014
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:17,083
You see me every day, aren't you bored?

1015
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:25,625
We...

1016
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:30,250
have kissed already, right?

1017
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,291
I don't remember.

1018
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,250
I mean...

1019
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,958
I want you to kiss me.

1020
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:53,583
Nui.

1021
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,291
Nui.

1022
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:08,833
What is it?

1023
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,250
What are you doing?

1024
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,041
I...

1025
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:42,416
I have something to confess.

1026
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:46,750
Say it.

1027
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:52,833
Actually,

1028
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:54,916
we've...

1029
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,541
never slept together.

1030
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:01,791
No wonder.

1031
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,416
Your face is redder than those monkeys.

1032
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,250
Your boyfriend's name is Top.

1033
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,041
I know.

1034
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:11,833
What are you saying?

1035
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,291
But I'm not Top.

1036
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,750
What do you mean?

1037
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:28,958
I'm really sorry, Nui.

1038
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:33,166
I didn't think it would go this far.

1039
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,750
Are you playing some crazy joke?

1040
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:38,500
You are joking, right?

1041
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:46,958
My name is Den.

1042
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:50,291
Actually, I just work
at the same place as you do.

1043
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,083
And I've been your secret admirer.

1044
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,583
I don't find this funny!

1045
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,958
Nui, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done this.

1046
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:00,750
I really shouldn't have done this.

1047
01:34:02,166 --> 01:34:03,125
I'm sorry.

1048
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:07,125
Are you crazy? What do you mean?

1049
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:09,833
So you're saying you aren't Top.

1050
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:12,208
And you aren't my boyfriend either?

1051
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,250
Correct.

1052
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:20,833
And why did you do this?

1053
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:22,958
Why did you lie about being my boyfriend?

1054
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:26,541
This is the only day
I could be close to you.

1055
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,583
But I had no bad intentions.

1056
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:30,875
What do you want?

1057
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,708
Answer me!

1058
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:42,791
How did you know about my birthmark?

1059
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:44,708
I didn't do it on purpose.

1060
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:48,291
During the New Year's party,
I saw your shirt lifted up and--

1061
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:49,375
You pervert!

1062
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:50,958
-Get out!
-I didn't have sexual thoughts.

1063
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,125
Get the hell out!

1064
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:54,291
Nui, please.

1065
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:55,666
-Get out!
-Listen for a second.

1066
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,958
-Get out!
-Nui.

1067
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:57,875
Go!

1068
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,666
Nui, please just listen first.

1069
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:00,875
Just get out!

1070
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:03,166
Please.

1071
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:04,750
-You're not getting out, right?
-Nui.

1072
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:06,208
-Nui.
-Get out!

1073
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,750
I didn't mean to do anything bad.

1074
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,000
Get out!

1075
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,208
I said get the hell out!

1076
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:11,125
Go!

1077
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:12,416
Get out!

1078
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,333
Go! Get out of here!

1079
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:09,375
NO RESULTS

1080
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:10,375
TOP

1081
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:11,875
NO RESULTS

1082
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:17,000
MY PRINCE

1083
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:21,416
CALLING MY PRINCE

1084
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:26,958
Hello, is this Top?

1085
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,000
Yes, speaking.

1086
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:31,458
Is this Mr. Surachet?

1087
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:34,291
No, this is Nui.

1088
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:36,125
Oh, yes.

1089
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,750
You're calling about the documents, right?

1090
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,166
What documents?

1091
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,125
I will hurry and e-mail them
to you again. 

1092
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:45,083
Okay? One moment.

1093
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:48,250
Hold on. Is this Top?

1094
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:51,583
Hello, Nui, what is it?

1095
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:55,083
Hello, is this Top?

1096
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:56,958
You are my boyfriend, right?

1097
01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:59,083
What are you saying?

1098
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,500
Right now, I can't talk. I'm with Chu.

1099
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,541
Can we talk when I get back?

1100
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:05,583
Who is Chu?

1101
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:09,083
Dad, I'm sleepy now.

1102
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:11,291
Mr. Surachet, I'll call you back.

1103
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,666
Let's go, Taipan. I'll put you to bed.

1104
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:16,583
Hello?

1105
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,250
Hold on.

1106
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:19,666
Hello?

1107
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:52,375
Am I his mistress?

1108
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,166
Tell me!

1109
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,375
I'm his mistress, right?

1110
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,583
Tell me!

1111
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:17,541
Tell me!

1112
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,416
You could say that.

1113
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,375
What do you mean?

1114
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,416
Am I or not?

1115
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:31,875
You are.

1116
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,958
And how did I become his mistress?

1117
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:40,416
He tricked me, right?

1118
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,125
Why are you quiet? Tell me.

1119
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,833
I didn’t know he had
a wife and kid already, right?

1120
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:51,958
Tell me!

1121
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,125
Wrong.

1122
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:14,333
You knew.

1123
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,666
No way.

1124
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,250
I'm not like that.

1125
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:29,291
You're lying again, aren't you?

1126
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,041
I'm not lying.

1127
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:34,458
And why would I agree to be his mistress?

1128
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:38,958
There has to be a reason.

1129
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,583
He told you he was going to get a divorce.

1130
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,416
He's getting a divorce?

1131
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:48,000
That means
they're about to break up, right?

1132
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,666
I'm not a home-wrecker, right?

1133
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,416
What I did is understandable, right?

1134
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,125
The other day, you just found out
his wife is pregnant.

1135
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,833
He can't get a divorce anymore.

1136
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,750
So what did I do?

1137
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:18,333
You said you understood,

1138
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:21,041
and continued to see him like before.

1139
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:22,416
Understand what?

1140
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,250
I don't understand at all!

1141
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:29,416
So he's with his wife and kid

1142
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:33,666
and I still stayed to go sightseeing
and enjoy skiing?

1143
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:35,458
Didn't I feel anything at all?

1144
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:36,833
Of course you did.

1145
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:39,666
You felt a lot.

1146
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,833
Actually,

1147
01:40:45,458 --> 01:40:47,250
you didn't go skiing.

1148
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,250
What do you mean?

1149
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,750
It wasn't an accident?

1150
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,500
This is weird.

1151
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:32,500
It's like I'm talking about someone else.

1152
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,833
The mistress who committed suicide
to get back at her lover.

1153
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:47,083
If this was about someone else,

1154
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,708
I would talk bad about this woman.

1155
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,750
Why is she so stupid?

1156
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,916
But what's funny is...

1157
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,708
this story is about me.

1158
01:42:23,083 --> 01:42:25,000
Nui, you can say you are stupid.

1159
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:30,750
But what I did today

1160
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,416
isn't any different from what you did.

1161
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:44,041
We both are climbing Mount Everest.

1162
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:17,916
What were you thinking?

1163
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,375
Why did you lie about being my boyfriend?

1164
01:43:23,916 --> 01:43:26,291
I don't know
if this has anything to do with it,

1165
01:43:26,916 --> 01:43:28,541
but there is a bell

1166
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:30,750
that people ring to wish for love.

1167
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,250
I made a wish.

1168
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,041
I wished to be your boyfriend for a day.

1169
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,166
Then, suddenly you lost your memory,

1170
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,583
so I thought I got my one day.

1171
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,625
And why did you ask for just one day?

1172
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,625
Just one day is
already hard work for the bell.

1173
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:58,333
Being my boyfriend for just one day,
what do you get out of it?

1174
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,000
Tomorrow, I'm going to forget everything.

1175
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:05,208
But I won't forget.

1176
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:15,083
You know...

1177
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,625
what you did is really crappy.

1178
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,375
I know.

1179
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:21,250
I'm sorry.

1180
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:22,833
Never mind.

1181
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:24,291
You don't have to say sorry.

1182
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:26,208
I think...

1183
01:44:28,166 --> 01:44:29,666
today was a good day.

1184
01:44:34,916 --> 01:44:36,083
It might...

1185
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,916
even be better than my real life.

1186
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:52,291
But from now on, don't lie to me anymore.

1187
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:54,000
Okay.

1188
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:12,958
I found it!

1189
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,125
Nui, take care of it.

1190
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,625
Tomorrow, you will be so happy

1191
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:26,208
that you have the complete set.

1192
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,541
This one is very hard to find.

1193
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:31,708
I thought it's lost.

1194
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:05,333
This is me kissing you, Den.

1195
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,333
Not Top.

1196
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:12,791
Got it.

1197
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:25,625
I sent a message to break up with Top.

1198
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:30,958
Why?

1199
01:46:35,833 --> 01:46:37,458
I don't want to be with him anymore.

1200
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:42,083
Nui, you won't think this way tomorrow.

1201
01:46:42,916 --> 01:46:44,375
You won't remember today.

1202
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:46,625
You'll only remember that
you're Top's girlfriend.

1203
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:50,625
And you won't come and say anything to me

1204
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:52,791
about what happened today?

1205
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:54,666
What do you want me to say?

1206
01:46:55,625 --> 01:46:57,416
Do you want me to say you lost your memory

1207
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,541
and I lied about being your boyfriend?

1208
01:46:59,625 --> 01:47:02,166
But you'll just let me forget today?

1209
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,500
Didn't today mean anything to you?

1210
01:47:06,666 --> 01:47:07,708
Nui,

1211
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,875
for a guy like me

1212
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,583
to be with a girl like you,

1213
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:14,416
it's impossible.

1214
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,125
Impossible? How?

1215
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:18,458
Today has already happened.

1216
01:47:19,208 --> 01:47:20,166
Why?

1217
01:47:20,416 --> 01:47:22,583
What makes a woman like me
so damn special?

1218
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:28,458
Nui, do you remember your expression

1219
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:30,666
when I told you I was your boyfriend?

1220
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:34,875
The face I saw in the mirror?

1221
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:40,041
What happened today was all a lie.

1222
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:44,041
But the look in your face then,

1223
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,750
that was the truth.

1224
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:55,375
Tomorrow, I'll be very sad too.

1225
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,833
But at least, give me this one day

1226
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:02,875
to keep as a good memory.

1227
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:11,541
You are so damn selfish.

1228
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:26,958
Nui,

1229
01:48:32,625 --> 01:48:34,666
today is the 11th of February.

1230
01:48:36,916 --> 01:48:39,666
You happened to have
some sort of crazy memory loss.

1231
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:45,333
Tomorrow, you will forget
everything that happened today.

1232
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:55,375
But I don't want you to forget.

1233
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:02,708
Today...

1234
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:07,875
You met the person who loves you
more than anything.

1235
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:19,458
If this guy comes up to you,

1236
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:28,083
you have to give him a chance.

1237
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:41,750
It's useless, Nui.

1238
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,208
I did try.

1239
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:18,208
Den,

1240
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,666
are you leaving now?

1241
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:21,541
Nui,

1242
01:50:22,416 --> 01:50:24,166
you don't have to cry.

1243
01:50:25,916 --> 01:50:31,166
What Top is doing might look romantic

1244
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:36,166
by taking the whole office on a trip,
so he can go with you.

1245
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:39,916
But wouldn't it be better

1246
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:42,708
if he ended things with his wife

1247
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:45,458
and went out with just you?

1248
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:51,750
Really, you can find a better guy.

1249
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:53,083
Den.

1250
01:50:53,333 --> 01:50:56,125
I just want to tell you...

1251
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:02,375
when you thought you got lucky
in finding a parking space,

1252
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,416
it wasn't luck.

1253
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:13,250
I always wake up early
and save a spot for you.

1254
01:51:16,416 --> 01:51:19,875
And I am the person
who put the songs you like

1255
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,666
in your computer every day too.

1256
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:26,750
And how did you put it in my computer?

1257
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:30,041
I did it after work.

1258
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:35,416
Nui.

1259
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:41,500
I...

1260
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:45,791
I...

1261
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,166
I like you.

1262
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,333
Hey, sorry.

1263
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:57,875
There were so many people in the restroom.

1264
01:51:57,958 --> 01:51:59,750
Sorry, I got to go.

1265
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:00,833
Hurry up, Joy.

1266
01:52:04,291 --> 01:52:05,375
Why?

1267
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:07,500
That's creepy. Let's go.

1268
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,125
In reality,

1269
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:23,500
to avoid getting in an elevator with me,

1270
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:26,958
you had to lie that you forgot your stuff.

1271
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:37,041
What I did, I can't hit CTRL+Z to undo it.

1272
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:39,875
Nui, don't force it.

1273
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:43,541
No.

1274
01:52:46,541 --> 01:52:48,833
Tomorrow, I might not be that way anymore.

1275
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:55,041
And I have this clip.

1276
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,208
Tomorrow, just come and tell me

1277
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:02,291
to watch this clip.

1278
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:06,375
And I'll remember we love each other.

1279
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,500
Tomorrow, you have to come and tell me.

1280
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:14,083
Please?

1281
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:18,250
Okay.

1282
01:53:28,083 --> 01:53:30,583
You said you wouldn’t lie to me again.

1283
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:39,666
Promise me.

1284
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:13,166
Who knows...

1285
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:20,916
I might wake up

1286
01:54:25,666 --> 01:54:27,208
and not forget about today.

1287
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:34,208
Okay.

1288
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:02,916
Excuse me.

1289
01:57:03,666 --> 01:57:04,500
Yes?

1290
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:05,750
The bus is leaving now.

1291
01:57:10,666 --> 01:57:11,916
Thank you.

1292
01:58:11,583 --> 01:58:14,833
MY PRINCE: NUI, WHAT'S WRONG?
CALL ME BACK. I'M WORRIED.

1293
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,375
CALLING MY PRINCE

1294
01:58:21,458 --> 01:58:23,333
Hello? Nui, what's wrong?

1295
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:24,833
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

1296
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:26,416
I...

1297
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:31,541
I'm fine.

1298
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:33,875
And why did you send me that message?

1299
01:58:36,166 --> 01:58:37,458
Message?

1300
01:58:37,583 --> 01:58:39,708
And when I called you back,
why did you turn off your phone?

1301
01:58:40,833 --> 01:58:42,708
No matter what, I won't break up with you.

1302
01:58:43,166 --> 01:58:44,375
Don't be this way.

1303
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:46,458
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.

1304
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:49,708
Top, what are you talking about?

1305
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:51,583
I don't remember.

1306
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:54,250
Nui, is everything okay?

1307
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:56,708
I'm okay.

1308
01:58:57,416 --> 01:59:00,083
Let's talk when I get back.

1309
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,458
Okay.

1310
01:59:01,666 --> 01:59:03,083
Don't disappear like this again.

1311
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:04,458
I love you.

1312
01:59:05,708 --> 01:59:06,541
Okay.

1313
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:18,791
It's lunchtime. What should we eat?

1314
02:01:21,666 --> 02:01:24,208
Anything except Japanese food, okay?

1315
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:25,458
I'm bored of it.

1316
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:29,291
And how was it when you stayed longer?

1317
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,416
Did you go to the Snow Festival?

1318
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:39,416
No, I stayed at the hotel all day.

1319
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:41,875
Too bad.

1320
02:01:43,875 --> 02:01:45,708
You haven't sent me any pictures yet.

1321
02:01:46,083 --> 02:01:50,166
-I forgot. I'll do it now.
-Okay.

1322
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:40,375
Oh, yes,
I have hundreds of photos with you.

1323
02:02:41,208 --> 02:02:45,458
Can you please save them
in a thumb drive for me?

1324
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:46,833
Okay, just give it to me.

1325
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:51,208
But I don't have a sync cable.

1326
02:02:51,791 --> 02:02:52,708
Really?

1327
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,583
I'll go and borrow one from IT.

1328
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,666
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

1329
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,416
Yes.

1330
02:03:13,541 --> 02:03:14,791
Nui, can I help you?

1331
02:03:15,416 --> 02:03:18,916
Do you have a cable that syncs
a phone to a computer?

1332
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:20,916
Try looking on Den's desk.

1333
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,541
There's one for both Android and iPhone.

1334
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:24,125
It's all there.

1335
02:03:24,416 --> 02:03:25,583
-Okay.
-You're welcome.

1336
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:31,916
Nui, I'm sorry.

1337
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,375
We're really busy.

1338
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:35,416
Den just quitted all of a sudden.

1339
02:03:38,208 --> 02:03:39,041
Did it work?

1340
02:03:41,083 --> 02:03:43,916
Try shutting down and restart.

1341
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:52,791
Nobody in our department
is free to have a look.

1342
02:04:01,666 --> 02:04:04,458
Posed like a pro.

1343
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,041
My nose is so flat!

1344
02:04:09,916 --> 02:04:11,000
And look at your eyes.

1345
02:04:11,458 --> 02:04:12,833
This one.

1346
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:14,458
My face is so big.

1347
02:04:15,125 --> 02:04:17,791
-This is super pretty.
-So pretty.

1348
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:20,958
What clip is this?

1349
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:33,458
Isn't this the Snow Festival?

1350
02:04:33,875 --> 02:04:35,416
I thought you said you didn’t go.

1351
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:37,750
...in Sapporo.

1352
02:04:37,833 --> 02:04:40,083
This Snow Festival is the...

1353
02:04:40,625 --> 02:04:41,541
The 67th.

1354
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:43,541
The 67th already.

1355
02:04:43,958 --> 02:04:45,208
Who did you go with?

1356
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:48,041
Whose jacket were you wearing?

1357
02:04:48,666 --> 02:04:50,166
This is...

1358
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:52,833
I don't know.

1359
02:04:53,166 --> 02:04:54,541
What is up with you?

1360
02:04:55,833 --> 02:04:57,375
Let me take some of you.

1361
02:05:01,875 --> 02:05:05,291
Hey, how can you be that shy?

1362
02:05:09,416 --> 02:05:11,166
Japanese people have such clear skin.

1363
02:05:24,041 --> 02:05:26,708
Hey, what's wrong?

1364
02:05:33,791 --> 02:05:34,875
I don't know.

1365
02:05:46,958 --> 02:05:48,208
What's the matter?

1366
02:05:50,833 --> 02:05:51,750
Nui,

1367
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,958
why are you crying?

1368
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:57,250
I'm going to leave.

1369
02:06:00,833 --> 02:06:03,166
Nui, what's wrong?

1370
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,375
I'm fine.

1371
02:06:07,583 --> 02:06:08,958
Are you still mad at me?

1372
02:06:11,666 --> 02:06:13,541
We can go again next year.

1373
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:17,083
You didn't get to go
to the Snow Festival, did you?

1374
02:06:23,166 --> 02:06:25,083
We'll go next time, just the two of us.

1375
02:06:25,541 --> 02:06:26,541
Sounds good?

1376
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:41,041
No, it's okay.

1377
02:06:42,541 --> 02:06:43,833
I've been there already.

1378
02:06:46,041 --> 02:06:47,333
What do you mean?

1379
02:06:51,041 --> 02:06:52,041
Excuse me.

1380
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:56,333
Nui, what's the matter?

1381
02:06:57,208 --> 02:06:59,541
Nui, come back. Talk to me.

1382
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:01,416
Nui.

1383
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:03,916
Nui.

1384
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:05,708
Nui.

1385
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:24,583
Actually,

1386
02:07:25,541 --> 02:07:27,625
I should have let Nui forget everything.

1387
02:07:29,333 --> 02:07:30,583
As if that day

1388
02:07:31,458 --> 02:07:32,958
never happened.

1389
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:38,333
Nui,

1390
02:07:39,625 --> 02:07:41,500
today is the 11th of February.

1391
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:56,208
DELETE

1392
02:07:57,125 --> 02:07:59,750
But I didn't want her to forget
the smile on her face that day.

1393
02:08:00,875 --> 02:08:02,291
Because that smile

1394
02:08:03,833 --> 02:08:06,208
showed exactly how she truly felt inside.

1395
02:08:11,166 --> 02:08:14,458
Hakodate warehouse.

1396
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:17,416
We are at the Hakodate warehouse.
It's so cold.

1397
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,791
It's snowing too.
