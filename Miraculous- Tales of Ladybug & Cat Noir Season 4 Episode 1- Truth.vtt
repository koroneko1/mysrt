It's perfect. As good as new!

00:58.520 --> 01:01.320
Now it's completely safe to use.

01:03.460 --> 01:06.390
Wow! I feel so much better!
What happened?

01:06.460 --> 01:08.360
Oh! Nooroo!

01:08.430 --> 01:11.500
Oh, wow! Everything
was so chaotic in my head!

01:11.600 --> 01:14.400
Like a nightmare where I'd
fallen into very bad hands!

01:14.470 --> 01:18.340
Sorry, old friend, but
the nightmare is not over yet!

01:19.340 --> 01:22.340
Nooroo, Duusuu... Unify!

01:41.060 --> 01:43.160
So, they all live in there?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.270
Yes,
except for Nooroo and Duusuu,

01:45.330 --> 01:47.500
who are being held captive
by the bad guys.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.340
- Master Fu never let them out?
- Only kwamis like me

01:50.470 --> 01:53.670
who have a holder like you can
go out into the human world.

01:53.810 --> 01:56.340
But isn't it
a bit cramped in there?

01:56.480 --> 01:59.450
Oh, no! There's a whole
parallel world inside!

01:59.550 --> 02:02.220
Of course, being out here
is much more interesting!

02:02.320 --> 02:04.620
You humans are so inventive!

02:05.420 --> 02:07.290
Hmm.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.790
(Laughter)

02:14.160 --> 02:16.200
Whoo! Whoo!

02:16.300 --> 02:18.130
I thought they couldn't get out.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.670
Now that you're the Guardian,
the box has become like you!

02:20.770 --> 02:23.500
Full of surprises!
That's amazing!

02:23.640 --> 02:25.640
- Thanks, Tikki!
- Hey! She made that for me!

02:25.740 --> 02:29.340
- That's my secret diary!
- Day. Night. Night. Day.

02:30.180 --> 02:32.380
Wow! It makes music!
I love music!

02:32.480 --> 02:34.310
Careful with my phone!

02:35.650 --> 02:37.450
Oh, my! You have to see this!

02:37.520 --> 02:39.350
The carts are
all moving on their own!

02:39.460 --> 02:41.760
There isn't a single horse
to pull them!

02:42.090 --> 02:44.660
- Look, Mom!
- Huh?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.660
(Laughs)
It's a talking squishie!

02:46.730 --> 02:49.260
But it's not for sale yet!

02:51.330 --> 02:53.170
(Laughter)

02:53.270 --> 02:56.440
<i> Paris is getting ready to</i>
<i>celebrate Prince Ali's birthday.</i>

02:58.070 --> 03:00.540
<i> - Marinette?</i>
<i> - Oh, Alya!</i>

03:00.640 --> 03:03.480
<i> What do you think of</i>
<i> my new squishies? Cute, right?</i>

03:03.550 --> 03:04.780
What new squishies?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.250
Marinette,
we're magical creatures.

03:08.350 --> 03:11.550
We can't be seen or heard
on screens or in photographs.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.890
That's why I'm not showing up
on these magic paintings!

03:15.020 --> 03:16.690
Right. She can only see me

03:16.760 --> 03:19.530
and I look completely
ridiculous, don't I?

03:19.600 --> 03:23.400
- Marinette, are you feeling OK?
-<i> Ah! Hey, girls!</i>

03:23.500 --> 03:27.730
<i>So happy to see you! Now is just</i>
<i> the perfect time for a chat!</i>

03:28.100 --> 03:30.270
Did you say new squishies?
Show us!

03:30.410 --> 03:33.410
<i> Uh, squishies? What squishies?</i>
<i> Aaah!</i>

03:33.510 --> 03:35.910
<i> - You OK?</i>
- How did they lock themselves

03:36.050 --> 03:38.380
- in this picture frame?
- They look so cute!

03:38.450 --> 03:41.380
- I want her as my holder!
- She's taken!

03:41.450 --> 03:44.220
Why does Trixx get to have
a holder when we don't?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.290
<i> You're acting</i>
<i> weirder than usual!</i>

03:47.290 --> 03:49.390
<i> I'm just working out!</i>

03:49.460 --> 03:52.430
<i> I came up with this workout.</i>
<i> It's a super special workout!</i>

03:52.530 --> 03:55.460
To, uh, be in shape
before making squishies!

03:55.800 --> 03:58.030
You should get some fresh air.
You look overwhelmed.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.030
Wait a minute. Awkward
gesturing, ridiculous babbling,

04:01.270 --> 04:03.640
weird excuses,
clumsiness overload...

04:03.740 --> 04:06.410
- (Gasp)
- Is Adrien there?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.440
<i> - What? Of course not!</i>
- (Phone ringing)

04:09.580 --> 04:11.010
Luka? Ah!

04:13.620 --> 04:16.020
ALL: Luka?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.750
(Mutters)

04:18.050 --> 04:21.120
OTHERS: Oh, that's so cute!

04:21.220 --> 04:22.660
(Phone ringing)

04:22.790 --> 04:25.930
- Wow! Luka! Hi!
<i> - Hi! Thanks for the pictures!</i>

04:26.030 --> 04:29.260
- What do you mean "thanks"?
<i>- For the photos of your bedroom</i>

04:29.370 --> 04:32.500
<i> - and of Adrien.</i>
- Ah! My room! Yeah, I...

04:32.640 --> 04:35.300
It's full of photos of Adrien
because I... uh...

04:35.400 --> 04:37.300
I'm using them
for fashion pics for my blog

04:37.410 --> 04:41.640
and I need your opinion, because
you have great taste, Adrien!

04:42.580 --> 04:45.680
- My name is Luka.
- Ha, ha! Of course, Adr --

04:45.810 --> 04:48.650
I mean, Luka!
You're Luka, obviously!

04:48.750 --> 04:53.290
'Cause you're you and I am me.
Marinette! Ha, ha, ha!

04:53.390 --> 04:56.460
I'm so sorry, it's just
that I've been so busted!

04:56.560 --> 04:59.190
- I mean, busy!
- No problem, Marinette.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.630
- It's cool. So, you ready?
- Ready for what?

05:02.730 --> 05:05.670
- Well, our date.
- Marinette?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.630
- Luka is waiting for you.
- Right!

05:07.740 --> 05:10.300
OK, I'll be right there!

05:14.180 --> 05:16.640
And remember, be good!
Hide, Tikki!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.480
Wasn't your date with Luka
meant to be yesterday?

05:22.550 --> 05:24.620
No! I completely forgot!

05:24.950 --> 05:27.150
That's why we agreed
I'd come and pick you up today.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.060
It's the last screening.
We can't miss it!

05:30.460 --> 05:34.430
Of course! It would really be
a shame to miss, uh...

05:38.530 --> 05:42.540
the thing we're gonna watch
at this screening! (Giggles)

05:42.640 --> 05:44.470
I can't believe
they're showing it again!

05:44.540 --> 05:46.670
It was so silly
when it came out 15 years ago,

05:46.740 --> 05:50.410
- it can't be any better now!
- Honey, it was his first movie!

05:50.550 --> 05:53.380
Think about your first baguette.
It was pretty bad!

05:53.480 --> 05:55.220
Sure, the movie's
a bit mindless,

05:55.320 --> 05:57.820
but we love him so much,
we swore we'd see it together.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.390
I know! We're gonna see
<i> Crocodile Heart!</i>

06:00.490 --> 06:02.390
Jagged Stone's first movie!

06:03.290 --> 06:05.660
- Did you forget?
- Of course not!

06:05.730 --> 06:08.700
And I don't have any other
emergencies right now, either!

06:08.800 --> 06:10.630
So, come on, let's go!

06:13.170 --> 06:16.700
"You are"... "You are"...

06:16.770 --> 06:20.110
Is it, "You are...
the popcorn of my life?"

06:20.240 --> 06:23.040
Nope.
It was the doughnut of my life!

06:23.150 --> 06:26.080
Of course, the doughnut!
On the<i> Candy Apple</i> album.

06:26.180 --> 06:29.080
His food phase, my favourite!
Two points for you!

06:29.180 --> 06:31.080
Two orange juices, please.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.620
Thank you. I got another one!
"I gave up everything..."

06:34.760 --> 06:38.590
- "But my dreams!"
- Nice! Another point for you!

06:41.160 --> 06:44.060
- I got one! "My guitar... "
- "Is my only family!"

06:44.130 --> 06:46.570
On in his live concert.
I love that song!

06:46.640 --> 06:48.500
Whoa! 20 points to 12.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.140
Luka Couffaine, you are
officially his number-one fan!

06:52.240 --> 06:55.410
And, uh, you... you win a prize.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.080
Wow!

07:00.150 --> 07:01.620
Jagged came by the bakery,

07:01.720 --> 07:04.450
so I asked him
to sign it for you.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.720
The rules are clear. This gift
entitles you to a second round.

07:08.090 --> 07:10.620
"Under the moonlight,
by the sea?"

07:10.730 --> 07:13.630
Under the moonlight by the sea?
It's on the tip of my tongue!

07:13.760 --> 07:15.460
I know! His very first song!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.330
"Under the moonlight,
by the sea, kiss me!"

07:19.670 --> 07:23.470
- (Embarrassed laugh)
- OK. I mean, if you want to.

07:24.070 --> 07:27.040
I do... want to.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.150
- (Crash)
- Huh?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.680
- What was that?
- Probably the subway!

07:37.790 --> 07:39.650
It passes under the theatre.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.290
I'm so thirsty all of a sudden!
I'm gonna go get some water!

07:44.560 --> 07:46.630
You're gonna leave Luka
there all alone?

07:46.730 --> 07:50.130
What'd I say? "Be right back.
Gotta fight some bad guys"?

07:50.230 --> 07:52.170
Or "Gotta go.
By the way, I'm Ladybug"?

07:52.270 --> 07:55.500
I'm the Guardian, so must keep
my identity even more secret.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.670
Tikki! Spots on!

08:13.860 --> 08:16.660
CAT NOIR:<i> Hey, Bugaboo!</i>
<i>Here's your faithful companion,</i>

08:16.790 --> 08:18.430
<i> at our rendezvous point,</i>
<i> just like always!</i>

08:18.860 --> 08:21.600
<i> Time for our patrol.</i>
<i> Hope you've not forgotten.</i>

08:21.660 --> 08:24.360
- Bugaboo! Aaah!
- Cat Noir?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.170
- Aaah!
- It's --

08:29.270 --> 08:31.770
Huh?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.840
Cut it out
with the practical jokes!

08:33.980 --> 08:36.980
- I could have really hurt you!
- The only thing that hurts me,

08:37.050 --> 08:39.310
is when you make me go
on patrol by myself.

08:39.410 --> 08:41.880
I even missed
your little angry pout!

08:41.980 --> 08:45.020
Sorry, Kittycat. I'm a bit
over my head at the moment.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.220
I bet!
Guardian of the Miraculous?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.160
Big name, big responsibility!

08:49.260 --> 08:51.730
I promise I won't forget
our patrols again.

08:57.230 --> 08:58.200
CAT NOIR: Woohoo!

09:01.870 --> 09:03.940
(Sighs)

09:05.070 --> 09:07.740
Phew! There was a huge line
at the water fountain,

09:07.840 --> 09:10.710
so I went to buy bottles,
but there was an akuma alert!

09:10.810 --> 09:12.580
They wouldn't let us out!

09:12.710 --> 09:15.720
Good thing Ladybug
saved everyone! Aah!

09:15.820 --> 09:18.420
Oh! Oh, no!
Is it over already?

09:27.360 --> 09:30.930
Uh, the ice cream's gonna melt!
We need napkins! I'll be quick!

09:31.930 --> 09:33.430
Huh!

09:37.740 --> 09:40.240
- Bye.
- Bye, guys!

09:42.780 --> 09:44.340
Luka! Stop!

09:44.980 --> 09:47.410
Sorry, I remembered
I promised to help a friend!

09:47.750 --> 09:49.820
I'll call you later!

09:53.920 --> 09:56.960
I'd like to dedicate this song
to Marinette, a girl...

09:58.990 --> 10:00.930
who's not here, as usual.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.900
<i> ♪ I love unicorns,</i>
<i> I love unicorns ♪</i>

10:15.780 --> 10:18.550
I'm sorry. There were
mosquitoes on the boat!

10:18.610 --> 10:20.580
I thought we needed
insect repellent,

10:20.650 --> 10:23.280
- but the drugstore was closed!
- Shh!

10:23.390 --> 10:25.250
Listen.
The song of the water.

10:25.350 --> 10:29.360
If you listen carefully, at this
very spot, you'll hear a melody.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.260
(Tinkling)

10:41.400 --> 10:43.740
You know,
I never knew my father,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.110
and my mom would never
bring herself to tell me.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.840
When I couldn't deal with it,
I took refuge here

10:48.940 --> 10:51.640
and the melody of the water
would console me.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.120
What about you, Marinette? Where
do you go when you disappear?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.550
- Uh...
- You tell me, I'll accept it.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.990
If you're in love with Adrien,
I'll understand.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.760
- I won't be jealous, you know.
- That's not it, not at all!

11:04.830 --> 11:08.400
Whatever it is, I just want
it to be the honest truth.

11:09.730 --> 11:14.370
The truth, Luka, is
the only thing I can't tell you.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.710
Is there a betrayal worse than
the lies of the one you love?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.860
Fly away, my evil akuma...
fly, my beautiful amok...

11:36.960 --> 11:39.930
and rewrite the song
of this heartbroken boy!

11:52.870 --> 11:56.880
Truth, I am Shadow Moth.
I'm giving you the power

11:56.980 --> 12:00.210
to force people to tell you
their most sacred secrets!

12:00.320 --> 12:03.350
Truth needs to be shared,
not taken by force, Shadow Moth!

12:04.120 --> 12:08.890
Shadow Moth? No! Luka!
Please resist, I'm so sorry!

12:08.990 --> 12:11.060
Why should you resist
when she doesn't trust you?

12:11.160 --> 12:14.360
- Marinette does trust me!
- I do! Of course I do!

12:14.430 --> 12:17.660
If she trusted you, then
she would tell you the truth!

12:18.400 --> 12:20.600
Accept my power
and you'll know everything!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.200
And all I ask of you in return

12:22.300 --> 12:25.310
is to expose Ladybug
and Cat Noir's little secrets.

12:27.210 --> 12:29.140
Run, Marinette!

12:32.250 --> 12:35.920
In addition to your power,
you will be aided by Lighteye!

12:36.050 --> 12:39.020
This Sentimonster
will be under your control.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.250
It's time to expose the truth.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.260
Tikki, spots on!

13:02.280 --> 13:04.810
Bye, guys! See you!

13:04.910 --> 13:05.910
(Gasps)

13:10.790 --> 13:12.950
Tell me the truth!
What is Marinette's secret?

13:13.290 --> 13:16.120
She is in love
with Adrien Agreste!

13:16.790 --> 13:18.090
That's not a secret!

13:21.960 --> 13:23.800
Tell me the truth!
What is Marinette's secret?

13:23.930 --> 13:26.270
She is in love
with Adrien Agreste!

13:26.400 --> 13:28.170
She must have another secret!

13:29.970 --> 13:33.610
Cat Noir, Hawk Moth
has become Shadow Moth!

13:33.710 --> 13:36.010
He's created a supervillain
and a Sentimonster!

13:36.110 --> 13:37.280
I need you out here!

13:37.410 --> 13:39.210
She doesn't have any secrets,

13:39.310 --> 13:42.780
because she's the most
honest girl in the whole world!

13:44.020 --> 13:45.850
Huh? (Gasps)

13:47.790 --> 13:51.090
- What is Marinette's secret?
- She loves Adrien, I guess.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.060
I'm the one waiting for you
this time! Enough!

13:59.130 --> 14:00.300
(Gasps)

14:00.700 --> 14:02.200
Luka?

14:06.470 --> 14:09.010
Now you must tell the truth
to anyone who asks a question.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.210
I'll do the honours.
Who are you, Ladybug?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.250
I'll finally find out
Ladybug's true identity!

14:15.350 --> 14:17.080
I am...

14:17.250 --> 14:19.150
A super swimmer!

14:24.290 --> 14:26.360
Pull them out, Truth!
Pull them out now!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.260
I must know her secret identity!

14:28.360 --> 14:30.730
Hey! What are you doing
on my ship, pirate?

14:33.170 --> 14:36.240
It's time to tell me the truth,
Mom! Who is my father?

14:36.340 --> 14:39.870
Luka,
your father is Jagged Stone.

14:40.810 --> 14:43.710
I want the truth!
Who is<i> really</i> my father?

14:43.810 --> 14:45.110
Jagged Stone.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.920
Sorry, Shadow Moth, but
that truth can't be put on hold.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.180
Don't worry, I'll never claw
a secret out of you, Milady!

15:09.120 --> 15:12.120
♪ Oh, prince Ali,
you're one year older

15:12.720 --> 15:16.860
♪ but to us you're still
a real rock 'n' roller! ♪

15:17.700 --> 15:20.530
Hey! Easy on the spotlight,
buddy! It's only a rehearsal!

15:20.670 --> 15:24.000
I am not your buddy. I am here
to find out if I'm your son.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.140
- Uh, depends on who you are.
- Hey! I wanna play too!

15:27.610 --> 15:30.770
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth and Dare.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.140
Lighteye,
freeze Ladybug and Cat Noir!

15:42.550 --> 15:43.990
My name is Luka Couffaine,

15:44.090 --> 15:46.420
and I have the right
to know the truth!

15:47.560 --> 15:49.460
Are you or are you not
my father?

15:49.630 --> 15:51.490
Luka Couffaine?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.830
Yes. I am your father!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.100
What?

15:58.340 --> 16:00.800
Why would you hide this from
me? And why did you abandon me?

16:01.140 --> 16:03.870
I was too lame to take care
of a kid. I'm sorry, son,

16:04.010 --> 16:05.680
but I spent my life on tour.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.680
I live in hotels
with a crocodile.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.010
I could never be the father
you'd need me to be.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.680
Besides, it made for
a super cool song!

16:12.920 --> 16:14.920
Ever heard "My guitar
is my only family"?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.190
Why don't you write a song
about this?

16:17.490 --> 16:18.760
Aaah!

16:22.860 --> 16:24.630
- Follow them!
- Sorry, Shadow Moth.

16:24.730 --> 16:26.500
I have one last truth
to uncover.

16:26.730 --> 16:29.000
How can I be sure that
it's really the last one?

16:29.070 --> 16:31.470
Because I always tell the truth.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.040
Woohoo! My son is outta sight!

16:42.150 --> 16:45.550
Now you stay outta sight
while we de-akumatise him!

16:48.090 --> 16:49.750
Yoohoo!

16:55.590 --> 16:56.760
(Chuckling)

16:58.630 --> 16:59.900
Oh!

17:01.500 --> 17:05.030
- What is Marinette's secret?
- She's in love with Adrien.

17:05.100 --> 17:08.440
Not that secret!
Does she keep a diary?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.910
- Yes. She hides it in her room.
- Perfect!

17:11.010 --> 17:13.810
That should hold
all her secrets!

17:18.220 --> 17:19.750
Good job, Lighteye!

17:19.850 --> 17:21.750
Stay where you are.
I'll be there soon!

17:21.820 --> 17:22.820
(Groans)

17:23.120 --> 17:24.990
Your idea was spots on,
Bugaboo!

17:32.630 --> 17:35.000
He'll find the box!
Hawk Moth will capture all of us

17:35.130 --> 17:37.830
- and the world will end!
- Not if I can help it!

17:37.970 --> 17:40.640
Wait! Your magical force
is too powerful

17:40.740 --> 17:43.770
without a keeper! Remember
when Plagg sunk Atlantis?

17:43.880 --> 17:45.980
So, we have a choice between
the end of the world

17:46.080 --> 17:48.140
and the end of the world?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.620
Lighteye, come back. Now!

17:59.720 --> 18:02.830
That's the akumatised object,
got it! Cataclysm!

18:07.800 --> 18:10.870
Milady, whenever you're ready,
call up your Lucky Charm!

18:11.140 --> 18:12.870
Take it off. I have a plan!

18:16.640 --> 18:18.140
Ladybug,
tell us what's your -- ?

18:18.540 --> 18:20.210
Top three favourite qualities
in Cat Noir?

18:20.650 --> 18:23.510
I have to say it's his courage,
self-confidence,

18:23.620 --> 18:26.180
but really, the quality
I like most is his humour.

18:28.850 --> 18:32.020
So you're saying you actually
like it when I clown around?

18:32.460 --> 18:33.990
Yes, and I couldn't
do without it today!

18:35.590 --> 18:37.660
Ladybug, under your mask,
what do you --

18:37.730 --> 18:41.600
- Use when all seems lost?
- My Lucky Charm!

18:49.140 --> 18:50.870
Aaah!

18:50.980 --> 18:52.610
(Coughing) Huh?

18:53.650 --> 18:54.880
Cat Noir!

18:56.980 --> 18:58.680
Cat Noir, tell me what --

18:58.780 --> 19:00.680
You think about
my new role as Guardian?

19:01.890 --> 19:04.620
If it doesn't change things
between us, I'm good with it.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.870
Lighteye, stop!

19:41.190 --> 19:43.630
No more evil-doing for you,
little akuma.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.770
Time to de-evilise!

19:53.540 --> 19:55.570
Gotcha!

19:55.640 --> 19:56.940
Bye!

19:57.940 --> 19:59.740
Miraculous Ladybug!

20:08.120 --> 20:11.050
What am I doing
in Marinette's room?

20:11.520 --> 20:14.660
Thanks to my new powers,
truth is underway, Ladybug,

20:14.830 --> 20:16.590
and nothing will stop it!

20:20.000 --> 20:23.130
- Woohoo!
- Ah, it's been a while

20:23.740 --> 20:26.170
- since I've had that much fun!
- If battling a supervillain

20:26.740 --> 20:29.570
with three eyes and a monster
buddy is your idea of fun,

20:29.640 --> 20:31.910
what are your other days like?

20:31.980 --> 20:34.110
A baddie, a Sentimonster
and Shadow Moth?

20:34.180 --> 20:36.850
It's even more exciting
with his new name!

20:36.950 --> 20:38.710
He can change his name
as often as he likes,

20:38.820 --> 20:41.150
- he'll still never win.
- You can count on me

20:41.750 --> 20:45.790
- and my jokes, Bugaboo!
- You don't have to overdo it.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.790
Truth is, I only ever have
this much fun with you.

20:48.890 --> 20:50.160
Catch you later! Whee!

20:53.100 --> 20:55.100
I don't want to lie to you,
Luka.

20:55.530 --> 20:59.000
I don't think I can...
I mean, maybe we should...

21:03.040 --> 21:06.010
When you're ready,
I'll be here, Marinette.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.080
Huh?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.030
If there's one thing I can do,
son,

21:26.130 --> 21:29.400
it's taking emotions and
turning them into great songs.

21:29.530 --> 21:31.170
Should we write one together?

21:33.670 --> 21:36.470
(Crying) As long as Shadow Moth
is a threat

21:36.540 --> 21:39.780
to the people I love,
I can't have a boyfriend.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.840
It's too dangerous.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.380
What is that strange liquid
running from her eyes?

21:47.490 --> 21:50.750
It's tears! That's so sad!

21:50.890 --> 21:52.690
Are we supposed to do something?

21:52.790 --> 21:55.090
Uh... Just give me a hug.

21:55.890 --> 22:11.840
Aw!
