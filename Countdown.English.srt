1
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,291
Papa, I want one.

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,916
No, I don't want to hear
your mom complain.

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,125
Let's go somewhere else.

4
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,208
-It's too loud. The baby is crying.
-Come here.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,833
Let's go. We'll miss the countdown.

6
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,041
Let's dance.

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,583
Are you tired already?

8
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,416
Cee.

9
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,208
Say something.

10
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,916
I'll send your brother a clip.

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,291
What?

12
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
Hey, Sun.

13
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,916
-Ten, nine, eight, seven,
-Ten, nine, eight, seven,

14
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,416
-six, five, four,
-six, five, four,

15
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,958
-three, two, one.
-three, two, one.

16
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:23,125
-Six, five, four, three, two, one.
-Six, five, four, three, two, one.

17
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,666
Damn.

18
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,083
I got the key copied.

19
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,833
I'll swing by Rite Aid first.

20
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,833
Okay?

21
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,166
Wait for three minutes.

22
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,166
Is that a kid or instant noodles?

23
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,666
I'm clueless. What does it mean?

24
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,583
I told you. I'm not pregnant.

25
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,041
No kid!

26
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,083
I have good news too.

27
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,875
Cool, right?

28
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,083
So Dad will stop threatening
to cut me off.

29
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,166
It would be cooler
if it wasn't misspelled.

30
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,208
What?

31
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,250
It's "business," not "busyness."

32
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,875
How do I spell that?

33
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,083
You're busy?

34
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,541
You should save energy to help me unpack.

35
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,000
I am unpacking.

36
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,916
What a waste of time.

37
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:12,875
Well?

38
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,916
Fabio slept with someone else.

39
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,375
How did you know?

40
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,666
He said a cat scratched him.

41
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,291
What kind of cat bites nipples?

42
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,458
Chill out.

43
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,416
Herbal remedies can take the edge off.

44
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,250
Babe,

45
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,583
let me take you to heaven.

46
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,625
He's funny.

47
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,125
Por bought a new mattress.

48
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,291
Selling weed must make him a fortune.

49
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,750
-Want to sell some?
-What?

50
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,375
Are you crazy?

51
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,666
Come on.

52
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,750
Mr. Famous wants to see us.

53
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,958
What?

54
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,458
NYPD, my ass.

55
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,958
Why are you painting your room?

56
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,208
Are you renovating?

57
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,625
Not renovating. I'm moving out, bitch.

58
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,708
What?

59
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,375
If I don't paint the room...

60
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,416
See? Jose won't return my deposit.

61
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,791
Are you moving far?
In case I miss you and I want to visit.

62
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,541
Not far.

63
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,166
Just back to Thailand.

64
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you want to come?

65
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,000
Do you?

66
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,125
Do you want to come with me?

67
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,583
Do you?

68
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,875
I'm hungry. Feel free to tag along.

69
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,625
Hey, Por.

70
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,666
Are you going back for good?

71
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,375
Why are you in a hurry?

72
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,416
I have my reasons.

73
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,250
Can you not be nosy for once?

74
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,833
Who will I buy weed from when you're gone?

75
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,791
-Are you craving for some?
-Yes.

76
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,750
You're looking pale.

77
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,041
Sorry, I'm turning over a new leaf.

78
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:23,958
What?

79
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm clean now, dude.

80
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,875
There.

81
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,583
See for yourself. Take a look.

82
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,625
Did you throw away all the good stuff?

83
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,333
See, amigo?

84
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,708
Finito.

85
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,833
I stopped buying.

86
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
I stopped smoking.

87
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,333
I even stopped selling.

88
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,666
Isn't that amazing?

89
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,458
Did you hit your head or something?

90
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,833
Hey, Jack.

91
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,458
You should stop too.

92
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,041
It's a new year. You should start fresh.

93
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,875
Quit all the bad shit.

94
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,583
Quit getting high. Trust me.
Life is short.

95
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,291
Give me the dealer's card.
I'll deal with him.

96
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,500
You asshole.

97
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,916
Didn't you hear me? If you want it,
get it from someone else.

98
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,333
Don't get me involved.

99
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,833
Why are you so worked up?

100
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,333
Are you having a midlife crisis?

101
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,791
I'm on my period.

102
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,250
I'll take this.
I've been eyeing it for a long time.

103
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,166
Hey.

104
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,583
You look familiar.

105
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,208
Have we met before?

106
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,166
We've probably

107
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,125
run into each other in the building.

108
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,208
No.

109
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,708
Are you an actress in Thailand?

110
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,416
Hey, dude. What's this?

111
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,500
A nail gun.

112
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,041
It's too heavy to take back.

113
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,833
It's so cool. Can I have it?

114
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,750
Go ahead.

115
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,958
Don't blame me
if you shoot yourself in the balls.

116
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,750
Shit.

117
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,208
It's missing one digit.

118
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,083
Damn. Is that your breath or your dog's?

119
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,666
You bitch.

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,916
What the hell is that?

121
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,166
The dealer's name card.

122
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,958
Por stopped dealing,
so I have to call him myself.

123
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,166
Drug dealers have name cards too?

124
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,708
Cool.

125
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,000
But the last digit is missing.

126
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,208
There are ten possibilities. Take a guess.

127
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,916
Which number do you like, babe?

128
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Three.

129
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,666
Why three?

130
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,375
It's the new year.
If you add a three, it will be 2013.

131
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,833
That's so dope.

132
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,791
How about four? So it will be next year.

133
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,250
You're not even helping.

134
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,541
Jack.

135
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,625
-Jack!
-What?

136
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,458
Are you seriously counting down the hours?

137
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,125
Looks like you need a fix. Come here.

138
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,083
Make yourself useful.

139
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,125
You know it's no good
for a sinner like me to do good deeds.

140
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,416
Shit. What is this?

141
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,791
-Your dog's blood?
-It's your mother's.

142
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,041
-My mother's, my ass.
-You're an ass.

143
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,333
Haven't you ever had blood pudding?

144
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,416
It's a sacred dish.

145
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,125
You'll go to hell for calling it that.

146
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,583
Hell can't handle me.

147
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,791
Anyway,

148
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,125
will you go make merit with me tomorrow?

149
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,625
I'm staying up for the countdown.
I want to sleep in.

150
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,875
-Come on, man.
-What?

151
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,625
Bee.

152
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,916
Can you go with my aunt for me?

153
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,958
She's your aunt, not mine.

154
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,791
Jerk.

155
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,041
Jack, when will the dealer arrive?

156
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,958
He said he'd come around nine,
which is in...

157
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,333
Ten, nine,

158
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,791
-Damn. He's a person, not a microwave.
-eight, seven,

159
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,708
six, five,

160
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,708
four, three,

161
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,875
two, one.

162
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,000
Feliz año nuevo, señor.

163
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,708
I'm Jesus.

164
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,583
What the hell is he saying?

165
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,916
"Jabba Pizza Hut"? What the hell is that?

166
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,541
I don't know,

167
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,125
but he's making me hungry.

168
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,500
Taiwan, my ass.

169
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,166
Up your father's ass!

170
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,875
Puta madre.

171
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,166
Margarita. El Niño.

172
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,208
Come on. Don't be upset, Jack.

173
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,541
Hang in there.

174
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,916
Fuck you. I'm going to pee.
Do you want to give me a hand?

175
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,958
Shit!

176
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,666
Holy shit!

177
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,333
Do you remember Fai?

178
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,958
She saw Fabio and his new girl
at the Circle.

179
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,666
Look at her.

180
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,875
She looks like a lizard even in photos.

181
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,625
Do you think I'm beautiful?

182
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,833
The most beautiful.

183
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,041
I told you Italians just bone you
and dump you.

184
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,791
You know it all, don't you?

185
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,625
I'm a Buddhist.

186
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,833
Thanks for saving me from a very sad

187
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,375
and lonely countdown tonight.

188
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,750
Sharing is caring.

189
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,416
Hey. It's free. Why don't you try it?

190
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,083
Are you a youth ambassador?
Why are you so uptight?

191
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,583
You've had enough, Pam.

192
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,750
You have to go
to the temple early tomorrow.

193
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,250
God, how many sins
have you committed since this evening?

194
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,791
It's not that. We don't know
if he put drugs in there.

195
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,125
Didn't you learn a lesson
after we lost 1,400 dollars?

196
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,666
Don't tell him, Jack.

197
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,458
We don't know him. How can we trust him?

198
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,250
That's right. How can we trust someone
we don't know? Take you for example.

199
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,166
What do you mean?

200
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,416
Can I trust you?

201
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,875
I don't know a single thing about you.

202
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,916
You never tell me anything.

203
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,708
Stop it, Pam.

204
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,541
Shit, a cockroach!

205
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,541
You scared me.

206
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,916
Fuck you, cockroach.

207
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,666
I'll have my dog, Chanel, eat you.

208
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,500
It's freaking funny.

209
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,916
You know, Chanel likes to chew things.

210
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,500
She chews on everything she sees.

211
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,916
One time, I left my Chanel bag
in the room.

212
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,375
Just imagine,

213
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,833
Chanel chewed on the Chanel bag.

214
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,625
You're talking so fast.
I can't catch anything.

215
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,958
What did he say?

216
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,791
What the hell is up with him?

217
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,041
Are you possessed by the Holy Spirit?

218
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,750
We should give him the money,
so he can leave.

219
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,166
Why did you squeeze so damn hard?

220
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,250
I'm building the suspense.

221
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,208
Bathroom.

222
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,458
Shit.

223
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,500
Hey. Why are you flushing it?

224
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,500
He said the cops are coming.

225
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,500
Come here to help, Jack. Hurry.

226
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,416
Jesus!

227
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,291
You ordered pizza?

228
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,541
Does it look like pad thai?

229
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,208
Why didn't you tell me?

230
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,875
You should have seen Jesus' face.

231
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,083
He ran as if a tsunami was coming.

232
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,125
He's a grown-up man,
but he's such a pussy.

233
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,791
He's about to cry.

234
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,875
Stop laughing at him.

235
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,166
Jack, give him the money, so he can go.

236
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:24,875
Damn.

237
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,958
You played rough.

238
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,625
My ears are ringing.

239
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,291
It's not number three.

240
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,083
Shit.

241
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,791
Are you out of your mind, Jack?

242
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,291
What kind of wallet is that expensive?

243
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,666
Wouldn't it be better
to give that money to a beggar?

244
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:47,791
Get up here!

245
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,125
Your dad sent you money for school.

246
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,208
What did you spend it on?

247
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,958
Did you spend it on weed?

248
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,541
That hurts!

249
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,875
-On stupid earrings?
-That hurts!

250
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,416
Why are you like this?
Do you have any tattoos?

251
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,791
-Show it to me.
-That hurts.

252
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,625
Won't your parents be devastated
if they find out?

253
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,291
You asshole. Take this.

254
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,375
You're hurting me. Stop!

255
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,916
That's enough! Stop it!

256
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,583
Turn around!

257
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,541
Your dad's factory went bankrupt,
so he sent you abroad to study.

258
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,458
Who the hell are you?

259
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,666
Did my dad send you?

260
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,458
What's wrong with you?

261
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,000
Are you thinking
with your brain or your feet?

262
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,375
What kind of father would send someone
to beat up his kid?

263
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,500
Why won't it pause?

264
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,083
Why won't it pause? Come on.

265
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,166
What's up?

266
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,500
Won't you laugh anymore?

267
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,125
Well, this isn't funny.

268
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,791
I see.

269
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,125
I'll fix that.

270
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,208
Is this funny?

271
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,416
Laugh, bitch.

272
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,041
I said laugh.

273
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,166
If you don't laugh,

274
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,916
I'll beat him until his spleen explodes.

275
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,500
I said laugh!

276
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,458
Laugh.

277
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,791
You're crying. I said laugh.

278
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,875
Laugh now.

279
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,000
Laugh!

280
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,833
Laugh!

281
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,083
Laugh!

282
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,708
Laugh!

283
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,291
Do you remember the story about my dog?

284
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,041
Do you want to know the ending?

285
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,750
Time passed by for, like...

286
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,541
three months,

287
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:49,833
and it stopped biting.

288
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,000
Because I pulled out all its teeth.

289
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,083
Creative, right?

290
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,166
I'm so sorry

291
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:03,541
for laughing at you.

292
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,166
You can take whatever you want.

293
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,166
I see.

294
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,416
What if I said I want you,

295
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,458
can I have you now?

296
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:49,750
Why are you so violent?

297
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,791
Come here.

298
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,375
I haven't done anything to you!

299
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,250
Come here. Where are you going?

300
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,250
Come here.

301
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,750
Come here.

302
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,125
That's enough.

303
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,958
What are you doing?

304
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,291
That tickles.

305
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,875
Come here.

306
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,125
Shit. He can't breathe.

307
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Wait, Jack.

308
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,625
Wait for what? He will die.

309
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,750
What if he wakes up?

310
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,000
What?

311
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,416
What do you want me to do?

312
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,875
Jack.

313
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:10,541
Go!

314
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,125
Leave!

315
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,958
I said go! Go now!

316
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:42,875
Fuck!

317
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,416
Open up! Help!

318
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,416
I'm tired.

319
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:07,375
Don't make me use force.

320
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:09,833
Would you open the door?

321
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,041
I'll give you three seconds

322
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,666
to decide.

323
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,958
Please don't hurt my dog.

324
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,500
Three!

325
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,500
Mommy.

326
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,291
Please help me.

327
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,416
Please don't hurt my dog.

328
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,958
I'm begging you!

329
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,041
Two!

330
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,333
Open.

331
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,416
Open.

332
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,250
Mommy, please open the door for me.

333
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,958
Don't you love me anymore?

334
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:42,208
One!

335
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,041
Damn it. Open.

336
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:55,958
What?

337
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,875
Are you all awake?

338
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:29,125
I have a question for you, guys.

339
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,541
What do death row prisoners do
before they die?

340
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,000
The cops are coming.

341
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,083
What did you just say?

342
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:41,291
The neighbors already heard me.
The cops are coming.

343
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,208
Here.

344
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,958
You didn't answer my question.

345
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,416
Death row prisoners confess their sins
before they die.

346
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,458
Why?

347
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,625
To cleanse their souls

348
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,166
before going to heaven.

349
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,083
My bad.

350
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:58,791
Before their souls get damned to hell.

351
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,041
Who wants to go first?

352
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:20,958
Pam.

353
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,791
Do you have anything to confess?

354
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,666
If you don't hurry,

355
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,791
I'll start counting down.

356
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,083
-Mister.
-What?

357
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,708
Please don't hurt me.

358
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:33,208
There's money in my room if you want.

359
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,291
Jack and Bee, I am sorry.

360
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,500
Sorry for what? Say it.

361
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,333
I was the one who stole the money.

362
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,666
Tell your friends what you did with it.

363
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,708
Don't be ashamed.

364
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,000
They have the right to know.

365
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:06,291
I spent all the money my mom sent me
on clothes at Woodbury.

366
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,125
Fabio said I wasn't pretty.

367
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,875
I didn't want him to leave me.

368
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,083
I didn't want to be alone.

369
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,666
Stupid bitch.

370
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,333
It's your turn, handsome.

371
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,916
I want some real drama, okay?

372
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:32,041
No basic shit like banging a girl
and dumping her.

373
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,375
I am a bad son.

374
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,791
Louder.

375
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,625
Louder!

376
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,666
I'm an ungrateful son.

377
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,291
Louder, or I will shoot you dead
right now!

378
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,125
I'm an ungrateful son!

379
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,833
I've been lying to my parents!

380
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,375
-I just want to say sorry!
-There.

381
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,500
That wasn't so hard.

382
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,000
I didn't need to yell.

383
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:03,958
Here.

384
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,041
Now is your chance.

385
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,500
Don't act stupid. Take it.

386
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:14,375
Dad, help...

387
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,875
What's wrong with you?
Why do you have to yell?

388
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:20,791
Nothing, Dad.

389
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,916
I just want to talk.

390
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:28,333
Dad! I have something to confess.

391
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,666
Can you hear me?

392
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:37,458
What is it?

393
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,666
All the money you sent me last time,

394
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,375
I didn't use it to pay for my tuition.

395
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:52,333
I spent it all on partying.

396
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,916
I haven't been accepted to college yet.

397
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:58,666
Jack.

398
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:01,666
You've been there for three years,

399
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,166
and you still haven't been accepted?

400
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,250
I sold my factory to send you to school.

401
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,958
Do you know that?

402
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,708
-Do you?
-I'm so sorry, Dad.

403
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,333
Enough.

404
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,333
You can talk to him on Skype later.

405
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,250
You're wasting his money.

406
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,541
Pam. Jack.

407
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,958
Look at me when I talk to you!

408
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,250
Are you sure that what you just confessed

409
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,833
are the worst sins you've committed?

410
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,375
Do you have anything else to confess?

411
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,416
Come on.

412
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,041
Maybe you didn't get my question.

413
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,833
I'll get to the point.

414
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,583
Do you two have anything
to confess to Bee?

415
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,875
Jack, just say it.

416
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:01,375
-Right.
-Just tell Bee.

417
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,208
You're a girl. You tell her.

418
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,375
You're a man. You tell her.

419
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,458
Enough!

420
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:08,458
I'll tell her.

421
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,375
Two days ago,

422
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,166
these two got drunk and slept together.

423
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,166
Isn't that right?

424
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:18,583
Bee.

425
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,958
I'm sorry.

426
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:29,500
It's your fault, Jack.
I was really drunk that night.

427
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,833
Bullshit. You weren't even drunk.

428
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,208
You seduced me. I didn't start it.

429
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:34,666
-Cut it out.
-Damn it.

430
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,125
I said enough.

431
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,416
You're pointing fingers now,

432
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,458
but when you were doing it...

433
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,500
"Jack, hurry. Bee is coming back soon."

434
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:47,291
"Hold it. I'm about to cum."

435
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,375
Your sins aren't that bad.

436
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,416
Her secret is the most shocking.

437
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:01,833
She has a lot to tell.

438
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:07,125
Turn around.

439
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,375
Turn around and have a chat with us.

440
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,916
Do you have anything
to confess to your friends?

441
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,083
Spit it out.

442
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,958
Shit.

443
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,583
Stay still.

444
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,041
Jackie.

445
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:04,666
Hey.

446
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:13,958
Jack.

447
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,458
Jack.

448
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,041
Are you in there?

449
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,625
Crap. Your face is messed up.

450
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,208
What happened to you?

451
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:55,500
I had a fight with my girl.

452
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,375
Is your girl here?

453
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,833
She's the reason I'm here.

454
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,583
I wasn't sure at first

455
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,875
because she cut her hair.

456
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,500
So I got proof for you.

457
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,625
I dug up old newspapers at Namtarn's.

458
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,333
I think...

459
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,750
You should read it yourself.
Go take a shit.

460
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,833
Wait. I forgot my sour sausage.

461
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:40,583
Is she in there?

462
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,666
Why didn't you tell me?

463
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:48,125
Bee.

464
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:50,083
I was just joking. I...

465
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,291
I was just messing around.

466
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,500
I'm really high right now.

467
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,208
Bee, are you mad?

468
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:51,708
Now.

469
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:55,958
Let's see if there's any interesting news
happening in Thailand.

470
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,541
Let's see.

471
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:03,000
"Townsfolk seek lucky numbers
from a two-headed calf."

472
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,833
Typical.

473
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,541
"A pervert fakes a ritual to rape victim."

474
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,416
Happens every day.

475
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:13,083
"A millionaire kills five people
when ex-wife refuses to make up."

476
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:24,916
"A female speedster kills a whole family
in a crash on New Year's Day.

477
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,375
The car crashes at high speed,

478
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,500
then a pretty girl
was seen fleeing the scene."

479
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:40,125
Please stop.

480
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,875
"The reckless driver was identified
as the daughter of a famous politician.

481
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:47,000
Four dead. The son flies back from England

482
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:49,250
-to take the bodies home today."
-Stop.

483
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:55,208
"Dad fabricates a false confession
and insists on his daughter's innocence,

484
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,166
but an eyewitness confirms she's at fault.

485
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,791
-The case has gone quiet
-I said enough!

486
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,166
after the scapegoat took the fall."

487
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:03,791
What?

488
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,416
A RECKLESS DRIVER KILLS FOUR PEOPLE
AND FLEES ABROAD

489
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,000
-Shit.
-Please stop.

490
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:20,666
Bee, you're so famous.
Why didn't you tell me?

491
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,333
I'm a fan of your work.

492
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,000
Can I have an autograph, please?

493
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,458
Leave me alone!

494
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:31,041
It was an accident.
What do you want from me?

495
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,500
Is this what it's about?

496
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,708
Their family sent you here, right?

497
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:42,125
You guys called me!

498
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,250
Stop asking me this question!

499
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,791
You scum are so hard to kill.

500
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,666
Luckily,

501
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,208
I always come prepared.

502
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,333
There.

503
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,250
I didn't mean to.

504
01:02:18,416 --> 01:02:20,125
Thailand is a Buddhist country, right?

505
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,875
Do you know the five precepts?

506
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:25,958
Have you learned them?

507
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,458
Let me take a piss.

508
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,958
Okay.

509
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,833
I'll give you guys another chance
to get out of this.

510
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,666
You should clean your toilet.

511
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,625
It's gross.

512
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:51,208
You have to recite all five precepts.

513
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:52,375
If you get them right,

514
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:53,750
I will let you live.

515
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,875
But if you get even one word wrong,

516
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:00,625
I will kill all of you.

517
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,375
Or do you want my help?

518
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,375
I can blow your brains out right now!

519
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,416
I observe the precept

520
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:20,375
of abstaining
from the destruction of life.

521
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,250
That's very good.

522
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,916
You can recite it,

523
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,625
but you don't practice it.

524
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,166
What is the second precept, baby?

525
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:36,875
Please don't do anything to me.

526
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,541
I really don't know.

527
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,750
Please don't hurt me.

528
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,750
Please don't hurt me.

529
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,416
Okay. Come here.

530
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,625
It's okay.

531
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:55,916
Take it easy.

532
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,666
It's okay if you don't know.

533
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,875
Just repeat after me.

534
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,583
I observe the precept of abstaining...

535
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,416
I said repeat after me! Do it!

536
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,375
"I observe the precept

537
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,666
of abstaining..."

538
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,375
From taking that...

539
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,166
"From taking that..."

540
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,916
Which is not given!

541
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,166
Now.

542
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,208
The third precept is for you.

543
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,166
It hits right home.

544
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:45,625
Recite the third precept
for your punk-ass friends.

545
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,125
I observe the precept

546
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,666
of abstaining from sexual misconduct.

547
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,625
Wow. Excellent.

548
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,958
Did you get an A
when you studied Buddhism?

549
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:02,916
It's your turn.

550
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,125
What's the fourth precept?

551
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:09,958
You idiot.

552
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,125
I'll recite it for you,
and you should remember it.

553
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,958
I observe the precept
of abstaining from falsehood.

554
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:24,708
I observe the precept
of abstaining from falsehood!

555
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:25,708
Do you remember now?

556
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,708
Do you?

557
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,500
Do you?

558
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,166
And now,

559
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,541
it's the final part of our show.

560
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,958
The three contestants

561
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:50,666
need to recite
the fifth precept altogether.

562
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,041
Are you all ready?

563
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,500
If you are,

564
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,750
let's hear it!

565
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,708
-I observe
-I observe

566
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:01,250
-the precept...
-the precept...

567
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,000
Let's start again. Recite it together,

568
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,541
loud and clear.

569
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,916
-I observe
-I observe

570
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:14,250
-the precept
-the precept

571
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,916
-of abstaining--
-of abstaining--

572
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,875
Wrong!

573
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,333
I will give you

574
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,708
one last chance.

575
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,458
-I observe
-I observe

576
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,416
the precept...

577
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,833
I observe...

578
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,083
The precept...

579
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,583
Of...

580
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,916
Abstaining from intoxicants...

581
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,625
Easy now.

582
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:23,958
Let's discuss this.

583
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,500
Fuck.

584
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,083
Fuck you.

585
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:53,416
Let me go!

586
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,416
Who are you?

587
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,333
Why are you doing this?

588
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,833
Please!

589
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,875
Stop it, please.

590
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,250
Please let me go.

591
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,666
I can't take this anymore.

592
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,541
Just let me go.

593
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:15,291
Please let me go.

594
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:19,250
Tell me then.

595
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:22,125
Why should I let you live?

596
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,583
Give me one good reason

597
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:28,666
why you should continue living
in this world?

598
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,250
You can't, can you?

599
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,625
But I have

600
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,041
four reasons

601
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,958
why I shouldn't let you live!

602
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,291
Do you have anything else to confess?

603
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,583
Bee?

604
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,625
What else do you want me to say?

605
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:09,083
Anything you haven't said yet.

606
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,625
So you'll have no regrets once you die.

607
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,625
That girl...

608
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,375
She wasn't dead yet.

609
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,916
When the car crashed,

610
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,750
the girl...

611
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,583
She was still alive.

612
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,500
You left her there to die?

613
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,500
You left her lying there?

614
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,333
She's a person, not a dog!

615
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:42,875
If you had rushed her to the hospital,

616
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,291
-she wouldn't have died!
-I know!

617
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,166
Enough! Just shoot me!

618
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,333
Shoot me now!

619
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,375
Okay. I'll give you an out.

620
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,416
I'll let you choose between

621
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:15,041
killing me

622
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,500
or

623
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:19,375
shooting yourself in the head.

624
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,083
Grab the brass ring. Come on.

625
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,458
What's so hard about it? Just shoot me.

626
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:31,458
Once the cops arrive,
you can say I killed those three.

627
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:32,750
You just defended yourself.

628
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:35,666
Your parents can hire a lawyer
to clean this up.

629
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,791
You can flee to another country
and start over,

630
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,666
walking away unpunished
like you did before.

631
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,666
Sounds good?

632
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,250
Stop overthinking.

633
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,500
Here. Okay?

634
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:48,125
Just pull the trigger,
and it will all be over.

635
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,666
It's so easy to kill a person.

636
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:53,791
You're a professional.

637
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,750
This special chance expires

638
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,958
on New Year's Day.

639
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,875
Damn.

640
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,958
You just won't die.

641
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,166
Humans and cockroaches are the same.

642
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,083
They are so damn useless.

643
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,416
They just try to get by.

644
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:39,791
Jack.

645
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:56,916
Are you okay?

646
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:01,666
Are you hurt?

647
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:08,750
Bee.

648
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,416
What the hell happened last night?

649
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,250
It happened to all of us, right?

650
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:19,958
Did it happen to you too?

651
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:03,208
Jack.

652
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,125
I went to Chinatown to eat.

653
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,541
I got food for you.

654
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:10,625
What took you so long?

655
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,208
Are you watching porn?

656
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:14,250
Your nose is bleeding.

657
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:02,958
Did I call you last night?

658
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:04,833
No, you didn't.

659
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:06,375
Are you okay?

660
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,625
Mom.

661
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,041
Yes? What is it?

662
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,375
I have something to confess.

663
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:15,625
I spent all my pocket money
on a shopping spree.

664
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:18,416
I haven't gotten accepted yet.

665
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,166
I stole my friends' money.

666
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,750
I'm sorry, Dad.

667
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,875
I'm sorry, Mom.

668
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,083
I didn't mean to.

669
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:05,875
Bee.

670
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:07,291
Where are you going?

671
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,166
Home.

672
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,125
What do you mean by "home"?

673
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,916
Juvenile home, maybe.

674
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:29,000
I don't know either.

675
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:35,833
Are you sure about this?

676
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,791
I already bought the ticket online.

677
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:03,416
Damn, Pam.

678
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:05,375
Your snot is dripping on my back.

679
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:06,833
Asshole.

680
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:09,416
Come on, Jack.

681
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:53,166
I'll have to tell Jose
about this elevator.

682
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,166
What about it?

683
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:58,625
It moves slowly,
and it's missing a button.

684
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,666
Do you know

685
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:35,583
what death row prisoners do
before they die?

686
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,041
They confess their sins.

687
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,625
