00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.817
I'm going out!

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.099
Ah! Do you want to eat ChiChiKo*?
 (*a famous Korean cake)

00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:24.672
Enjoy your day, you don't need to bring back anything.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.059
Alright, I'm off!

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:11.750
So irritated!

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.283
If I didn't bear it, I would beat you up today.

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.766
Who can work for you for free?

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:19.838
Well, let's become a volunteer!

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:20.630
Oh my God!

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.631
Don't you have a less scary way to show up?

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.065
I was afraid that you'd be startled, so I moved slowly from behind.

00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:28.177
So good!

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:29.794
Hey?

00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:31.091
What is it now?

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:32.358
Wait for me to come in with!

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.304
This is your house, so just come in!

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.580
"Doing nothing is doing ill", huh?

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.109
He must have been troubled by my brother a lot!

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:56.754
He's not here, so I have to do it quickly!

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.498
We've been together for a long time,

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:04.301
I don't believe that he can resist my charm.

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:06.946
Thach, sweetie!

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:08.005
Huh?

00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:10.242
Sis. Linh?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.299
Why are you here?

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:15.573
I'm the one who should have asked that question!

00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:18.316
What's your purpose when dressing like that in Thach's room?

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:21.426
Thach and I just get angry with each other..

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:23.656
Is it wrong when I come into my lover's room to make up?

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.485
Aren't you ashamed to say it?

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.838
Don't be impudent to the adult!

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.321
It was you who left Thach when finding out he was blind.

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:33.597
But not too long, you ran out of money and came back here.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300
It was he who broke up with me first!

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.703
You really love him?

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:41.048
He says you go, and you do immediately?

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:44.113
So why don't you leave here forever?

00:03:44.213 --> 00:03:45.823
What did you come back here for?

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.359
How about you?

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.777
Don't think I don't know your feelings for him?

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:54.491
You always act like naive, cute, innocent,

00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:56.721
but your real personality is a nine-tailed fox.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.349
Brother and younger sister? That's disgusting!

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:03.326
About you? You're adulterous, promiscuous, flirtatious!

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.266
Do you have any proof that I had affairs but say like that?

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:08.552
The fried chicken shop owner, milk tea staff, restaurant chef.

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:12.692
Do you want me to list anymore?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.119
How could you know? You were in the US?

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.259
If I want, I can just know.

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:19.612
Did you hire someone to follow me?

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:20.672
Just think whatever you want!

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:22.948
And now, get out of here!

00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:23.885
Hell no!

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200
Nu!

00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.607
Ms. Linh beat me up!

00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:10.196
It hurts so bad!

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:17.140
I've finished my work, so I'm leaving?

00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:22.595
Uh! Just go your home!

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.289
Go back home!

00:05:58.077 --> 00:05:59.228
You know who I am?

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:01.650
Yes, I know!

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:03.337
Just come back home!

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:04.978
No problem!

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.643
I go home just to sleep!

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:11.642
Thach!

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.821
Don't you have anything to talk to me?

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:20.523
I can't hold back myself!

00:06:22.892 --> 00:06:24.892
I hate the feeling of being cheated.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.538
Phuc!

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:34.791
Say something to me!

00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:38.666
It's your affair, so I don't know what to say.

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:42.324
I wasn't in your situation! Now, what can I say?

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.860
I don't want you to see that scene.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:52.308
You just act like I'm a girl!

00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:56.280
I'm a man! A real man!

00:07:00.218 --> 00:07:01.484
Uhm!

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.411
I know that you're a man!

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:13.113
It's late, so let's come inside! It's hot here!

00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:14.510
I...

00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.855
I got it! I have no thoughts!

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:22.082
I'll try to restrain myself.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.105
Yes.

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:03.784
Where did he put his credit cards?

00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:15.575
What's it?

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.684
Test results.... Infertility?

00:08:22.537 --> 00:08:24.537
Why are you so stubborn?

00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:28.558
What are you doing here?

00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:30.558
No... nothing!

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:32.595
What are you holding in your hands?

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:33.799
It's nothing!

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.859
Give it to me!

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:47.479
What have you read?

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:50.362
I haven't read anything yet.

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:53.414
Get out of here!

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:08.598
So what happened, brother?

00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:10.371
It's nothing!

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:13.873
Let's go out, dear!

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.000
Where did you find this machine?

00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:40.185
Because I knew you like it, I ordered it online.

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:43.035
Though it's not like the kind we used to hear as children!

00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:44.577
But it's so nostalgic!

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:57.561
Phuc! Someone's calling you!

00:09:57.562 --> 00:09:58.461
Yep!

00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:01.861
I'm drying clothes, so pick up the phone for me!

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:13.364
What's up, dear? How are you and the guy with the cute scar?

00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:14.539
Hello!

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:16.539
Oops... You're not Phuc?

00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:17.718
Uhm!

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.718
He's busy, so he asked me to pick this up.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.719
Ah! Phuc is here!

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:27.137
Hello! It's me!

00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:29.137
Heyyy... Who did you let answer my call?

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:37.926
I know Phuc is a ga...

00:10:37.927 --> 00:10:39.147
Any thing, it's not my business.

00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:41.407
I'm focusing on listening to the radio!

00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:43.405
Uhm.. Or let me...

00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:44.143
Do you drink wine?

00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.210
It's daytime now, dear!

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:49.568
Tonight,

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:52.256
listen to music, enjoy wine,

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.861
and dance!

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:16.363
Nu!

00:11:16.982 --> 00:11:17.752
What?

00:11:21.858 --> 00:11:22.826
Does your wound still hurt?

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.720
Yah! I'm okay!

00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:29.835
Later, don't talk to her anymore!

00:11:30.684 --> 00:11:31.491
Uhm!

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:36.405
Fortunately, there was Mr. Duy that day. Otherwise, I don't know what she would do to me!

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720
If later there's something wrong happen, just tell me.

00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.033
I'm always ready to help you.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:41.657
Really?

00:11:43.148 --> 00:11:45.148
Then l won't mind if I do.

00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.213
Let's arrange the books back for me!

00:11:57.585 --> 00:11:58.736
Novels with novels!

00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:03.237
Put sci-fi books on the 2nd row, from the left to the right according to ABC alphabet.

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:10.398
Politics and law books are in the bottom row.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.477
Thick books are put in the right corner.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.945
Arrange it beautifully! Don't let them get mixed up!

00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:22.574
How about criminal psychology, religion, and spirituality?

00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:27.671
Do I even have those books?

00:12:28.222 --> 00:12:29.671
Here! Look at them!

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.077
Do you think I can see?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.720
Why do you keep thinking I'm a normal guy?

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:44.439
I always think you're normal!

00:12:47.695 --> 00:12:48.525
Thach!

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:52.177
Have you ever imagined how I look like in your eyes?

00:12:55.987 --> 00:13:00.533
Am I very small in your eyes?

00:13:03.513 --> 00:13:05.513
Of course, how can you be any big!

00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:12.961
Just arrange those books!

00:13:15.134 --> 00:13:16.148
Ah!

00:13:17.203 --> 00:13:19.570
The clothes yesterday, just re-wash them for me.

00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:21.860
Why?

00:13:22.388 --> 00:13:23.455
It's not fragrant enough!

00:13:26.965 --> 00:13:28.093
You're so nasty!

00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:48.506
Here,  it's dried!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.500
It's not fragrant enough!

00:15:07.132 --> 00:15:08.480
Serve you right!

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:12.724
Do you need to take medicine?

00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:16.724
I got sick myself, I'll get over it on my own!

00:15:17.256 --> 00:15:19.898
You act like you're a weed! Self-birth and Self-destroy?

00:15:20.729 --> 00:15:21.949
Hey! What you said is wrong!

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:25.677
The grass dies due to being uprooted and sprayed.

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:34.838
I can't breathe!

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:38.145
What's wrong with you?

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:41.659
I can't breathe!

00:15:43.123 --> 00:15:44.641
Eh! Don't joke like that!

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:46.695
I'm shortness of breath!

00:15:47.644 --> 00:15:48.336
What's wrong?

00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:50.841
Let me call an ambulance right away!

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:54.417
I'm about to stop breathing!

00:15:55.772 --> 00:15:56.464
Thach!

00:15:57.382 --> 00:15:58.376
Give me...

00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:00.812
artificial respiration!

00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:04.892
I can't wait for the ambulance to come!

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.397
I'm about to stop breathing! I'm dead!

00:16:47.683 --> 00:16:49.683
Why is he so reckless today?

00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:53.601
God... I'm so embarrassed.

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:55.601
How can I destroy this embarrassment?

00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:12.762
Alo?

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.022
Mr. Thach, right?

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.169
I'm here.

00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.804
Tonight, I'll try to be back early. Can we have dinner together?

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:21.932
Uhm!

00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:22.845
Don't mind it!

00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.681
Can you make spaghetti for me?

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:28.923
Uhm! I got it!

00:17:30.414 --> 00:17:32.414
I have to go! Bye!

00:17:39.832 --> 00:17:40.332
Phuc!

00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:42.791
Cut the tomatoes and mince the meat, I need to cook later.

00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:13.751
Now it's your turn to get dyspnea?

00:18:14.274 --> 00:18:16.274
What did you say?
