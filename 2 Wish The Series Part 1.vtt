00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.500
Hello!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
I’m Two

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.400
And that is

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
Wish

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
My boyfriend

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800
After we graduated, we moved in together

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.000
What you see is what you think we are, right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
But actually…

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
What the hell?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You snore too loud!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I was sleeping

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
How am I supposed to know that it’s loud?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.600
So, I have to endure this?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000
Seriously?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I’m so sorry

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Your mouth is so smelly. You haven’t brushed your teeth. You didn’t even take a shower

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.000
I’m not smelly

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Maybe it’s because of you

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Two…

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
Just kidding

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Hello!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500
What’s the matter, Art?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.500
Hello

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.900
Where are you?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.800
We have meeting at 8 o’clock

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Shit!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Shit. I slipped. I’m coming!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.000
I’m sure you’re gonna be late!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.000
Why is it so hard?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.000
I can do this

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I’m begging you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Great!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What the hell?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
What are you doing?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Get it out!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Get what out?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.500
This!

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Turn it off!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Are you okay?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.700
I’m fine

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.500
But your breakfast

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
It’s a mess

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I told you

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.800
You don’t have to do anything

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500
I’m happy as long as you’re here beside me

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.500
But I want to help

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Look at me

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.500
I’m jobless

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.800
I’m so bad at doing household chores

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
How do you know?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.000
Let me try this

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The menu is…

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.500
Smoked omelet?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You don’t have to eat it

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500
It’s burnt

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.500
Just throw it away

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500
Then…

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.500
I’ll eat this burnt toast before I’m off to work

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Have a good day

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.800
I forget

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500
Bye bye

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I’m so late

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I’m so sorry

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.000
Is my phone screen cracked?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.500
It’s not

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Excuse me

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.500
Wait

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.000
I’m sorry!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I made it!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Two

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Why are you so loud?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Sorry

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.000
Why are you still here?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.500
I thought we have a meeting at 8.30 AM

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.000
She will be late

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.500
She already called me

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.000
She will be here soon

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Do you know who is our client?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Someone who wants to sell sunscreen

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Why?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.000
You should come out of your shell

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
All you have is work and your boyfriend

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000
I feel so sorry for you

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000
You should feel sorry for yourself first

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500
You don’t have girlfriend

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.000
You don’t even have any friends

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.300
Hit me right in the feels

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Right, Two

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.500
I bought snacks for you

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.300
This shop is very famous

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Here

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.000
Thank you

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.700
Not for you

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I’ll share with you later

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.500
Dude

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.500
Pretty Aeoy is calling me

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.000
I will go pick her up first

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Don’t be late

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.500
I'll be there soon

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.700
I don’t want her to wait too long

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.000
Hello Miss Aeoy

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.500
Look at him

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.000
He flirts with everyone

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But Aeoy is actually very pretty

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That’s right

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.600
She is so tiny

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.000
She is hardworking too

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.000
I want to know now

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
What she will be like

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I’m leaving first then

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.000
Keep fighting

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Should we start?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I’m Art

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.600
I’m a copywriter

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.500
I’m Two

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.000
I’m a creative director

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
You!

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.900
You bumped into me this morning, right?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.000
Yes

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.500
I’m sorry

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You guys met before?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.500
Let’s start our meeting

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.000
So, we won’t waste our time

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.700
That’s great

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.000
First thing is

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.300
This sunscreen

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.200
Who is your target audience?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200
Who do you think will want to buy the product?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
Whoever wants it

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I mean

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.840
Which target group do you particularly want to focus?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.500
What age group? What job?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Do you actually know how to work?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.800
It’s your job, not mine

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.400
You don’t give me any information. How am I supposed to work on this?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I think we can leave the target group issue for now

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Right?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.000
Let’s talk about the product

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.500
Could Aeoy…I mean Miss Aoey

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.600
Could you explain to us more about this sunscreen?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.000
Yes

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Hello

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.500
Hello. This is Mr. Rathavit, right?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.500
I’m calling from Viper C company

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Yes

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.800
I have received your e-mail

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.000
Are you available for the interview this Monday?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.500
Yes. Yes

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.000
I’m available

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.500
Yes

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Thank you so much

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.900
I’m angry

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.000
I’m mad!

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
How can a person like her become famous?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.500
I heard about her issue before

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.500
But I didn’t think it will be this bad

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Headache

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Do I actually have to work with a person like her?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Come on

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.000
What can we do?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Are you going to let another team do it?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.500
We cannot!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.500
Think about connection we will have. Also, our profile too

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.500
She is our door to the success

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.500
We have to fight for this

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Look

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.500
Look at the number of her followers

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.500
It’s hundred thousand. It will be million soon

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
She’s famous

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
We have to fight

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Come on

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Fine

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.500
But for now

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You have to fight alone

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I’m leaving

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.500
You’re ditching me?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500
I’m stressed

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.500
I’m leaving!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.500
It’s me who should be stressed. Not you!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Concentrate. I need to concentrate

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Who the hell…?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.300
WEVIT: I think I will have a job soonnn

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.300
TWO: We should celebrate

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.500
WEVIT: Let’s wait. Just in case I don’t get it

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.000
TWO: If you get it, it’s good. If you don’t get it, it’s okay too

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.200
WEVIT: If I don’t get it. How can that be good?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.300
TWO: You can be my housewife

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.500
TWO: I can take care of my boyfriend

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.500
WEVIT: You're like this again

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.000
WEVIT: I’m your boyfriend not your son

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.000
Hello

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Let’s eat dinner together and celebrate

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Okay

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
How about just eat dinner?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Do you think that’s a good idea?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I’m joking

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I will try to finish my work as fast as I can and go back home right away

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.500
Bye bye…wait for me too

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Gosh!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.500
This work makes me stressed

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.500
I’ll choose this one

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.500
You should join us today

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.500
Because it’s Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.000
To that extent?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
If you’re that excited, then you should

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.500
Go!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.000
I’m not going

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Why not?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Let’s go together

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.300
Two…come on

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.700
You go girl. Tell him to come

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.000
I have a car. I can drive you home

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Right

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.500
I have a date with my boyfriend

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.000
The end

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.500
I’m disappointed

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I’m sad

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.500
I don’t care

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
Bye bye. See you guys

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
He doesn’t care…

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.500
Don’t drink and drive

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.000
I will wait until you join us someday

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Of course

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.000
Because of you guys…aunties

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.500
Because of you

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.000
You guys are ugly

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
That’s why he doesn’t want to join us

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Shut up

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Let’s go

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.500
We will lose our reservation

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500
Shit!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.000
It’s burnt again?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.000
Wow

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.000
What are you making?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
What’s that?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.500
Can’t you see?

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.500
It’s a fish

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.300
Let me try

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Wash your hands first before eating

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You’re dirty

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.400
Not that dirty

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.700
Everything that I eat will go into my stomach anyway

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Wash your hand or you’re not allowed to eat

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Yes sir

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.500
This is

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.300
Fish fillet with Tartar sauce

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Wow

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.500
How did you know how to make it?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500
Where did you get the recipe?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.200
I searched it on the internet

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.000
Try it first

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.500
Wow crispy!

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.200
I’m telling you this

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.300
You

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.600
You are a very good chef

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600
Even though, it looks weird

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.500
But the taste is really good

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500
Really?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.500
Let me try

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
It’s actually good

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.500
You’re cute

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.300
Just eat

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.000
Stop looking

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.000
How’s work today?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.500
Let’s not talk about that

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I met my new client

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
She’s so annoying

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
She’s cruel

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
She talks too much and it doesn’t make sense

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.500
Why is she like that?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500
Is she famous?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.800
Is she rich?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.500
Art said she is a net idol

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Her name is…

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.400
Hello everyone! Welcome back to my channel. I’m pretty Aeoy

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.800
That’s her

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.000
What the hell?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
What’s wrong with you?

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.500
Why is she keep haunting me?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500
This is her

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.700
My new client

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.600
She’s so picky

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600
I don’t like her

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.500
Really?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.500
But she seems awesome

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Her content is good too

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
Whatever

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
Don’t even say her name

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.500
Let’s eat

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.000
I can’t even stand hearing her name

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.200
I'm losing my appetite now

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200
If someone says Aeoy, I’m like…

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
She can make the food taste really bad

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600
You don’t trust me?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600
You’re overreacting

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.600
You don’t trust me

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.600
Try it

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Is it good?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
It’s delicious

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.500
Aeoy

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.500
I cannot swallow it

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200
This name is haunted

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
You see

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500
What’s the name again?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.500
Aeoy

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.300
Hello

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
You're long gone

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.500
Stop whining

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.500
Someone just tricked me

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
What’s wrong?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Who tricked you?

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.300
Normally it’s you that trick other people

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.500
There’s a company that asked me to go for an interview

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.000
They actually ask me to become a salesman selling some shit or whatever

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.400
What’s that company?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.700
Viper C something

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.700
I’m so angry. I didn’t get a job and I wasted my time for nothing

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.000
What?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Viper C

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.500
Yea. They pretend to be a graphic company. They’re actually doing direct sales

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.600
What?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.000
Hello

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Wish!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.800
Wish!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.400
I forgot

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.000
It’s too early in the moring

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
You can go back to sleep

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.700
Sorry

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Bye
