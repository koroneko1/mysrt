1
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,333
When will we get there?

2
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,250
This is as fast as we can go.

3
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,875
We'll be late for the auspicious time.
Hurry up.

4
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,041
Hey!

5
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,666
Where is the mahout?

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,083
Where is everyone?

7
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,958
Mahout!

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,208
Help me.

9
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,666
What are you doing?
I'm about to be ordained for you.

10
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:31,791
No!

11
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,000
GENERAL BUDDHIST SCRIPTURE SCHOOL
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

12
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,125
WEDNESDAY APRIL 11, 2019
NOVICE'S PRECEPT EXAMINATION

13
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,083
There will be a precept examination today.

14
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,208
Prepare yourself.

15
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,083
Okay.

16
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,833
As for the novices who were late,

17
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,458
you must clean the classroom later.

18
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:45,750
"During the time 
before the Buddha reached devaloka,

19
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:52,041
he told Moggallana
to make merit to the people

20
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:58,083
and told Anathapindika to feed everyone.

21
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,875
For that reason, Anathapindika

22
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,458
let my body return to devaloka

23
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,583
accordingly."

24
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,916
MAENMUANG JITSIRI

25
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,833
You're getting better at this.

26
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,875
Your grandpa must have felt at peace.

27
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,166
Luang Na, he died with his eyes open.
He won't be at peace.

28
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,708
Don't mess with me.

29
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,416
How are you doing now?

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,541
I'm fine.

31
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,958
My grandpa had life insurance.

32
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,708
He said I would get a huge sum of money.

33
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,041
I can withdraw the money
if I need to use it.

34
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,125
You should consider getting insured,

35
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,833
so your family won't struggle.

36
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,375
All right. I think I will…

37
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,041
You little punk.

38
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,791
Don't jinx me. I've been unwell lately.

39
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,541
Did he really get ordained
to avoid the curse?

40
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,041
He was cursed since he left this temple.

41
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,666
Bad things kept happening to him.

42
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,041
Even after he got ordained again,

43
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,500
the curse was still after him,

44
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,541
until it finally took his life.

45
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,250
I never thought

46
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,041
that the curse I heard about
when I was young

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
would be real.

48
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,958
Did no one survive after they disrobed?

49
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,541
From what I heard,

50
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,250
no one did.

51
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,875
No one could escape

52
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,291
even though they got ordained again.

53
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,250
Does this mean that Balloon and First

54
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,166
will die?

55
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,125
They shouldn't have left.

56
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,958
They would only cause trouble
if they stayed.

57
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,833
This is good for everyone.

58
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,625
First!

59
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,083
Balloon!

60
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,791
What happened to your arm?

61
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,250
Hey!

62
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,500
Keep it down.

63
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,916
I think he meant me.

64
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,333
Come here, First.

65
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,791
Sorry.

66
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,708
Listen. 

67
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:30,041
Ever since I disrobed,
that damn ghost has been haunting me.

68
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,708
I almost died many times.

69
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,166
I'm in the same boat as you.

70
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,375
I lost my job and all the guys dumped me.

71
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,625
I nearly die every day.

72
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,250
More importantly,

73
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,000
I see him almost every time
that something happens.

74
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,333
He's wearing a nak's robe.

75
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,333
He must be the same one.

76
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,416
He always says that if you--

77
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,416
If you disrobe, you'll die.

78
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,000
Exactly.

79
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,375
Right. I'm like…

80
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,833
If you disrobe, you'll die.

81
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,083
If you disrobe, you'll die.

82
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,041
If you disrobe, you'll die.

83
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,958
Die!

84
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
Die!

85
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,750
-Die!
-First.

86
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,916
If you disrobe, you'll die.

87
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,250
Balloon, wait for me.

88
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,375
Hurry, First.

89
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,291
If you disrobe, you'll die.

90
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:14,083
THUMMANAKANIMIT TEMPLE

91
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,208
One down, Novice Bom.

92
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
Mission success.

93
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,166
Novice Good.

94
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,666
Novice Good.

95
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,041
The whole party is gone, Novice Nott.

96
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,458
The fort is down, Aod.

97
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,458
Great.

98
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,000
All crushed to the ground.

99
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,666
That's a bit too dramatic, Novice Bom.

100
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,916
Wait. Where's Fahlan?

101
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,416
-Right.
-I don't know.

102
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,708
Fahlan!

103
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,791
-Fahlan!
-I'm here, everyone.

104
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,916
Over here.

105
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,416
-What?
-Keep walking straight.

106
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,666
-I'm here, everyone.
-We're over here.

107
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,416
-Where?
-Right here.

108
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,583
-Where are you?
-We're over here.

109
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,583
That was so fun. Should we continue?

110
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,541
Take this off.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,916
I totally forgot.

112
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,250
Thank you, Novice Nott.

113
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,333
He's over there.

114
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,083
Thank you.

115
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
Should we continue?

116
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,416
-Sure.
-One moment, everyone.

117
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,125
Use this, Aod.

118
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,416
It's the best.

119
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,125
Great.

120
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,875
This year's Loy Krathong Festival

121
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,541
will be awesome.

122
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,166
-Let's try it now.
-Wait.

123
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,625
This is dangerous.

124
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,458
It's for the badass people.
Don't mess with it.

125
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,750
Novice Nott, they're all dangerous.

126
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,291
-What about those two--
-Wait.

127
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,958
That's my voice.

128
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,500
Right.

129
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,958
What about those two trannies
that you told us about?

130
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,583
I wonder how they're doing.

131
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,291
They must be dead by now.

132
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,750
It's funny. They can't be ordained
because of the curse,

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,916
and they also can't disrobe.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,166
How can someone be so unlucky?

135
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,958
It's good that they left.
We can finally have some peace.

136
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:53,875
Aod.

137
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,083
Are you sure we'll have peace?

138
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,208
Look over there.

139
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,208
Novice!

140
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,416
Aod!

141
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,875
Aod!

142
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,083
Novice!

143
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,083
The bad luck of Thummanakanimit Temple

144
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,541
has returned.

145
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,458
Novice!

146
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,833
Are you sure you want
to get ordained here?

147
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,458
-Alms bowl?
-Check.

148
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,166
-Yellow robe?
-Check.

149
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,666
-Undergarments?
-We got the fireproof kind.

150
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,333
I can't do it.

151
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,916
Why not, Luang Pee?

152
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,041
I am not qualified.

153
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,666
Luang Loong is not around.

154
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,250
He's on a pilgrimage.

155
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,583
How about this?

156
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,291
While we wait, you can ordain us as naks.

157
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,250
Luang Loong can ordain us as monks
once he's back.

158
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,833
But if it takes too long,
we can get ordained at another temple.

159
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,166
Good. Should we go to Luang Pu Kem?

160
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,041
Recently, someone also ran away
just like you two.

161
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
He was haunted,
so he came back to get ordained again

162
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,541
in order to revoke the curse.
Do you think he made it?

163
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,291
No.

164
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,666
We can't get ordained,

165
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,958
and we also can't disrobe.

166
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,500
What do you want from us?

167
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,750
Luang Pee.

168
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,375
Is there a way for us to survive this?

169
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,250
Well,

170
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,458
you can stay here for now.

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,333
When Luang Na Yong recovers
from his illness,

172
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,958
he can perform an ordination ceremony.

173
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,291
In the meantime,
we'll find a way to revoke the curse.

174
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,916
There might be a way.

175
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,458
But this time,

176
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,875
you can't disrobe again.

177
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:58,750
I know.

178
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,125
Greetings, Luang Pee.

179
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,125
I brought my son to be ordained here.

180
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,875
You can call me "eomma."

181
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,125
What a pretentious bitch.

182
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,208
Min-Jun, come here.

183
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,333
I know she's faking it.
Does she think she's Dae Jung Geum?

184
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,708
Should we place an order?

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,333
First, I'll place my order with the chef.

186
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,375
Balloon.

187
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,958
Behind you.

188
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,791
Toh Min-Jun!

189
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,000
Toh Min-Jun!

190
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,375
Toh Min-Jun.

191
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:40,958
Come here.

192
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,541
He's so cute. What do we do?

193
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,875
Mom.

194
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,583
Can I not get ordained?

195
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,375
No.

196
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,250
He's my son.

197
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,958
Hello, ma'am.

198
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,291
-She's pretty.
-But…

199
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,708
this place is full of strange people.

200
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,208
They look weird.

201
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't stay here.

202
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,416
What is he saying?

203
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,333
-Maybe he wants to buy us a meal.
-Trust me.

204
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,541
-I made a vow here.
-They're still talking.

205
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,583
If you won't get ordained,
don't come back to Korea.

206
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,666
Do you understand?

207
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,541
Mom.

208
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,625
He's so cute.

209
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,833
Toh Min-Jun.

210
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,916
Cute, my ass. You bastard.

211
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,583
Shit, First. He just said it.

212
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
He said you're beautiful, First.

213
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,791
-You're right. He said I'm beautiful.
-Shit.

214
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,208
Are you sure you want
to get ordained here?

215
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,208
Is there a problem?

216
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,291
Well, there is…

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,666
Let's get to the point.

218
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,416
Well, I made a vow here

219
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
that if Min-Jun became
a boy band member in Korea,

220
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,666
I would fulfill my vow
by bringing him here to be ordained.

221
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,750
-You made a vow to this temple?
-Yes, I did.

222
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,208
Min-Jun has been down on luck this year.

223
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,333
He almost died so many times,
so I want him to get ordained today.

224
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,791
Almost died?

225
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,875
Does the curse still exist?

226
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,833
If he gets ordained here,
he can't disrobe.

227
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,750
If he disrobes, he will die.

228
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,791
You have to fulfill your vow.

229
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,458
You'll die if you don't keep your word.
I experienced it myself.

230
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,250
He can get ordained at another temple.

231
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,916
It has to be here.

232
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,416
If he gets ordained here,

233
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,958
we will take care of your son

234
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,916
like he's our beloved.

235
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,083
I told the boys and the novices

236
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
to sleep at the school.

237
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,541
You can stay here.

238
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,041
First, my heart is going to explode.

239
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,166
It's not every day

240
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,375
that we get to see
a superstar like Toh Min-Jun

241
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,458
looking bulgy like this.

242
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,416
What's bulgy?

243
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,333
Luang Pee, I can't just say
he has a bulgy crotch.

244
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,458
I just said it.

245
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,916
Where are you going?

246
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,791
I'll invite him to stay with us.

247
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,916
If you don't really want to get ordained,
just leave.

248
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,375
That's right.

249
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,416
You haven't changed at all.

250
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,041
Gosh.

251
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,875
You can carry your own stuff.

252
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,958
This is just great.

253
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,583
My bulgy baby.

254
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,416
Your bulgy…

255
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,958
Mom! How do I do this?

256
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,041
-Shit.
-You're the little shit.

257
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,208
No shit.

258
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,625
This is destiny.

259
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,458
Are you here to take a shower?

260
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,708
I just finished. You can go right in.

261
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,708
Have you just finished?

262
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,833
Neither of us have finished yet.

263
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,041
-I should leave.
-Hey.

264
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,958
What's the hurry?
Are you scared of ghosts?

265
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,291
I'm scared of you.

266
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,625
First, you're not being flirty.

267
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,958
You're being horny, bitch.

268
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,791
You can just talk normally.

269
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,750
I can hear you.

270
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,500
I have to apologize for my friend.

271
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,166
I'm right here.

272
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,541
I can't take this anymore.

273
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,666
Me neither.

274
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,000
Fuck.

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,083
Another compliment.

276
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,791
You're so lucky.
He's speaking Korean to you all day.

277
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,791
-Fuck!
-Please stop.

278
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
He said it again, First.

279
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,958
I said fuck!

280
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,250
It's a snake. I'm out of here.

281
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,791
-Shit.
-Balloon, help me.

282
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,916
Help me! My balls!

283
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,125
My balls!

284
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,625
My balls!

285
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,291
-My balls!
-It's my balls! Fuck! Let go of me!

286
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,500
Novice!

287
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,791
Everybody, stop!

288
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,291
Let me.

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,458
Novice, help me.

290
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,583
Come on, Novice.

291
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,833
Novice.

292
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,666
I think I should leave.

293
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,583
Novice, stop.

294
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,541
Is it safe?

295
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,666
Is it safe?

296
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,708
-First.
-Pick it up, Novice.

297
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,250
-Do I pick it up?
-Yes. Hurry up.

298
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,375
Quickly.

299
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,791
-Get it away.
-First.

300
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,875
First.

301
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,750
First.

302
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,750
First!

303
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,541
-My glasses.
-First.

304
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,208
-Where are my glasses?
-First.

305
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,333
-What?
-Grab it.

306
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,333
Shit!

307
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,250
-Pull it.
-On three!

308
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,666
I'm here.

309
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,208
-It's so big and so long.
-No.

310
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,500
Bone!

311
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,750
-What bone?
-I'm still here.

312
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,083
You have a boner.

313
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,291
Fahlan.

314
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,208
You have a boner.

315
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,583
-First.
-Stop, Novice.

316
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,125
I'll slap you. Stop!

317
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,083
Stop!

318
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,000
Get back.

319
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,750
First, why are you down there?

320
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,833
To be with your man.

321
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,666
It's a snake.

322
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,041
You can't leave me!

323
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,333
First!

324
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,916
Wait for me.

325
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,083
Mr. Toh.

326
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,416
Calm down. Where are you going?

327
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,291
Let go of me. I'm leaving.

328
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,791
Mr. Toh, calm down.

329
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,750
You're wet.

330
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,208
-Calm down. Where are you going?
-Mr. Toh.

331
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,833
I don't want to be ordained.
I can't stay here.

332
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,833
-Goodbye.
-Mr. Toh.

333
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,375
Please stay.

334
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,500
-I'll tell you later.
-Are you okay, Balloon?

335
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,791
Mr. Toh, if you leave now,

336
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,041
you will be in danger.

337
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,583
It's dangerous everywhere.

338
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,375
I have bad luck anywhere I go.

339
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,500
-I'm leaving.
-If you leave,

340
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,041
there might be an accident.

341
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,791
I don't know what you've been through,

342
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,958
but all of us have experienced it before.

343
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,333
You will die.

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,958
That's why we don't want you to leave.

345
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,458
That's right.

346
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,583
Haven't you been down on luck lately?

347
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,000
So who's the cursed one here?

348
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,625
Is it Mr. Toh, First, or Balloon?

349
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,166
I think this is either

350
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,541
the ordination curse

351
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,541
or the disrobement curse.

352
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's not risk it.

353
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,000
That's right.

354
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:47,416
The ordination curse here is no joke.

355
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,875
You have to fulfill your vow.

356
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,875
From what your mother said,

357
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,208
there might still be
the curse of the previous Pee Nak.

358
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,416
The disrobement curse is just as bad.

359
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,583
Is it worse than Nak Non?

360
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,083
It's a lot worse.

361
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,458
Not only do we have the ordination curse,

362
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,166
but people say the disrobement curse
is much more frightful.

363
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,291
Whoever gets ordained here

364
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,708
can never disrobe.

365
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:37,708
If they do,
the curse will take their lives.

366
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,458
Help me!

367
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,000
Somebody, help me!

368
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,500
Help!

369
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,416
Luang Por!

370
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,250
Help!

371
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,583
Help me, Luang Por!

372
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,541
If you disrobe,

373
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,625
you'll die.

374
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,791
Wait a minute.

375
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,583
If the curse really exists,

376
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,708
that means if I get ordained here,

377
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,208
I…

378
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,041
You can't disrobe.

379
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,500
So I can neither get ordained nor disrobe.

380
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:46,958
Mr. Toh.

381
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,625
Mr. Toh.

382
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,958
if you don't get ordained,

383
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,541
you might die.

384
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,541
But don't be afraid.

385
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,083
We are trying

386
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,958
to find a way to break the curse.

387
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,375
-Aod.
-Yes?

388
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,958
Did your grandpa ever tell you

389
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,541
how to revoke the curse?

390
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,708
I don't know.

391
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,000
If he and Luang Por were here,

392
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:16,583
we would've had some clues.

393
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,791
Now that you know about this,

394
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,291
what will you do next?

395
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,750
If what you all say is true,

396
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,375
I guess I'll stay.

397
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,416
May you be well all year round.

398
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,041
May you always be happy.

399
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,333
-I'm aching all over.
-Hello, Luang Pee.

400
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:16,583
Greetings, ma'am.

401
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,833
Shit.

402
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,583
You scared us again.

403
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,708
I'm just joking, Luang Pee.

404
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,416
Are you trick-or-treating?

405
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,666
A ghost is up early to give alms.

406
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,833
He's a human. Don't be rude.

407
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,750
Where is Jay?

408
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,833
He's inside, Luang Pee.

409
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,791
He must be a halfling.

410
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,458
Half spirit, half ghost.

411
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,833
His brother must look worse.

412
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,375
Hello, Luang Pee.

413
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,416
Greetings.

414
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,541
Your alms round procession
seems livelier than usual today.

415
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,333
I have two friends that want
to be ordained.

416
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,958
There is also a Korean superstar.

417
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,541
Really, Novice?

418
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,291
-He's at the market with Novice Bom.
-Won't the market be in mayhem?

419
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:11,958
I don't think so.

420
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,500
-Luang Pee.
-Hurry.

421
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,166
Luang Pee!

422
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,666
Novice!

423
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,041
Hey.

424
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,458
Stop!

425
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,083
Stop!

426
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,875
Are you here to get survival packs
or something?

427
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,375
It's because of your superstar.

428
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,333
Everyone, please guard me.

429
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,666
I was caught off guard.

430
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,000
It's too late. The whole town saw you.

431
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,333
I think this is kind of exciting.

432
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,041
Yes. I wish it was like this every day.

433
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,000
That's enough.

434
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,875
Please step back, everyone.

435
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,291
Get back.

436
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,750
Take a step back.

437
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,250
Go on.

438
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,708
Please step back.

439
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,500
This isn't nice.

440
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,250
Come on, Luang Pee.

441
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:58,291
We just want to see
our beloved Toh Min-Jun up close.

442
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:02,083
It's not every day
that we have an opportunity like this.

443
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,416
That's right.

444
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:07,250
The man you love is about to assume
a new status.

445
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:10,625
He is about to be ordained.
What he wants is peace.

446
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,333
-Is he getting ordained?
-What?

447
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,333
It's okay.

448
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:29,291
Thank you very much
for your love and support.

449
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:33,083
I am about to be ordained.

450
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:37,666
Let's all make merit together.

451
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,333
-Really?
-So we'll meet again in our next lives.

452
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,708
-Everybody.
-He's handsome and kind.

453
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,791
You once turned an ordinary man

454
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,333
into someone extraordinary.

455
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,291
If you listen to me,

456
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,375
you can turn an extraordinary man
into a man of religion.

457
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,750
Sadhu.

458
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,958
Excuse me, Luang Pee.

459
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,125
Don't worry about Mr. Toh.

460
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:13,541
I will take care of him
like I'm guarding Buddhism itself.

461
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,500
-I'm sorry, Novice.
-Thank you.

462
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,458
Listen to me. Don't worry.

463
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,291
Watch my face, bitch.

464
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,208
Don't worry about him.

465
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,375
Don't…

466
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,666
Don't worry. I will take care of him.

467
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,541
You can go home now.

468
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,000
Go on. Let's all go home.

469
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,000
Put the food in the alms bowl.

470
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,541
It's lunch time.

471
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,541
Novice, why are you napping here?

472
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,958
Aren't you supposed to be studying
with your friends?

473
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,458
Keep it down, sir.

474
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,708
-I'm sorry.
-I'm just resting my eyes.

475
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,083
What about you?

476
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,958
I thought you didn't want to be ordained.

477
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,583
Why do you seem so committed?

478
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,958
Do you want to be ordained or not?

479
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,166
Novice.

480
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,000
Although I don't want to do it,

481
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,791
I'm obligated to do my duty.

482
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,541
You should do the same.

483
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,083
You must do your duty as a novice.

484
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,125
Criticizing a novice

485
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,291
is like criticizing Buddhism itself.

486
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,000
Is that right, Novice?

487
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,916
One, two, three, four.

488
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,583
That's everybody.

489
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,291
One, two.

490
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,291
Aod.

491
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:03,916
Aod.

492
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,291
Aod.

493
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:06,958
Aod, wake up.

494
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:07,875
Shit.

495
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,000
What's with you?

496
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,791
There's someone here.
Can you go take a look?

497
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,833
Go have a look yourself.

498
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,958
Please, Aod. I'm scared.

499
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,000
They're over there.

500
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,916
Who's there?

501
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,541
Come with me.

502
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,125
Balloon.

503
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,541
-First.
-Balloon.

504
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:49,041
-Aod, we have to collect alms at dawn.
-First.

505
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,333
-First.
-Balloon.

506
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,083
Aod.

507
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,666
-Damn it.
-Calm down, Aod.

508
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,000
Aod.

509
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,250
Let him sleep.

510
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,041
Novice Nott.

511
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,250
Novice Nott.

512
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,875
What is it, Aod?

513
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,375
There's a burglar.

514
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,041
A burglar?

515
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,666
Novice Nott.

516
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,666
Do you have the flashlight?

517
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,791
Novice Nott, turn the flashlight on.

518
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,583
Wake up!

519
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,750
-It's a ghost.
-Wake up.

520
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,583
-Wait.
-Hurry.

521
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,833
-What now?
-Come on.

522
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,708
-Calm down.
-A ghost is here.

523
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,833
What?

524
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,416
It's a ghost!

525
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,000
What?

526
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,666
A ghost!

527
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:22,791
Novice.

528
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,166
You shouldn't talk bullshit.

529
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,583
It's true.

530
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,500
First.

531
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,791
Let's go.

532
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,083
Hey.

533
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,583
It's here.

534
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,875
What a cliché.

535
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,791
The door is locked.

536
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,958
Something will fall to the ground.

537
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,291
Then the door will slowly open.

538
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,208
This is every horror movie cliché.

539
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,250
Novice Nott.

540
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,250
Yes?

541
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,791
Please come forward.

542
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,708
-Please.
-Why…

543
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,500
Why me? There are others here.

544
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:15,791
Novice.

545
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,666
But I'm a novice.

546
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,041
-I'm not--
-You're not an X-Men, right?

547
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,416
Today you are.

548
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,291
Easy.

549
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:30,125
We're trying our best.

550
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,291
-Walk slowly.
-I am, Novice.

551
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,250
I'm scared.

552
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,583
I…

553
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,333
Novice!

554
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:01,416
Novice!

555
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,041
Novice.

556
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,000
Novice, chant something.

557
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:09,250
-Thou shalt not commit adultery.
-That's not right.

558
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,083
-Just tell me what to say.
-Hurry.

559
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,500
Thou shalt not drink--

560
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,041
Come on, man. Be serious.

561
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,791
Come on, Novice.
Chant whatever comes to your mind.

562
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,000
-I got one. Honor to the Blessed One--
-No!

563
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,125
Come on!

564
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,625
Stop!

565
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,416
Novice.

566
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,416
That's it, Novice!

567
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,083
Keep chanting!

568
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,833
I've chanted that mantra

569
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,291
even before you were born.

570
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,625
First.

571
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,416
Why are you doing aerobics here?

572
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,208
First.

573
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,041
-First.
-What's wrong with him?

574
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:52,958
First!

575
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,458
First!

576
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,125
-First, no.
-First.

577
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,458
Stay calm, First.

578
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,958
Don't do it! No!

579
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,625
-Stop!
-First!

580
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,583
-First, no!
-First.

581
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,458
First.

582
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,583
-First, no!
-Don't do it!

583
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,708
Please stop it!

584
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,250
First.

585
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,333
That's enough. Stop it.

586
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,791
-Stop it!
-Stop!

587
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,958
-Knock it off.
-Stop it.

588
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,291
First, stop it.

589
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,500
Fahlan!

590
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,250
Let me hide in here.

591
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,416
-First, stop it already.
-First.

592
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,041
-Please stop it.
-First.

593
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,666
What's wrong with you?

594
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:55,916
It's me, Balloon.

595
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,208
I'm Balloon.

596
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,125
Aod.

597
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,833
Aod, why are you lying down here?

598
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,583
Help me.

599
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,416
-Are you all right?
-That hurt.

600
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,708
What's going on?

601
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,541
You two, please don't fight.

602
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,041
Friends don't fight.

603
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,416
First, Balloon can't take it anymore.

604
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:27,791
Novice!

605
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,375
Novice!

606
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,583
Novice!

607
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,708
First, please stop.

608
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:36,500
-First, let go.
-First, it's me.

609
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:37,541
Stop it.

610
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
First.

611
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,083
First.

612
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,375
First.

613
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,958
If you disrobe, you'll die.

614
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,333
Luang Pee.

615
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:19,916
Well, Novices.

616
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,333
Novice Good. Novice Kiddee. Novice Bom.

617
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,041
You ran out on us.

618
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,791
Now we're all in trouble.

619
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,500
-That's enough!
-Aod.

620
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,708
Aod.

621
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,166
Aod, calm down.

622
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,750
Don't you both realize it?

623
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,125
I think both of you should leave.

624
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,791
-I can't take it anymore.
-Aod.

625
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,333
Calm down.

626
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,500
Calm down? Everyone almost died.

627
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,958
Do you want me to be calm?

628
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,958
Aod, do you think I want this to happen?

629
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:50,083
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

630
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,583
Why did you disrobe?

631
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:57,916
All of this happened because of you two.

632
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,625
Your best friend is a monk,

633
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,458
and you abandoned him!

634
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,375
Aod!

635
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,166
Aod.

636
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,291
What we did was wrong.

637
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,291
But don't you think...

638
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,291
you're being too hurtful?

639
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:18,208
Aod, this isn't the time
to blame one another.

640
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,083
We must solve this together.

641
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,166
The solution is for both of you
to leave the temple.

642
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,958
-You crossed the line, Aod!
-Balloon.

643
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,375
-Please calm down.
-Novice.

644
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,916
I know I can be stupid sometimes,

645
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,166
but I'm not so stupid
that I can't tell he meant it!

646
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,458
-Calm down.
-So what if I did?

647
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,791
-Calm down.
-Stop!

648
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,166
That's enough.

649
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,291
Please don't fight.

650
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,625
Aod, please stop.

651
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,833
You should leave too.

652
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,666
-Watch your mouth!
-Stop it, Aod.

653
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,083
Aod!

654
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,916
Aod.

655
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,583
Get up, Jay.

656
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,583
I don't like how aggressive you are, Aod.

657
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:01,875
Apologize to them.

658
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:06,375
Do I have to apologize?

659
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:08,708
Now.

660
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,333
You always side with your friends.

661
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,208
Aod.

662
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,083
Aod.

663
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,208
Novice.

664
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,958
Aod, listen to me.

665
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,041
I know

666
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,708
that you're not really mad at those guys.

667
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,666
You're just worried.

668
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,458
But don't you think

669
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,958
Luang Pee would be hurt

670
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,333
by what you said?

671
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,166
He loves you

672
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,833
and worries about you.

673
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,458
But this Pee Nak

674
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,416
is much more menacing than Nak Non.

675
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,375
If I lose you and Luang Pee,

676
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,708
how will I live?

677
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,958
I have no one left.

678
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,166
That's why we need to fix this,

679
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,708
so we don't lose anyone.

680
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,583
Luang Pee.

681
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,708
Please forgive me.

682
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,708
Aod, get up.

683
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,333
It's all right.

684
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,458
We will be okay, Aod.

685
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,083
I won't let anything happen to us.

686
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:31,250
No matter how scary Pee Nak is,

687
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,916
we'll get through this together.

688
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:37,166
Mr. Toh.

689
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,208
We're not sure

690
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:42,333
if we will be given another chance
to get ordained here.

691
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,500
But you must do it.

692
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,708
You can do it.

693
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,250
We've come this far.

694
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,833
All of us will get to be ordained here.

695
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,791
I believe that the monk

696
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,333
will help all of us get ordained.

697
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,875
We don't know...

698
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,958
if we're going to make it.

699
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,666
During our last ordination,

700
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,833
we caused so much trouble

701
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,458
that we had to run away.

702
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:34,875
Luang Pee.

703
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,958
Have you never thought about disrobing?

704
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,208
I thought about it after you left.

705
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,583
But the longer I stayed,

706
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:50,916
the more I started to see.

707
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,791
I get to teach kids,

708
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,500
help people,

709
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,125
and improve myself.

710
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,791
I started to have self-worth.

711
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,291
I want to have that too,

712
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,333
that self-worth you mentioned.

713
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,166
I want people to like me.

714
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:12,166
I want to get many likes

715
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:16,625
and I want my band
to gain more and more followers.

716
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,416
But the more I keep at it

717
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,333
and the harder I try,

718
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,125
the more I feel like I'm losing myself.

719
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:29,791
I get stressed.

720
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:31,750
I feel pressured.

721
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:34,916
It's so difficult

722
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,166
to force myself to smile like this.

723
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,875
Novice Nott.

724
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,166
Give this to Mr. Toh.

725
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,958
Hold it like that.

726
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,083
For how long?

727
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,125
Try holding it for three hours.

728
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:12,708
My arms will be tired.

729
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,625
Anyone would feel stiff
after holding it that long.

730
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,666
Then why are you doing it?

731
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,833
Why don't you put it down?

732
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,166
You told me to hold it.

733
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:24,750
And who's in pain now?

734
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:26,875
Is it me

735
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,666
or you?

736
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:03,958
Thank you.

737
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:06,916
Luang Pee.

738
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,750
Balloon.

739
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,416
-Is that her?
-First.

740
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,291
I think so.

741
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:58,291
If Luang Pee decides to disrobe,

742
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,666
what will we do?

743
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,875
If he disrobes,
I'm going to make a move on him.

744
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,166
Bitch, that's a sin. We're in a temple.

745
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:12,333
I'm just joking. Can't you tell?

746
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,916
Damn.

747
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:17,291
Luang Pee has been ordained for so long.
He won't disrobe.

748
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,208
But still.

749
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,916
His ex showed up
at the temple with his son.

750
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,791
Don't you think they have
a father-son bond?

751
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,791
Did you see the kid's face?

752
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,291
He doesn't look like Luang Pee at all.

753
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,500
Maybe it's not his.

754
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,875
How would you know?

755
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,208
The kid's age fits the time frame
of their breakup.

756
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,583
I think it's Luang Pee's son.

757
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:46,625
His son?

758
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,500
I'm sorry, Novice.

759
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,208
-Novice.
-That hurts.

760
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:01,916
Novice.

761
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:05,708
Why did you push me?

762
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,375
Well, what were you up to?

763
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,708
It's Balloon.

764
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,291
What now? What did I do this time?

765
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,083
We're here.

766
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:16,750
First.

767
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,875
You said it, and the novices heard you.

768
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,625
Then you got startled.

769
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:22,833
Are you sure?

770
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,916
I've never been more sure of anything.

771
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,500
If you and I had just kept quiet,
no one would know

772
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,916
that Luang Pee has a son.

773
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:33,375
Balloon, keep it down.

774
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,916
What's the point?
Everyone in the temple already knows

775
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,958
that Luang Pee has a son.

776
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,958
Why are you rubbing it in?

777
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,583
I'm not rubbing it in.

778
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:46,250
I'm just making myself clear.

779
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:49,416
Just ask the novices
if Luang Pee has a son.

780
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,291
Let's come this way.

781
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:56,166
Don't tell anyone
that Luang Pee has a son.

782
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,375
Just say it's my son, bitch.

783
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,541
Hey!

784
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,250
Balloon.

785
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:11,583
Well… No one here can handle the truth.

786
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,166
You accused me of ratting him out.

787
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,666
Tell me what you think, Novice.
Don't act solemn.

788
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,291
Aod.

789
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,750
Where are you going?

790
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,208
Where are you going?

791
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,791
Luang Na Yong asked Jay and I
to fix the light.

792
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,458
They don't have an electrician.

793
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,000
I'll come with you.

794
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,250
-Luang Pee Nong.
-First.

795
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:35,541
Is something the matter?

796
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,041
I need to talk to Luang Na Yong.

797
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,375
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

798
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,291
Hop on, Luang Pee.

799
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:45,791
Luang Pee.

800
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,250
-Luang--
-Jay.

801
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,458
-Swing by my residence first.
-Okay.

802
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:58,833
Where is he rushing to?

803
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,083
To see Luang Na Yong.

804
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:04,125
He said he needed to talk to him.

805
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,916
The disrobement myth

806
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,541
has been around for ages,

807
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:14,458
even before I was born.

808
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,458
If you really want to know,

809
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,958
you should ask older people.

810
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,458
I don't know if they are still alive.

811
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,416
I think you came to see me

812
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,958
because of something else.

813
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,958
I teach everyone to let go,

814
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,291
but I'm the one

815
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:03,833
who keeps holding on.

816
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,083
Are you thinking of disrobing?

817
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,833
It's time for me to rest.

818
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,250
Let me help you.

819
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,166
-Balloon.
-Balloon!

820
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,625
Balloon!

821
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,666
Balloon!

822
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,500
-Balloon!
-Is he over there?

823
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,083
Mr. Toh, don't point that at random.

824
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,166
-I'm sorry.
-Where is he?

825
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,166
Why do we have to look for him
in this hot weather?

826
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,791
Balloon!

827
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,291
Let's just get it done.

828
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,458
Will this take long?

829
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:43,833
Aod.

830
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:45,833
Jay.

831
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,708
What are you playing at?

832
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,958
I can't see with my head stuck
in an alms bowl.

833
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,291
Why did you let me walk off alone, First?

834
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,708
Where am I?

835
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:35,750
First.

836
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:39,458
Monk Nong.

837
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:41,958
No.

838
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,500
It's this way. I remember.

839
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,375
It's starting to come back to me.

840
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:18,958
Aod!

841
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,208
Aod! Aod!

842
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,375
Stay out of this.

843
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,125
Luang Pee.

844
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,583
Stop it.

845
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:32,500
Who are you?

846
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,041
-I'm Aod.
-I'm Jay.

847
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,541
That's a cloth.

848
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:10,583
Something isn't right. Shit!

849
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:18,416
What is it?

850
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,333
It's over there, Mr. Toh.

851
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,041
Balloon!

852
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,625
Stay right there.

853
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:35,958
Mr. Toh.

854
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,458
I'm sorry, Balloon.

855
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,083
My nose!

856
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:42,166
Be patient, Balloon. It's coming off.

857
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,166
I have an idea.

858
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,583
Balloon, are you ready?

859
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,291
I've been ready since last week.

860
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:00,458
Novice.

861
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,583
Why didn't you cut the whole thing off?

862
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,958
I'm sorry. I forgot.

863
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:09,875
This looks kind of awesome.

864
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:11,250
Right.

865
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,333
But it's missing something.

866
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,083
You look awesome, Balloon.

867
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,916
Get out of the way.

868
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,833
-What is it?
-What?

869
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,333
Novices, what's wrong?

870
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,666
Luang Pee, help.

871
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:45,541
Wait. Be careful.

872
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:47,375
Balloon.

873
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,791
What should we do? It's an elephant.

874
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:56,875
Do you want me
to catch a grasshopper on its back?

875
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,833
First, help me.

876
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:04,750
Be gentle.

877
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,250
My head.

878
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,958
If you disrobe, you'll die!

879
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,291
Help me.

880
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,250
First.

881
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,916
First, help me.

882
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:47,916
Mr. Toh.

883
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:49,625
Get out of the way.

884
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,166
First. Mr. Toh.

885
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,291
Balloon.

886
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,541
-Hey!
-Where are you taking me, you bastard?

887
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,083
Balloon!

888
01:05:58,666 --> 01:05:59,958
Let me go!

889
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,166
Balloon.

890
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,541
Please let me go!

891
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,916
Don't do it!

892
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,541
No!

893
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,958
Please don't hurt me!

894
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,083
Balloon!

895
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,208
Balloon!

896
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:32,625
EMERGENCY

897
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,166
How are you feeling?

898
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,208
Can you afford the payment?

899
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,208
You can tell me.

900
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,375
It's no problem, Luang Pee.

901
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,875
Balloon has insurance.

902
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,958
It covers everything.

903
01:06:57,166 --> 01:07:01,291
THAI LIFE INSURANCE

904
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,166
Where is Mr. Toh?

905
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:06,791
He's outside looking glum.

906
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:11,208
I don't know if he's scared
or reconsidering his ordination.

907
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,833
Do you want to go and rest at the temple?

908
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:31,875
Luang Pee.

909
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,083
I'd rather stay here.

910
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,541
I…

911
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,708
I tried to help Balloon.

912
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,208
But I couldn't grab his hand in time.

913
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,416
Is it because of my curse?

914
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,833
No matter whose curse it is,

915
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,208
I'd like to thank you

916
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:08,000
for risking your life to help my friend.

917
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:11,500
Sure.

918
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,333
Mr. Toh.

919
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:28,708
Thank you so much.

920
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:36,875
It's okay, First.

921
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,791
We've been through a lot together.

922
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,583
We are like brothers now.

923
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,625
Here. Keep it for protection.

924
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,375
This looks familiar.

925
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,208
I think I saw it before I passed out.

926
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:11,041
A Naga Prok pendant.

927
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,500
Pee Nak had it around his neck.

928
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:19,375
This could be an important clue.

929
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:23,208
I went to search
the late abbot's residence today,

930
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,916
and I found old pictures of
when he discovered the Naga Prok pendant

931
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:29,916
at the ancient arch.

932
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,666
That's Luang Por and Luang Loong.

933
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:36,583
They look young in the pictures.

934
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,458
Does our temple have an ancient arch?

935
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,916
Yes, but I don't know where it is exactly.

936
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,375
Hello, Novice Bom.

937
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,208
Novice Nott, I've got something.

938
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:48,791
Just a moment.

939
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,500
What is it, Novice Bom?

940
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:55,166
Greetings, Luang Pee.
I'm with the abbot of Nua Temple,

941
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,208
He is the oldest monk around here,

942
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:02,166
and he knows about the ancient arch
at our temple.

943
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,958
You need to come here, Luang Pee.

944
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,208
I don't know

945
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:13,166
how it happened.

946
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,208
The fact that he is still here

947
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,000
means he's holding a grudge.

948
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:22,291
Who is he?

949
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:26,875
Luang Pee.

950
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,708
Luang Pu seems tired.

951
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,708
Let me ask you one last question.

952
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:37,833
Okay.

953
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:42,166
Do you know how to revoke the curse?

954
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:48,666
He was born with a grudge.

955
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:52,625
You have to make him let go
of that grudge.

956
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,000
There was a plague.

957
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,916
All villagers and monks

958
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,541
had to evacuate.

959
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,916
SMALLPOX

960
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:24,125
SMALLPOX - AN ANCIENT PANDEMIC

961
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,166
HOW TO CURE SMALLPOX

962
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,416
BAIWAN

963
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:51,000
How old is he?

964
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,833
He's two years old.

965
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:04,250
-Is he my son?
-I'm here to say goodbye.

966
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm moving abroad.

967
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,625
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

968
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,125
BAIWAN

969
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:06,916
Why are you all lying here?

970
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:10,750
Kid!

971
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:11,958
Kid!

972
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:14,458
Kid!

973
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,375
Kid, wait for me.

974
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,458
-Hey.
-Mister.

975
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:27,750
Get the kid some medicine.
He's in bad shape.

976
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,375
Shit. Are they all dead?

977
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:32,708
First!

978
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,250
Kid!

979
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:40,833
What the hell?

980
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,625
Are you all dying?

981
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:51,958
Fuck.

982
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,666
Luang Pee.

983
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:58,958
Luang Pee.

984
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,250
Please help my mother.

985
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:12,000
Sir.

986
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:14,583
We have no more space. Go somewhere else.

987
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,083
Can't you take one more?

988
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,375
I said we have no more space.

989
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,875
What's all the racket about?

990
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,750
Luang Ta. Please.

991
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,416
Follow me to my residence.

992
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,416
But…

993
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,583
Bring some medicine too.

994
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,625
Come with me.

995
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:43,375
Yes, sir.

996
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:53,458
Venerable Monk.

997
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,291
First. Ball…

998
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,916
No, I'm Balloon.

999
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,000
Why are you so hideous?

1000
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,375
Why are you walking towards me? Fuck off.

1001
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,666
According to First,

1002
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:02,416
Pee Nak has a Naga Prok pendant
around his neck.

1003
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:05,125
His corpse must have one too.

1004
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,041
Our second clue 

1005
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,666
is the pictures of Luang Loong

1006
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,458
when he found the pendant
at the ancient arch.

1007
01:16:14,791 --> 01:16:15,916
That means…

1008
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,458
Pee Nak's body must be there.

1009
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,458
We have to find the ancient arch.

1010
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:47,583
It's all trees.

1011
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,916
Do you think it's been torn down?

1012
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:52,916
I don't think so.

1013
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,791
Luang Pu would have told us.

1014
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,708
He might have forgotten.

1015
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,875
It might be hidden in the woods.

1016
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:05,916
Where?

1017
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,500
It's the whole arch we're talking about.

1018
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,000
Where would you hide it?

1019
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,583
In a tree?

1020
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,958
I've only seen anthills so far.

1021
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,583
I think it should be…

1022
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,833
Luang Por.

1023
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,583
Right here.

1024
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:54,208
Why would Pee Nak hurt people?

1025
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,333
Balloon!

1026
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,208
Balloon.

1027
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,000
Balloon.

1028
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,458
Balloon.

1029
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,875
First. Is he possessed?

1030
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,458
-Possessed?
-Yes.

1031
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:41,583
Balloon.

1032
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,500
Where's the amulet?

1033
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,500
-Do you mean this?
-Ghosts are scared of amulets.

1034
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,958
-Hurry.
-Balloon.

1035
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:52,750
Balloon.

1036
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,083
Why are you hurting people?

1037
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:02,333
Luang Por.

1038
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,500
I'm out of here!

1039
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,083
What the hell is happening?

1040
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:22,583
Balloon.

1041
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,250
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

1042
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:28,666
Balloon.

1043
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:30,208
Who are you?

1044
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:31,375
It's me, First.

1045
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,333
-Who are you?
-I'm Toh.

1046
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:35,666
Who am I?

1047
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,291
You are Balloon.

1048
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,916
I'm not. I'm out of here!

1049
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:44,833
What is it?

1050
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,958
My face looks like shit!

1051
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,291
What?

1052
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,916
-First.
-What?

1053
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,041
We need to see Monk Nong.

1054
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,958
-Calm down.
-Slow down.

1055
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,625
You need to calm down.

1056
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,416
First.

1057
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:08,208
What?

1058
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,458
Both of us

1059
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,000
shared our past lives with Pee Nak.

1060
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,083
Bullshit, Balloon.

1061
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,083
First.

1062
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,291
Luang Pee.

1063
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,166
Wait for me, Aod.

1064
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:50,583
Stay out of this.

1065
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:52,875
They hurt me. They must die.

1066
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,416
Have you two finished talking?

1067
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:35,541
Is it over?

1068
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,625
He's retreating,

1069
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,083
but he still seems vengeful.

1070
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:44,541
Did you really talk to a ghost?

1071
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:55,958
I found his bones.

1072
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:57,666
Everyone.

1073
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,500
Find tools to help me dig.

1074
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,541
Go on.

1075
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,208
Okay.

1076
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,458
What is this cup doing here?

1077
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:16,666
Aod, come and give us a hand.

1078
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,958
-Novice, come help us.
-Aod.

1079
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:25,291
Everyone, get out of the way!

1080
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:27,833
Move!

1081
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,375
Mr. Toh.

1082
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,916
What is this?

1083
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,250
What is going on?

1084
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,208
Hey.

1085
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:06,958
Are you clearing out the graveyard?

1086
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,958
Is this considered normal?

1087
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,666
Since you came here,

1088
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:15,875
everything has become normal.

1089
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,500
But one thing is not.

1090
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:23,958
Everybody.

1091
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:27,125
Listen to Balloon.
He is not lying this time.

1092
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,375
Go on.

1093
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:34,250
That day, when I got…

1094
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,916
You need to be polite around clergymen.

1095
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,916
Venerable Father, on the day that I…

1096
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,083
I…

1097
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:43,666
I'm not good at this.

1098
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,000
What's wrong?

1099
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,208
Let me talk normally, Luang Pee.

1100
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:49,500
-Pardon my language.
-Okay.

1101
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:51,916
On the day I got thrown,

1102
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,416
I couldn't remember how I passed out,

1103
01:23:54,541 --> 01:23:56,583
but I didn't wake up in the hospital.

1104
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,000
-Where were you?
-Bitch, it was like

1105
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,875
a temple hall. I started walking.

1106
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,666
I came outside,
and I saw millions of ghosts.

1107
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,625
There were millions of them.
This was just the first group.

1108
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,833
Right?

1109
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:09,166
You weren't there.

1110
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,875
All of them looked like toad queens.

1111
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:14,291
Their skin was all bumpy.

1112
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,375
I told them to stay away from me.
I had this superpower.

1113
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,625
I kept walking, and I saw monks.

1114
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:23,083
An old monk turned around, and I went…

1115
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:28,166
-Not there. Right here.
-Here.

1116
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,750
I was shocked.

1117
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:32,333
They turned out to be you and me, First.

1118
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:35,041
But we were old!

1119
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,083
You look terrible as an old man.

1120
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:38,041
That's right.

1121
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:39,583
You weren't there.

1122
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,625
-What?
-You weren't there.

1123
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,083
I'm being scared.

1124
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,125
I was at an old arch.

1125
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,083
-Were you in The Siam Renaissance?
-No.

1126
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:52,083
I saw him walking…

1127
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,708
I saw ghosts.

1128
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,166
It was Pee Nak, Luang Pee.

1129
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,791
But we still don't know

1130
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:03,291
what causes Pee Nak to be so vengeful.

1131
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:05,708
From what I just heard,

1132
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,875
I think it has something to do
with you two, Balloon and First.

1133
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:15,375
Then Pee Nak might not want anything
from Min-Jun.

1134
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:20,875
This is totally on us.

1135
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,333
-Everyone.
-Balloon.

1136
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:25,333
-Balloon.
-First.

1137
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:27,333
-First.
-What's the matter?

1138
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,875
-First.
-Wake up.

1139
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:31,500
-Balloon.
-Balloon. First.

1140
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,000
Everyone, we need to cremate
Pee Nak's bones.

1141
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:35,916
Let's go.

1142
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,416
Yes, sir.

1143
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:39,375
Novice.

1144
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:43,083
Jook and Klae, prepare food for Luang Ta

1145
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:44,833
and meet me early today.

1146
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:46,958
-Yes, sir.
-Luang Ta.

1147
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:55,666
You shouldn't have let them stay here.

1148
01:25:56,416 --> 01:26:00,500
You might end up contracting the disease.

1149
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,708
That's right.

1150
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,708
Besides, you haven't been feeling well.

1151
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:13,333
We are monks. People rely on us.

1152
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:18,333
When they need help, how can I do nothing?

1153
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:28,083
I really look shitty like you said.

1154
01:26:28,166 --> 01:26:30,000
First, that's Luang Ta.

1155
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,833
You look worse than him.
That's you right there.

1156
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:44,041
Lotus flowers.

1157
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:46,041
You can have them.

1158
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:49,041
Give them as offerings to the Buddha.

1159
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,958
Here.

1160
01:26:58,166 --> 01:26:59,250
Here, Mom.

1161
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,041
Ordain.

1162
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,875
Ordain.

1163
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,791
Luang Ta.

1164
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:32,666
I promised my mom
I would be ordained for her.

1165
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,666
Can you please

1166
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:40,875
ordain me?

1167
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:51,958
Please, Luang Ta.

1168
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:27,208
Do you know about the Naga Prok myth?

1169
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,625
Legend has it 

1170
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:45,833
that Mucalinda Naga,

1171
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:51,875
a powerful being of the underwater world,

1172
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:56,958
lived in a grand lotus pond

1173
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:02,125
where the Buddha

1174
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:07,250
remained in meditation
after attaining enlightenment.

1175
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:13,791
Then it started to rain
for seven days straight.

1176
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,125
Mucalinda Naga

1177
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:22,166
admired the Buddha's virtue and morality,

1178
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,791
so he coiled himself

1179
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:31,375
and spread his hood

1180
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:36,041
to protect the Buddha

1181
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:39,291
from the wind and the rain.

1182
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:46,791
Mucalinda Naga was the mighty

1183
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:49,500
serpent king.

1184
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:52,833
With his faith in virtue,

1185
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:57,791
he offered himself

1186
01:29:57,958 --> 01:30:03,916
to protect the Buddha
against the elements.

1187
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,958
This great merit

1188
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:13,541
helped him to become enlightened later on.

1189
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:20,041
You can do it too.

1190
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:25,500
Nak Son.

1191
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:32,166
It's great that you want to be ordained
for your mother.

1192
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,333
But remember this.

1193
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:39,708
If you hold onto self-entitlement

1194
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:44,333
and harm those who make you suffer,

1195
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:47,208
it will lead you to ruin,

1196
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,541
and you shall never be reborn.

1197
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:54,958
Remember my words, Nak Son.

1198
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,333
And all of you as well.

1199
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,750
If you keep thinking
you are better than others

1200
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,250
and think only about yourselves,

1201
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:17,875
the whole world will become your enemy.

1202
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:19,875
-Luang Ta.
-Hey.

1203
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,583
Luang Ta.

1204
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,125
You should go rest inside.

1205
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:27,208
Luang Ta.

1206
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,083
Luang Ta.

1207
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Luang Ta.

1208
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:38,166
Luang Ta!

1209
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:40,833
Luang Ta!

1210
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,125
Hey.

1211
01:31:48,833 --> 01:31:50,166
We can't stay here, Monk Thong.

1212
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,208
Luang Ta.

1213
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:52,541
We need to leave.

1214
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,083
Wait, Luang Pee.

1215
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:55,333
I'm begging you.

1216
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:56,666
Please ordain me.

1217
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,166
I want to dedicate the merit
of my ordination to my mom.

1218
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,083
Please, Luang Pee.

1219
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:04,833
-Please.
-Nak Son.

1220
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:06,000
-You asshole.
-I beg you.

1221
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,000
-Please ordain me.
-Nak Son.

1222
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:10,208
-Please, Luang Pee.
-Nak Son.

1223
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,458
-Hey!
-Stop it!

1224
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:13,416
-Please, Luang Pee.
-Stop! Move!

1225
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:20,458
Do you want the yellow robe for your mom?

1226
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:24,791
Yes, Luang Pee.

1227
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:26,916
Fine.

1228
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,333
Here.

1229
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:36,166
-Let's go.
-Wait.

1230
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,583
-Hey.
-Wait, Luang Pee.

1231
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:39,500
-Please ordain me.
-What now?

1232
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:41,583
-Ordain me.
-Let me go!

1233
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:51,541
Mom.

1234
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:56,375
Mom.

1235
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,583
Mom.

1236
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:01,625
I'm sorry.

1237
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:08,333
I'm sorry.

1238
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:23,625
Take this as an offering, Mom.

1239
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:41,041
I love you, Mom.

1240
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,500
Do you hear me?

1241
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,166
I renounce my ordination.

1242
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,875
I'm sorry.

1243
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,833
-May you all keep in mind
-I'm sorry, Mom.

1244
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,166
that I am a layman.

1245
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,166
You must conduct a funeral for my mom.

1246
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:07,208
Can't you see

1247
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,708
we aren't monks anymore?

1248
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:12,583
You bastards.
You disrespected my mom.

1249
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:15,250
-You must die.
-Hey.

1250
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,250
You son of a bitch!

1251
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:23,375
I let your mom have the yellow robe,
just as she wished.

1252
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,041
You disrobed, so you must die.

1253
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,416
Let's go.

1254
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:36,208
Jook. Klae. Take the boat out.

1255
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:29,666
You disrobed and left us to die.

1256
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:37,833
May those who get ordained at this temple

1257
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,041
never disrobe.

1258
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:41,875
Those who do...

1259
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:45,208
must die!

1260
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:49,000
Look.

1261
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:55,166
This Naga Prok pendant

1262
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:58,583
is the one Luang Loong gave to Monk Nong.

1263
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:03,583
It actually belongs to Nak Son.

1264
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:10,208
It's the reason we ended up here.

1265
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:18,208
What grave sin did we ever commit?

1266
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,208
I understand now

1267
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:35,958
why you had to make a vow here.

1268
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:40,791
We were destined to be ordained here.

1269
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:46,166
We are cursed to die

1270
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,291
whether we get ordained or disrobe.

1271
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,583
I get it now.

1272
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:57,791
Balloon.

1273
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,416
I'm scared.

1274
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:02,708
Balloon.

1275
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:08,083
First.

1276
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:09,833
First.

1277
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:12,083
First.

1278
01:38:13,041 --> 01:38:13,875
Look.

1279
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:15,166
Lotus flowers.

1280
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:17,125
It's hot. Help.

1281
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:21,541
This is the crematorium.

1282
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:22,708
-Help!
-We're screwed.

1283
01:38:23,125 --> 01:38:25,625
Come on.

1284
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,208
-Hurry.
-Burn everything.

1285
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:30,166
Bring it over here.

1286
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,250
Where are my glasses?

1287
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:39,791
They're here.

1288
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:43,916
Look, First.

1289
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:47,750
Nak Son.

1290
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:50,583
-Stay back.
-Get away from us.

1291
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:53,041
-Stay back.
-Get back.

1292
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:54,500
We need to run.

1293
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:55,416
Get away.

1294
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,458
-Don't come closer.
-Luang Pee!

1295
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,458
Luang Pee!

1296
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:35,208
Luang Pee!

1297
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:08,958
-Don't hurt us!
-Luang Pee!

1298
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,541
-Luang Pee!
-I'm scared.

1299
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:23,333
Luang Pee!

1300
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:34,916
Luang Pee!

1301
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,833
Luang Pee!

1302
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,000
Where are you going, Balloon?

1303
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:43,125
-Luang Pee.
-Stay with us.

1304
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:46,166
Why did you help them?

1305
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,208
Nak Son.

1306
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:52,750
Please do this for me.

1307
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:56,541
Let's all forgive and forget.

1308
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,166
Your vengeance

1309
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:02,500
is like the fire that's burning you.

1310
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:05,291
Don't let that fire

1311
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:07,708
consume your heart.

1312
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,666
I'm not scared

1313
01:41:13,625 --> 01:41:14,916
even if hellfire

1314
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:17,541
consumes my whole body.

1315
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:21,000
Luang Pee.

1316
01:41:26,416 --> 01:41:28,000
I will drag them to hell.

1317
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:34,291
Please forgive us.

1318
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:37,458
We did wrong.

1319
01:41:37,916 --> 01:41:39,541
You ran away to save yourselves.

1320
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:43,416
You left my mom to die.

1321
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:50,791
We feel guilty about what we did.

1322
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,416
We didn't know

1323
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,708
how evil we were in the past,

1324
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,708
but that was a long time ago.

1325
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:07,458
Please give us a chance in this life.

1326
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,500
Please forgive us.

1327
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:17,250
You are lucky

1328
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,083
that Luang Ta is still protecting you.

1329
01:42:22,291 --> 01:42:24,083
Otherwise, you would be dead.

1330
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:42,333
Luang Ta.

1331
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,875
You have always been kind to me.

1332
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:50,708
In any lifetime,

1333
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,500
you are always good to me.

1334
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,083
Nak Son.

1335
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:08,083
Your mom died...

1336
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,208
because her time was up.

1337
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,666
It is nobody's fault.

1338
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:22,708
I also died of illness.

1339
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,166
It's karma.

1340
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:33,416
If you hold onto self-entitlement

1341
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:38,166
and harm those who make you suffer,

1342
01:43:39,708 --> 01:43:41,500
it will lead you to ruin,

1343
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:44,375
and you shall never be reborn.

1344
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:48,541
Remember my words, Nak Son.

1345
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:33,958
Did you forget the Naga Prok pendant
that I gave you?

1346
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:39,708
If you keep thinking
you are better than others

1347
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:43,166
and think only about yourselves,

1348
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:48,375
the whole world will become your enemy.

1349
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:50,583
Nak Son.

1350
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:54,375
I take your teaching to heart.

1351
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:57,041
I haven't forgotten.

1352
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:03,166
But I'm so enraged.

1353
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,291
If so,

1354
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:13,083
maybe you can do this for my sake.

1355
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:16,208
Let go of this rage

1356
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:19,583
and dedicate this good karma

1357
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:22,666
to yourself and your mom.

1358
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,958
Let go of your grudge against them.

1359
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:28,125
Their karma

1360
01:45:28,958 --> 01:45:30,958
will catch up to them when it's time.

1361
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:50,791
I forgive those who have wronged me

1362
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,250
for Luang Ta.

1363
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,416
I forgive you.

1364
01:46:13,375 --> 01:46:14,625
I must bid you farewell.

1365
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:38,583
People can die just like that
when their time comes.

1366
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:41,250
We can die at any time.

1367
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:43,541
No one knows the future,

1368
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:45,916
so it's important
that we prepare ourselves

1369
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:48,875
by doing good deeds
and thinking good thoughts.

1370
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:53,125
We should help as many people
as we can before we die.

1371
01:46:53,916 --> 01:46:56,041
Most people always put themselves first,

1372
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,041
but Luang Ta

1373
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,083
put other people's lives

1374
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:03,333
before his own.

1375
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:07,333
That's why he was always willing
to help everyone

1376
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:09,875
without thinking about himself.

1377
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:14,333
Pee Nak saw that
and decided to let go of his grudge.

1378
01:47:15,333 --> 01:47:19,125
Giving is truly the greatest form of love.

1379
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:22,208
Luang Pee.

1380
01:47:22,708 --> 01:47:24,833
When your ex came to see you,

1381
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:26,875
did you ever think of disrobing?

1382
01:47:28,166 --> 01:47:30,083
For a brief moment, I did.

1383
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:32,291
But when I thought it through,

1384
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:35,875
I wondered if disrobing
would make me happy.

1385
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,416
Would Baiwan be happy?

1386
01:47:40,333 --> 01:47:41,750
What I know for sure 

1387
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:44,041
is she seems happy

1388
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:46,166
that I became a monk.

1389
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:48,500
So I chose that happiness.

1390
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:51,208
I understand now

1391
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:54,291
how we can find that happiness

1392
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:57,875
and how to return true happiness

1393
01:47:58,458 --> 01:48:00,125
to the people around us.

1394
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:09,750
Sadhu.

1395
01:48:10,125 --> 01:48:12,958
May your soul rest in peace, Son.

1396
01:48:13,416 --> 01:48:16,333
You can stop hurting us

1397
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:18,500
and let go of your grudge against us now.

1398
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:19,916
Listen.

1399
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:24,083
Vengeful spirits aren't bad people
who try to hurt us.

1400
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,291
They are good people

1401
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:31,166
who got hurt in the past
by sinners like us.

1402
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:34,250
That's so wise, Luang Pee.

1403
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:36,583
-I got it from the Internet.
-Jeez.

1404
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:40,833
Aod.

1405
01:48:41,916 --> 01:48:42,958
Take it back.

1406
01:48:49,375 --> 01:48:50,625
Are we doing this again?

1407
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:53,500
Jay.

1408
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:56,291
No, thanks. I prefer Phra Somdej amulets.

1409
01:48:58,541 --> 01:48:59,625
Fahlan.

1410
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:02,208
It's okay. I have my Luang Pu Kem amulet.

1411
01:49:02,458 --> 01:49:03,375
Novice Kiddee.

1412
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:04,958
No.

1413
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:14,875
-Novice Nott.
-I'd rather not.

1414
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:17,500
I think we're safe now, Aod.

1415
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:21,125
Pee Nak has let go of his grudge.
You should keep it.

1416
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:24,625
All right.

1417
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:33,125
By the way,

1418
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,750
you didn't see me in the past, right?

1419
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:37,375
Why? Do you always want to be with me?

1420
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:41,041
I'm just asking.
Who would want to be with you?

1421
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:43,125
Aod, you have a crush on me.

1422
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:44,583
Tell everyone what you told me.

1423
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:45,625
Is that right?

1424
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:48,416
I saw it with my own eyes.
You gave him a look, Aod.

1425
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,250
How confident!

1426
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:51,833
Aod.

1427
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,958
Punch him. Let him have it.

1428
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:55,166
Punch him.

1429
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:06,166
Is he still selling ice-cream?

1430
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:09,291
Is it him?

1431
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:48,291
-Jook. Klae.
-Yes, sir.

1432
01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:49,625
Take the boat out.

1433
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:51,041
Yes, sir.

1434
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:51,958
Hey.

1435
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,250
Did you steal from a corpse again?

1436
01:50:54,416 --> 01:50:56,375
-No, we didn't.
-We didn't.

1437
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:57,958
Hurry up.

1438
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:24,208
I undertake the precept to refrain

1439
01:51:24,625 --> 01:51:30,958
from taking that which is not given.

1440
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:47,875
I spent yesterday fulfilling my vow.

1441
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:50,250
Chickens and offerings didn't seem enough.

1442
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,166
Sadhu.

1443
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,583
I want to go all out for Monk Min-Jun,

1444
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:56,875
so I hired dancers to perform.

1445
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:58,875
They're probably setting up the stage.

1446
01:52:00,333 --> 01:52:03,666
Wait. Can you set up a stage
at Pee Nak Shrine?

1447
01:52:03,833 --> 01:52:06,666
Of course. It's a big stage.

1448
01:52:07,125 --> 01:52:09,541
Anyway, what is Pee Nak Shrine?

1449
01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:11,666
Didn't you pray at the shrine out front?

1450
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:14,166
I made a vow to a red shrine.

1451
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:17,708
Please make my Min-Jun a global superstar

1452
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:19,875
who is known all over the world.

1453
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:22,625
What? That's a spirit house.

1454
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:25,166
Mom, you prayed at the wrong shrine.

1455
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:27,958
Hey.

1456
01:52:28,166 --> 01:52:29,541
He's wearing a yellow robe.

1457
01:52:29,625 --> 01:52:31,375
It's not a yellow robe. Let's go again.

1458
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,875
He's wearing a nak's robe.

1459
01:52:34,666 --> 01:52:36,125
Cut.

1460
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,250
Shit.

1461
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,875
Aim, look.

1462
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:47,375
It got in my mouth.

1463
01:52:48,916 --> 01:52:50,583
Come on, Novice.

1464
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:53,500
It's open.

1465
01:52:53,583 --> 01:52:54,416
It's open.

1466
01:52:54,916 --> 01:52:56,166
Why is it open?

1467
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,833
Are you hurt, Pat?

1468
01:53:02,375 --> 01:53:03,583
Are you hurt?

1469
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:08,458
First.

1470
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:11,791
-Sorry.
-I'm going to faint.

1471
01:53:12,666 --> 01:53:13,666
I have an inhaler.

1472
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,416
-Why am I staggering?
-Relax.

1473
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,000
Take a deep breath.

1474
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,666
-You should be ordained.
-Butt out.

1475
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:22,458
-"Disrobe."
-Disrobe.

1476
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:23,416
Disrobe.

1477
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,750
Look more fierce.

1478
01:53:25,916 --> 01:53:26,791
Luang Pee.

1479
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:28,208
Cut.

1480
01:53:28,291 --> 01:53:29,625
Cut.

1481
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:32,166
He's not playing along with us.

1482
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:35,416
-Don't mess around.
-Mr. Toh, come here.

1483
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:37,000
Be careful.

1484
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:42,333
-Mr. Toh!
-He's mine.

1485
01:53:44,666 --> 01:53:46,625
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1486
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:48,083
-What?
-Sangkham…

1487
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:49,416
Luang Pee is going to…

1488
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,041
Sorry.

1489
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:00,750
-Luang Pee.
-What's that?

1490
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:04,000
I have the boys…

1491
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:05,458
Don't laugh.

1492
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:07,125
What's so funny about boys?

1493
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:12,208
