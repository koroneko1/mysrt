1
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,879
Tell me again what her message was.

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,320
"Is that all you have to tell me,
as though last night never happened?"

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,559
So, you still smelled of her, you bastard.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,079
-Guzmán!
-Let me tell you something.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,759
You're a goddamn liar.

6
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,320
You pretend that you're a good dude,
that you're my friend,

7
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,520
but, of course, you have no goddamn idea
what being a friend means, do you?

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm not gonna punch you here
'cause we're in a restaurant.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,359
What's with the look?

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,840
Is this you sticking your neck out?

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,680
Guzmán. Guzmán. Guzmán!

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,480
Look, this isn't a competition for me
or just a fucking whim, okay?

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,760
You're my friend, above all.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,280
The last thing I want
is to hurt you or fuck you over.

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,359
Let me make something clear.

16
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,519
Listening?

17
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,799
You go to hell!

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,640
You get that?

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,200
-Okay, listen--
-You seriously need to shut the fuck up.

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,439
THE MESS YOU LEAVE BEHIND

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,040
-I'm finally gonna read it.
-I only gave it to you a year ago, man.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,640
Sure, but now I'll finally have time.

23
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,879
You know what?
I think I might go with you.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
You serious?

25
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,159
I don't know why I'm here, honestly.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
You shouldn't have stayed this long.
You should've left when you wanted.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,479
Well, I had my reasons.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,479
-That one-track mind.
-Such a dipshit.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,639
I love seein' the two of you together.

30
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,280
Even if it's to say goodbye.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,599
You're telling the principal
and your classmates today?

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,719
Yeah.

33
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
You're leaving halfway through the year?
Can't you wait until the summer?

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,719
But this summer,
who knows where I'll be? Life's short.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,599
Ander. Oh.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, enough. Stop. C'mon.
You said you'd be supportive.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,039
Of course I am. But let me have my moment
to play the suffering mother.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,439
C'mon. Off you go.

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,520
-Ciao.
-See ya.

40
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

41
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,719
Yeah. She really is pretty.

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,400
To be honest, this year,
I'm really looking forward to a vacation.

43
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,599
I've always liked
spending time with my family.

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,199
-For the holidays, we're gonna go away…
-Ari? Ari, I need to talk to you.

45
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,319
Me? About what?

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Your sister won't listen to me,
but I thought you would.

47
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,680
So, you're trying to solve
your personal issues

48
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,280
with me as the middleman?

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Merry Christmas, Rebeka.

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
-I need your help.
-Well--

51
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,120
I'll be right back.

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,439
Look, hon, my best advice
is that you forget about my sister.

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,600
You can avoid some sleepless nights,
I assure you.

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,639
Great, so she has to stay
with that sleazy old man

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,839
because you won't help her?

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
What old man? Armando?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Sweetheart, Armando and her
are just friends. Why are you interfering?

58
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,519
Are you crazy or just jealous?

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Yeah, they're great pals.
Did she tell you how they first met?

60
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,279
-Having drinks, you mean?
-Expensive drinks.

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
Maybe too expensive.

62
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,480
What?

63
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,319
Look, Ari,
I'm not telling you this about Mencía

64
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,360
out of spite or to try to get her back,

65
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,160
'cause I know this means
I'll probably lose her forever.

66
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,639
I'm telling this to you
in case you can help her,

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,680
'cause she won't let me.

68
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,720
-Just one second--
-No. Get out.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
-But… But let me--
-I said no. Don't. You're too close.

70
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,920
Let me explain myself.

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Outside, where there are cameras.
You're a fan of those, aren't you?

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,639
I had no intention of upsetting you, okay?

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
We were partying,
and we had a lot to drink, you know?

74
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
Yeah. And that's no excuse, Phillipe.

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,279
Cayetana, come on.
Don't act like it's so surprising

76
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
I misinterpreted your signals.

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,319
Exactly which signals
did you misinterpret?

78
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,519
Because I sent plenty,
and none of them were mixed.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't know,
but we were making out, and--

80
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,839
And I told you the fact
that we were making out is no excuse.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,040
I told you no more than once, Phillipe.

82
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,279
Would those be the signals
you might have misinterpreted?

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Because you only got the picture
when I bolted out of your limousine.

84
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,519
Caye…

85
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,560
I really am sorry.

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Fuck no. Just fucking ignore her.

88
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,439
She made all this up
because she's upset with me. That's all.

89
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,000
She's upset, but I don't see her
pulling this out of thin air.

90
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,079
Ari, please. Just ignore her.

91
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,120
Mencía, are you sure?

92
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,079
Get your nose
out of my business, all right?

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
Mencía.

94
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Babe, listen.

95
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,199
Um, whatever might be going on
with Armando or whoever it is--

96
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,720
It's my fucking problem,
and I can handle my own shit.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,839
Stop, Mencía, you say that all the time.

98
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,639
And in the end, all you accomplish
is leave a mess in your wake

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,879
the rest of us get stuck taking care of.

100
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,240
Trust your family a bit more.
Give us some damn credit.

101
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,560
-Maybe we should tell Dad about it.
-No way.

102
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,319
For once, can you stop being mad
at Dad and everyone else?

103
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,240
No, not a fucking word to Benjamín.
I mean it.

104
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,959
Do you not realize Dad can fix any problem
with the snap of a finger?

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,279
I said no, Ari!

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,879
Not a thing to him, Patrick, any of them.

107
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,839
I'm dead serious right now, Ari.
If you say a single word to Benjamín,

108
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,319
I promise you'll never see me ever again.
Do you fucking understand me?

109
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,199
I've done everything possible
to try to forget about you.

110
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,519
But I realized it's useless
because I can't.

111
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,279
It's absurd, but I love you.

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,839
I can't forgive myself
for giving up on you 'cause I never have.

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,639
Not even when I thought you were dying.

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,279
So, I'm not gonna start now.

115
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,480
Giving up on you, I mean.

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,839
And if you're open to it,
I'd like to give us another shot.

117
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Ander, what are you thinking?

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Look, you almost went
to New York with Malick.

119
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,959
And you stayed here because of me.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,079
Don't you wonder where you'd be
if only you'd been true to yourself?

121
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,600
Except I didn't stay here for you.
I stayed here for me.

122
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,200
I can only see a life if it's with you.

123
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,600
I want us to be together.

124
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,360
But if you…
I get it if you don't want that.

125
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,639
I… I won't make a big deal of it
and hold it against you or anything.

126
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,399
I'll respect your answer.

127
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,519
I'd better leave you alone.

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
BEFORE I GO: OMAR

129
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,639
Omar, wait.

130
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Come in.

131
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,000
Excuse me. You wanted to see me, sir?

132
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,799
Benjamín, would you give us a moment?

133
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,360
I know
that you're trying to defend your son.

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,639
No matter what gender theories
or passing fads may say,

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,679
every man is naturally born with

136
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,759
a biological type of hardwiring.

137
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,120
And we women have the capacity to tame it.

138
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
And that is… a gift.
It's uniquely powerful.

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,039
There's no need
to beat your head against a wall,

140
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
trying to change that reality.

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,039
Forget about his history
with these girls, Cayetana.

142
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,240
And about any nasty rumors
you may have heard about Phillipe.

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,639
Because my son has chosen you.

144
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,159
Above everything.

145
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
And everyone.

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,679
Do you realize how many things
will no longer be a problem

147
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,279
for you or your family?

148
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,679
Countless.

149
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Don't be stupid.

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,240
Don't refuse this gift
that life has graciously handed you.

151
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,159
Cayetana,

152
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,159
I would love it if you came
to the New Year's Eve party with Phillipe.

153
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,440
DECEMBER 31

154
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,559
Ah! Don't you look
like a handsome little gentleman!

155
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,519
Come in. Ander's in the shower.

156
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,200
We have, like, a million plans together
for after graduation.

157
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,240
We deserve it.

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,080
You mind if I ask you a personal question?

159
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,840
Yeah?

160
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,480
Go for it.

161
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,600
Why'd you reunite?

162
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,120
Well, because we love each other.
I mean, obviously.

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,720
But that's not enough, though.

164
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,879
I love my ex a lot.

165
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
I mean, he's Ander's dad.
I'll never quit loving him,

166
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,720
but you need to have a shared purpose
in your relationship.

167
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,919
I don't mean a house
with kids running around.

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
I'm not that crazy.

169
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,639
But you do have to be on the same page
about what you want.

170
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,080
Wait a minute. I just told you
that we both have a million plans.

171
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,320
-That it's, uh--
-You both have? Or just you?

172
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,639
He's staying again for you.

173
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't force him before,
and I'm not forcing him now.

174
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,799
In fact, I told him that
if he didn't want to get back together,

175
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,960
I'd accept it.

176
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Omar.

177
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
What's the matter?

178
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,519
Wow.

179
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,120
You look great.

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,559
If you'll excuse me.

181
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,399
-Hey. How are you?
-Hey. Great.

182
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,039
-Hey.
-Hey.

183
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,279
You look incredible.

184
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,000
Thanks.

185
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,799
Ah.

186
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,799
Ah. This is your moment.

187
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,759
Be sure to enjoy it.

188
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,720
Excuse me.

189
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,000
Your son's impulsiveness

190
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,240
isn't really a matter of biology,
Your Highness.

191
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
It's a matter of education.

192
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,480
Fuck 'em, right?

193
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
What do you intend to do?

194
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,279
I organized this to celebrate
the New Year with my guests.

195
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,879
And Cayetana is my guest in her own right.

196
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
As a friend and as a designer.

197
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,039
You are a fool

198
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,879
and an ingrate.

199
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,279
And whose fault is it?

200
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,559
Who raised me this way?

201
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,279
Phillipe…

202
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,759
I brought you into this world.

203
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,399
I raised you.

204
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,559
I never took my eyes off you,

205
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,480
except when it was better
to look the other way.

206
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
Something that happened quite often.

207
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,919
My role has been to love and protect you,
and I have done that impeccably.

208
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,159
If now, all of a sudden,

209
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
you want to be an adult
and walk on alone, do it.

210
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,200
Accept the consequences of your choices.

211
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,480
Ari, calm down, girl.
We all know how you get when you drink.

212
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't "get" any way
because I'm barely a drinker.

213
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,480
Well, now we've gone
from "never" to "barely."

214
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,200
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

215
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,879
Go talk to her.

216
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,360
I'll pass.

217
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
Then wallow in your pride,
and see how well that works out.

218
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
Yeah, spare me the lecture.

219
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,759
You were gonna go travel, and yet again,
you bowed down to Omar.

220
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,319
-Well, I'll go… eventually.
-A little word of advice?

221
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,519
Don't give up things for others,
'cause they won't do the same for you.

222
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,680
Feel me?

223
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,960
Look at Nadia. Chose her future over me.

224
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,599
But I kept pursuing her
like a real dickhead.

225
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,799
What about Ari?

226
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,039
What about Ari?

227
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,519
Honestly, you're still angry
that Nadia prioritized her future

228
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,759
over staying with you.

229
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,599
Whereas Ari wants you in her life,
and you threw that away.

230
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,880
Look, Ari's one thing,
Nadia's another, all right?

231
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,799
Ari loves me and Samuel and the football
and basketball team, probably.

232
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Okay? They're two different things.

233
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,480
Look, you've told me millions of times

234
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,000
that you'd love a relationship
like the one I have with Omar.

235
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,880
Well, this is how our relationship works.
Compromise, dude. We both have to.

236
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,599
Sure, she fucked up.

237
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,079
But do you really wanna lose Ari…
or Samuel?

238
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,680
I wouldn't wanna lose Omar over that.

239
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,839
Go talk to her. Come on.

240
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on.

241
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,839
Thanks a lot, handsome.

242
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

243
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,440
Nothing.

244
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,920
Have a minute?
It's impossible to talk in there.

245
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,519
No, thank you, honestly.

246
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't wanna finish the year
with an argument.

247
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,759
One minute. I promise.

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,240
This isn't really how I thought
I'd start the year either, you know.

249
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,759
With you and all that.

250
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,519
I never thought you'd fall
for someone like me, if I'm being honest.

251
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, well… you were clearly mistaken.

252
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
Was I mistaken, Ari?

253
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,400
Because that whole routine about
how you can't give me or Guzmán up

254
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,759
was the most cowardly possible way
to try and let either one of us down easy.

255
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,799
I know you love Guzmán.

256
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,559
Admit it. It's not that big a deal.

257
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,119
It makes perfect sense.
He's the rational choice.

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,640
But you must leave me alone if you care.

259
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,319
You're used to having
everything you want in life,

260
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
but that's not how it works.

261
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,640
You can't have everything.

262
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
But you gotta stop roping me in.

263
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,480
And don't tempt me every time
you wanna indulge some whim of yours.

264
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,759
Forget all about me.

265
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,079
For me,
it's not worth the damage we've done

266
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,839
and that we'll keep doing together.

267
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,079
Sorry. It's not worth it at all.

268
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,240
WHERE ARE YOU?

269
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I WANT TO START THE NEW YEAR WITH YOU.

270
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,039
I HAVE PLANS. I'M SORRY.

271
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,880
I KNOW. I'M HERE, IN YOUR PLANS.

272
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,079
All right, party people!
Seven minutes until the end of the year!

273
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,519
Let's go. Come on.

274
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,759
Even on Grindr, we introduce ourselves.

275
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,119
Patrick. A local but raised in London.
Versatile. More submissive.

276
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Coming or not?

277
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,359
I don't know what came over me
or what in the world I was thinking.

278
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.

279
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
Please come and hear me out.

280
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Is it me you're smiling at?

281
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,200
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

282
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,160
Should we end the year right?

283
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,359
Okay, what's the matter? I know you.

284
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,559
You had this plan to see the world.

285
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,000
You did.

286
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,039
And you put that plan
on hold for me twice.

287
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,319
Look, it was just an idea
I was tossing around. That's all.

288
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,759
-Leave.
-But I don't want to.

289
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm telling you, please.

290
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,160
Omar, I'm happy here with you.

291
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,440
I know,
and I have no doubts about that.

292
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,559
I'll feel better if you follow your dreams
and get out there.

293
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah. I really mean it.

294
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
If you want me to, I can wait.

295
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,359
We can see people on the side,

296
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
'cause I'm not my sister,
and you're not Guzmán.

297
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm happy if you're happy.

298
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:44,000
Rebeka,
how do I know you're not lying to me?

299
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,039
I just don't know. I can't be sure
if the thing with Armando's real or not.

300
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,480
If what you told me is true or not.

301
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,200
I have no way of knowing.

302
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,200
What I know for certain
is that Mencía told me

303
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,559
that if I do anything at all to help her,
like tattling to my dad,

304
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,400
she said she'd never see or speak to me.

305
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
I told you the truth, Ari.

306
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,000
That goddamn motherfucker.

307
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,480
What's the matter?

308
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,160
The fuck are you doing?

309
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,480
You made your way into my house
and my fucking relationship.

310
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,920
What more could you possibly want?

311
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
To spend New Year's Eve with you, Menci.

312
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,519
You don't get to call me Menci.
What's your deal?

313
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,680
You're fucking psychotic!

314
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,079
You better not call me psycho,
you little shit.

315
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,440
Rebe, this is dangerous.

316
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,160
Don't you get it? I always come back.

317
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
And if I know you need help,
even if you don't ask, I'll be there. See?

318
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,279
Mencía!

319
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,519
Guzmán.

320
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,160
I'd like to start the year
giving my friend a hug.

321
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,079
Forgive me, man. I swear,
Ari's got nothing to do with this.

322
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,799
Three minutes
until the end of the year!

323
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,039
That's why you were talking with her
by the lake now?

324
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,559
No, all I was doing--

325
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,599
Stop fucking lying to me, Samuel!

326
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,799
I don't care if my sister
won't tell the truth about you.

327
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
The fuck do you want?

328
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm telling my father everything, Armando.

329
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,880
And he'll snap his fingers
and fuck up your life forever.

330
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Because you're a disgusting,
rapey motherfucker.

331
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
And you're not gonna be able to fuck up
my sister's life

332
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:59,640
or anyone else's, because my family
will fuck up yours first.

333
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,759
-I'm gonna call my father.
-What'd you say?

334
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,640
I told you. I'm calling my father.

335
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,119
Give me the phone.

336
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,720
No.

337
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Hello?

338
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,720
Ari? Ari, can you hear me?

339
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,240
Help me… Dad!

340
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,759
Someone help!

341
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Elodie, I know it's probably
too late now, but…

342
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,319
forgive me.

343
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,559
-Asshole!
-You're a son of a bitch!

344
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,440
Now you have a voice message
from me admitting what I did.

345
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,960
Use it as you deem fit.

346
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,559
-I love you.
-I love you too.

347
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,240
You okay?

348
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,119
I'LL BE AT THE PIER
AFTER THE LAST BELL RINGS.

349
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,319
I don't know
what came over me or what I was thinking.

350
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,240
I'll meet you in half an hour
at the pier on the lake.

351
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,920
Please come and hear me out.

352
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,839
Hey!

353
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,079
Hey!

354
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,359
Ari!

355
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,960
Ari!

356
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,759
Ari.

357
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,640
Ari.

358
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,279
No, no, no, no, no. Ari.

359
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,200
Ari.

360
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,519
Are you all right? What'd he do to you?

361
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,279
What happened? Who is that guy?

362
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,319
Get him for me, Guzmán.

363
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,039
Okay. Okay.

364
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,200
Okay. You stay here.

365
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,839
You son of a bitch!

366
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,160
Motherfucker!

367
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey.

368
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,599
Have you seen Ari?

369
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,319
What happened?

370
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,680
You haven't seen her?

371
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,559
Oh God!

372
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,359
What's wrong?

373
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,000
What's wrong?

374
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,720
That fucking pig was blackmailing Mencía,
so he could keep abusing her.

375
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,960
And Ari found out because I told her.

376
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,039
-Fuck.
-It'll be all right.

377
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,359
The last time I saw her,
she was so out of it,

378
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,759
she probably went for him,
and that's why he beat her up.

379
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,279
But you can't feel guilty, Guzmán.
That guy's a son of a bitch.

380
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Call the police.
I wanna tell 'em what happened.

381
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,440
Okay, so we are gonna call the police,
but we're not gonna tell the whole story.

382
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,920
We're just gonna tell them
that Ari disappeared

383
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,119
and that we have no goddamn idea
where she is, kay?

384
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
Period.

385
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,839
And I don't confess what I've done?

386
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,559
Guzmán, I need you to tell me
what you saw here tonight.

387
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,239
The girl is alive.

388
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,960
I repeat, the girl is alive.

389
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,239
If you go to jail, your life is over.

390
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,159
Even when you get out.
I mean, look at my brother, man.

391
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,639
And your brother's innocent.

392
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,239
So are you, Guzmán.

393
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,239
Until they can prove it beyond a doubt,
okay? You're good.

394
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
He knocked me out and ran off.

395
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,880
I couldn't do anything.

396
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,119
Why didn't you wanna see me?

398
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,400
Because I was too embarrassed
to even look you in the eye

399
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,079
after what I did to you.

400
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,360
I honestly don't know
what got into me, Guzmán.

401
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,199
I mean, I swear I've never let my feelings
get the better of me before.

402
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,800
And I know you'll always be there for me,
and I wanna reciprocate that.

403
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,599
But Samuel's the one you love.

404
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,599
No. It's not that.

405
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,079
-I understand.
-No.

406
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
That message you sent to Samuel,

407
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,960
that's why I went
to the lake to look for you.

408
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,119
So you could tell me to my face, I guess.

409
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,119
But it's okay.

410
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,360
Forgive me for all the bad moments.

411
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I just hope
the good times outnumbered them.

412
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,599
Take care of yourself, Ari.

413
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,079
And just like that… we're done?

414
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,360
Goodbye.

415
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,039
Waiter.

416
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,679
Should've punched you harder, you bastard.

417
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,639
Take care of yourself, dude.

418
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,320
You made a worthy opponent, you know that?

419
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,679
Rebe.

420
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,519
Thanks for everything you did.

421
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,480
Don't say anything to Cayetana and Omar.

422
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,920
Jesus, I would never.
I'm not a snitch.

423
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,039
I love you.

424
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
Love you more.

425
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,440
Okay.

426
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,599
Equally?

427
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
Okay.

428
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,639
Well, everyone.

429
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,719
I'm sure gonna miss you.

430
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:25,880
Come in.

431
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,960
Any news from Armando?

432
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
Not a trace.

433
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
It's as if the earth
just kinda swallowed him up.

434
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,159
Well… maybe it's for the best.

435
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,400
Are you upset about that?

436
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,679
I'm actually more scared
he'll suddenly reappear at any moment.

437
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm gonna tell Dad about everything.

438
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,360
Because enough's enough.

439
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,840
It was my fault
we don't have a mom anymore.

440
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,440
It was my fault Patrick almost died.

441
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,519
And it's my fault, again,
that we almost lost you too.

442
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,639
Get that crap outta your head, Mencía.

443
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:19,280
You're not to blame for any of that.

444
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,880
-Okay?
-All right.

445
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
You know I'm never gonna believe it.

446
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,480
Come.

447
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,880
Hey, can you be there with me
when I tell Dad what happened?

448
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,079
Right by your side.
