00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What's up, Dao?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I know that I need to have dinner with Gam at home.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm not gonna bail on this, okay?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Whom should I invite to join the party?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What? In the end, Tum came back to date that Aongaoey bitch?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's right. Well, he hasn't been good enough for me anyway.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I think he's a good person that's why he could escape this from you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I see. Then I think Bank would be a good person too.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
He could escape you.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Is this Diao? A new creative staff from your team?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.500
That's right .

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I heard people talking that you're hot stuff.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I need to see if he lives up to the hype.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Hold that thought if you don't want to get cursed.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
He's even smarter mouth than me.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Even worse than you? He could compete with a barking dog?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But it's good, I like it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Diao? / Yes?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.000
My name is Manow. I'm an AE from URWISH.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.600
Nice to meet you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.600
I do!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He's just greeting you, not asking you for marriage.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
Stop flirting around. Lunch time is over.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.000
Wait. Can I see Mr. Darling first?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.000
Stop it! You can't mess with my Darling.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Stop flirting and go back to where you came from.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Wait.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If you're sleepy at work, and want some sour snacks.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You can have me. I'm sour like my name.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
How was it? Sour enough?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If Kanom is here,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
don't forget to let her know that I need to see her.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I want to know how was her vacation to Koh Chang with a boyfriend.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Sure. Go back to your desk already.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Go back to your desk! / Ouch.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Go back to your department!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Do you want to have dinner at my place? Dao will be cooking Wagyu steak.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.700
I don't eat beef.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Right. I forgot. Actually, she will be cooking pork steak.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't eat pork.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.600
What about dog steak?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Are you gonna cook a dog in your mouth for me?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm not available. I already have a date with someone.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You can ditch him and have dinner at my place instead.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.000
It's starting to get weird now.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.000
What's going on? Did Dao invite a girl for you again?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That's right.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I knew it!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Please, have dinner with me.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I don't want to have dinner with that girl alone.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I really wanna help you.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.000
But you know that it is super hard to call a man for a date.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This one is really my type. He can be my future children's father.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You don't even have an ovary.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I was just comparing that this was really important to me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
If you don't know whom to invite, why don't you invite Mr. Darling?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Rak? I don't think so.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
If he knows that I invite him to be a third wheel on this date,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
he would make fun of me for sure.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There's one more way. You could send a speed boat to pick up Kanom from Koh Chang,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.000
so she could join your date tonight.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Can you come up with something possible?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The most possible plan right now is to invite Mr. Darling.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If you're thinking about your face, then you should seduce him instead.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You're a creative staff. You need to use your brain, not your shoes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Mr. Rak?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Come on in.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You should say something. Or you don't want to walk home

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but would rather have me carried you home instead?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Nope. I have legs. I can get back home by myself.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Are you free this evening?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500
Why? You're gonna hit on me?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I was just wondering if you're free tonight? How could I hit on you?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It's normally a start of conversation for someone asking me to go out on a date.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Like, are you free this evening? You want to watch a movie?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Are you free this evening? Let's hang out.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Are you free this evening? Let's have dinner.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
That's right. Good thing I didn't asked if he was free this evening and let's have dinner.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Or I would look like someone asking him out on a date.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
What is it?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Do you want to come to my office just to talk to a holy spirit?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You're such a smart mouth. You're starting to get on my nerve.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I can still hear you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Move back a little, move.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I was asking if you're free this evening because Dao asked me to invite you over for dinner.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Dao invited me or you invited me?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Dao, of course. Why would I want to invite you?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I don't even want to stand close to you.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Thanks Dao for me but I still have leftovers from last night.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.000
Okay?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You can save it for later. Let's have dinner with Dao this evening.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.000
And you said you don't want to get close to me. You're such a hypocrite.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
See? You're holding my arm so tight.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Stop making joke.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Dao invited you for dinner. You should have some manners.
97
00:07:37,000 --&gt; 00:07:40 ,000
See you at home, don't ditch on us.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There must be something going on. He forces me to go.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Where the hell is he?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Hello.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.700
Hello

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Diao, Hello. I'm Gam.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I've been waiting for Dao to invite me over for a month, like I'm waiting for a monthly paycheck.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
She opened the gate without permission from house owner

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.000
She didn't even wear house slippers

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And she called me out the minute she got here. She can't be a mother of my children for sure.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Excuse me.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Hey, you didn't say anything but just stared at her like this, were you just evaluating her?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.000
I told you not to do that. Mom and I did that already.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Diao needed time for one month

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because he wanted to prepare himself for you.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.000
The other week, his zit popped up and he needed to postpone the date. He was scared of not looking good enough.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.000
Was I right, yes I was. The other week, he needed to postpone the date

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because his hair was getting long and it didn't look good. Was I right? Yep.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
The other week he was working late so he needed to push it further.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.000
Because he was afraid that he would got darker under eyes.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:21.000
Was I right? Yep. That's why it needed to push for a month, right?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I should let you two talk.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm gonna prepare dinner.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Why didn't Rak come here already? Is he gonna ditch me?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Are you excited? You don't have to. It's just a dinner.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If I close my eyes and touch these hands, I'd believe they were women's hands. So soft.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What are you doing? I told you not to bail on me. Let's have dinner at my house.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.000
And I told you already that I have leftovers.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I told you to save it for later. Let's have dinner with Dao first.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You're so eager to invite me over. There must be something going on.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Or you wouldn't be able to eat, if you hadn't seen my face.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Stop joking and come with me.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.500
Wait.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
What?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
You said I'm disgusting but you never let go of my hand.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Quit joking around already.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Let me put the cup down first.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You can hold my hand now. Let's go.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Come here. Quick. Before foods get cold.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Where's Diao?

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.500
He's going outside.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.000
Excuse me.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Did he try to ditch Gam?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Rak?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I thought you're gonna bail on Gam.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Nope. I'm not.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Can you make a plate for Rak?

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.600
What?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
His food's gone bad.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Welcome, Rak. This way.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Welcome.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Welcome, Gam.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Gam, this is Rak. He's our tenant.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Nice to meet you.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Nice to meet you, too.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Excuse me.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Dao didn't actually invite me over for dinner, right?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
But you use me as a buffer for this girl, right?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Nope. She did invite you over.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
If she really did invite me here, she would have set a plate for me already.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
These are two plates she prepared.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It hasn't done yet. She only has two hands.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.000
Do you want her to carry the third plate with her mouth ?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Come and sit.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Diao, come here and give me a hand, please.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I know that Rak's dinner hasn't gone bad. But you invited him here

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.000
to be a buffer for Gam, didn't you?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
His dinner's really gone bad. You can ask him if you want.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.600
Sure.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
No, please don't ask him. He could be embarrassed to admit.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You know that having same meal over and over is his sensitive spot

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.000
When his leftovers's gone bad, all he can think about is his mom's face.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
All done? I'll carry it out.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Can I have a glass of water please?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Don't you think I know your trick? I'm your big sister.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Make yourself at home, Rak.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Make yourself at home, Gam.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Try Dao's signature mashed potato. It's good.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Dao even made her own dressing.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I know you want to try these. Let me get them for you.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I'm telling you…

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Dressing.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
He's taking care of a wrong person?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I told him to have dinner with Gam. Why did he take care of only Rak?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Mashed potato's not here. Let me take care of that.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Its texture's sorta like ice cream.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Try it.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You need to take Gam home.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.500
What for?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Well, you refused to have one-on-one dinner with her.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.000
I wanted to have alone time with Gam. But Rak's dinner's gone bad.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
You didn't want me to help him at all?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
You can say what you want

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
but you need to take Gam back home or I'll tell mom.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
You're gonna tell mom again?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
You made an excuse of my food's gone bad?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.500
Huh?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Why? You didn't find Gam attractive so you wouldn't want to be alone with her?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Or you have no idea how to flirt with girls? You want me to teach you?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
This way.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Diao will give you a ride home.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Thank you for dinner.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.500
Sure.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.000
The foods are delicious.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.800
Sure.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I'm gonna go to Uncle Jod's café. Do you want anything?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:02.000
Can I have your heart? To go please?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.600
Excuse me.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
He left me here, all alone, with audience.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
You don't have to give me a ride home. I forgot that I made an appointment with my friends here.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Which house?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I don't remember. I need to call them first.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Thank you for dinner. It's nice to meet you.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
This is all your fault.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I need to find other ways to encourage Gam to have a crush on Diao.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Think. Use your brain. Think.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I know that you tried every possible way but it didn't succeed yet.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
It's okay. You just have to come up with something else. Think.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
What's going on? Why did you scream so loud? Is our café on fire?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Nope. LAZ iCON's here.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
LAZ iCON?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Move out of my way. Come on.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I'm so happy. They're all here.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Da Ou

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.000
Hello

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Off-Road

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.000
Hello

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.700
Hello

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.800
Pentor

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.000
Hello/Hello

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.600
Diamond

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.400
Hello

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Geler

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.800
Hello

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Did you know that I watch you all the time?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Thank you

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Did you just think of yourself as their brother?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.000
We're the same age.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Can I have a picture with you all?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.000
Sure. Please.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.700
Get in the middle.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.000
Can you take a picture for me?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.000
Sure.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
What pose? This one?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
1…2…3

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
1…2..3 let's pose for the pic

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Jod, can I take a photo with them too? This way, Uncle Jod.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I shouldn't have acted too informal with them.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.600
1…2…3

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
1…2…3 Okay.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Thank you / Thank you so much.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I'm so thrilled. Why're they here? I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.000
You're not dreaming. We need to be excused.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.000
We have another photo shoot session.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
You do? Thank you for stopping by.
252
00:20:53,200 --&gt; 00:20:53,000
Don't forget your drink.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.400
Drinks.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Almost forgot my drinks.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Drinks here are delicious.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.600
Pae / Yeah?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
On the house.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
It's okay. We already paid for the drinks.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.000
You did?

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.600
Yeah.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
That's fine. I can just show off then.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
We gotta go now.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Okay / Okay/ See you later.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.000
Love you / Keep on fighting, see you later.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.000
See you later.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.000
Please visit us soon.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.000
Where's the pic?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Uncle Jod?

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:44.000
Little Rak, I have something to show you. LAZ iCON just dropped by at my café.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.000
I took a picture with him too, look.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I worked with them too.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.000
You wanted to show off but he could show off too. How do you feel?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Don't mock me.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Pleng.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.500
Yeah?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Da Ou smells so good.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.000
His scent was still on my shirt. Have a sniff.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Whom can I order a tank of water to?

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.600
Pleng.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Lisa.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.600
Pae.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.600
Rit.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.000
I'm gonna get it for you.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.000
Wait, I don't even work here.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Pae and Lisa, stop looking at pictures for a minute and you two need to bring water to Rak.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.000
Fine. Don't forget to send me the pic later.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.000
Have a seat.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.600
Sure.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.800
That's quite clear.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.400
Pleang.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.600
What is it?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Looking good.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Our café will blow up for sure.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Can I sit here?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Sure.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
What do want to drink? It's on me.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.600
That's okay.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Please order something. We maybe sit here for a long time.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
We didn't talk much over dinner.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.000
I want to get to know you better.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I'm gonna buy iced tea. Do you want anything?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I don't think you'd need anything because you're gonna have me tonight.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Go!

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Gam? What's she doing here?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Did Dao ask her to be here to see me?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
If she's here to see me, Diao could get me wrong.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.600
Rak?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.600
Rak?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
What're you doing here?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I can't let him know that I run away from Gam.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
If he knows that Gam has a crush on me, it'd be a big trouble.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I asked what you are doing here.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Why did you close the door? Get out of here.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
You think you can hide me in the lavatory?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
That's alright. I can wait.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
I shouldn't make fun of Kanom. Now it's on me.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Did she poison me?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Why did you do this?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
You're too loud.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Why? You're afraid that someone would hear you?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I heard Diao and Rak's voice.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Why didn't you pick up the phone? I have something to talk to you.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.000
Why didn't you pick up the phone? Whom should I talk to ?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.000
Why didn't you pick up the phone? Whom should I talk to ?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Whom should I talk to ?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Maybe with dogs in front of the office? They always pay attention to you.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.000
That's right. Nope, it's not. What're you doing here?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
I told you to tell Kanom to see me.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Where is she? She's not here?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.000
It's good that you're here. Diao just stole our Darling.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.500
Huh?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Keep it down.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.600
What happened?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
There's no pants on the floor. They didn't do something nasty yet.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
That's not always the case. I'm sometimes half-naked.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Are you that horny or in a hurry?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.600
Both.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I think Gam should be gone by now.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Was she still waiting for me in front of the lavatory?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Who are you hiding from?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
No one.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Then you should leave.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
You two don't have to worry about anything.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I can keep a secret.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
But you brought Manow to see us?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
She's just here to pee.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
That's right.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
This is men's room.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
I just got transitioned.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
You can watch me pee.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Like this.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I don't think they believe you.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
This bitch invited me to join the gossip loop.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Who are you hiding from?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.500
No one.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So you two didn't do it here.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Judging from the look on his face. He was cursing you inside.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Waste of time.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Rak?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Missed it.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Are you here to see Diao?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Nope. I'm here to see you.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
What's up?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I just want to see you.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So Gam has a crush on Rak?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Don't tell me that you don't know what I mean.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Isn't that the girl Dao trying to set you up with?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Why did she have a crush on Rak?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
That's not a surprise. Everybody likes him.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Even I have a crush on him.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
If you're here to see me, why didn't you call Dao?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So I could wait for you.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I'm not here to see you.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I'm here to see him.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You don't have to use him as an excuse, I know that you want to see me.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.000
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:16.800
But I…

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.000
That's alright. I get it. You want to see me.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Poor you.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
How're you feeling? Having coffee and brownie all by yourself.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
You look lonely. I can sit with you.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
I'm sorry that I spend working hour to have coffee with Gam.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
What could I do? She's here to see me.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
It would be rude not to take care of her.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Do you really find her attractive or you just want to win?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Of course I do like her.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
If not, then why would I buy her coffee?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
You should stop your idea that Gam has a crush on you.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
You shouldn't have a girlfriend right now.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Why is that?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
You can't take care of anyone right now.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
You couldn't even take a good care of yourself.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
You forgot to close garbage bin's lid. I need to remind you all the time.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
You can't even close the gate completely. I need to issue new house rule for it.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
That's why you shouldn't have a girlfriend right now. Got it?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Why're you smiling?

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
If you were a girl, I'd believe that you were jealous of me.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Stop with your narcissistic idea.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Rak, hello.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Hello.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.000
Who are you? I don't know you.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
He's messing with you again.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Stop messing with me or I'm gonna be real mad at you.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I haven't seen you all for a long time. How're you doing?

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.000
I'm doing great. I have a shoot around here.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.000
So I was here to buy drinks.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.000
This is Diao, he's my friend.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Hello / Hello.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I thought you two were dating. It seemed like you were flirting earlier.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I can't date someone with smart mouth like him.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
But I think you're so cool.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
I haven't seen anyone dare to talk back to him.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
You two must be really close.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Not that I want to. But we live together.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Live together?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Live together.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
It seems like he's a little bit mad at you.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Excuse us. We need to get coffee.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I'll follow you. So thirsty.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
See you later. / Like there's no sweetness in my life.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Hello.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Welcome. This way.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Welcome.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I told you to keep your feeling inside, don't show it.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
You see? My friends think that you're mad at me.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Please don't be mad at me, honey.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
You need my heart?

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Am I your friend?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Diao's here. How could I get to talk to Rak?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Are you here to invite me to dinner?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I told you at the café that I don't have a crush on you.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.000
I have a crush on Rak.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Please apologize to Dao for me.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Do you want to have dinner with me?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
I'm sorry but I'm not free today.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.600
Let's go.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
You can let go of my hand now.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
I've hold my hand since we're Uncle Jod's café. Now you told me to let go of your hand?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Do you like me to hold your hand?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Please respect the place. This is home.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Oops. I forgot that you have a power here.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Let just say that I want to hold your hand. But you don't want to hold mine.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
You!

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I know that you pretended to hit on Gam just to get back at me.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
It's not a right thing to do.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Good thing that she doesn't have a crush on you.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
If she really did have a crush on you, and you played her like this.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
She would be heartbroken.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
We're human, not a robot. Our feeling is valid.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
When it's broken, it's hard to mend.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Think about it before playing with someone else's feeling.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Why did you say something like this? Has anyone seen you as a robot?

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Let's just say that if you don't like her that much, you shouldn't be playing with her feeling.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Why? You're jealous?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
You can make joke about this but I can't?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
This is home. I'm a big dog here. I can do whatever I want.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Fine. Mr. House Owner.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Good. Mr. Tenant.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
You look cute when you're nice to me.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
You should be nice to me more often.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Nope, or you'd fall in love with me.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000
You're speechless? You can't think of anything to say?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
I told you that I can say or do whatever I want here.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Why are you blushing?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Your ears are turning red too? Are you feeling okay?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Do you have a feeling for me? Come on now.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
This is for food.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.000
Thanks. I'm not counting.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Good for me. So you wouldn't know what I just did.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Fine. I'm counting.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.000
I was just kidding.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.000
You keep on joking about this.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Your fiction is that spicy?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
I saw you keep twitching.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
You should take a look. And you'll know why.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Love Note Chapter 5 : Clarity

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
After Ryo and Ryu spend time together under the same roof.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Their good feeling starts to increase.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Ryo's action tells Ryu all of his feeling.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Ryu is sure about Ryo's love for him.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.700
Is she your friend?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Nope. She's just asking for my contact.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Don't you want to know if I gave her mine?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Nope.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
I just want to tell you that

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I didn't give her my contact. But I tell her that

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
I already date someone.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Who's that?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
It's the person that I'm currently talking to.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Should we switch place?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.700
Why's that?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
What's going on?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I'm gonna nominate you for URWISH BOY contest.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.000
Can you nominate one more person?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Someone nominated you for URWISH BOY contest.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
You have been the winner for two consecutive years because I wasn't here.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
But I'm gonna win URWISH BOY this year.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Do you want to book a doctor? In case you need someone to mend your face.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
I was just bluffing earlier. But if he really challenges me like this,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
I need to win this year.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.000
You know how I feel about you.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
I know

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
that you have a crush on me.
