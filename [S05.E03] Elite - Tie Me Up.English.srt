1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,880
Omar!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Omar!

3
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,440
C'mon. You're not the only one
who lives here.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,760
Omar, fuckin' come on.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,320
This is Bilal.
I told you about him.

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,039
Why is this guy here?

7
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,240
I mean, dude,
he needed to crash somewhere.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,960
-And you didn't check with me first?
-Samuel, this is also my house.

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,240
Sure.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,439
I dunno. Next time, tell me.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,439
C'mon.

12
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,200
-I'm so fucking hungover.
-Does your head hurt?

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,640
Crazy night, huh?

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,079
-It was intense.
-Hi, hi.

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,079
Look. Speak of the devil.

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,640
You sleep over at Samuel's?

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,680
-Yeah, why?
-No reason.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,280
-Wait till Dad makes an appearance.
-We'll see if he talks to you.

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,319
'Cause since we got home,
he hasn't said a word.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,719
-Mm.
-Good morning.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,959
Have a good time with Samuel last night?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Mm… Yeah, I guess it was okay.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,519
What do you mean, "okay"?

24
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,319
That's an underwhelming review of an orgy.

25
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,879
All right, go shower and get changed.
I don't want you to be late for the exam.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,120
It's a multiple-choice test.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
A drug test.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,599
A negative result will add two points
to your grade point average.

29
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,680
Get a positive result…
and you'll be expelled.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,959
-He can't.
-Questions?

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
This is stupid.

32
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,319
Just wonderful, dude. Just wonderful.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,439
So, with the little prince, what happens
in Triesen stays in Triesen.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,879
But you're gonna screw us plebs over
for what we do in our private lives?

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,759
You got the wrong bitch, partner.

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm in this class too.

37
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,520
And I was at the party,
so I also refuse to take it.

38
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,759
Come on.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,919
Patrick.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
Let's go.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,599
-This isn't fair.
-I'm not taking it, either.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,560
Otherwise, what?
Are you gonna expel the entire school?

43
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,240
If necessary, then yes.

44
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,159
Come on. Chill out. He's totally bluffing.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
Hey, Omar, can you not?

46
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,240
Let him do the test.

47
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,439
You really think he'll kick you all out?

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,520
You think he'll get rid of his cash cows
who pay for his screens in the hallways,

49
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,120
little cameras, and metal detectors?

50
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,080
Come on. I'm the only one who didn't go,
and I'm on scholarship.

51
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
So, go ahead, Benjamín. Do the test.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,280
Dude, seriously. Shut up.

53
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,680
Okay.

54
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,639
Since it seems the class
who rebels together stays together,

55
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm going to ask you to stick together
once more to make a decision.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,599
Now we're gonna vote

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,240
via the school intranet,
and voting will be compulsory.

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,360
You'll have to choose a student,
someone from within your class,

59
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,719
and whoever's elected…

60
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,120
Well, that student will be expelled
on the remainder's behalf.

61
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,680
-Seriously?
-Because somebody has to pay.

62
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,120
Is this guy for real?

63
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,919
-Why is he doing this?
-What the fuck?

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
Everyone, shh. Please calm down!

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,159
You're the ones
who will be making the final decision.

66
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,560
Oh, and, uh, García,

67
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,199
congratulations on sticking to your guns
against the peer pressure

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,639
and not being emotionally manipulated
into standing up with the others.

69
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,600
It would be a shame if a student
like García were expelled, while others,

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,680
who have zero interest in the common good

71
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
and no viable plans for the future,

72
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,360
were to remain.

73
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,000
Son of a bitch.

74
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,160
-Why rile him up like that?
-Someone needed to take a stand.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,279
'Cause, clearly, you're not going to.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,319
What?

77
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,720
-Nothing.
-What's the matter?

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,199
You agree with him, don't you?
You think I should go.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,680
I think it wouldn't hurt you
as much as the others.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
That's what I think.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,120
My father has that power.

82
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,040
He pushes you. He's demanding.

83
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,000
And he's never quite satisfied with you.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,439
You get to the point where you try…

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,199
anything to gain his approval.

86
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,079
I think wanting to be his friend

87
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,839
is just a convenient
and easy way for you to…

88
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,439
to stay close to him
while telling yourself

89
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,120
and the rest of the world
that you're not into him at all.

90
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
No, I don't think so.

91
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
Well, you don't have to agree with me.

92
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,360
Just with yourself.

93
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,720
-Talk to you soon?
-Sure.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,759
Mm-hmm?

95
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,160
Good morning.

96
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,759
Good morning.

97
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,720
Good morning.

98
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,839
Hey, I'm honestly sorry about last night.

99
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Apology accepted.

100
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,079
Caye, come on.

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,439
Hello, fellow goddesses.

102
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,439
Sorority call.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,800
I want-- No.

104
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,720
I need to

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,360
make you reflect on your excuses
for kicking a classmate out of school.

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
-You hear everything in bathrooms.
-What the hell?

107
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,759
And I know
that some of you ladies

108
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,279
intend to vote for Phillipe
to kick him out of school

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
based on wild accusations
that are totally unfounded.

110
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,560
That's wrong.

111
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,439
And, you know, that's despite him
standing up to authority

112
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,480
like everyone else did.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay?

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
I, as a very special friend of Phillipe's…

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

116
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,319
…I have to say that he is simply
a gentleman from head to toe.

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,079
Cayetana? She's supporting him.

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,959
Guys, come on.

119
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,160
So, that makes not one but now two women

120
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
who know him intimately

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,399
and who believe in
his right to redeem himself.

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,800
And, babes, if you thought
the whole monarchy thing is medieval,

123
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,680
let me tell you
that retro is very much in.

124
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,600
But burning someone at the stake
without evidence isn't exactly chic.

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Right?

126
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay, bye.

127
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,800
Hey, uh, what'd you mean
by "special friend"?

128
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,759
-You're welcome.
-But you and I barely know each other.

129
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,600
Baby, I told you,
if they think there's something going on,

130
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,959
you'll stop being a rapist
and go back to being a prince.

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,839
The darling of Spain and Triesen.

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,000
The public eats it up
when they see a couple

133
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,399
that's young, rich, famous, good-looking.

134
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,040
And I swear to you,
these kids will forget everything

135
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,680
to buy into that fairy tale.

136
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,480
ALMODÓVAR FILM SEASON

137
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,840
You're into that director, aren't you?

138
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,399
-You know who Almodóvar is?
-No idea. I just saw it on your Insta.

139
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,840
It's so you'll forgive me.

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,759
I was trying not to hurt you,
but I hurt you three times as much.

141
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,200
So, what is this? A date?

142
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,360
No, man.
It's me making plans with friends.

143
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm inviting people from my class
and from your class as well.

144
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,480
Just to get everything clear up front.
So no drama.

145
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,120
Come on, give me a hug.
I know you're dying to.

146
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
Who are your plans with?

147
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,679
People.
None of your damn business.

148
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,519
The girl from last night?

149
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,399
Yeah, I went to the party.

150
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,159
-And I saw you with her.
-Okay, fine.

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
Her name's Jess.

152
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,120
You could say she's my first dyke friend…
and invited me to my first dyke party.

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,399
A lot of pretty dykey firsts to be honest.

154
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,159
Well, let's go to the drive-in.

155
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,519
And

156
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,279
then I'll go with you

157
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,679
to that dykey party
with this so-called Jess.

158
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,840
Only if you wanna.

159
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,919
You serious?

160
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,960
BABE, WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE DRIVE-IN?

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
Hey, Omar.

162
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm sorry I assumed
you didn't care about anything.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,360
We don't really shoot the shit anymore.

164
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
We're spending more time together
than ever.

165
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,240
At the house,
at the restaurant, and at school, but

166
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,600
we don't talk anymore.

167
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,320
Oh my God.
Why am I getting so intense? Jesus.

168
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,039
Omar, I'm stopping by the house
to change for the drive-in.

169
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,320
You maybe wanna…

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Maybe just hang out in the plaza?

171
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,720
Have some beers
and sunflower seeds like we used to?

172
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,120
Sorry. I didn't know where to go.

173
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,000
BABE, WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE DRIVE-IN?

174
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,360
-Ari, come help me a sec.
-Coming.

175
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,799
What do you think?

176
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,799
-A tracksuit?
-It's very '80s.

177
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,440
Yeah, vintage '87 junkie.

178
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,919
Trap music's screwed you up.

179
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
Guys, the cars.

180
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
Could you go down?

181
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,480
-Yeah, I can go.
-Tell 'em we'll be right there.

182
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,639
Let's see.

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,919
Alone, even for just a minute.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,679
-Should I reveal his weaknesses?
-Jesus Christ.

185
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,000
Why does everyone
assume that I'm gay?

186
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,399
Oh, honey. You can like whoever.
You don't need to put a label on it.

187
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,200
But I saw how hard you got.

188
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,879
Maybe it's not for him.

189
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,039
No, of course not.
Because you're a macho alpha male.

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,759
Look, I mean, I get that your dad
plays soccer and all that and--

191
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,320
Let's stop putting a label on it.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,919
What matters is that I like who I like.

193
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,600
Ah.

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
That's all.

195
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
Uh, guys. The cars are here.

196
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,159
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,240
LEAVING NOW. WE'LL PICK YOU UP.
IT'LL TAKE ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

198
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,679
What's wrong?

199
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,159
Don't make that face, dude.

200
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Look at him.
He's all beat up with nowhere to go.

201
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,159
-Hey, I'm gonna go.
-You're not gonna go anywhere.

202
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,799
Now, relax.

203
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,600
Stings, doesn't it?

204

00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,799
-Hi. How are you? Two orange juices.
-Hi there.

209
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,759
Do you have any vodka?

210
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,759
How come I'm sick of the '80s and '90s
when I was born in the 2000s?

211
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,279
Baby, can we go to the car
and listen to music from this century?

212
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,320
Wait. No, I like this song.

213
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,879
HIGH HEELS

ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,519
But if you don't wanna go out with her,
why did you say yes?

216
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,320
Well, that's exactly why, Cayetana.
Right there.

217
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,240
So she knows
she doesn't have any power over me.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,879
I mean, none.

219
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,559
Selfie?

220
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,480
-As friends?
-As good friends, you mean?

221
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,879
Sure, you mean as BFFs.

222
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,440
Of course.

223
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,279
Smile.

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,440
That's it.

225
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
EXPULSION VOTING

226
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,159
Come on.
Can't we have a little bit of fun?

227
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,120
How?

228
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,519
It's too much.

229
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,720
First, Omar lied to me
and then left me hanging.

230
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,960
Now there's this whole voting thing.

231
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,240
And I also feel like
I'm letting your dad down, you know?

232
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,519
I was wondering
when you'd mention my father.

233
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,359
Samuel, do you think Iván and Patrick
are thinking about my dad in this moment?

234
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,599
BAD EDUCATION

235
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,079
Look, just never mind.
I'm gonna go and get some food.

236
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,799
TALK TO HER

237
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,279
-Thanks.
-You and I need to talk.

238
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,440
Come here.

239
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,880
-So, what happened this afternoon--
-I'm sorry.

240
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,480
I didn't realize you were one of those.

241
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Those what?

242
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,119
One of those girls
who go for guys like their dad.

243
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
Daddy issues?

244
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,519
I'm sorry, what?

245
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm messing with you.

246
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
I just don't think
Samuel's a good match for you.

247
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,559
Yeah, the way he kisses
is fuckin' awesome.

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,200
-But you kiss much better.
-Here's what we're gonna do about this.

249
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,279
You're gonna stay away
from Samuel, from me,

250
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,680
and most importantly,
you'll stay away from Patrick.

251
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
And what happened
this afternoon never happened, okay?

252
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,880
Ari, did you smell me?

253
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,119
You know what I'm smelling?
Your little game here.

254
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,680
So, if you fuck with my brother
even the slightest bit,

255
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,680
I'll smack that grin
right off of your mouth.

256
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,000
Is that what you think of me?

257
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,240
Look, your brother
makes me feel fucking great.

258
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,160
-Mm-hmm.
-I hope to make him feel just the same.

259
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,839
But just as friends. That's all.

260
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,119
You can't ask me to feel the same
for him that I feel--

261
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,039
Shh.

262
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,680
That's enough.

263
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,640
So, can't your parents help you?

264
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Or anyone?

265
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,400
But you're a minor.

266
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,039
They could help you find a place
or something, couldn't they?

267
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,599
There are more kids
than beds in that facility.

268
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,799
Do you think they care
if we spend a night on the street?

269
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,680
I mean, someone must care.

270
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
I'm telling you, they don't.

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,960
You got me. I care about you.

272
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,839
It's the first time
I've heard that since I got here.

273
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,440
Thank you.

274
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm gonna get more water.

275
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,680
Omar.

276
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,000
You have a boner right now?

277
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

278
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
-I didn't mean to.
-Are you a queer?

279
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,119
Yeah. I'm queer.

280
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,480
I turn you on?

281
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,039
No, no. Not at all. It was the situation.

282
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,359
-I'll put the tabbouleh in a Tupperware.
-No, don't kick me out.

283
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm not kicking you out,
but I assume you don't wanna stay.

284
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,319
But I have nowhere else to go.

285
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,160
What are you doing, Bilal?

286
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
What's the matter?

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,440
-No, what's the matter with you?
-Don't you like it?

288
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,359
You don't wanna do this.

289
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,000
-Yes, I do.
-Stop!

290
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,960
You're doing it because you think
it's the only way I'll let you stay.

291
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,200
What kind of life have you had
that you think you only deserve help

292
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,359
if you sleep with someone?

293
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,799
We're gonna find a roof
to put over your head,

294
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,079
and we're gonna find you a job, okay?

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
-What?
-Nothing.

296
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,319
Wow.

297
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,799
-I'm gonna go get popcorn.
-Uh, no. Don't, Caye. They'll bring it.

298
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,039
-It's okay. Let her go if she wants.
-Yeah, I'm gonna get some air.

299
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,960
But, Caye. Hey, Caye, girl.

300
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,839
What's wrong, huh?

301
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,759
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

302
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,519
Okay. It feels like you're afraid
to be left alone with me.

303
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,599
Who, me? Afraid?

304
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,119
No, no, I'm not scared.

305
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,119
-Because we're friends, right?
-Exactly. We're just friends.

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,160
Yeah.

307
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,599
And friends, well…

308
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
Friends sometimes do things.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,079
Ah, uh, no, Mencía.
No, no, no, no.

310
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
-No, what?
-I said no.

311
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,119
It's just, this place is packed.

312
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,119
-And?
-Well, um, everyone can see us.

313
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,480
Well, you know what?
I don't really give a shit.

314
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,960
Uh,
what if Caye comes back?

315
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,200
I don't care.

316
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,160
-No, kid. We shouldn't. I mean--
-I told you, I don't give a shit.

317
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,720
Well, well, well.
Look who's here. Thanks for saving a spot.

318
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
Hey! You look totally gorge, babe.

319
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah, thank you.
Why don't you take my spot?

320
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm not hungry anymore.

321
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,000
Wonderful.

322
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
Hey, how are you?

323
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,440
Super great, and you?

324
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,559
I'm great too.

325
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,160
-That's great.
-What?

326
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,920
Have you given up on me already?

327
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,000
Look, Caye. I wanna do my part too, okay?

328
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,000
But it's gonna be really hard
for me if you're judging me 24/7

329
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,680
and telling me that…
that what I do is wrong or…

330
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:07,079
or that it's not enough, you know?

331
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,200
Yeah.

332
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,640
Meanwhile, she's a yes-girl
and tells you everything is okay, right?

333
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
She makes my life a lot easier.

334
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,799
Here. Baby, my treat.

335
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,599
-No, thank you.
-No, please. Take it. I bought it for you.

336
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,359
I said I don't want it, okay?

337
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,799
-Seriously? Are you kidding me right now?
-Ah.

338
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,079
Uh… I'll ask for a broom.
You clean here too, don't you?

339
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,880
Isadora, Jesus.

340
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah, fuck it.

341
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,079
Um,

342
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,640
can I borrow this real quick?

343
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,160
Fucking clown.

344
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,599
And you? You're a dumbass.

345
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,119
That fucking little cunt.

346
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,759
What a total fucking bitch!

347
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,119
I mean, did you see
what she just did to me?

348
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Did you see?

349
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,039
Here. You can wear this.

350
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,200
Yeah.

351
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,319
Now that I finally managed
to get naked in front of you?

352
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,680
No way.

353
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,039
I'm all yours.

354
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,559
Okay?

355
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,720
Psst. My favorite scene is coming soon.

356
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,319
Hmm.

357
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,119
Can we go to your place?

358
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,599
Didn't we say
we'd go to the party after this?

359
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,519
Yeah, but I mean, don't you prefer

360
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,000
this party right here?

361
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,440
I was looking forward to going, kid.

362
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I just don't want
any more problems with my dad.

363
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
You know what he's been like.

364
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,079
Yeah, so then tell him
you're sleeping over at my house.

365
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,759
I think I'd better not.

366
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,359
How's this go, Mencía?

367
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
How does it go?

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,839
I come out of the closet,
and you get in, so we never meet outside?

369
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
That it? Huh? Tell me.

370
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
Please tell me. What are we?
What the fuck are we, dude?

371
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,680
Tell me!

372
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Never mind.

373
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,119
We're done.

374
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,359
I really tried, kid, you know.

375
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,440
I tried so hard.

376
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,680
But I'm done. It's over.

377
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,200
It's over, Mencía.

378
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,240
-No, what's over? Wait.
-It's over.

379
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,720
Wait here.

380
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,359
If I let you loose, will you escape?

381
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,799
I don't know.

382
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,240
You'd better tie me up.

383
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,759
Tie me up.

384
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,880
Tie me up.

385
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,119
Samuel,

386
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
tie me up.

387
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,440
Tie me up.

388
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,079
How'd it go?

389
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Not good.

390
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,000
Worse for you?

391
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,240
-Well…
-Wanna leave?

392
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah.

393
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,759
I told you. Don't you dare hold back.

394
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,720
Okay?

395
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,319
Please, Phillipe. Please, stop.

396
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,759
Stop! Please, don't, Phillipe!

397
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,680
I'm begging you. Stop!

398
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,559
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Let's go. Let's leave.

399
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
-Stop what?
-I said we're leaving now.

400
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,119
I don't get it.
I thought you were into this.

401
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,359
I really love this film so much.

402
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,799
Wanna knock one more back?

403
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,920
No, man. I'm wiped. Gonna get some sleep.

404
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
What? One little drink.
Then we go to your place.

405
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,240
No, seriously. Let's go home.
But to our own houses.

406
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,119
-What's wrong?
-No, nothing.

407
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,559
I just don't think it's smart
for us to sleep together again.

408
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,599
That's all.

409
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Hey, I meant just as friends. Chill out.

410
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,039
Well, that's why.

411
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,240
Since we're friends,
we can't keep doing that, can we?

412
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,279
-Of course we can.
-No, we can't.

413
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,720
We can't, because you can't get your head
around the fact

414
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,160
that nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

415
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,839
Look, Patrick. I am the way I am,
and I'm open with people I care about.

416
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,440
But you come up
with these fantasies. They hurt you.

417
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,279
That's why it's better
if we just have some space for now.

418
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,039
Fucking great.

419
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,799
Hey.

420
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,880
THE PERFECT ENDING
TO A PERFECT NIGHT WITH YOU.

421
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,559
Babe, hey. Babe, let's stop. Okay?

422
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,359
Okay?

423
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:10,960
Sorry.

424
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,720
I've been neglecting you all day,
just thinking about the same shit.

425
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,039
What are you thinking about?

426
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,000
About how I don't want to disappoint you.

427
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,599
I see.

428
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,880
Like you've disappointed
my father?

429
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm fucking with you.

430
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
Why are you obsessed
with disappointing us?

431
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,920
You're not disappointing anyone.

432
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,920
Do you know
why I'm like that with your dad?

433
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,279
No.

434
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,319
Because I have no idea
what it's like to have a father.

435
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,159
And seeing the way yours worries about me,

436
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,119
asks me what I want to be
or how I'm doing.

437
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,280
He believes in me and is betting on me.

438
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,519
That's such a new feeling.

439
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,679
And I like it.

440
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,840
It gives me peace.

441
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,199
Come here.

442
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,360
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TO ME.

443
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,079
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH PATRICK.

444
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,880
Man, with this whole Bilal thing
and learning his life story,

445
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,679
I think I finally know my calling.

446
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,320
Social work.

447
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,639
It's a good fit, right?

448
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,880
What's wrong? What are you looking for?

449
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,599
My computer.

450
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,719
I left it right over here.

451
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,440
Where? Here where?

452
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,920
After school,
I'll go to Bilal's facility and ask him.

453
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,559
But with all the computers at school,
I'm sure you need it less than he does.

454
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,960
What?

455
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,039
It's not an urgent need.

456
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,199
And for someone like Bilal, he can live
on that money for a whole month.

457
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,480
But don't worry.
If you need it, I'll buy you one.

458
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,039
I'm coming!

459
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,599
All right, I'm coming. Jesus.

460
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,239
Hey, baby. Hello.

461
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,039
What is this?

462
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,599
Huh?

463
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
Isadora, what is this?

464
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,519
"Hi. How's it going, Isadora?
Good morning! How are you? Okay. You?"

465
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,880
-"Good."
-Can you explain what this is?

466
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,519
-Isadora, what the fuck is this? Huh?
-Yeah. What the fuck is what?

467
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,199
-Was it or was it not a perfect evening?
-No. It was a fucking disaster, okay?

468
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,559
And I didn't come here
to have drinks and chat.

469
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,239
Shh! Lower your voice,
or the hotel staff will hear you,

470
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,519
and I want a supportive,
nontoxic work environment. Understood?

471
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,800
I told you already, baby.

472
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,599
As long as people buy the story
about the prince and the empress,

473
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,840
they'll forget all your sins.

474
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,280
And more importantly, so will you.

475
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
Yeah, but I'm not your trophy.
Or anyone's.

476
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,800
Trophy?

477
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,440
You? Honestly?

478
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,239
You're a broken trophy.

479
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,239
Baby, you're radioactive.

480
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,679
You don't gain me followers.
You lose them. Today I lost 2,000.

481
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,119
-Why are you helping me then?
-Because I can't anymore.

482
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,880
I can't stand seeing you
keep punishing yourself

483
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,320
and how they keep punishing you
for something in your past.

484
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,360
It's done.

485
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,719
You need to get over it.

486
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,920
You need to be
with someone who is good for you,

487
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,920
not someone who's constantly reminding you
that you made a mistake.

488
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
If you take a small child

489
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,880
and say that he's bad,
that he's bad, that he's bad, what then?

490
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
The kid ends up believing
he's actually bad.

491
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,840
I know what I am talking about.

492
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
We are not bad. Not me or you.

493
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,679
And I won't allow anyone
to convince us otherwise.

494
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,159
Okay?

495
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,559
And here's a little tip, baby.

496
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,440
If life offers you the opportunity
to lay eyes on the body and face

497
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,800
of an empress of Ibiza,
then what do you do?

498
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,639
You say yes. Yes and yes.

499
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,440
And if you hesitate,
you say yes again. Hmm?

500
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,719
But don't go around posting pics.
Especially not fake ones, okay?

501
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,880
I promise you, it won't happen again.

502
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,239
Although maybe it wasn't such a bad idea.

503
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,239
How are you doing in the voting?

504
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,960
Shanaa.

505
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,679
You didn't vote, and it's mandatory.

506
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
What happens if there's a tie?

507
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,599
In that case,
both students would be expelled.

508
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,480
Fuckin' A.

509
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,119
Whenever you're ready.

510
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,199
Samuel, he won't expel you. Don't worry.

511
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:33,480
My vote's for Samuel.

512
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,800
Omar, bro. What you doin'?

513
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Samuel García Domínguez,

514
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,000
you are expelled for three days,
courtesy of your classmates.

515
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,079
-I thought he was gonna be expelled.
-And he is… for three days.

516
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,960
See that?

517
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,199
Coulda let us know sooner,
don't you think, Benji?

518
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. What? What's the matter?

519
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,559
Now you're disappointed
because I didn't permanently expel one?

520
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,599
So much for
that whole unite and stick together thing.

521
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,800
In the end, it's every man for himself.

522
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,360
Hmm.

523
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,800
Gonna go to class, Samuel. Ciao.

524
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,800
Remember the time
when you came to talk to me,

525
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,960
and you defended Omar?

526
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,599
Remember that I told you
to focus on your own battles

527
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,800
and stop fighting everyone else's?

528
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,159
Well, it looks like that's a lesson
Omar appears to have learned very well.

529
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,119
Dude, hear me out.
I knew he wasn't gonna let you go.

530
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,400
If it had been me, then forget
that three-day shit. I'd be on the street.

531
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,239
Get outta my house.

532
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,559
-What?
-You heard me.

533
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,840
You gotta be outta here by tomorrow.

534
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,159
Please. I need to understand.
I need to know why you did it.

535
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,880
Did my dad make you that crazy?
