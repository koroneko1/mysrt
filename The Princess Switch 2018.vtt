I would be so honored.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.879
-Shall we say in an hour or so?
-An hour?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.090
Yeah, sure.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.509
I mean, I was going to go sightseeing
with my friends,

11:58.592 --> 12:00.553
but I'm sure they'll understand
if I tell them--

12:00.636 --> 12:03.681
Oh, no. You can't tell a soul about this.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.058
I wouldn't want to risk offending
the King and Queen.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.687
Right, of course not.
My lips are sealed.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.147
Brilliant.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.148
Great.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.569
Do I really need to bow or something
before I go?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.779
It really isn't necessary.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.322
Great.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.668
I tested out the oven
while you were gone,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.546
and it doesn't look like you had
much luck with that stain.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.006
-Stain?
-Your apron.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.217
[laughs] Right, my apron.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.680
Um, you know, I think the best thing to do
would be to just go buy a new one.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.016
If you hang on a sec,
I'll pack this stuff up,

12:47.099 --> 12:48.392
and we can all go together.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.560
No!

12:49.643 --> 12:53.147
What I mean is
Olivia doesn't want to go shopping

12:53.230 --> 12:54.857
for some silly, old apron.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.109
Maybe you and I can watch
some more of the ballet.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.779
And you can ask
how much the summer program costs.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.281
Liv, you know we could never afford
something like that.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.575
Meet you back at the cottage in an hour.
Deal?

13:04.658 --> 13:05.618
Deal.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.208
Hey!
[laughs]

13:16.128 --> 13:18.214
I really wish you and Stacy were a thing.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.842
Stacy and I have been friends
since high school.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.428
If sparks were gonna fly,
we'd know by now.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.430
Maybe you're just not trying hard enough.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.516
She's my best friend, Liv. You know that.

13:28.599 --> 13:32.102
Besides, she's just a little too intense
for someone like me.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.229
People change.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.064
Not that much.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.111
[Mrs. Donatelli]
It's uncanny.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.076
Do you think we could be related somehow?

13:47.743 --> 13:51.080
Three generations ago,
your great-grandmother's cousin, Cecil,

13:51.163 --> 13:56.168
fled the country after a dalliance
with a vulgar American divorcée.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.380
It was rumored
that Cecil settled in the United States.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.757
His daughter married
a man named De N'Ofrio,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.259
but the families lost touch.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.428
De N'Ofrio, De Novo... It could be.

14:06.971 --> 14:10.391
Stacy, I think we were destined
to run into each other.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.433
Don't you?

14:12.142 --> 14:14.770
I don't know about destined....
[chuckles]

14:14.854 --> 14:17.314
But I am so happy
to help you with your cake.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.817
I do need a favor,

14:19.900 --> 14:23.070
but it has nothing to do
with baked goods.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.280
What kind of a favor?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.616
Would you like some tea?

14:30.578 --> 14:31.620
Sure.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.334
I'm supposed to marry Prince Edward
on New Year's Day,

14:37.418 --> 14:40.337
but I don't know anything
about the people here

14:40.421 --> 14:43.382
or what a normal life here,
or anywhere, is like.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.927
So, you want me to teach you
how to be normal?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.722
No. I want to be you.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.141
I want to switch places with you.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.475
Switch places?

14:53.559 --> 14:57.146
I become you, and you become me.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.481
Get out!

14:59.565 --> 15:00.983
It would only be for two days.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.943
No one would even notice.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.279
I'm kind of guessing
your fiancé would notice.

15:05.362 --> 15:09.199
Edward is leaving town tonight
to meet with the Spanish Ambassador.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.202
He won't be back
until the day after tomorrow.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.705
So, you wouldn't have to deal
with him at all.

15:14.788 --> 15:18.167
You know, it doesn't sound like
you're too excited about getting married.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.378
My parents taught me
that marriage is about duty,

15:21.462 --> 15:23.547
about alliances between nations.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.343
Now that they're gone,
I'm not going to disappoint them.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.346
So, what?
It's, like, an arranged marriage?

15:33.474 --> 15:36.685
Edward and I met twice
before we were engaged.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.979
It's not that he's unpleasant.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.607
He's just very... formal.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.402
Does he happen to have
one of those fancy limousines?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.446
I believe so.
Why do you ask?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.406
Not important.

15:49.490 --> 15:54.161
Look, the only thing on my schedule
is breakfast with the King and Queen.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.122
You can spend the rest of your time
relaxing right here.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.290
Please.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.584
If there's anything I could offer you...

16:01.293 --> 16:02.962
anything at all.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.968
You wouldn't happen to know anyone
at the Children's Ballet Conservatory,

16:09.051 --> 16:09.927
would you?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.804
It's one of the Royal Charities.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.682
So if an adorable,
eight-year-old ballerina wanted

16:14.765 --> 16:16.266
to do the summer program?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.769
It would be my pleasure to sponsor her.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.562
You really mean it?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.690
Consider it done.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.526
And I'd be back
in time for the competition?

16:25.609 --> 16:28.028
We would switch back
at midnight the night before.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.572
[sighs]

16:31.115 --> 16:34.493
I mean, if you really think
it would help you out.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.453
So, you'll do it.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.544
They say life's what's happening
when you're busy making other plans.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.425
Fabulous.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.721
-Okay, so... that is Chicago.
-Wow!

16:53.804 --> 16:55.639
-There's my house.
-So charming.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.558
There is Kevin.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.561
And little Olivia.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.355
Oh! How precious!

17:03.772 --> 17:04.940
[Stacy]
There is the bakery.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.191
-Did you make that?
-Yeah.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.319
-Very impressive.
-Thank you.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.823
["What Christmas Means to Me" plays]

17:14.533 --> 17:15.534
[gasps]

17:19.496 --> 17:23.959
So, the most important things
to remember are, obviously, Edward.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.087
His father, George,
and Caroline, his wife.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.005
Yes.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.923
Can't forget.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.093
Right, let us take a closer look.

[giggling] No.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.697
So bad!

18:39.910 --> 18:43.205
Oh. [giggles] It's so cute.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.967
Almost there. One final finishing touch.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.344
Oh, um, sorry. I don't do hair spray.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.805
You will learn to do hair spray.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.223
[Margaret]
What do you think?

19:01.765 --> 19:04.685
Stacy De Novo. How's it hanging?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.646
-How's it hanging?
-A bit much, is it?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.273
[knocking on door]

19:09.356 --> 19:11.942
-Who is it?
-Edward. May I come in?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.029
Just one moment if you please.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.282
Do I really sound so Downtown Abbey?

19:18.365 --> 19:21.201
I don't know. I'm trying.
Just... hide or something.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.162
Okay.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.872
Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:24.955 --> 19:26.039
What?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.375
Oh. Okay.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.877
Just a minute.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.673
[sighs]

19:37.801 --> 19:39.803
Ah! There you are!

19:40.387 --> 19:41.430
Here I am.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.764
[softly] Curtsy!

19:46.643 --> 19:48.061
Please do come in.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.610
Might I say you look lovely in pink.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.569
Oh!

19:55.652 --> 19:57.946
And you look lovely as well.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.489
Not in... Not in pink.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.492
Just... you know, in general.

20:02.576 --> 20:06.205
Though I'm sure pink
would be very becoming.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.873
I'll take that as a compliment.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.211
I trust the accommodations
are to your liking.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.546
Oh, yes, they're top drawer!

20:14.630 --> 20:17.090
Yes. But is there a problem with the sofa?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.176
No. No, no, not at all.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.511
You seem to keep staring at it.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.514
Oh, well... I have a lazy eye.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.141
-Oh.
-[Stacy] Yes.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.437
Uh, not all the time.
Just when I get fatigued.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.316
Perhaps it's not to your taste
or not comfortable enough.

20:34.399 --> 20:39.696
Oh, no, no, it's very comfortable.
Very comfortable indeed.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.200
In fact, I took a nap on it.
Slept like a log.

20:43.867 --> 20:44.910
A log?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.538
Yes, dear, a royal log.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.750
It's an expression we have in Montenaro.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.835
A royal log?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.212
It's very quaint.

20:55.295 --> 20:59.424
Oh, well, we're a quaint, little country.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.220
But I don't want to keep you from Spain.

21:03.303 --> 21:06.974
Oh, yes, I...
I suppose I should be heading off.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.934
Yes, off you go.

21:09.851 --> 21:14.147
Oh, and do tell your driver
to be careful of pedestrians

21:14.231 --> 21:16.525
and other road hazards.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.527
Road hazards?

21:18.610 --> 21:20.654
[sighs] God!

21:23.198 --> 21:24.825
You were brilliant!

21:24.908 --> 21:26.910
[scoffs]
I don't know about brilliant.

21:26.994 --> 21:30.497
Well, I do. With Edward away
to stuffy, old meetings,

21:30.580 --> 21:33.917
all you need to do is stick to chatting
about the weather.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.294
If you say so.

21:35.877 --> 21:39.006
Okay, now there is a sightseeing schedule
in the back pocket of those jeans.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.342
All you need to do is follow it
for the next two days.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.427
Right.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.472
Well, I suppose it's time.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.689
-Well, good luck.
-You too.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.609
And thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.243
[exhales deeply]

22:57.751 --> 23:00.253
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.005
Olivia thought you got lost.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.590
She went to bed an hour ago.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.885
I was just taking in the sights.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.058
And there are a lot of sights to see.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.105
So, you get the apron?

23:18.730 --> 23:19.773
Apron.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.860
Right, the apron with the stain.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.571
Nope. Couldn't find one that fits.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.449
Stace, aprons are one-size-fits-all.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.409
Right.

23:31.034 --> 23:35.705
What I mean is I couldn't find one
that fits... my personality.

23:38.792 --> 23:39.876
Did you get a haircut?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.878
Yes. Yup.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.589
Sure did.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.842
-Just out of the blue?
-Yup.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.678
I've known you 12 years,
you do not do out of the blue.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.681
There's a first time for everything.

23:53.765 --> 23:58.687
Well, it's getting late.
I better catch some Z's. Good night.

23:59.938 --> 24:00.897
Good night.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.692
"Catch some Z's"?

24:07.028 --> 24:09.698
Does Lady Margaret
really wear this to sleep?

24:09.781 --> 24:10.657
[chuckles]

24:10.740 --> 24:14.578
If you mean, does she wear a proper
nightgown to bed instead of feety pajamas,

24:14.661 --> 24:16.329
then the answer is yes.

24:18.915 --> 24:22.711
So... I guess it's just you and me
for the next two days.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.045
Indeed.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.798
Have you worked with a Duchess
for a long time?

24:27.632 --> 24:31.094
-Since she was a little girl.
-And you're okay with us trading places?

24:32.679 --> 24:33.680
[sighs]

24:35.599 --> 24:41.062
Well, the Duchess
has always been rather spontaneous.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.150
And, uh, it's not my place
to have an opinion.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.735
But you have one anyway.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.282
The dear girl
has been through so much already.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.493
Losing both her parents so young,

24:54.576 --> 24:57.078
and now, all the responsibility
of becoming a royal

24:57.162 --> 24:59.122
when she doesn't even really know
who she is.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.458
The truth is I would do anything for her,

25:01.541 --> 25:05.545
which means that for the next two days,
I will do anything for you.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.798
[clears throat]

25:08.882 --> 25:11.676
So, uh,
should I bring you a fresh pot of tea?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.221
No, thanks. I think I'll be fine.

25:15.096 --> 25:15.931
Yes.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.391
I believe you will be.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.191
[sighs]

25:32.614 --> 25:34.491
[giggles]

25:34.574 --> 25:37.911
[laughs] Oh!

25:37.994 --> 25:39.371
[gasps]

25:43.416 --> 25:45.418
[laughs]

25:51.633 --> 25:53.093
Hello, darling.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.678
[giggles]

25:54.761 --> 25:56.096
[knocking on door]

25:58.306 --> 25:59.933
Mrs. Donatelli?

26:05.730 --> 26:06.815
[knocking on door]

26:06.898 --> 26:07.941
[Stacy]
I'm coming!

26:12.362 --> 26:13.572
It's you again.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.865
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.495
No. No, not at all.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.582
Mrs. Donatelli went to fetch some tea,

26:23.665 --> 26:28.086
and in Montenaro, it's the custom
to always wear a hat to tea.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.629
Even in one's nightgown?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.507
Yes, yes.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.635
There can be no exceptions,
substitutions, or exchanges.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.389
-Excuse me?
-Our code of etiquette was drafted

26:39.472 --> 26:41.766
by a rather fastidious attorney.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.229
Is there something I can do for you?

26:46.313 --> 26:48.523
Yes, I just wanted to say

26:48.607 --> 26:52.235
I hope you understand
that I wish I could rearrange my schedule.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.029
I hate to leave at such short notice.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.614
I completely understand.

26:55.697 --> 26:58.033
Schedules are important
to keep things organized.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.576
I couldn't agree more.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.120
-"A goal without a plan is--"
-"Just a wish."

27:02.203 --> 27:03.955
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.417
The Little Prince.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.171
One of my favorites.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.589
Mine too.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.970
Well, safe travels.

27:19.054 --> 27:19.971
Thank you.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.265
Oh.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.066
Really?

27:36.821 --> 27:38.531
So much to do,
and so little time to do it.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.532
[King George]
Hmm.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.702
-Mmm.
-Ah.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.287
Please join us, dear.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.956
Your Majesties.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.137
[King George]
I trust you slept well.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.972
Very well indeed.

28:05.433 --> 28:09.437
The weather is particularly
splendid today, isn't it?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.606
Hmm. If one is a fan of frostbite.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.607
Oh.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.652
[Queen Caroline]
I'm so glad to see you, my dear.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.988
I've been talking with chef
about the menu for the reception.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.366
What about the menu? Prithee, tell.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.247
It's the salad course.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.500
Chef was thinking
about a peanut sauce for salad dressing.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.961
But I seem to recall
that one of your relatives is allergic.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.921
I just can't recall which one.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.132
My mother's side.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.049
The Pembrokes.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.719
Lord Percival?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
Didn't he die last spring?

28:42.387 --> 28:43.304
Mmm.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.932
Yes. Yes, he did.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.601
Suddenly, in fact.
The dear thing.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.063
So we won't have to worry
about poor Percy.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.107
You know? I never did like peanuts.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.233
Hmm.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
Well, then we'll find something else.

28:59.028 --> 28:59.904
Oh, you all right?

29:01.156 --> 29:04.409
Oh, yes. Just... surprised.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.035
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.038
Of course. I just...

29:09.873 --> 29:12.208
Didn't you leave for your meeting
with Spain last night?

29:12.292 --> 29:16.755
Edward had the good sense to turn around
before he arrived at the airport.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.341
Yes, I thought it wrong to be concerned
with affairs of state

29:20.425 --> 29:22.010
with our wedding just around the corner.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.763
And I'm determined to spend
as much time together as we can

29:24.846 --> 29:26.181
over the next few days.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.974
How smashing!

29:28.057 --> 29:29.934
And now, you can both attend

29:30.018 --> 29:32.228
the St. Andrew's Shelter
Charity Ball tonight.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.983
How doubly smashing!

29:37.066 --> 29:39.319
Which reminds me.
I have something for you.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.362
Oh.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.493
Wow!

29:46.576 --> 29:49.996
I had it made for your engagement present.
I hope it's suitable.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.457
It's... It's very suitable.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.629
Extremely suitable.

29:57.712 --> 29:58.546
[Prince Edward]
Good.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.299
Well, in the meantime,
I've spoken to Miles at the stables,

30:01.382 --> 30:04.260
-and he'll be ready for us in an hour.
-Ready?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.013
For us to do what?

30:07.096 --> 30:09.098
I thought a nice ride
through the countryside

30:09.182 --> 30:11.059
would be a fun surprise
for you this morning.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.936
Oh!

30:13.019 --> 30:15.146
Isn't it too cold to go riding?

30:15.688 --> 30:17.857
-I thought you said you love the cold air.
-I do.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.943
I... I do.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.237
But I'm worried about the horses.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.491
[laughs] The horses live in the stables.
They're used to the cold.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.827
Well, of course they are, here.

30:30.036 --> 30:33.915
But not in Montenaro.
It's much warmer back home.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.334
I thought you had
a terrible snow storm last winter.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.795
We did.

30:38.878 --> 30:39.963
Terrible.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.382
Dreadful, really.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.678
But we have heated stables.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.138
Ah, well...
[chuckles]

30:49.222 --> 30:52.725
-How very nice for the horses!
-Yes, well, you know what they say.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.270
A warm horse is a happy horse.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.605
And there's nothing better
than a happy horse.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.400
Hmm.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.735
Well, I better change
if we're going riding.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.445
-Yes.
-Yes, all right.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.551
-Frank?
-Sir?

31:28.553 --> 31:31.764
I want you to keep a close eye
on the Duchess.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.267
-She seems, um...
-Different?

31:35.393 --> 31:36.394
Hmm.

31:37.937 --> 31:38.813
Different.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.274
Hmm.

31:43.234 --> 31:47.238
All right, we have our eggs, our pancakes.
Should be enough.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.491
Breakfast is ready.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.794
You never burn anything.

32:01.878 --> 32:06.466
Uh, I guess I'm a bit nervous
with the big contest coming up.

32:06.549 --> 32:07.592
Maybe we should eat out.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.094
-Splendid.
-Splendid?

32:11.346 --> 32:13.932
Splendidly super.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.018
Stacy, what did you do to your hair?

32:17.101 --> 32:19.437
Oh, I got a trim.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.731
Thought I'd mix things up a little.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.942
Are you feeling okay?

32:24.859 --> 32:25.735
Super.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.822
Uh, will your father be joining us?

32:29.906 --> 32:31.115
[chuckles]

32:31.199 --> 32:33.368
Father went out to get that sauté pan,

32:33.451 --> 32:35.662
and he said he'd pick you up a new apron.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.789
Super-duper.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.583
So, where should we go?

32:40.667 --> 32:43.002
There was a place right on the square.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.045
Right.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.505
The square.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.759
Where we bought the Christmas tree,
remember?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.887
Right! The Christmas tree.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.726
Tell you what, you get the coats,
and I'll wash the dishes, deal?

32:59.519 --> 33:00.353
Deal.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.189
Secret handshake?

33:08.695 --> 33:09.612
[clears throat]

33:10.530 --> 33:11.990
[Margaret]
Oh! [laughs]

33:18.287 --> 33:20.289
Hey! [giggles]

33:30.341 --> 33:31.175
Okay.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.183
[phone vibrates]

33:39.267 --> 33:41.227
Stacy, phone!

33:42.103 --> 33:48.192
[phone continues vibrating]

33:56.743 --> 33:57.577
[phone ringing]

33:57.660 --> 33:59.245
Oh, come on, Margaret. Pick up.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.663
[phone continues ringing]

34:00.747 --> 34:01.581
[clears throat]

34:02.665 --> 34:05.877
Was Your Grace having difficulty
with her mobile telephone?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.921
Oh, no. It's nothing.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.257
Just a dropped signal.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.384
Would you like borrow mine?

34:13.468 --> 34:15.762
Oh, no. I wouldn't want to impose.

34:15.845 --> 34:18.806
Oh, it's no imposition.

34:20.641 --> 34:25.229
The Duchess is quite capable
of placing her own calls, Mr. De Luca.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.190
I was just trying to be of service.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.609
Well then,
you may take these to the laundry.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.111
It's that way.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.742
[quietly] The laundry.
For God's sake!

35:06.145 --> 35:08.231
-Shall we?
-We shall.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.524
Good.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.737
Oh, dear God!

35:15.863 --> 35:17.115
[chuckles awkwardly]

35:17.198 --> 35:18.324
Is there a problem?

35:18.991 --> 35:20.493
Not at all. It's just...

35:20.576 --> 35:25.248
The horses in Montenaro are a bit shorter,
like large ponies.

35:25.331 --> 35:28.584
But... no problem.
[laughs]

35:29.085 --> 35:30.378
None in the least.

35:33.923 --> 35:34.966
Here we go.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.472
-Are you all right?
-Mm-hmm.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.683
I thought you said
you were a competitive rider.

35:43.766 --> 35:47.436
Oh. Uh, I'm quite competitive indeed.
[laughs]

35:49.689 --> 35:50.857
It's the pants.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.485
They must have shrunk in the royal wash.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.570
Huh.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.532
Wouldn't want to split a seam.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.202
All right, there we go.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.246
You know, we really don't have to do this.

36:05.329 --> 36:10.501
Oh, no. We are scheduled to go riding,
so that's what we're going to do.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.212
-Well, then let me give you a hand.
-All right.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.135
Ready? One, two, three.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.555
-Better?
-Much.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.473
Good. Okay.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.186
Right.
[clicking tongue]

36:28.269 --> 36:31.105
All right. Oh! Oh!
[laughs]

36:32.899 --> 36:35.151
[Stacy chuckles awkwardly]

36:53.169 --> 36:55.004
[sighs]

36:55.087 --> 36:56.297
Here. Let me help you.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.882
I'm quite all right.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.217
Well, just in case.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.262
[giggles]

37:04.639 --> 37:07.225
You have something in your eye.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.488
This really is quite breathtaking.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.324
Yes. Yes, it is.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.826
I come here when I need to get away.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.453
Do you need to get away a lot?

37:28.162 --> 37:30.539
Sometimes the affairs of state
can be a burden.

37:31.123 --> 37:35.336
Burdens usually aren't so bad
when you have someone to share them with.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.381
[laughs] I doubt you'd be interested
in the details of foreign trade.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.342
-Why not?
-You shouldn't have to worry about that.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.970
Because I'm not bright enough?

37:44.053 --> 37:46.222
No, because you have a wedding to plan.

37:46.305 --> 37:49.267
So I should stick to things
like polishing my tiara?

37:50.184 --> 37:51.435
No, I didn't mean it like that.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.188
Well, I think it's precisely
what you meant.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.775
It's getting a bit chilly.
I think it's time to head back.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.443
Margaret...

38:02.280 --> 38:03.864
[Stacy clicks tongue]

38:10.079 --> 38:12.206
[phone vibrates]

38:13.416 --> 38:14.417
Hello.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.877
Ugh! Boy, am I glad you picked up.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.046
[Margaret on phone]
I was going to call you.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.215
There's been a bit of a snag
at this end.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.133
What happened?

38:25.553 --> 38:26.887
Hey there, Princess.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.473
Oh! You figured us out!

38:29.557 --> 38:31.100
It wasn't rocket science.

38:31.183 --> 38:32.184
You okay with this, Liv?

38:32.268 --> 38:34.520
[Olivia on phone]
You kidding? I get to hang with royalty.

38:34.603 --> 38:37.440
And Margaret told me
all about that ballet scholarship,

38:37.523 --> 38:39.317
and that's so totally cool.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.944
I'm glad you're all right.
Let me talk to Margaret.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.157
We're getting on fabulously.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.868

you can tell me the truth.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.976
Uh, about what?

55:13.059 --> 55:14.394
Anything and everything.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.021
Oh.

55:16.104 --> 55:17.605
But how about we start

55:17.689 --> 55:20.984
with what you think about the charity work
we're doing with St. Andrew's?

55:21.067 --> 55:25.947
[laughs]
St. Andrew's! Of course.

55:28.450 --> 55:31.661
Well, if I'm being honest...

55:33.163 --> 55:36.416
Having a ball to raise money
is a wonderful thing to do.

55:37.834 --> 55:38.835
But...

55:38.918 --> 55:42.839
But you really need to be more involved.

55:43.381 --> 55:46.051
-How?
-Schedule a day to visit the shelter.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.053
Get to know the people.

55:50.055 --> 55:51.723
It's never been done before.

55:51.806 --> 55:54.559
Which means it needs to be done
sooner than later.

55:58.146 --> 55:59.939
You sound like my grandmother.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.401
I'll take that as a compliment.

56:13.870 --> 56:17.749
"He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

56:17.832 --> 56:22.003
and away they all flew
like the down of a thistle."

56:23.880 --> 56:27.717
Isn't she wonderful?
Reading to the children like that?

56:27.801 --> 56:29.386
The Duchess is very special.

56:29.469 --> 56:34.099
"And I heard him exclaim
as he rose out of sight,

56:34.182 --> 56:36.017
'Merry Christmas to all,

56:36.101 --> 56:38.561
and to all a good night.'"

56:43.400 --> 56:44.234
Yes?

56:44.317 --> 56:46.736
Is it true you're really a princess?

56:46.820 --> 56:50.824
Not yet. But I will be
after I marry Prince Edward.

56:52.492 --> 56:53.952
Are you in love with him?

56:54.035 --> 56:55.537
[children giggle]

56:56.496 --> 56:57.539
Very much.

56:59.958 --> 57:02.460
I wish I could be a princess.

57:02.544 --> 57:05.713
The most important thing
about being a princess

57:05.797 --> 57:08.133
is caring about other people.

57:08.216 --> 57:12.429
And if you do that,
then you're a princess in your heart.

57:13.054 --> 57:16.266
Can we all please say,
"Thank you, Lady Margaret"

57:16.349 --> 57:18.101
for her time here today?

57:18.184 --> 57:21.146
[in unison]
Thank you, Lady Margaret!

57:22.147 --> 57:23.898
You're very welcome.

57:27.652 --> 57:29.362
Is that your Christmas tree?

57:30.071 --> 57:31.614
Yes, it is.

57:31.698 --> 57:32.907
Where are the presents?

57:33.408 --> 57:35.869
We don't have the budget for presents.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.829
What about the money from the ball?

57:37.912 --> 57:41.749
It is earmarked for the essentials:
food, clothes.

57:41.833 --> 57:44.169
So the children don't get any toys?

57:44.252 --> 57:46.754
Toys are in short supply.

57:47.505 --> 57:50.592
But we usually manage
to find a wee little something

57:50.675 --> 57:53.761
to pop in their stockings
on Christmas morning.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.772
I trust it was a good visit?

58:05.440 --> 58:07.775
It was very educational.

58:07.859 --> 58:09.903
The families here don't have
a real Christmas tree

58:09.986 --> 58:11.112
or presents for the children.

58:12.655 --> 58:18.119
Unless we do the shopping,
and the wrapping, and the baking.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.955
You and I?

58:21.039 --> 58:21.956
Why not?

58:22.040 --> 58:24.000
You've already made
the proper gesture, Your Grace.

58:24.083 --> 58:27.045
A gesture isn't what Christmas is about.

58:29.547 --> 58:31.508
We have the afternoon free.

58:31.591 --> 58:32.800
Well...

58:33.468 --> 58:35.261
It's a very ambitious undertaking.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.643
So I suppose we'd better get right to it.

58:41.726 --> 58:44.020
[squeals]

58:44.854 --> 58:47.357
Oh! Uh, sorry.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.275
That wasn't very dignified.

58:50.026 --> 58:52.028
It's all right. I liked it actually.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.282
Frank, the nearest toy emporium
on the double.

58:56.866 --> 58:59.452
A toy emporium.

58:59.536 --> 59:02.789
Frederick's on Palmetto Road,
Your Majesty.

59:02.872 --> 59:03.957
Frederick's.

59:11.631 --> 59:12.924
Palmetto Road.

59:13.383 --> 59:16.427
According to the guide book,
the fountain is right up ahead.

59:17.345 --> 59:19.013
Can I get a candy cane?

59:19.097 --> 59:21.224
Yeah. There you go. Knock yourself out.

59:22.141 --> 59:23.059
[chuckles]

59:25.103 --> 59:30.525
You know, there is a legend that says
the St. Nicholas Fountain never freezes

59:30.608 --> 59:33.111
because of the warmth
of the Christmas spirit.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.488
I'm guessing there's
an underground spring.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.283
Well, I like the legend better.

59:39.158 --> 59:41.035
You know what?
So do I.

59:41.786 --> 59:42.662
[chuckles]

59:43.580 --> 59:47.000
[man]
Excuse me? Are you Stacy De Novo?

59:47.083 --> 59:48.751
Yes. Yes, I am.

59:48.835 --> 59:51.087
Adam Delaney, Food Insider Magazine.

59:51.170 --> 59:54.799
I heard about your bakery in Chicago.
I'd love to do a feature on you.

59:54.882 --> 59:56.759
Hello! Brianna Michaels.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.595
I won the competition last year.

59:58.678 --> 59:59.971
Great.

1:00:00.054 --> 1:00:03.433
So the buzz is
you're the one to beat this year.

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:07.770
Oh, well, uh, it's not just me.

1:00:07.854 --> 1:00:09.522
We are a team.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:13.776
This is Kevin, my very talented sous-chef.

1:00:14.277 --> 1:00:16.863
Kevin. Can I get your full name please?

1:00:16.946 --> 1:00:19.574
Yeah, sure. I'm Kevin Richards.

1:00:19.657 --> 1:00:21.868
[Delaney]
And how long have you been a team?

1:00:24.704 --> 1:00:26.914
-[Kevin] A long time now.
-[Stacy] Very.

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:39.385
[Prince Edward]
This is nice.

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:41.471
[Prince Edward and Stacy laugh]

1:00:42.930 --> 1:00:44.223
Oh, very nice.

1:00:44.682 --> 1:00:47.644
[gasps] I always wanted one of these.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:49.562
-[laughs]
-[gun sounds]

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.022
My parents never let me have one.

1:00:51.105 --> 1:00:53.816
Well, what's wrong with saving the Earth
from an alien invasion?

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:56.194
If you're going to save
the Earth from an alien invasion,

1:00:56.277 --> 1:00:58.613
you should probably do it
by diplomacy not warfare.

1:00:58.696 --> 1:00:59.906
-[scoffs]
-[gun sounds]

1:00:59.989 --> 1:01:02.200
Yes. We'll need about a dozen.

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:05.036
Ooh! And a few of these as well.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:09.332
Edward, look what they have.

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:15.046
Ooh! It's a mat
with... large colored circles.

1:01:15.713 --> 1:01:19.258
[laughs]
You've never played Twister before?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:20.551
Ah, it's a game.

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:23.721
Take off your shoes this instant.

1:01:23.805 --> 1:01:25.431
-[chuckles]
-Now.

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:29.102
[giggles]

1:01:30.186 --> 1:01:32.397
Has the Duchess always been so different?

1:01:33.731 --> 1:01:37.110
Tell me, has the Prince always been so...

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:38.319
ordinary?

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:41.948
You're hiding something.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

1:01:42.782 --> 1:01:46.202
You're going to be looking
for a long, long time.

1:01:47.370 --> 1:01:51.749
[Stacy and Prince Edward laughing]

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:53.042
Right hand red.

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:55.294
[both laughing]

1:01:57.338 --> 1:02:00.717
So, that's how you do things in Montenaro.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:04.220
It was nice of you
to let me do that interview.

1:02:04.303 --> 1:02:05.680
Well, you deserve it.

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:09.058
Guys, come look! It's a toy store!

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:10.810
I've never been in a toy store.

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:12.478
What?

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:14.772
Um, what she means is

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:19.110
she's never been
to a "Belgravian" toy store.

1:02:19.193 --> 1:02:20.069
Oh.

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:21.946
-[Olivia] Come on!
-Lead the way!

1:02:26.951 --> 1:02:28.161
All right.

1:02:32.206 --> 1:02:34.041
Oh, wow!

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.213
Geez Louise!

1:02:40.631 --> 1:02:41.507
Excuse me?

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:44.385
My earring from Aunt Louise, it's gone!

1:02:45.052 --> 1:02:47.597
Yes, yes. Maybe look over there.

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:50.641
-I changed my mind. Let's go see Santa.
-Yeah!

1:02:50.725 --> 1:02:53.686
-We just saw Santa.
-Yeah, but he and I didn't go deep.

1:02:54.812 --> 1:02:59.025
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
I feel so... so faint!

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:02.069
First, you wanna go shopping.
Now, you wanna see Santa.

1:03:02.153 --> 1:03:03.321
What's going on with you?

1:03:03.404 --> 1:03:05.198
Come on, Liv. Spill.

1:03:05.281 --> 1:03:10.203
Excuse me. Sorry to be a bother.
My car has run out of petrol.

1:03:10.286 --> 1:03:12.705
The station is down the street,
but I can't push it myself.

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:14.957
Think you could give an old man a hand?

1:03:15.041 --> 1:03:16.793
Of course we can.

1:03:16.876 --> 1:03:19.754
-Yes, here we go.
-Just hot. Thank you.

1:03:19.837 --> 1:03:21.130
Wait a second. I know you.

1:03:21.214 --> 1:03:23.591
On the square in town,
you had one of those booths.

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:26.594
Closed early today.
Rheumatism's acting up.

1:03:26.677 --> 1:03:28.304
The car's right outside.

1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:30.097
Great! Let's go.

1:03:30.181 --> 1:03:31.432
Okay.

1:03:36.562 --> 1:03:38.856
Oh, wait! I see it.

1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:40.525
-Here it is.
-Ah!

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:43.402
-Yes. Close one.
-Right.

1:03:46.447 --> 1:03:47.657
-Cooled down?
-Yes.

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:50.201
There we go. I feel much better now.
It's fine.

1:04:03.714 --> 1:04:05.508
Here. Try this.

1:04:05.591 --> 1:04:07.093
[chuckles]

1:04:12.765 --> 1:04:14.767
Where did a Duchess learn
to bake like this?

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:16.018
My father.

1:04:17.812 --> 1:04:19.272
Your father?

1:04:19.355 --> 1:04:21.858
The Grand Duke of Montenaro baked cookies?

1:04:21.941 --> 1:04:23.109
Best cookies in the world.

1:04:23.192 --> 1:04:24.652
You miss him, don't you?

1:04:26.237 --> 1:04:28.322
I'm generally not the sentimental type,

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:32.076
but doing things like this helps
keep a piece of the past alive.

1:04:32.159 --> 1:04:33.786
[Prince Edward]
Yes, I know what you mean.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:36.581
I used to love the smell
of turkey roasting at Christmas.

1:04:36.664 --> 1:04:38.875
It meant my cousins were coming over
to play.

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.459
That was a long time ago.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:44.422
It's still all right to play sometimes.

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:47.174
[Prince Edward chuckles wryly]
Not so sure about that.

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:48.843
Well, I am.

1:04:52.513 --> 1:04:53.848
[Prince Edward]
All right.

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:58.895
-[laughs] Here.
-Okay.

1:05:00.229 --> 1:05:02.565
Hang on. I think there's a couple more.

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:06.402
I wrapped that one.

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:08.779
Your Highness wrapped
the presents himself?

1:05:08.863 --> 1:05:10.948
-Really?
-A few. With a little help.

1:05:11.032 --> 1:05:14.243
Taking the time to wrap a gift
is part of the gift itself.

1:05:14.327 --> 1:05:16.120
It's what we say in Montenaro anyway.

1:05:16.203 --> 1:05:18.539
Well, it's not very dignified for a royal.

1:05:18.623 --> 1:05:20.583
It's always dignified to be kind, Frank.

1:05:21.876 --> 1:05:23.920
-Right. Shall we?
-Yes.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:29.842
-Do you see what's going on out there?
-I do.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:31.510
[King George]
I don't like it.

1:05:32.053 --> 1:05:34.055
There's something about that girl.

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:38.017
George! She's a breath of fresh air.

1:05:39.143 --> 1:05:41.896
And it seems your son
is falling in love with her.

1:05:43.147 --> 1:05:44.649
Yes.

1:05:44.732 --> 1:05:46.817
Well, I suppose that's all that matters.

1:05:47.485 --> 1:05:49.695
You know that's all that matters.

1:06:26.899 --> 1:06:28.567
I've always wanted one of these!

1:06:28.651 --> 1:06:31.570
Good. We need someone
to defend our galaxy.

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:33.656
When diplomacy fails.

1:06:33.739 --> 1:06:36.784
Look! I really am a princess!

1:06:36.867 --> 1:06:39.036
Your Majesty!

1:06:40.997 --> 1:06:46.669
Your Royal Highness and Lady Margaret
have given us so much this Christmas.

1:06:46.752 --> 1:06:48.629
Well, it was all the Duchess's idea.

1:06:49.130 --> 1:06:52.008
Well, it was a very gracious gesture.

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:57.054
That's just it. Christmas is about more
than just a gesture,

1:06:57.138 --> 1:06:58.305
which is why I've decided

1:06:58.389 --> 1:07:01.142
that Lady Margaret and I are going
to make it a tradition

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:03.185
to come here once a month
and get to know you all.

1:07:10.359 --> 1:07:11.861
That's wonderful.

1:07:13.070 --> 1:07:14.613
Excuse me.

1:07:14.697 --> 1:07:17.324
You're standing under the mistletoe.

1:07:17.408 --> 1:07:18.617
[Mrs. McBride]
Oh!

1:07:18.701 --> 1:07:19.910
Ah, so we are!

1:07:32.965 --> 1:07:36.927
-Who wants to go play Twister?
-Twister? My favorite. Come on, Frank.

1:07:37.011 --> 1:07:38.971
That's not really
in my job description, sir.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:40.681
It is now. Come on.

1:07:42.558 --> 1:07:46.854
Oh! That was the best spaghetti
I've ever had.

1:07:46.937 --> 1:07:49.857
Since you're doing the heavy lifting
at the competition tomorrow,

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:52.026
I figured it's the least I could do.

1:07:54.820 --> 1:07:57.323
-So, are we going out tonight?
-Ooh!

1:07:57.406 --> 1:07:58.699
-You're going to bed.
-[grumbles]

1:07:58.783 --> 1:08:01.535
We have an early start tomorrow.
We got to be at Wembley by 8:00.

1:08:01.619 --> 1:08:03.037
-But--
-Pajamas.

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:04.038
Now.

1:08:04.121 --> 1:08:05.414
Can Stacy tuck me in?

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:07.750
Sure.

1:08:14.924 --> 1:08:17.468
She never runs out of energy, does she?

1:08:18.177 --> 1:08:19.303
Her mom was like that.

1:08:20.638 --> 1:08:22.056
Do you miss her mother?

1:08:22.723 --> 1:08:24.975
-You know me better than that, Stace.
-[chuckles]

1:08:25.059 --> 1:08:26.477
Karen and I weren't meant to be.

1:08:27.645 --> 1:08:29.146
Like you and Paul.

1:08:31.023 --> 1:08:32.399
Well, you're right.

1:08:33.818 --> 1:08:34.944
We weren't.

1:08:41.909 --> 1:08:43.160
[knocks]

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:50.751
So I guess you're leaving tonight.

1:08:50.835 --> 1:08:51.919
I don't have a choice.

1:08:52.002 --> 1:08:53.671
I wish you could stay.

1:08:55.673 --> 1:08:57.341
I wish I could too.

1:08:57.842 --> 1:08:59.969
But you'll have Stacy back,

1:09:00.052 --> 1:09:02.054
and I must get on with my duty.

1:09:02.138 --> 1:09:06.392
Which means you have to do things
even if you don't want to do them?

1:09:07.017 --> 1:09:08.185
Something like that.

1:09:08.269 --> 1:09:09.603
That's not fair.

1:09:09.687 --> 1:09:10.646
It's complicated,

1:09:10.729 --> 1:09:13.691
but I'll never forget you
and your father.

1:09:13.774 --> 1:09:15.818
You'll always be special to me.

1:09:16.402 --> 1:09:18.154
But you're meant to be here.

1:09:20.531 --> 1:09:23.075
I'm afraid I don't get
to decide things like that.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.660
You should.

1:09:41.093 --> 1:09:42.469
[sighs]

1:09:43.762 --> 1:09:46.849
You know, I think this trip
has done you a lot of good.

1:09:47.516 --> 1:09:49.310
-You do?
-I mean,

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:51.604
it's almost like
you're not the same person.

1:09:51.687 --> 1:09:53.230
[laughs]

1:09:53.314 --> 1:09:54.982
-Please!
-No, I mean it.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:57.484
There's just something less...

1:09:58.402 --> 1:09:59.695
intense about you.

1:10:00.821 --> 1:10:02.114
I don't know.

1:10:02.656 --> 1:10:04.408
Just being here,

1:10:05.159 --> 1:10:06.911
making Christmas ornaments,

1:10:08.412 --> 1:10:09.914
singing carols.

1:10:10.623 --> 1:10:13.542
I mean, all those little moments with you.

1:10:15.419 --> 1:10:17.129
It's what life's really about.

1:10:20.424 --> 1:10:22.843
That is the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1:10:22.927 --> 1:10:24.553
Well, it's true.

1:10:27.431 --> 1:10:28.390
So...

1:10:29.934 --> 1:10:32.144
-Wanna watch a Christmas movie?
-Sure.

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:33.771
Which one?

1:10:33.854 --> 1:10:36.774
The... one with Santa.

1:10:38.234 --> 1:10:39.944
Stace, they all got Santa.
[chuckles]

1:10:40.027 --> 1:10:43.697
[laughs] Right.
Then you choose.

1:10:45.449 --> 1:10:46.533
[Kevin]
This one.

1:10:46.617 --> 1:10:49.036
Ooh! Your favorite?

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:52.831
-No, it's your favorite.
-Right.

1:10:53.582 --> 1:10:55.334
I was just messing with you.

1:10:58.087 --> 1:10:59.421
I'll pop the corn.

1:11:06.512 --> 1:11:08.264
[Prince Edward]
I've learned so much from you.

1:11:08.347 --> 1:11:11.100
Like how to bake cookies
and wrap presents?

1:11:11.183 --> 1:11:15.396
Like how to understand people
and how to reach out to them.

1:11:16.355 --> 1:11:18.315
You have a good heart, Edward.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:20.025
You're going to do just fine.

1:11:20.734 --> 1:11:22.486
As long as you're here to help me.

1:11:23.988 --> 1:11:27.074
Well, I suppose it's time to turn in.

1:11:27.741 --> 1:11:30.035
I wanted to give you something.

1:11:30.953 --> 1:11:33.872
Didn't have time to wrap it,
but... probably for the best.

1:11:37.710 --> 1:11:40.713
"Veritas, Anoris, Amare."

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:44.341
"Truth, honor, and...

1:11:47.469 --> 1:11:48.429
love."

1:11:50.681 --> 1:11:51.640
The family crest.

1:11:52.891 --> 1:11:54.310
The one from the painting.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:57.646
It belonged to your grandmother.

1:11:58.647 --> 1:12:00.899
Margaret, if I'm being truthful...

1:12:01.483 --> 1:12:04.611
I was worried about us,
about the wedding, about...

1:12:05.362 --> 1:12:07.698
-not knowing who you are.
-Yeah.

1:12:07.781 --> 1:12:08.699
But after today,

1:12:09.450 --> 1:12:10.993
I'm not worried anymore.

1:12:12.619 --> 1:12:14.872
You really are Prince Charming.

1:12:22.546 --> 1:12:23.630
I...

1:12:24.590 --> 1:12:25.924
-Did I do something wrong?
-No.

1:12:27.051 --> 1:12:29.636
No, you did everything right.

1:12:30.971 --> 1:12:32.514
Well, then I'll see you in the morning.

1:12:34.933 --> 1:12:37.269
You will see your Duchess in the morning.

1:12:46.653 --> 1:12:49.782
[sniffles]

1:13:02.252 --> 1:13:05.547
There is nothing like a happy ending
to make someone cry.

1:13:05.631 --> 1:13:08.258
Endings usually aren't very happy.

1:13:12.721 --> 1:13:14.556
Hey, what is it, Stace?

1:13:15.933 --> 1:13:19.895
I don't know.
Just feeling sentimental again.

1:13:20.938 --> 1:13:22.314
Must be the movie.

1:13:24.191 --> 1:13:26.318
Well, speaking of sentimental...

1:13:26.985 --> 1:13:27.945
Don't kill me.

1:13:29.905 --> 1:13:31.532
I got you a little something.

1:13:31.615 --> 1:13:33.367
But it's not Christmas yet.

1:13:33.450 --> 1:13:36.787
-It's not for Christmas.
-Then what's it for?

1:13:39.331 --> 1:13:40.582
It's in your stocking.

1:13:55.222 --> 1:13:56.098
Open it.

1:14:03.397 --> 1:14:04.314
What do you think?

1:14:06.775 --> 1:14:09.319
It's the most beautiful gift
I've ever received.

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.282
Thank you so much.

1:14:15.242 --> 1:14:16.118
May I?

1:14:19.163 --> 1:14:22.958
Look, I know...
we've been friends for so long.

1:14:28.088 --> 1:14:31.091
But these last few days, I...

1:14:32.426 --> 1:14:34.052
I felt like it could be more.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:37.931
At least... to me.

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:42.978
I think you felt it too.

1:14:51.403 --> 1:14:53.489
-Something wrong?
-No.

1:14:55.532 --> 1:14:56.700
Yes.

1:14:57.951 --> 1:15:01.747
I mean, it's me.
I should not have done that.

1:15:01.830 --> 1:15:05.083
-It's okay.
-No, it's... It's not.

1:15:08.086 --> 1:15:11.381
Can we just pretend this never happened?

1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:14.134
Why?

1:15:15.594 --> 1:15:19.848
Please, you just have to trust me on this.

1:15:22.059 --> 1:15:23.477
Yeah, sure.

1:15:24.061 --> 1:15:25.020
Whatever you say.

1:15:26.688 --> 1:15:27.773
Thank you.

1:15:33.153 --> 1:15:34.404
Good night.

1:15:36.740 --> 1:15:37.741
Good night.

1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:12.609
[clock chiming]

1:16:12.693 --> 1:16:14.695
[knocking on door]

1:16:25.414 --> 1:16:27.040
I will be right outside.

1:16:27.624 --> 1:16:28.667
Thank you.

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:38.176
[Stacy] So, did you get to do
everything you wanted?

1:16:38.844 --> 1:16:39.678
Almost.

1:16:40.304 --> 1:16:42.764
And you and Edward got on all right?

1:16:42.848 --> 1:16:45.183
Yeah. Everything's set for your wedding.

1:16:45.684 --> 1:16:47.144
Splendid.

1:16:48.437 --> 1:16:52.941
You know, Edward's really special.
He's thoughtful. He's kind.

1:16:53.025 --> 1:16:55.569
Your friend Kevin is the real prince.

1:16:55.652 --> 1:16:57.738
No, Kevin is just Kevin.

1:16:57.821 --> 1:16:59.114
He's one in a million.

1:16:59.197 --> 1:17:01.617
No, Edward is the one who...

1:17:04.745 --> 1:17:06.413
You're in love with Edward!

1:17:10.125 --> 1:17:12.377
And you're in love with Kevin!

1:17:13.754 --> 1:17:14.713
Oh!

1:17:16.256 --> 1:17:18.550
Well, this wasn't supposed to happen.

1:17:18.634 --> 1:17:20.260
No, it wasn't.

1:17:21.595 --> 1:17:23.764
So, what do we do?

1:17:24.765 --> 1:17:25.766
Nothing.

1:17:26.391 --> 1:17:28.393
You go back to being the Duchess,

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:31.855
and I hop on a plane back to Chicago
as soon as the competition's over.

1:17:36.151 --> 1:17:39.112
Oh, I believe this belongs to you.

1:17:45.827 --> 1:17:50.123
[shutter clicking]

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:53.418
What?

1:17:56.588 --> 1:18:00.717
[shutter clicking]

1:18:00.801 --> 1:18:03.804
Whoa! [yells]

1:18:10.310 --> 1:18:11.478
[sighs with satisfaction]

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:13.980
Ow!

1:18:30.831 --> 1:18:32.374
Is it really you?

1:18:32.457 --> 1:18:34.918
[chuckles]
It's really me.

1:18:38.922 --> 1:18:39.881
[chuckles]

1:18:46.346 --> 1:18:47.264
[laughs]

1:18:47.347 --> 1:18:49.099
It really is you.

1:18:50.642 --> 1:18:53.061
Well, do you have
to sound so disappointed?

1:18:53.145 --> 1:18:55.480
No, no, no.
I'm really glad that you're back.

1:18:55.564 --> 1:18:58.859
It's just I really wish
Margaret didn't have to go.

1:18:58.942 --> 1:19:01.319
And now she has to marry
that creepy, old prince

1:19:01.403 --> 1:19:03.280
who probably smells like mothballs.

1:19:04.531 --> 1:19:08.326
Okay, first of all, the Prince
does not smell like mothballs,

1:19:08.410 --> 1:19:10.454
and he's definitely not creepy.

1:19:10.537 --> 1:19:11.621
Then what was he?

1:19:11.705 --> 1:19:12.956
Dreamy.

1:19:14.082 --> 1:19:15.250
Sweet.

1:19:16.376 --> 1:19:17.836
[chuckles]
Funny.

1:19:18.670 --> 1:19:22.215
Sounds like someone's crushing big time
on Prince Mothballs.

1:19:23.550 --> 1:19:27.512
Look, all I know is we have got
a big competition today, which means...

1:19:28.180 --> 1:19:30.390
we need to focus, okay?

1:19:41.193 --> 1:19:42.068
Yes?

1:19:42.152 --> 1:19:44.029
I have urgent business with the King.

1:19:44.613 --> 1:19:47.240
Anything that concerns the King
concerns me as well.

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:48.492
It's a very delicate matter.

1:19:48.575 --> 1:19:52.287
I really should speak
to His Royal Highness directly.

1:19:53.413 --> 1:19:54.539
I see.

1:19:56.041 --> 1:19:59.336
It would be such a shame to lose one's job
right before Christmas, wouldn't it?

1:19:59.419 --> 1:20:01.546
-But--
-Hand me the envelope, Frank.

1:20:01.630 --> 1:20:02.547
But it's...

1:20:02.631 --> 1:20:04.966
Or would you prefer
to hand in your resignation?

1:20:05.050 --> 1:20:06.676
No. No.

1:20:07.385 --> 1:20:08.512
Your Majesty.

1:20:10.931 --> 1:20:12.098
Oh, and, Frank,

1:20:12.182 --> 1:20:15.644
there seems to be a plumbing problem
in the privy next to the study.

1:20:15.727 --> 1:20:17.103
Would you mind taking a look?

1:20:18.605 --> 1:20:21.858
It would be my great honor, Your Majesty.

1:20:38.416 --> 1:20:40.585
-Your bath is ready, Your Grace.
-Thank you.

1:20:41.419 --> 1:20:42.712
Forgive me for speaking plainly,

1:20:42.796 --> 1:20:45.715
but that doesn't sound
like a very happy bride-to-be.

1:20:46.508 --> 1:20:48.635
My happiness isn't what matters.

1:20:49.594 --> 1:20:50.428
It's my duty.

1:20:51.930 --> 1:20:55.851
Oh, before I forget,
Miss De Novo gave me this to give to you.

1:20:55.934 --> 1:20:57.936
It's a gift from Edward.

1:21:01.523 --> 1:21:04.860
"Veritas, Anoris, Amare."

1:21:07.529 --> 1:21:08.780
"Truth, honor, and love."

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:09.698
Funny thing,

1:21:09.781 --> 1:21:12.742
it doesn't say a word about duty.

1:21:30.802 --> 1:21:31.928
Remarkable.

1:21:33.179 --> 1:21:36.266
A remarkable resemblance,
wouldn't you say?

1:21:38.518 --> 1:21:41.271
Apparently, she's a baker
at the competition in Wembley.

1:21:45.609 --> 1:21:47.903
Looks like a princess to me.

1:22:00.165 --> 1:22:03.627
[show host] Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could please find your places

1:22:03.710 --> 1:22:06.755
and make way to your seats.
The competition is about to begin.

1:22:08.882 --> 1:22:10.926
-Looks like we're good to go.
-Great.

1:22:13.428 --> 1:22:15.597
Stace, about last night--

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:17.432
Let's just talk about it
on the plane, okay?

1:22:17.974 --> 1:22:19.476
-Yeah.
-Cool.

1:22:21.353 --> 1:22:22.812
Good afternoon, and welcome

1:22:22.896 --> 1:22:26.858
to Belgravia's 56th Annual International
Christmas Baking Competition.

1:22:26.942 --> 1:22:30.111
The finest bakers from around the world
will have five hours

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:32.989
to prepare the most spectacular
Christmas cake.

1:22:33.073 --> 1:22:35.408
Only one will be crowned winner.

1:22:35.492 --> 1:22:37.410
And the competition begins...

1:22:38.370 --> 1:22:39.287
now.

1:22:51.883 --> 1:22:52.884
Darling!

1:22:54.511 --> 1:22:56.846
And how is the blushing bride-to-be?

1:22:56.930 --> 1:22:58.848
Very well, Your Majesty.

1:22:58.932 --> 1:23:00.016
Edward has been telling us

1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:02.227
about your adventure
at the shelter yesterday.

1:23:02.310 --> 1:23:05.397
I understand you made
a lot of people very happy.

1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:08.441
She was magnificent, a born leader.

1:23:08.525 --> 1:23:10.276
I must say I'm very impressed.

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:12.153
Thank you, Your Highness.

1:23:12.862 --> 1:23:15.115
You know, I'm feeling
a bit under the weather.

1:23:15.198 --> 1:23:18.660
-I hope it's nothing serious.
-No, it's just a bit of fatigue.

1:23:18.743 --> 1:23:21.079
Edward, would you be a dove

1:23:21.162 --> 1:23:25.542
and take my place with Margaret
at the baking competition today?

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:27.377
I'm supposed to be handing out
some ribbons,

1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:29.004
and I don't think I have the strength.

1:23:29.087 --> 1:23:31.047
Oh, yes, we'd be glad to.

1:23:31.756 --> 1:23:33.049
Something wrong, my dear?

1:23:34.801 --> 1:23:36.344
I...

1:23:37.095 --> 1:23:39.139
I don't know if we have the time.

1:23:39.222 --> 1:23:40.682
Of course we have the time.

1:23:40.807 --> 1:23:42.559
But the wedding--

1:23:42.642 --> 1:23:45.395
I would imagine the staff
has everything under control.

1:23:49.524 --> 1:23:51.526
Will you excuse me for a moment?

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:08.752
More gold! More sparkles.

1:24:09.419 --> 1:24:11.129
This isn't a funeral. It's Christmas!

1:24:15.133 --> 1:24:17.218
-We're gonna need more poinsettias.
-I'm on it!

1:24:17.302 --> 1:24:18.386
Those layers cool yet?

1:24:18.470 --> 1:24:20.388
Uh... Needs five more minutes.

1:24:20.472 --> 1:24:22.682
-I'm gonna start on the filling.
-Yeah.

1:24:26.394 --> 1:24:27.729
Kevin?

1:24:27.812 --> 1:24:28.688
[Kevin]
Jeez!

1:24:29.981 --> 1:24:31.608
How am I supposed to puree the berries?

1:24:31.691 --> 1:24:33.318
You're gonna have to do it by hand.

1:24:38.531 --> 1:24:40.408
-You got this, okay?
-Okay.

1:24:41.242 --> 1:24:42.202
Yeah, we're good.

1:24:46.414 --> 1:24:48.166
I've been looking all over for you.

1:24:48.249 --> 1:24:49.542
I needed some fresh air.

1:24:50.001 --> 1:24:50.919
Oh.

1:24:52.754 --> 1:24:54.172
Well, I was worried about you.

1:24:56.424 --> 1:24:58.051
Please don't.

1:25:00.845 --> 1:25:03.223
Look, Margaret,
I don't know what's wrong.

1:25:04.182 --> 1:25:07.685
Whatever it is, if you don't want
to hand out a bunch of silly ribbons,

1:25:07.769 --> 1:25:09.562
just say so. We don't have to.

1:25:11.564 --> 1:25:13.608
No, we have to go.

1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:15.443
But...

1:25:17.529 --> 1:25:19.656
There's something
I need to tell you first.

1:25:21.324 --> 1:25:22.408
Sounds serious.

1:25:22.992 --> 1:25:24.452
Well, it is.

1:25:24.536 --> 1:25:26.538
It's about truth and honor.

1:25:28.164 --> 1:25:29.749
But mostly, it's about love.

1:25:32.168 --> 1:25:36.714
[show host]
Eight, seven, six, five,

1:25:36.798 --> 1:25:40.635
four, three, two, one...

1:25:41.094 --> 1:25:43.263
Time is up. Well done.

1:25:57.068 --> 1:25:59.612
Frank, we need to get
to Wembley on the double.

1:26:04.909 --> 1:26:07.537
-Now this should be interesting.
-Oh, shut it, Frank.

1:26:09.247 --> 1:26:11.457
It's incredible presentation.

1:26:11.541 --> 1:26:13.918
And your sugar work is commendable.

1:26:14.002 --> 1:26:15.128
Thank you, judge.

1:26:15.211 --> 1:26:16.921
[judge]
The filling is interesting.

1:26:17.005 --> 1:26:20.091
The puree isn't as smooth as I'd hoped.

1:26:20.175 --> 1:26:23.094
But it has a wonderful flavor.

1:26:23.178 --> 1:26:24.262
Nicely done.

1:26:36.733 --> 1:26:38.526
The judges have reached a decision.

1:26:38.610 --> 1:26:40.028
In third place...

1:26:41.029 --> 1:26:44.699
is Zachary Brachmann of Munich, Germany.
Well done, Zachary.

1:26:47.744 --> 1:26:50.413
In second place is...

1:26:54.209 --> 1:26:57.295
Is Brianna Michaels of Beverly Hills, USA.

1:26:57.378 --> 1:26:59.005
Well done, Brianna.

1:27:00.006 --> 1:27:01.591
Okay. who's next?

1:27:04.385 --> 1:27:06.179
And in first place,

1:27:06.262 --> 1:27:07.388
the winner

1:27:07.472 --> 1:27:11.768
of the 56th Annual International
Christmas Baking Competition is...

1:27:12.810 --> 1:27:15.521
Stacy De Novo, Chicago, USA.

1:27:15.605 --> 1:27:16.522
Well done, Stacy.

1:27:20.568 --> 1:27:24.614
Now, since Queen Caroline was unable
to attend today's ceremony,

1:27:24.697 --> 1:27:26.574
presenting the award...

1:27:27.242 --> 1:27:30.161
is Prince Edward of Belgravia
and his fiancée,

1:27:30.245 --> 1:27:32.247
Duchess Margaret of Montenaro.

1:27:32.330 --> 1:27:34.791
Now if the winners
would like to please join me on stage

1:27:34.874 --> 1:27:36.626
for the awards ceremony. Thank you.

1:27:37.460 --> 1:27:40.088
You know, who needs a silly medal?

1:27:40.171 --> 1:27:41.464
I think we should go.

1:27:41.547 --> 1:27:43.800
Are you crazy?
Stace, this is our moment.

1:27:43.883 --> 1:27:45.885
Yeah, but we're gonna be late
for the plane, so...

1:27:45.969 --> 1:27:47.929
I'm going up there,
and you're coming with me.

1:27:48.012 --> 1:27:51.891
[show host] Ladies and gentlemen,
Prince Edward and Duchess Margaret.

1:27:51.975 --> 1:27:53.977
[crowd applauding]

1:28:10.660 --> 1:28:12.203
And here it goes.

1:28:12.787 --> 1:28:13.830
What's going on?

1:28:14.497 --> 1:28:16.416
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.418
Try me.

1:28:18.501 --> 1:28:20.420
I think I can explain.

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:26.634
There's...

1:28:27.051 --> 1:28:29.220
-There's two of you?
-No.

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:32.181
No. But we think that we may be related

1:28:32.265 --> 1:28:34.892
through some great, great someone in-law.

1:28:35.310 --> 1:28:36.436
-Cousin Cecil.
-Yeah.

1:28:37.979 --> 1:28:39.689
I think we need a moment to ourselves.

1:28:39.772 --> 1:28:42.066
-Maybe let's go backstage.
-Perfect.

1:28:46.154 --> 1:28:47.155
[Stacy]
Let's go.

1:28:53.036 --> 1:28:56.289
Can someone please explain
what's going on?

1:28:56.372 --> 1:28:57.707
This is my fault.

1:28:57.790 --> 1:28:58.791
How's that?

1:28:58.875 --> 1:29:03.004
All I wanted to do was to get to know
what it was like to be a normal girl.

1:29:03.087 --> 1:29:05.173
Even if it was only for a few days.

1:29:05.256 --> 1:29:06.632
When I saw Stacy,

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:09.719
the idea just came to me.

1:29:11.679 --> 1:29:14.140
-You two switched places?
-Yeah.

1:29:14.766 --> 1:29:17.143
You've been with Margaret
for the past two days.

1:29:17.226 --> 1:29:19.520
And Stacy has been with the Prince.

1:29:21.105 --> 1:29:22.440
I'm sorry.

1:29:22.523 --> 1:29:25.026
I didn't think things would get
so complicated.

1:29:25.610 --> 1:29:27.320
Complicated is an interesting word for it.

1:29:28.863 --> 1:29:30.573
But there's more.

1:29:32.075 --> 1:29:33.201
How can there be more?

1:29:33.743 --> 1:29:35.828
I like being normal.

1:29:35.912 --> 1:29:37.997
I hate being in the spotlight.

1:29:39.415 --> 1:29:43.878
Edward needs a partner who likes
taking charge, who has a good heart.

1:29:44.462 --> 1:29:46.923
Someone who is meant to be a princess.

1:29:47.507 --> 1:29:48.883
Someone like Stacy.

1:29:49.425 --> 1:29:50.593
Wait. Me?

1:29:53.346 --> 1:29:55.932
I didn't plan any of this,

1:29:56.015 --> 1:29:59.102
but I suppose I found out
I'm just a normal girl.

1:29:59.769 --> 1:30:01.437
And normal girls,

1:30:01.521 --> 1:30:03.898
they fall in love with normal boys.

1:30:06.943 --> 1:30:08.069
Like you.

1:30:09.737 --> 1:30:12.615
-But you're not Stacy. You're--
-Margaret Delacourt,

1:30:12.698 --> 1:30:13.991
Duchess of Montenaro.

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.661
Aren't you supposed to marry the Prince?

1:30:16.744 --> 1:30:19.539
I know this is a little confusing, but...

1:30:19.622 --> 1:30:22.542
Lady Margaret is trying to say
that she's in love with you.

1:30:24.544 --> 1:30:25.545
Oh!

1:30:28.214 --> 1:30:29.924
Doesn't that kind of piss you off?

1:30:30.007 --> 1:30:31.217
Not at all, actually.

1:30:33.928 --> 1:30:35.430
Because I'm in love with her.

1:30:37.723 --> 1:30:39.684
Stacy brings out the best in me.

1:30:42.311 --> 1:30:44.480
The way you bring out the best in me.

1:30:46.065 --> 1:30:47.275
You're not mad at me?

1:30:47.984 --> 1:30:49.527
At us?

1:30:49.610 --> 1:30:52.989
If all of this ends with me getting
to be with the woman that I love,

1:30:53.072 --> 1:30:54.824
I am very happy.

1:30:55.450 --> 1:30:58.161
I intend to keep being happy
for the rest of my life.

1:31:03.166 --> 1:31:05.585
No. Edward, I...

1:31:06.419 --> 1:31:07.670
I can't let you do this.

1:31:10.256 --> 1:31:11.841
Stacy. Stacy, wait!

1:31:17.180 --> 1:31:19.015
We need to talk.

1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:23.853
How about we do it over a movie
and hot chocolate?

1:31:25.354 --> 1:31:26.439
It's a date.

1:31:27.857 --> 1:31:29.066
[Olivia]
Kiss her, Daddy!

1:31:49.086 --> 1:31:50.796
Stacy, wait! Please, stop.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:52.840
Edward, you can't be in love with me.

1:31:52.924 --> 1:31:55.343
-Says who?
-It isn't right.

1:31:55.426 --> 1:31:57.929
Okay, things happen according to plan.

1:31:58.012 --> 1:32:00.848
Life happens according to plan,
and this...

1:32:00.932 --> 1:32:02.767
This is not the way it was planned.

1:32:02.850 --> 1:32:06.270
-So you're saying you don't love me.
-No, that's not what I'm saying.

1:32:08.022 --> 1:32:11.192
I love you more than I've ever loved
anyone in my whole life.

1:32:12.068 --> 1:32:14.237
Then I'm not giving you up
without a fight.

1:32:15.613 --> 1:32:18.533
I'm not a duchess or a princess.

1:32:18.616 --> 1:32:21.661
I'm a baker from Chicago.

1:32:22.286 --> 1:32:24.205
You can still be a baker from Chicago.

1:32:24.789 --> 1:32:27.208
We'll pick up your shop,
and we'll move it here.

1:32:27.291 --> 1:32:28.918
[Stacy]
No, you can't do that.

1:32:29.001 --> 1:32:30.670
Then you can open up another shop here.

1:32:30.753 --> 1:32:32.672
You can bake to your heart's content.

1:32:33.339 --> 1:32:34.465
As long as we're together.

1:32:36.926 --> 1:32:38.594
This is crazy.

1:32:38.678 --> 1:32:39.762
No, it's not.

1:32:39.845 --> 1:32:41.472
Don't you understand?

1:32:42.932 --> 1:32:43.975
Stacy, you're my destiny.

1:32:44.934 --> 1:32:47.812
This was the plan.
We were meant to be together.

1:32:48.854 --> 1:32:50.898
You can't really be serious.

1:32:55.736 --> 1:32:57.947
[crowd gasps]

1:32:59.156 --> 1:33:00.491
Stacy De Novo,

1:33:02.034 --> 1:33:05.079
if you're still in love with me
a year from today,

1:33:06.831 --> 1:33:08.666
will you marry me next Christmas?

1:33:13.588 --> 1:33:14.839
Of course I'll marry you.

1:33:15.423 --> 1:33:17.008
Yes! Yeah!

1:33:28.519 --> 1:33:32.106

1:33:59.967 --> 1:34:01.969

1:34:17.526 --> 1:34:18.569
Yes, sweetheart?

1:34:18.653 --> 1:34:20.279
You're a real princess now, aren't you?

1:34:21.072 --> 1:34:22.198
She is indeed.

1:34:22.281 --> 1:34:25.117
I guess Christmas wishes
really do come true.

1:34:32.833 --> 1:34:34.585
Aren't you going to throw the bouquet?

1:34:34.669 --> 1:34:36.671

Marvelous.

1:34:59.485 --> 1:35:01.654
So, what are you doing New Year's?

1:35:01.737 --> 1:35:04.573
I don't have any plans. Why?

1:35:05.491 --> 1:35:07.368
You might want to hang on to that.

1:35:07.451 --> 1:35:08.536
Mm-hmm?

1:35:18.754 --> 1:35:22.091
