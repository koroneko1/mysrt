1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Don't listen to him.
That's just his bullshit honor talking.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
Samuel didn't kill him.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,480
Rebeka, how do you know that?

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,719
-Because he didn't do it.
-Aha.

5
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,159
So, you know he didn't do it, hmm?

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
All right.

7
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,240
Then who did?

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,680
Yeah. See you later. Hey. Phillipe.

9
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,359
How are you?

10
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,879
Good. It is what it is. And you?

11
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,319
Good. Have you given it any more thought?

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
You know? Greta, the counselor.

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,159
She's really cool.
I think she's a good option, right?

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,359
I don't know. I think I'll pass.

15
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,920
But thanks. I mean it.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,319
Phillipe.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,200
You won't get any better at this rate.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,599
And if you don't do the work,
I'm not waiting around for you.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,959
I mean, I'll go with you…

20
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,000
…but I need you
to make a little effort on your part.

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
-I'm serious.
-All right, yeah. Okay.

22
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,799
-I'll go.
-You will?

23
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,159
I'll go with you.

24
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,879
I promise you'll love Greta.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,799
-This is illegal, man.
-He's such a dictator!

26
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,959
This can't be.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,480
-What's with them?
-No idea.

28
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,120
What's going on here?

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,319
Gatherings of more
than three people are prohibited.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,359
You know that. So, what's going on?

31
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,840
When we load the school's app,

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,520
it activates geolocation,
and we can't deactivate it.

33
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,360
Well, that information's being gathered
for the sole purpose of keeping you safe.

34
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,400
The thing is,
we're not a bunch of lost puppies.

35
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,599
We don't need you to find us.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Yeah, exactly. And let's be honest.
You're kind of a nobody.

37
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,919
But I own businesses and half of Ibiza.
You want me to get kidnapped?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
You won't be. The location's encrypted.

39
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,560
In other words, you're gonna know
where we are at all times, right?

40
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,439
No one can access it except your families.
They can deactivate it if they wish.

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,759
Oh, really?
Then, why don't you deactivate mine?

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,159
If it's for our safety, I understand.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,879
In any case, you all have
far more important things to think about,

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,039
such as an exam in two days
that could make or break your GPA.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,319
-And most of you are falling behind.
-You took away points for no reason.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,719
And you'll lose even more
before the exam, Shanaa.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,199
Why don't you prove
you can do something other than complain?

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
The highest grades will have access

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,520
to the best internships
in any field they want to go into.

50
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, that's fucking rad.

51
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,159
-You're not even close.
-Not too far.

52
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,719
-Disperse them, please.
-What?

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,080
Come on, kids. Go to class.

54
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,080
Please. Come on.

55
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,800
Guys, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

56
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,599
Keep moving. Hurry up, kids!

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,319
Mencía.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,639
Don't give up everything you had

59
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,719
just to get brownie points
with our old man.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,719
Because don't forget that,
for him, it'll never be enough.

61
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,520
-Yeah, I saw him.
-Girl, that's fire. See ya. Yeah.

62
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,560
You may already be losing her.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,439
Listen, all of you!

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
My father may be in charge here,

65
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
but out there,
we're the ones who are in charge!

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
-Damn straight!
-A huge party's in order.

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,479
No damn rules or regulations

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,919
because we set the rules.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,479
Rule number one. No geolocation.

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,520
Anyone at the party will have to put
their phones in airplane mode. Got it?

71
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,199
And now that I'm thinking about it,
no official uniforms or attire allowed.

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,000
You know what?
Let's skip attire altogether!

73
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,759
Watch out,
Sauna Ken's makin' a comeback, huh?

74
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,319
So, wait. Hold on.
It's a party where everyone's naked?

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,199
A party where everyone goes
as far as they want to.

76
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,680
-Yeah.
-Rule two.

77
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
None of this social distancing.
Let's be all up in and on each other.

78
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,399
Well, damn. Fuckin' A.
I mean, I'm single and need some action.

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
-Let's slut it up!
-Get it, girl.

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,079
No. This is even if you're not single.
It'll be everyone with everyone.

81
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Rule number three.

82
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,160
Our main purpose here is to experiment,

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,879
which means no prejudices,
complexes, or other things.

84
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,639
You better leave
your sexual orientation by the door

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
or don't come in.

86
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Is this negotiable, or…?

87
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
Samuel, I'm the son of a dictator.
What do you think?

88
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,279
Okay. You do you, but…

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
-Ah.
-…I'm not risking it.

90
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,639
How about you, sis? You in?

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
I'm practically dying to go.

92
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,560
-It might be fun, right?
-You can't if you have doubts.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,519
Ari, come by yourself, okay?
It'll be way more fun.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
Trust me.

95
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,600
-All right, count me in too.
-Yeah?

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,839
-Oh shit!
-Perfect, guys. Let's do this.

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,319
So, I'll ask Isadora
to reserve the VIP area and get her to DJ.

98
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,360
Tomorrow night, anything goes!

99
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,199
Do whatever we fucking want! Whoo!

100
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,560
My background's in academic counseling.

101
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,600
Not the kind of thing
you're asking me for.

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Yeah. Yeah, we know.

103
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,079
Very well.
Then, I'll do what I can to help.

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,680
Are you two having sexual intercourse?

105
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,079
Shit.

106
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,519
You can rest assured,
everything we talk about is confidential.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
And I'm pretty sure

108
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Benjamín hasn't set up cameras
or microphones or anything.

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,839
Well, no. We're not together.

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,639
Any other partners?

111
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,839
No.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,959
Not with her or anyone.

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,879
Why not?

114
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,079
Why what?

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Why haven't you been having
sexual intercourse?

116
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,399
Because

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
I haven't felt like it.

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,439
Isn't there any girl out there that,
I don't know, that you've liked, or…

119
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,879
Not like her.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
This profile
you sometimes display--

121
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,800
-What profile?
-Your pattern.

122
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,079
The one that emerged
with Elodie and now with Cayetana.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
I don't know. We might call it
"overly impetuous," maybe.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
It's predatory.

125
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,639
What do they have in common?

126
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,920
-Those two?
-Them, the situation, everything.

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,759
Um…

128
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,680
That we both said no.

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,399
That I liked both of you a lot.

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
And with both of them,
you'd had a little too much to drink.

131
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
Right?

132
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,920
So, how was that? Okay?

133
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,040
I think it went well, no?

134
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,480
Sure.

135
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,879
What's the matter?

136
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,040
No, nothing.

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
It went well, no?

138
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,800
-Phillipe.
-At least you think so, right?

139
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
Is it the alcohol?

140
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,920
Are you upset
that she banned you from drinking?

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,279
No, no. It's not the alcohol.

142
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,920
It's, uh…

143
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,279
I don't know. It's the fact that…

144
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,519
that you called me a predator back there.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Because that's what I am to you?

146
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,720
A predator?

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,720
No.

148
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,360
It's just, no.

149
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,160
What I wanted to say was that,
when you drink, sometimes I think that…

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,279
when you're not conscious of your actions,
that side of you can come out.

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
But it's not who you are.

152
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,600
Caye…

153
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,160
…have you ever really had
the intention of forgiving me?

154
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,279
But for real?

155
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Phillipe, this is a bit of,
well, a journey.

156
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,519
I have no idea how all of this will end,
to be honest with you.

157
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,160
But for the moment,
I'm gonna be there by your side.

158
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,000
Go a little faster.
Come on, guys! Let's go!

159
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
Rebeka, go!

160
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,879
You're near ready
for the Olympics.

161
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,519
Oh shit, you can still speak?
I thought you'd lost your voice.

162
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,480
And your hand
since you don't ever call or text me back.

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
-There's the Rebeka I knew.
-And what's that mean?

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,039
-Good form. I like it. Go.
-Forget it.

165
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,679
Keep it up.

166
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,240
-One, two, three, four…
-Oh yeah, sure. I'll forget it.

167
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,879
'Cause we only talk when you want to.
You tryin' to drive me crazy?

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
No, you don't need to get crazier.

169
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,320
I got my fill with the 20 voice messages
you sent me in an hour yesterday.

170
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,840
Don't you think?

171
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, don't you worry. All right?

172
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,879
I won't send you any more.

173
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,240
I can be loyal, intense, and clingy,
even when someone treats me like shit.

174
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,679
Watch out.
'Cause when I flip the switch, I'm out.

175
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,440
Good job.

176
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,759
And I flipped it.

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
So, make sure you save those messages.

178
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Because when you decide
to change your mind and call me,

179
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,200
your ass will be blocked.

180
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,559
And those 20 messages will be
the one place you can hear my voice.

181
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,679
Girls, let's go.

182
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,799
You going or should I?

183
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
I will.

184
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,720
Hey there.

185
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,840
What are you doing here?

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
What would you like me to be doing?

187
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,000
-Hey, are you trying to get us kicked out?
-There are no cameras.

188
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,440
Are you sure?

189
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,399
I made sure.

190
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,480
Okay, stop it.

191
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,720
What's the matter? Just relax.

192
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,960
-Lately, you've been very Ira.
-And you've been very my father.

193
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you sure this party's gonna be
something you can handle?

194
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,080
Shh!

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,759
No, no. Don't cover her mouth.

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,320
-Oh shit! Fuck!
-How long has he been there?

197
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
-Perhaps my daughter has something to say.
-Dad, please leave! Get out!

198
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,440
I want to see you both
in my office. Separately.

199
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,799
Fuck. Didn't you say
there weren't cameras?

200
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,080
Don't be an idiot.
You think I didn't look?

201
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,919
Fuck. Shit. Ah, fuck.

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,679
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

203
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,879
Fucking, fucking fuck. Dude, I--

204
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,399
You aren't even going to bother
explaining yourselves?

205
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,240
I can apologize,
but there isn't much to explain.

206
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,480
You honestly don't know
how sorry we are.

207
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,320
I won't even begin to go down
the laundry list of rules you just broke.

208
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,759
-Dad, I know I broke 'em.
-It's "Benjamín" here.

209
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,399
-I got it.
-I'm not the principal right now.

210
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,279
I'm speaking as Ariadna's father.

211
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
But I'm the one who egged Samuel on.

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,799
What's gotten into you?
Why have you turned into this tramp?

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,039
What can I expect from your relationship
with my daughter, Samuel?

214
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,960
What?

215
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,639
Since you've been together,
Ari is running wild.

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
She's uncontrollable.

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
One day, everything's fine, and the next,
someone bashes you in the skull.

218
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,320
We lost Mom and almost Patrick and me.
Life's so random!

219
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,240
Do you get it? I'm doing what I want now.

220
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,600
Whatever I want.

221
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,120
Dad, you're not gonna get
a better explanation.

222
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,480
Benjamín.

223
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,159
Get to class.

224
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,639
Regardless, I still have high hopes
for you, Samuel.

225
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,919
You're hardworking, ambitious.
But you need to focus.

226
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,720
Both of you need to focus.

227
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,159
Because I need Ari
to go back to how she was.

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,879
But if I try to talk to her, if I attempt
to get strict with Ari right now,

229
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,919
I'm gonna get the opposite effect.
She'll rebel even more.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,799
-But if you reined her in…
-No way. She's the one holding the reins.

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,320
Make her think she still is, then.

232
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,840
But don't disappoint me

233
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
once again.

234
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,679
Hello?

235
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,080
Bro, you can't be here. Sorry.

236
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,679
Sorry.

237
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm just looking for food.

238
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,000
Please, sir.

239
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,200
Bilal, right?

240
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,720
Nice to meet you. I'm Omar.

241
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
Where are you from?

242
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
Comores.

243
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,799
-Where?
-Comores.

244
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,399
I've never heard of it.
I'm from Palestine.

245
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,600
Is it cool with your facility
you're wandering around?

246
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,639
There's too many of us.

247
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,799
They won't miss me.
I'm not looking for trouble.

248
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,720
Just for work.

249
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,120
I can maybe help with that part.

250
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,039
I assume you can wash dishes
and mop floors?

251
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,360
-Yeah, sure.
-Hop to it.

252
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay, your lunch break's over.

253
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,039
Thank you.
Merci beaucoup. Thank you.

254
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,679
Don't say thank you. Get to work. Come on.

255
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,399
Let's go. Allez, allez.

256
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
Let's see if I understood you.

257
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
You're giving away your wine collection,
but you're not coming to the party?

258
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,120
No alcohol.

259
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,480
I made a promise.

260
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,600
To who? Little Ash Girl?

261
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,320
What?

262
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,159
-The janitor, the cleaning lady, the maid…
-Okay, okay, okay. I got it.

263
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,200
And she's a witch too. Who knew?

264
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,679
How does she wield
so much power in her broom?

265
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,600
Well, I'm out. Have fun.

266
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,960
You're trying too hard for the wrong girl.

267
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,440
That's enough, all right?

268
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
-Cayetana is--
-Yes, she is.

269
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,759
She's the person
who abandoned you when you need her most.

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,200
She didn't abandon me, though.
She's made things clear.

271
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,440
Her path's hers,
and she wants to walk by my side.

272
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,399
Mm-hmm. By your side.

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,879
Not with you.

274
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,879
Aren't you happy?

275
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,120
You get ten an hour.

276
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,080
Sure. Thank you.

277
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,840
De rien. 

278
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,840
But you're sure you're cool with it?

279
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,759
More tomorrow?

280
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,519
Tomorrow, mm…

281
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
No, it's my day off.

282
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,919
But I'll call you, okay?
It'll just be here and there at first.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,039
You wanna take some food with you?

284
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,039
There's always leftovers,
I mean, and they'll just throw it out.

285
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,720
It's not much. A little pasta, bread.

286
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,200
But, hey, it's something.

287
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,000
What do you prefer,
pasta or hamburger?

288
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm sorry.
I needed the cash.

289
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,480
Get out.

290
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to steal. I was forced to.

291
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,240
-Get out now.
-I'm so sorry.

292
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,559
Some gangsters--

293
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
Dude, I said, get out.

294
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,279
Fuck.

295
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,640
You won't do it again.

296
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Do what?

297
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,960
Well, I mean, trusting someone blindly
just 'cause.

298
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,359
I don't get it. Why do people just go
and throw away opportunities? Y'know?

299
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
I don't know.

300
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,839
You tell me.

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,279
What's with your tone?

302
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,160
We have an important exam tomorrow,
and you're determined to go to that party.

303
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,079
That's all.

304
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,599
-Yeah, but Samuel, dude, that's not fair.
-Come on. I need to study.

305
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,640
And close the door when you--

306
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,519
-Hmm. Nah.
-Let's see.

307
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,359
Oh, okay. Yeah.
These aren't a bad option for tonight.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,359
Tonight?

309
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,839
For the party.

310
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,480
-May be a bit short, I think.
-You think?

311
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,920
I love them like this.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,599
But Patrick likes everything
to be a bit more, well, elegant.

313
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,920
After all, it's his party. Right?

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,960
-Oh, Patrick's party.
-Ari.

315
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,599
-Coming?
-Sure.

316
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Patrick.

317
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,599
I'll catch up to you.

318
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,480
So, you're having a party, huh?

319
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,359
I'm not invited?

320
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,920
-Hmm. It's not your thing.
-Why not?

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,799
This party is so we can be free to…
to, um… mingle,

322
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,759
make out, get high, grind.

323
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,160
To experiment a bit,

324
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,640
without fear, prejudice, or rules.

325
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,599
Only for the brave.

326
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,519
Then I'll be there.

327
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,839
Well, you might have to try
a thing or two.

328
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Then I'll try it.

329
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,359
That right?

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,960
Your legs are trembling.

331
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,279
I'm just nervous
about seeing you chicken out.

332
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,279
Guess I'll see you tonight.

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,799
The decision to get rid of
all the alcohol in your collection

334
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,519
is very responsible of you.

335
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:31,960
Phillipe?

336
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,400
-Hmm?
-Are you here with us?

337
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,960
Mm-hmm.

338
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,960
Something you'd like to share?

339
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,559
Well, uh, the fact is…
I have doubts, Greta and Cayetana.

340
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,480
Uh, let's see.
For starters, this thing we're doing--

341
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,000
By "this thing,"
you're referring to our meetings?

342
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,880
Yes, this. Coming here
so you can tell me all the ways I'm wrong.

343
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,799
Well, I don't think-- I don't believe
I've used the term "wrong" or "right."

344
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,599
Well, okay. Either way, though,
if you're gonna tell me how to change,

345
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,000
uh, and she's not really gonna do
much more than listen and nod,

346
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,920
I mean, I think you could just e-mail me
the instructions in a PDF,

347
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
and I'll do it at home on my own.

348
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,079
What's with all this?

349
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,039
You don't wanna be with me, do you?

350
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
What?

351
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,480
I mean, are… are you gonna be with me,
really supporting me?

352
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,759
Right there, holding my hand
through all this?

353
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,559
Wait, hold on.
You see me sitting here, don't you?

354
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, but… but I mean
like the way we were before.

355
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,160
Together, me and you.

356
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:39,319
Phillipe, you need to do this
for yourself.

357
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Not for me
or to make me get back together with you.

358
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,279
Well, that's really all I needed to hear.

359
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,279
Thanks a lot, Greta.

360
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Thank you both.

361
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,000
What the hell?

362
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,359
You're going to the party?

363
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,319
'Cause I thought maybe you'd like
to come over to my house to study.

364
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
I mean, I'm the one
who'd like you to come over.

365
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,599
What's this about?

366
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,119
Um, when I study without you,
I'm less productive.

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
Even though we tended to get distracted.

368
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,519
Mencía, what do you want?

369
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,960
I want to…

370
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,359
to give it another go.

371
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm sorry. I was selfish.

372
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,119
I never thought about what I was doing
or the consequences of any of my actions,

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,279
and I really miss you.

374
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,440
Don't you kinda miss me too?
Even a teensy bit?

375
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,079
Whoa, okay. No need to flip out.
I don't miss you that much. It's just--

376
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Cut to the chase.

377
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,920
Please just come over tonight.

378
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Look, Mencía. I actually really need you
to come over for once.

379
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,160
To the party.

380
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,640
Mencía, I also wanna try again.

381
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,599
But I can't jump every time you call.

382
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,039
I can't, kid.
So, if you're serious, then come.

383
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,519
If you really care about me,
that's all I'm asking from you.

384
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,119
Come.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,839
Okay.

386
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,519
Oh my God.

387
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,720
Yeah, "Oh my God."
But we're not staying long.

388
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,680
-It's spectacular.
-Huh?

389
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
All right! Everyone, over here, please.

390
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,519
Listen up.

391
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,359
I'm here to remind you that this evening,
there are no goddamn rules!

392
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
And there's no curfew tonight!

393
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,799
There is no… social distancing.

394
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,200
Discipline can get fucked!

395
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,480
Get crazy, go!

396
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,839
Take photos!

397
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,319
Make videos! But don't send them tonight.

398
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,960
Don't switch out of airplane mode.
I mean, ever.

399
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,559
Don't let anyone know where we are.
Fuck adults!

400
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,000
Tomorrow, everyone will see
that we're goddamn free!

401
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,799
Don't forget out there!

402
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,039
Tonight, anything goes!

403
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,240
Whoo!

404
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
AIRPLANE MODE

405
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,400
DAD
PATRICK

406
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,680
Pink essence of Ibiza for everyone.

407
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,160
You really know how to party, baby.

408
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
Ah?

409
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,960
Mencía!

410
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,440
So, now your brother's
completely lost his mind too?

411
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,759
Where is he?

412
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
No idea.

413
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,279
No, of course.

414
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,920
NO STUDENTS CONNECTED

415
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,240
Do you want your dose of Ibiza, baby?

416
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
It's not alcohol.

417
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
There you go.

418
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,519
Go all out. Very good. Nice work.

419
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,079
Where's Mencía?

420
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,759
Kill the flash. Jesus.
You're gonna make me blind, kid.

421
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,960
Studying.

422
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,160
She's not comin'.

423
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,759
Okay, great. Slutting it up.

424
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,799
Soccer player's
fuckin' hot, right?

425
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,359
Damn, I need a drink, boo.

426
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,079
Oh, you came after all.

427
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,480
Where'd you leave your hang-ups?

428
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
In the coatroom.

429
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,799
And your absolutely
unbreakable heterosexuality?

430
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,279
Parked outside.

431
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,759
Someone might steal it.

432
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,720
These are too tight.

433
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
Come with me.

434
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,880
How many times have you jerked off,
thinking about this moment, huh?

435
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,200
What's this?
Now you're playing hard to get?

436
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,559
Wait for me. I'm in charge here.

437
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,680
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were gay.

438
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm just playing.

439
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,480
Anything goes, you know?

440
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,599
I don't know.
I don't know. I have my doubts.

441
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,400
Help me get rid of them?

442
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,640
And is this mine,
or did Patrick leave it behind?

443
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,119
Figure it out.

444
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,119
Whoo-hoo!

445
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,599
There you go.
Go all out. Very good. Nice work.

446
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Kill the flash. Jesus.
You're gonna make me blind.

447
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,759
What's the matter? Wasn't that convincing?

448
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,480
-Ari, are you serious?
-What?

449
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,680
Don't let anyone control you
or tell you what you're allowed to do

450
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,440
or what you can try or not.

451
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,799
Our chemistry's fucking great.

452
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,200
What did you say?

453
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,039
-Hey. Whoa, whoa there, partner.
-What?

454
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,960
You're not sinking one
in this net tonight.

455
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,160
Fuck, but you really, really turn me on.

456
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,640
-And you wanted to also?
-Yes, I wanted to. I wanted to want to.

457
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,680
But I don't want to, and I won't.

458
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,079
Even drunk, I can't kid myself.

459
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,680
Turns out, I'm an even bigger dyke
than I thought I was.

460
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,359
Uh-uh. But our chemistry.

461
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,599
Hey, come on.
We need to get outta here soon.

462
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,359
Well then, we'll have to speed things up
if we wanna experiment a bit, y'know?

463
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,559
Will you do whatever I want?

464
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,079
Samuel, I know perfectly well
when we have to leave,

465
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,480
and that is not right now.

466
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,079
So, shake off this little mood you're in,

467
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,240
and let's make the most of our time
and do things.

468
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,200
That's what we came here for.
Isn't that right?

469
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,559
You gonna do what I want? Yes or no?

470
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,759
Come on, babe.

471
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,559
Only if you do whatever I ask you to do.

472
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,319
Ask away.

473
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,440
I want to see you with another girl.

474
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,079
C'mon.

475
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Hi.

476
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,680
Hi.

477
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
-I really like your glasses.
-Thank you.

478
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,400
And I really like your dress.

479
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,759
-Hey, wanna make out?
-Obviously.

480
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,640
Hey, yo! What's the matter, man?

481
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Why are you so upset?

482
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,519
-It's nothing.
-What's the matter?

483
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:45,240
-I let people hurt me because I'm stupid.
-Huh?

484
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,000
Then us damaged goods
can hang out here together, okay?

485
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,920
We'll show them they can't take us down.

486
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,359
What the hell? What?

487
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,480
Does this seem normal to you?

488
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Well, yeah. I mean,
Patrick is just super hot.

489
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,920
Huh? No, Omar. I mean,
he promised he would quit drinking.

490
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,480
-Cayetana.
-Hey.

491
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,880
It's his life.

492
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,440
His choice.

493
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,599
-But his choices affect people who--
-Who what?

494
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,279
Who care about him?

495
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,279
-Yeah.
-Who worry about him?

496
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,920
Who love him?

497
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,640
-Omar.
-Come on, say it. It's no big deal.

498
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,960
No. That's not it.
It's just, he doesn't love himself, okay?

499
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,599
Look, Caye.

500
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,400
Your turn.

501
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,760
-What? No, Ari. We're about to leave.
-Don't waste the time we have left.

502
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,159
Samuel, so I did what you told me,
and now it's your turn.

503
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,400
I wanna try.

504
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,039
You'll get to try death if your father
catches us getting home late.

505
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,719
No. He won't kill me today
because I'm staying here.

506
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,159
Jesus Christ.

507
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,559
Am I even the one
that you're worried about?

508
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,800
You're more worried
about my dad's reaction?

509
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,440
Who are you dating? My dad or me?

510
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,800
-The guy who holds the scholarships?
-Ari, no. That's not why I'm with you.

511
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,719
-But your father's betting on me.
-I'm betting on you too.

512
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,159
Who are you betting on?

513
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,760
Which of us are you trying to please?

514
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,679
Is it clear now?

515
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
Whoo!

516
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,079
Hey!

517
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,920
Is it me you were looking for?

518
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,679
Oh, yeah. There's something I owe you.

519
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,719
Are you pissed off at me?

520
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,760
What for?

521
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,960
Because of Rebe?

522
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,199
Please, the chick left me
with a case of blue balls.

523
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,360
She's super hot, though.

524
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,159
Plus, I mean, makin' out with a lesbian
is also a way to experiment, right?

525
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,639
You're pissed off? Seriously?

526
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,880
I'm always fucking serious.

527
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm not an in-the-closet cocktease
who's super fucking repressed.

528
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,239
Not again, man.

529
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,800
I've told you a million times. I'm hetero.

530
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,719
Yeah, sure you are. In your words.
What about your eyes?

531
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
What about your hands?

532
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,800
I mean, you gladly touched my dick
in the shower, then my ass in your bed.

533
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
Bullshit, you're hetero.

534
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,119
You gotta be fucking kidding.

535
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,039
-What?
-You're hooked on me.

536
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,199
Super hooked.

537
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,280
Really? No fucking way.

538
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Hey, I haven't done anything with you
that I wouldn't do with any friend, okay?

539
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,000
What I'd do with any friend. But with her?

540
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,079
I'd do a lot with her.

541
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,559
Yeah, all right. Sure.
But you haven't kissed me.

542
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,400
And I'm not going to.

543
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,480
Because you're scared
to make out with a dude, right?

544
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,480
If you are,
why don't you go the fuck home?

545
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,199
I'm not scared.

546
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,519
-Ah, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

547
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,679
Let's see.

548
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,519
Okay, watch me.

549
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,719
Hey, where are you going?

550
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,119
Sorry, guys.

551
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,960
-Anything goes, right?
-Yeah.

552
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119
Fucking delicious, Samuel.

553
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,119
Who do you taste like?

554
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,159
What are you doing?

555
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
-What am I doing?
-Yeah. What the fuck are you doing?

556
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,320
-What are you doing here?
-I just--

557
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,639
You're breaking the dress code.

558
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,519
-Why's she wearing so many clothes?
-Stop. Leave me alone, all right?

559
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,239
-Stop now. For real.
-God.

560
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,679
Listen to me. Don't just throw away
all the progress you've made.

561
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,719
-The first step's hardest. You took it.
-No. Leave me alone.

562
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
Leave me alone, Caye! Okay?

563
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,239
You want me to…

564
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,239
Okay. Just wow.

565
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,719
-Can you please stop?
-Fuck! Let me live my life!

566
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
-Hey!
-What?

567
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,679
-What?
-Stop it. Just chill out.

568
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,800
For a cleaning lady, you're pretty good
at messing everything up. Huh?

569
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,880
Ah!

570
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,519
Hey, Mencía!

571
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
I'm excited you're here.
You're gonna have a blast!

572
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,400
-Ari, let's go. We have to go home.
-What?

573
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,440
Dad told me to get you.

574
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,840
-We have to go home, now.
-No. I'm staying right here.

575
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,719
-You're staying.
-Let's go. I'm telling you.

576
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,119
-We have to go home.
-I said no!

577
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,119
Hello?

578
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,559
Fuck.

579
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,039
Hey, man.

580
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,480
No. No, no, no.
Get outta here.

581
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,920
Sorry.

582
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,719
-I said no. Get out.
-I needed money was all.

583
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,679
Sure. I fucking need money too. So?

584
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,840
Listen to me.

585
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,159
-They're threatening me.
-Don't care.

586
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,960
If you were trustworthy,
no one would threaten you, okay?

587
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,320
I'm sorry. Really.

588
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,239
They're coming for me,
and I don't know where to go.

589
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,719
Please.

590
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Please.

591
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,760
Fuck.

592
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,679
Don't feel guilty for a second.
Honestly.

593
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,280
This whole life thing
is about having a bomb-ass time,

594
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,320
about relaxing, about being happy.

595
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,119
And are you happy, or are you not?

596
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,840
-Mm.
-Exactly. Right.

597
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,159
So, then, who is some cleaning lady
or anyone to tell you what's right?

598
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,400
She your mama? Your mama? No.

599
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,719
On top of that, you're nailing it all.

600
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,639
Like, you know,

601
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,519
if anyone were to do for me even half
of what you're doing for her,

602
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,760
then I would never let him go.

603
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Never.

604
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,639
Honestly.

605
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,559
I mean, just thinking about it
makes me wet.

606
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,440
But you don't know me at all.

607
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,079
See?

608
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,599
I wasn't lying.

609
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,199
I'm here for you, whenever you want.

610
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Got it? Hmm?

611
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,360
Dad?

612
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,039
Why are you here?

613
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,719
Who did it?

614
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,079
Not Samuel.

615
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,599
Then what is Samuel doing, Rebeka?

616
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,039
Is he protecting someone?

617
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,639
Or is it you

618
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,519
who's trying to protect Samuel?

619
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,719
Rebeka,

620
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,599
what do you know?
