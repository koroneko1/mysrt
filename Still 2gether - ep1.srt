1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,840
Hi, guys. I'm Tine, Mr. Chic.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,440
This guy next to me is…

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,720
Tine's boyfriend.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,200
What? Am I wrong?

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,680
Hi, guys. I'm Tine, Mr. Chic,

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,600
and this guy is Sarawat.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,120
Want to know how we met?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
It started out when I was hit on by someone.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,320
I rejected him and turned him down so many times,

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,000
but he never left.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,480
So I asked this guy to pretend to hit on me

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,520
and be my shield.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,880
Not only did he refuse to help…

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,600
If you keep staring at me,

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,760
I'll knock you out with a kiss.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,920
Look at him.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,280
I didn't give up, though.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,680
I tried to join the Music Club just to pursue him.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,160
He didn't know he failed the audition.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,400
I was the one that begged the seniors to accept him.

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,400
Truth be told, I've had a crush on him for so long.

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,960
So I was fooled big time.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,880
I thought he was pretending, but no, he hit on me for real.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,880
In the end…

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,040
this little fool is mine.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
We've been together for over a year now.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,760
Many things have changed.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,800
We moved into a new place that is closer to the university.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,240
I got a new guitar. And he got… See it for yourself.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Do you like it?

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,200
Of course.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,200
I like it too.

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
-You mean the speaker? -No. I like you.

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
-Wat, have you seen my laundry basket? -It's in the same spot.

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,200
You can use mine. We live together now. What's the problem?

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,080
In the same spot, you say?

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,920
Tine, what the heck are you playing?

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Our loving moments, which are usually few, slowly hit rock bottom

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
and were replaced by chaos.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
Wat, get up.

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
Wat!

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,760
Wat!

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
Damn it!

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,480
You're like this again!

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Tine…

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,840
Come closer.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,120
Stop.

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,520
I already washed my face.

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
-I don't want to eat frozen food. -Quit complaining.

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
We're blessed to have food on the table.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Nope.

52
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,800
You used to cook me green curry

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,760
and stewed pork with eggs every day.

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,040
Are you going to eat or not?

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
Yes, dear.

56
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Hey.

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,480
Come on!

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,320
Tine, have you seen my sausages?

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,640
-They can't just disappear. -Maybe you already ate them.

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,600
Tine. Give it back.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,360
Hey!

62
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,360
It's mine now. Spit it out, then.

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Wat?

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,000
What is it?

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,360
I told you to turn your clothes inside out before washing.

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Do it now.

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
It's my shirt. Why bother?

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,360
Stop talking.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,280
Hey.

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,760
Sometimes I wonder if other couples in a long-term relationship…

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,200
are like us.

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
Type.

73
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,840
I have finished the washing. Do you want me to hang them now?

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,440
I told you a million times, before washing clothes,

75
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,320
you have to make sure the pockets are empty first. Look.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
Bits of paper are all over.

77
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Get rid of them.

78
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,320
I get you now, Wat.

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,960
They are so much alike, these two brothers.

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,440
What did you say?

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
Nothing. I'm just cleaning them.

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,800
I wonder if other couples are like us.

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,120
You are such a good kid.

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
I tricked you to help me build the model.

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
I thought you wanted to see a movie.

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,240
What are you mumbling about?

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
Nothing.

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
All right.

90
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,600
There's too much glue. Put it down.

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
I think dating each other

92
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,760
is only the beginning.

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,120
We will have to face a lot more.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,720
As long as we keep holding each other's hands,

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,000
no matter what is there waiting for us, we will go through it eventually.

96
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,080
Because we are together.

97
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,080
No. Because we are still together.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,680
And that was the story of "WatTine,"

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,520
the hottest couple in our university.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,640
Before we say goodbye,

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
can you please do a cute couple pose for the fans?

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,520
So they can capture and enjoy your sweet moments.

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Like this.

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,760
What are you doing?

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,640
Sarawat, come on.

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
Your fans will love it.

107
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,360
Why do I need to do this?

108
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
All right, everyone. Let's say goodbye right here.

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,120

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,240
Have a great day, guys.

113
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
Sarawat.

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,760
Can't you just do this one thing? The fans want to ship you two so bad.

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,320
Ship what?

116
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
We are a real couple. Our love is real.

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
We don't need to put on an act.

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,360
Whatever you say, boss.

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,640
When we earn some money or get sponsored,

120
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm going to share them with you, okay?

121
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
Green.

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,880
How about you pay me first?

123
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm a cameraman and an editor.

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,720
-Come on. -I should be paid.

125
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
But I already paid you with my body, dear.

126
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
By the way, Tine,

127
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,200
when you are free, can I get a solo interview with you again?

128
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,000
I think I've said everything.

129
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,240
No.

130
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Well…

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,520
There's still one thing people want to know.

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,760
They are curious

133
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,400
about Pam.

134
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
Huh?

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,640
They want to know how things actually were.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,000
I heard some say that Sarawat was hugging that girl.

137
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,160
And when you were in a hospital, Sarawat didn't look after you, Tine.

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Green, who said Sarawat didn't look after him?

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
Right?

140
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,960
You were there taking care of me?

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
Well, the thing is…

142
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,440
I just realized I forgot to shut off the gas valve at home.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,640
No, you didn't, but you're about to start a fire here.

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,040
Oops! It's catching fire.

145
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,520
Hurry, Dim. There's a fire!

146
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
Here. We should go too.

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Wait.

148
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,320
What did Dim mean?

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
Did you come to the hospital?

150
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,800
I did.

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,760
Is there anything else I don't know about?

152
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
What do you want to know?

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,960
I know it was a long time ago,

154
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
but it's still stuck in my head.

155
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,400
Why did you hug Pam that day?

156
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
It was a difficult situation for me.

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,560
Pam is my close friend.

158
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,600
She was crying in front of me.

159
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,600
I just meant to comfort her and then follow you.

160
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
Right. That's true.

161
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,360
So you let Mil take me to the hospital instead.

162
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,320
You were sick. Did you really want me to start a fight?

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,880
Actually, I was there sitting next to you all night.

164
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,880
I went home and changed the next morning.

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
When I came back, you refused to talk to me.

166
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,040
It was not funny.

167
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,320
Not just that. When I got home,

168
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,800
I found your bracelet left in our place.

169
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,520
So I thought you didn't want to see me again.

170
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,360
Why didn't you tell me?

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
Well, you didn't ask.

172
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,240
Let bygones be bygones. We shouldn't bring it up.

173
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Tine.

174
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,560
You are my first boyfriend.

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Sometimes we don't realize we made a mistake until it's already happened.

176
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
I make mistakes from time to time,

177
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
but I never intend to hurt you, Tine.

178
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm sorry too.

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
I am sorry I jumped to conclusions so easily.

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
From this day on,

182
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,680
whatever is in our minds, we need to have a heart-to-heart talk.

183
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,680
-Okay. -Promise?

184
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Promise.

185
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,200
Now I'd like to be frank with you.

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,920
-Can I grab your boobs? -Hey!

187
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Not again. Come on.

188
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,160
What a perv.

189
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Wait.

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm meeting Fang for lunch. It's a meal with codeshare students.

191
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Shit. I'm running late. I have to go now.

192
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,800
-Okay. -See you at home. Later.

193
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
Eat up.

194
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,640
It's my treat, but don't order too many meat dishes.

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
Order vegetables. Veggies are good for you.

196
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
Pass that over here.

197
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,560
That's right.

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Could you pass some to me? Why are you late?

199
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,480
Hold on. Who said you could sit?

201
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,120
-Oh. -You kept us waiting.

202
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,560
You'll be punished for that.

203
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,840
Come on. I'll be punished anyway even if I'm on time.

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Everyone!

205
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,400
This is Tine, the legendary chic guy from our codeshare.

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,560
He will show us his moves. Do you want to see?

207
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
-Yes! -Yes!

208
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,360
Fang.

209
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,800
You made me do it last year.

210
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,560
Do I need to do it again?

211
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
Of course. Now get up.

212
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,200
-You do it with me. -No!

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
-Let's dance. -Just you. Hurry up.

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
-Do it fiercely. -You should do it with me.

215
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,640
No. Just dance already.

216
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,840
Now.

217
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,280
-Come on. -Goodness.

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Show us your signature moves.

219
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy.

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,520
I like to act cute.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
I can be top, but bottom is also fine.

222
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,480
I like to strike hard!

223
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Strike!

224
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,720
Do it again. Make it harder.

225
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,600
-Strike! -Right.

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
That's it.

227
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
I couldn't hear what you said.

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,120
Sarawat.

229
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Wat, why are you here?

230
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,400
What was that dance?

231
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,400
It's like a kid's dance.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,120
Oh, I can see that you're shy.

233
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,280
You've got a backup here. Look, Wat.

234
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
If you love him, dance with him.

235
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
-Splendid! -Come on.

236
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
I left my phone somewhere.

237
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
Sarawat, come here.

238
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,240
-Just go. -Go on.

239
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,480
Give it up for them.

240
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,800
-I'm leaving. -Hey!

241
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,280
Don't go just yet.

242
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Ready?

243
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,840
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy.

244
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,040
I like to act cute.

245
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,560
Come on. Be cute.

246
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,280
My name is Tine. I am a chic guy.

247
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,320
I like to act cute.

248
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,960
Cute.

249
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,320
Try to be cute, will you?

250
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,080
That's cute.

251
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
I can be top, but bottom is also fine.

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,960
I like to strike hard!

253
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
Strike!

254
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,760
Why are you smiling?

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,720
I just…

256
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,440
smile for a cutie.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
He gets a head pat.

258
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,240
All right, guys.

259
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,000
Come and have a seat. Please.

260
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,400
Should we go now?

261
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,840
-Okay. Drive safe. See you. Bye. -I'm waiting for Tine.

262
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,000
-I'll see you later, then. -Hold on.

263
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
What is it?

264
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
I have something to talk to you about.

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,480
Here. Pillowcases.

266
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,720
They're in different colors.

267
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,120
Come on. It doesn't matter.

268
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,040
They don't go well together. Just get new ones.

269
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Blue is pretty though.

270
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,160
No. Get the ones in the same color.

271
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,320
By the way, Fang asked me something earlier.

272
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,720
Dim asked for my opinion too.

273
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,520
-Really? -Yes.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
You go first, then.

275
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,840
You know that Dim already graduated.

276
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,920
And he said…

277
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,600
he doesn't have much time for the club,

278
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,080
so he asked me to be the club president.

279
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,640
-Is that so? -Yes, it is.

280
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,920
What did you say?

281
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
He asked me personally. What else could I say?

282
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,920
But I have one condition.

283
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,040
You have to be…

284
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
my secretary.

285
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,560
I'd love to.

286
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,280
But…

287
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,800
But Fang also asked you to be the Cheerleading Club president.

288
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,400
Yes.

289
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,800
It's hard to say no to her.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,880
Hey.

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,960
I really want to work with you.

292
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,480
Okay.

293
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,240
It's fine. I understand.

294
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
Hey.

295
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
What are you doing?

296
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,280
Testing the bedsheet.

297
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Soft as always.

298
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,000
-Testing the bedsheet? I'll go-- -Hey.

299
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,240
Let's do this.

300
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,640
I will help you make the decision.

301
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,280
You just have to choose between two choices.

302
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,480
Your first choice is that I'll become your secretary.

303
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,720
And the second one,

304
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,440
you'll make me your secretary.

305
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
Whichever choice I make,

306
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll end up being your secretary.

307
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,080
Now you get smarter, little fool.

308
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,960
What a cheater.

309
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
What do you say?

310
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
Yes or no?

311
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Fine. It's a yes.

312
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,920
Well, should a secretary start working tonight?

313
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,280
You may start now.

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
Hi.

315
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,240
Well, hello.

316
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,400
Hurry up. Take a seat.

317
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,280
Sit right here.

318
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,880
Tine, come with me.

319
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,840
-Sit. -Wat, move a bit to the left.

320
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,200
To the left.

321
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,160
-Is it okay now? -A bit to the right.

322
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,880
-I mean, to your right. -Sorry.

323
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
That's it.

324
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,000
Now pick up the guitar.

325
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,240
Pick it up.

326
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you two for taking this job.

327
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,880
Let's not waste any more time. Let's shoot.

328
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,040
-Okay. -Here's your script.

329
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,560
Don't worry too much about it.

330
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,760
What are we doing exactly?

331
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
It's a live video to promote our club.

332
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,920
But the seniors didn't have to do anything like this.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,880
Come on.

334
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,800
It's a new normal, you know. Social media is a must.

335
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,360
Don't fuss about it.

336
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
Especially you, Wat.

337
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,840
-You need to be friendlier. -Hey, people are joining our live session.

338
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
-They're coming in. -Be friendly.

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
-Should we start now? -But I don't want to.

340
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,560
-Be nice and friendly. -Five, four, three, two…

341
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,320
-What? -Say something.

342
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Introduce yourself. Anything.

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,840
-Anything? -Seriously.

344
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
Tine, please say hello.

345
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
Greet the audience.

346
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,800
Hi, guys. I'm Tine, Mr. Chic. I'm the club secretary.

347
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,480
This is Sarawat, the club president.

348
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
Today, we're going to tell you what is special about our club.

349
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
We have so many likes. Can you make some cute gestures?

350
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,040
Like a mini-heart or something.

351
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,280
A love sign.

352
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,240
A lot of students from our university are watching.

353
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
This one goes, "Tine, can I be your fan?"

354
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
-Wow. -Sure.

355
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,120
Please join our Music Club.

356
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,160
"You two look so handsome."

357
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,720
"Tine is adorable."

358
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
Go on. Give them more love.

359
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,720
Oops.

360
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,160
I may not be so smiley as him,

361
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,080
but I can play the guitar.

362
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,800
Wow.

363
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
There's a new comment.

364
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,720
"Sarawat, can you play a song to hit on us?"

365
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Of course, dear.

366
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Okay.

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,000
Time has brought us

368
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,720
Together

369
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,440
The bond we create each day

370
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,400
Is getting more and more meaningful

371
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm back.

372
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,440
Did you miss me?

373
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,840
-Huh? -I do…

374
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,320
I do wonder when you'll stop putting used paper in the printer.

375
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,960
It's good that I saw them first.

376
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,840
If I brought these to my boss, I'd be doomed.

377
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,520
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,680
I just thought we could use the other side.

379
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,440
Look. I bought you your favorites.

380
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
See? We have plenty.

381
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,800
Aren't you aware that I am on a diet?

382
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,920
-Fine. I can take care of them myself. -You can't.

383
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm on a diet,

384
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,240
and so are you.

385
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
Look at this one.

386
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,920
It's your ultimate favorite.

387
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
This is also delicious.

388
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,160
Type…

389
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
Take off your shoes.

390
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,080
I dance every single day. I'll never be fat.

391
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
I may not be so smiley like him,

392
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,400
but I can play the guitar.

393
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
-There's a new comment. -What is it?

394
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,560
"Sarawat, can you play a song…"

395
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm watching the club president entertain his fans.

396
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,520
Are you jealous?

397
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,680
Don't be silly.

398
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
You're just playing a Scrubb song for your fans.

399
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
Why would I be jealous?

400
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,560
Why don't you just throw a concert already?

401
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,840
Look at this.

402
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,040
You sent them a lot of mini-hearts.

403
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,320
You also smiled from ear to ear.

404
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
Did I get to say anything?

405
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,560
I simply did what I was told.

406
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,200
I see.

407
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,760
Then why are you being mad?

408
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,360
You said we should have a heart-to-heart talk.

409
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,160
Just admit you're jealous.

410
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
No, I'm not.

411
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,880
-You shouted. That's not convincing. -I'm not.

412
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,800
-It's high-pitched. -I'm not jealous.

413
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,920
You get jealous just because of a mini-heart.

414
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
Huh?

415
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
You're so cute.

416
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,520
I told you.

417
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,880
For other people,

418
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,920
they have to ask me to do it.

419
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,200
But for you,

420
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,480
I do it by heart, not by duty.

421
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,280
Yuck.

422
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
So cheesy.

423
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Here.

424
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,360
Well…

425
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,920
Can I request a song, Mr. President?

426
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,080
Any song, Mr. Secretary.

427
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
It's late. Get some sleep.

428
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm reading comments from today's live.

429
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,160
A lot of people are interested in joining our club.

430
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,800
IS HE THE ONE WHO GOT IN BECAUSE HE HAS CONNECTIONS?

431
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,160
I HEARD HE DIDN'T EVEN PASS THE AUDITION?

432
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
HIS BOYFRIEND IS THE BOSS. THAT'S WHY.

433
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,560
Just don't read them.

434
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,320
It's full of rubbish comments.

435
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Don't think about it.

436
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
I know.

437
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,600
You get some sleep. I'll listen to music.

438
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,720
No way.

439
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,840
I won't let you get sad all alone again. Let's sleep now.

440
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,600
Or do you want me to knock you out with a kiss?

441
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,240
I've heard that for over a year now.

442
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,080
And I haven't been knocked out yet.

443
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,280
Are you challenging me?

444
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,560
I'll knock you out.

445
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I'm kidding.

446
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
I'm going to sleep now.

447
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,640
I mean it.

448
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,080
-Still can't sleep? I'll help. -I'm sleeping. I am.

449
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,320
You're safe tonight.

450
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Good night, then. I'll turn off the light.

451
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
What?

452
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
You said I was safe.

453
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,560
Don't ask for it. Now sleep.

454
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Good night.

455
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,440
Good night.

456
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,000
Stop reading it already.

457
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
Why are people so good at criticizing?

458
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,320
You realize that, and you're reading them anyway.

459
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
Enough.

460
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,360
Hey.

461
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
Phuak just yelled at us through his post.

462
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
He's mad because we didn't see him off.

463
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,360
But we had a test.

464
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,640
We threw him a farewell party yesterday. Why so demanding?

465
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,280
It's an exchange program for a few months. Don't be dramatic.

466
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,880
-Here. Let me yell back. -See?

467
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,160
You guys get hot-headed too.

468
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,040
Well, this one is our friend,

469
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,040
but those comments you're reading are from people you don't know.

470
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,920
Even their profile pictures are fake.

471
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,560
With fake profile pictures, their comments are so harsh.

472
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,440
Exactly.

473
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,960
It's like what I told you before.

474
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,440
Couples shouldn't work together.

475
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,840
It causes a lot of headaches.

476
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,520
Why is that?

477
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,440
These trolls are all on Team #SarawatsWives.

478
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,280
They see you guys spending time together and get envious.

479
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,600
So they dig up your past to sabotage you.

480
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
Unbelievable.

481
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,240
If I were him, reading these comments, I'd quit immediately.

482
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Ohm, you brat.

483
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,440
Don't suggest to him to quit his relationship.

484
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,120
-I mean quit being his secretary. -Oh, I see.

485
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,720
Quit?

486
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,360
Yes, quit being the secretary.

487
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,560
Okay.

488
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,760
Hey.

489
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,920
-Mine is empty. Can I have a sip? -No way.

490
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,800
Damn. What a jerk.

491
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,080
-Sorry. -Happy, huh?

492
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,120
Like, four times.

493
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,640
Sorry about that.

494
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,640
Sorry, Boss. I'm sorry.

495
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,600
I'll see you later, then.

496
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,720
Boss, you've had eyes on her for a year.

497
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,840
When will you make a move?

498
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,800
A girl like her won't be single for long.

499
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,960
Today, I will join the Music Club.

500
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,720
Last year, WatTine couple happened.

501
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
This year, everyone will learn about…

502
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,760
BossPear!

503
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,560
Pear resigned just now.

504
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,480
What?

505
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,360
She wants to find what she really likes.

506
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,760
Do you still want to join the club? Go and figure out yourself.

507
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,280
Guys, let's gather around.

508
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,160
Hurry up.

509
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,480
Why do you look so serious? Let's be cheerful.

510
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,400
Yeah.

511
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,480
First of all, congratulations to everyone

512
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,520
who passed this year's audition.

513
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,880
This year, we get a new club room because the old one is under maintenance.

514
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,040
We also have a new club president and club secretary.

515
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
Want to meet them?

516
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Please step out and welcome our new members.

517
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,320
Hello. I'm just here to kick off the event,

518
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,760
so I'll skip the introduction.

519
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,520
I'm Tine.

520
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm the club secretary.

521
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
IS HE THE ONE WHO GOT IN BECAUSE HE HAS CONNECTIONS?

522
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,040
HIS BOYFRIEND IS THE BOSS. THAT'S WHY.

523
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,080
Well, as for today…

524
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,120
-I think-- -Many of you might be thinking…

525
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm here because of the connections I have.

526
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
That's true.

527
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,160
I didn't pass the audition.

528
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,880
I was accepted because I got some help.

529
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,920
At my first stage performance…

530
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,800
I couldn't even finish the song.

531
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,440
So I'm thinking it's not fair to all of you

532
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,880
if I become the secretary of this club.

533
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,360
So I'd like to ask from you…

534
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,840
one week for me to practice guitar,

535
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,600
and I will audition for this club again.

536
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,720
What?

537
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
What?

538
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,720
As…

539
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,960
As…

540
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,560
As…

541
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,120
Long…

542
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,320
As…

543
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,840
As long as I have…

544
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,040
You…

545
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I have…

546
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
I don't want anything else

547
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
Tine, just stop.

548
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,560
I don't think it works.

549
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,920
Why?

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,360
Did Wat ask you guys to talk to me?

551
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,360
-No. -No.

552
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,680
-Really. -Really.

553
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
Fine.

554
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,520
He is worried about you,

555
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
so he asked us to talk you out of it.

556
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,600
Does he think I won't pass?

557
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,480
Not that.

558
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,800
He doesn't want you to care about those negative comments.

559
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,040
Look.

560
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
Don't care about what others think.

561
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,360
Just care about those who care about us.

562
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,520
Wow. As expected, from Fong the Philosopher.

563
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,480
Who said I cared about those comments? It's Sarawat that I care about.

564
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,960
I don't want anyone to talk behind his back that he's biased.

565
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,400
Tine speaks like a philosopher too.

566
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,720
Now I'm being left behind.

567
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
Who are you talking to?

568
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Mil, you know what?

569
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,320
Of all the models we have built, this one is my favorite.

570
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
It sure is.

571
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,560
I designed it just the way you like it.

572
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,160
It's our home.

573
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,680
What do you mean?

574
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,040
You once asked me to open my mind.

575
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I got the answer now.

576
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,800
Phukong.

577
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,520
-Phukong! -What?

578
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,200
I have the answer to your question. It's that the door is too large.

579
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,600
-The door is too large? -Yes.

580
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,240
-Let's make another one. -Here.

581
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,000
-Phukong. -What?

582
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Why do you study architecture?

583
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,280
I guess I have a certain motivation.

584
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,840
Well, Mil.

585
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,520
-After we finish this model-- -Mil.

586
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
-The football court is available. -Oh.

587
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,600
Great. Let's go.

588
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,040
Can you take care of the rest? I don't think I can come back in time.

589
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
Hey. Hold on.

590
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,840
When you're done, keep it in my workshop room.

591
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
Here's the sandpaper.

592
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,080
-Let's go. -Okay.

593
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,000
When will I get to hear the answer?

594
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,280
Hey, Praw. About the song you like, I learned all the chords.

595
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,200
Really?

596
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,880
-Yes. I'll play it for you next time. -I can't wait.

597
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,640
Hi. You came so late.

598
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,640
Why are you here at this hour?

599
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,400
Well…

600
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,040
I came to borrow your guitar.

601
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,160
-You want to borrow my guitar? -Yes.

602
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
What for?

603
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
For playing a song

604
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,680
and recording a video, of course.

605
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,120
All right. Here.

606
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,840
Who are you hitting on?

607
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
No one. What are you talking about?

608
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
Really?

609
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,200
Really. I just want to record one to watch later.

610
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,000
I am your brother. You can talk to me.

611
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,480
It's nothing.

612
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,760
I just want to play.

613
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,320
-I'm thinking of writing a song too. -Yeah?

614
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,360
Not just recording a video, but also writing a song.

615
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
What is it about?

616
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,560
It's a song about…

617
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,800
someone whom we do everything for,

618
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,800
but we get brother-zoned in the end.

619
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
Are you really talking about the song?

620
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,240
Of course. What are you laughing at?

621
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,840
Are you aware you're so into the song?

622
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Into what?

623
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,800
You seem so hurt. How about we open bottles and drink?

624
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,240
I can drink with you.

625
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,240
No. I'd better hurry back and write a song.

626
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
What are you doing anyway?

627
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,440
The club's budget paper.

628
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,280
-I'm the club president. Remember? -Yes.

629
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,040
Where's Tine?

630
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,400
He's practicing at the club.

631
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
He said he couldn't focus here.

632
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
It's so late already.

633
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Is he still practicing?

634
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
Hey. You're home.

635
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Yes.

636
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,760
I told you not to wait.

637
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,640
I'm not waiting for you.

638
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm hungry, so I'm just filling my stomach.

639
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Hungry?

640
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,000
You must be starving. You already had two cups.

641
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Thank you.

642
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,560
How was your day? Did the practice go well?

643
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,560
I'm so tired. Look at my fingers.

644
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,520
They're worn out.

645
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,560
-Just like old times. -There, there.

646
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
How about this?

647
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll let you grab some milk to relieve your tiredness.

648
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,960
How is that going to help?

649
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,600
I mean condensed milk, not my boobs.

650
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,040
You always have dirty thoughts.

651
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,320
-Unacceptable. -No, you are.

652
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm pouring it.

653
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,880
Go ahead.

654
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,520
Thanks for the food.

655
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Thanks.

656
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,360
-It's so good. -Of course it is.

657
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Now that you've grabbed what's mine, it's my turn to grab yours.

658
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Hey.

659
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,600
What?

660
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,000
-Here. Take this. -It's already mine. I want your boobs.

661
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,840
No way. I'm still tired from practice.

662
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,160
-I can give you a massage. -No.

663
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,040
-Come on. -No.

664
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,720
I've been taking care of your brother since he was this small.

665
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
-And now? -He's this big.

666
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
-Really? -Of course.

667
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,760
Hey.

668
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,720
-Why are you with these assholes? -Oh.

669
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,520
-We are assholes now. -Just you, I think.

670
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
I came here to return your guitar.

671
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,880
We're just having a little chat.

672
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,680
Your brother told me that these days, your boyfriend

673
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,320
demands you to turn clothes inside out before washing.

674
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,320
Don't believe anything he said.

675
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,720
Be on your way already.

676
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,440
Don't sit still. Come on. Go to class.

677
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,320
Go on.

678
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,760
Tell your friend to keep going.

679
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,440
Sure. If he succeeds, he will treat you guys to one big meal.

680
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,640
-Wow. -We'll look forward to that.

681
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,080
Of course.

682
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
-See you later. Bye now. -Good luck.

683
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,920
-Bye. -He didn't take the plate, this brat.

684
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,760
"Keep going"?

685
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Just keep going.

686
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,640
Well, your brother asked us for love advice for his friend.

687
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,040
-His friend? -Right.

688
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,200
In short, his friend loves someone, but he doesn't love him back.

689
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
-Same old stuff. -Yes.

690
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
I don't think it's his friend's story. It's his.

691
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,880
He borrowed my guitar to write a love song the other day.

692
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,840
Huh?

693
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,600
He must have a crush on someone.

694
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,320
Could be a student from his faculty.

695
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,360
Those architecture folks, they're so hot.

696
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,680
Well…

697
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,880
Must be one of his seniors.

698
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,880
I went home the other day and heard him talking to someone on the phone.

699
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,400
When he saw me, he did this.

700
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,360
-He knocked on the table? -He hung up.

701
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,560
Oh.

702
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,560
I don't want him to get hurt. He's so clueless.

703
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,320
Before worrying about your little brother,

704
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,680
you should be worried about yourself.

705
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
Why?

706
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,360
Who's teaching Tine to play the guitar?

707
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,840
-He's playing on his own. -Well…

708
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,840
My friend walked by the Music Club the other day.

709
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,640
He heard Tine talking closely to someone.

710
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,360
They were practicing music together.

711
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,080
Not practicing by himself obviously.

712
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,400
It might be his friend. He has friends, doesn't he?

713
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,560
All right. That's good.

714
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,840
We're just afraid it might be someone else.

715
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Imagine a late-night practice with just the two of them.

716
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,200
-Goodness. -I don't want to see that.

717
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,120
Wow.

718
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
-Can you teach me some? -My pleasure.

719
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
It's his friend. You guys are overthinking.

720
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,400
Hey.

721
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,000
-And then G. -Not so fast. I can't follow.

722
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
-It's C, right? -Yes.

723
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Not G, but C.

724
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
What are you watching? Porn?

725
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm not a pervert like you.

726
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,960
All right. I'm off to my guitar practice.

727
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,960
The food is on the table.

728
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,680
Wash the dishes when you're done.

729
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,520
You can practice here. I won't disturb you.

730
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm not afraid of that. It's just…

731
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,640
I don't want to bother you.

732
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,760
I'm off now.

733
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,640
Don't wait for me.

734
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,680
I'll be late.

735
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,000
You can go to bed first.

736
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,480
See you.

737
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,120
Take care.

738
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,840
Can't sleep?

739
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,360
What?

740
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,760
You can't sleep?

741
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,760
No, I can't. You only let me eat a salad.

742
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
I'm starving right now.

743
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
Can I go grab something to eat?

744
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
No, you can't. Save it for breakfast.

745
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,120
Come on. Boiled eggs will do.

746
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,400
No. Get some sleep. I have a presentation tomorrow.

747
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,600
-Just boiled eggs? -Go to sleep.

748
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,320
What are you doing?

749
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,120
Well…

750
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,800
I'm hungry. I'm fixing myself something to eat.

751
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,280
Go ahead and curse me.

752
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,400
What are you laughing at?

753
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,120
Nothing.

754
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,320
It's just amusing that you're falling off the wagon. It's cute.

755
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,280
Aren't you mad at me?

756
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,680
I won't mind as long as you share it with me.

757
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,920
Okay.

758
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,320
Just wait for a bit.

759
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,080
-Hurry. -Sure.

760
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,880
-Done. -Wow.

761
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,640
What a cute dish.

762
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,840
These are heart-shaped.

763
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,560
-Let's eat. -Okay.

764
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,440
Here.

765
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,720
Oh, you're so fast.

766
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,520
You must be very hungry.

767
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Feed me.

768
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,480
I cooked for you.

769
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,760
Do I have to feed you too?

770
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,920
Hmm.

771
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,280
I'm a good cook, aren't I? It's delicious.

772
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,760
It's good. May I have another bite?

773
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,000
-So tasty. -Enough.

774
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,680
Cook it yourself.

775
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,600
Come on.

776
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
You said you would share.

777
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,240
-Can I have some? -I'm hungry.

778
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,280
Let's share. Pretty please.

779
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,320
Hey!

780
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,200
Can I have some? No? Are you going to share or not?

781
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,360
-Hey. -Hey.

782
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,880
What are you doing?

783
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,040
Nothing.

784
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Here.

785
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,480
I'm returning Tine his notes.

786
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
He hasn't come back yet. He's still practicing.

787
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,800
Is that so?

788
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,200
I'll leave them with you, then.

789
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,960
Didn't you see him at all today? I thought he was practicing with you.

790
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,600
Are you nuts?

791
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,480
Do we look like we can play the guitar?

792
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,120
Then who is he with?

793
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,240
What are you watching?

794
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,240
Porn?

795
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,840
Didn't you see him at all today?

796
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,920
-I thought he was practicing with you. -Are you nuts?

797
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,840
Do we look like we can play the guitar?

798
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,520
Then who is he with?

799
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,680
My friend walked by the Music Club the other day.

800
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,000
He heard Tine talking closely to someone.

801
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,760
They were practicing music together.

802
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,320
Not practicing by himself obviously.

803
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,600
C.

804
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
A minor.

805
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,160
-And G. -Slowly. I can't remember.

806
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,600
-Okay. This is G. -G.

807
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,000
-What's this? -This is A minor. See?

808
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,680
Wrong. Start over.

809
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,120
That's wrong. Press harder.

810
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,080
Why don't you play it?

811
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,960
-Record it, will you? -Okay.

812
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,240
Here's the C chord.

813
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,440
Just play and think of yourself

814
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,000
as a rising star

815
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,800
who's been practicing very hard for your guitar solo,

816
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,200
and this is the scene where you have to play for a lot of people.

817
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
Everyone is clapping to your brilliant performance.

818
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,200
It's like a happy ending scene. Do you see it?

819
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
As long as I have you

820
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,480
You are all I ask for

821
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,240
Just you

822
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,200
I need nothing more

823
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,440
No matter

824
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,080
How cruel this world is

825
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,520
No matter how gloomy it is

826
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,720
With all the darkness

827
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,520
And sorrow

828
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,320
Though I have to go through

829
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,920
All difficulties in life

830
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It seems unbearable

831
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,200
But it's fine

832
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,840
It's totally fine

833
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,400
Never, ever do I feel scared

834
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,760
Never, ever do I feel shaken By anything coming at me

835
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,080
As I'm ready to accept everything

836
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,360
As long as I have you

837
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,000
You are all I ask for

838
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,320
Just you

839
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,440
I need nothing more

840
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,480
Do you like acoustic or electric guitar?

841
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,880
An acoustic one because someone just bought me one.

842
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,440
Do you play any other instruments?

843
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,960
Bass, drums, Electone, and ukulele.

844
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,080
Is there anything you can't do?

845
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,120
How to be a club secretary.

846
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,120
Your fingers are ruined. You should've let me teach you.

847
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,320
I wanted to do it myself.

848
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,400
Was I good?

849
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,720
-Did you like my performance? -No, I didn't.

850
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,120
Come on.

851
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,920
You should've let me help.

852
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,520
But I pulled it off, didn't I?

853
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,280
-People were clapping for me. -Yes. You did great.

854
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,440
-Are you happy now? -Yes.

855
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Fingers.

856
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,720
Will you marry me?

857
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,160
Having me as a secretary is not enough?

858
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,840
I want you to be my partner.

859
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,440
Many people have warned me not to work with someone I love

860
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,640
since duties might put us in difficult situations.

861
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,080
But I want to try.

862
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,680
We might have conflicts,

863
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,200
but it can help us understand each other more.

864
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,240
More importantly,

865
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,040
no one can stand the craziness of this club president like I can.

866
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,880
