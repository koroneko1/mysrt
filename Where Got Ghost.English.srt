1
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,799
WHERE GOT GHOST?

2
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,799
GHOST ON THE ROADSIDE

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
YUNNAN SHANTANG

4
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,240
There are two children outside,
looking at us and wanting to come in.

5
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,000
Who are their parents?

6
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,280
Never mind.
You can't see them anyway.

7
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,680
I think they're the children
from your family.

8
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,240
I don't think so, Master.

9
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,879
Did anyone have an abortion
or miscarriage years ago?

10
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
Never mind.

11
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,919
These children will then follow
the unlucky ones.

12
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,479
Master, are they neighboring kids
who've lost their way home?

13
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Will your grandchildren
also go to the wrong doors?

14
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,280
No.

15
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,680
Baby spirits can be terrifying.

16
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
If they're not dealt with properly,

17
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,000
these baby spirits
will haunt their parents for life.

18
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,560
-What are we to do then, Master?
-Simple.

19
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
Perform a ritual to send them away.

20
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,920
Do it then, Master.
Let them reincarnate.

21
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,879
-Okay, $1,000 each.
-What, $1,000?

22
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,560
Can it be cheaper?

23
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,839
If you're tight on cash,
just do the ritual for one,

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,879
and the other will stay here
to follow the unlucky ones.

25
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,319
Okay, then.

26
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,240
-So be it, $2,000.
-Okay.

27
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,600
What toys do you want to burn for them?

28
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
Burn toys for them?

29
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,639
This is crucial.

30
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,680
-Show them the catalogue.
-Right away.

31
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,600
We're having a promotion.

32
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,680
You'll be given special discount
if you order today.

33
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,519
Look at this Transformer.
It's the children's favorite.

34
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,079
-Very popular.
-Is it?

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,519
There are also DS Lite, Ben 10...

36
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,160
PSP is the best.

37
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,279
There's more...

38
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,000
Yours.

39
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,160
Yours.

40
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,879
Chief?

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,839
Too little?

42
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,959
No.

43
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,600
If we continue with this act, will we
offend the spirits and get retribution?

44
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,160
He's right. I feel uncomfortable,
making money like this.

45
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
I get goosebumps every time.

46
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,079
There's nothing to be afraid of.

47
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,600
Let me tell you,
there are no ghosts in this world.

48
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,480
They exist only to the guilt-stricken
and weak-hearted,

49
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,439
who'll pay us to perform the ritual.

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,720
Aren't we still cheating them
out of money?

51
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,639
We're executing heaven's will.

52
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,519
These people are willing to pay us
to help them feel better.

53
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,040
What's wrong with that?

54
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,879
Chief, what you just said
makes me feel much better now.

55
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,240
Okay. Go buy some supper
and some fruits too.

56
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,120
I've been having problems of late.
Must be constipation.

57
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,839
Whenever I pass by this place,
it gives me the crisps.

58
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,000
Crisps?

59
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
I mean "creeps."

60
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,800
Singaporeans can never speak
proper Mandarin. All because of you...

61
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,240
Oh, no!

62
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,360
-What's the matter?
-I forgot to buy fruits!

63
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm not going to go alone
to buy them.

64
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,079
I'm fat and tired.

65
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's go together then.

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,319
What's the difference? It's equally far,
and I'll still be fat and tired.

67
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,480
What shall we do then?
Expect a scolding from the Chief?

68
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,600
I have an idea.
Are you with me?

69
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,319
You want to give the Chief these oranges?

70
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,079
Chief said there were no ghosts
in this world.

71
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,399
If you don't take them,
the foreign workers will,

72
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,120
and they're fine after eating them.

73
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,079
Are you sure?

74
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,600
Have you heard of foreign workers
dying after eating oranges?

75
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,720
-No.
-Then it's okay.

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,079
You're right.
Anyway, it's for the Chief.

77
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,079
I'll never touch them.

78
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm so sorry, Mr. Spirit.
Our Chief wants to eat these fruits.

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,439
Please look for him
if you spirits are unhappy.

80
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,639
His name is "Li Ah Cai."

81
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,879
He's not afraid of you spirits,

82
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,199
but we respect you very much.

83
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,600
Sorry.

84
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,399
I respect you too.

85
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,519
Get the oranges.

86
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,000
May I ask, where did you get this orange?

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,160
It's tasteless.

88
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,279
It's inedible.

89
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,000
How dare you give me such rubbish?

90
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,360
It's sugar-free.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,879
Yes. You'll get diabetes
from eating too much sweet stuff.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go to hell!

93
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,559
If I get diabetes,
I'll drown you with my urine.

94
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,799
Almost forgot.

95
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,000
Prosperity!

96
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
Goal!

97
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,320
I worship to the God of Ball.
Are you insane?

98
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Are you insane?

99
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,519
God of Ball?

100
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,679
I meant the God of Football,

101
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,080
who can help me win.

102
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
You should pray hard not to go insane.

103
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,399
Nuts!

104
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,559
Chief, there's a god in everything.

105
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,960
Worship them,
and you'll be blessed and prosperous.

106
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,919
Hello?

107
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,639
Congratulations to you, sir.

108
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,559
You've won a prize
in our company's lucky draw.

109
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,360
Two first-class round-trip tickets
to America.

110
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,279
Please come collect your prize
from our company.

111
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,480
Go to hell!

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,799
You think you can fool me
with these old tricks? Idiots!

113
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,200
Can you believe it? They're still trying
to trick people with such calls.

114
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Can't they be more creative?

115
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Full of shit.

116
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,919
Chief, look at it from another angle.

117
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,320
If she makes 10,000 calls,

118
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,879
all she needs
is ten people to buy into the idea,

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,519
and they'll be rich.

120
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,000
Chief, the same goes
with our everyday lottery system.

121
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,919
Out of 10,000 combinations,
there are only 23 possible winners.

122
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
You're right.

123
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,440
If a person bets from 0000 to 9999,
they'll win 23 combinations for sure.

124
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,879
We're going to win big!

125
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,480
What is it, Chief?

126
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,480
From tomorrow,

127
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,039
we'll make 10,000 phone calls,

128
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,000
from 0000 to 9999,

129
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,960
giving each of them
a combination of numbers.

130
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,759
There will surely be 23 winners.

131
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,360
From the smallest to the biggest prize,
we will win them all!

132
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,360
Then we'll get a 20% commission fee
from every winner.

133
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,960
That's a brilliant idea, Chief!

134
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,519
What if they don't buy into our idea
or even deny having won?

135
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,080
How do we get a commission then?

136
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,000
We'll tell them it's lucky money
from the God of Wealth.

137
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,879
Then they'll pay up accordingly.

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Is there a God of Wealth?

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,399
Yes, I'm the God of Wealth!

140
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,080
-You're a God, Chief!
-We're with a deity!

141
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,639
Where can we find 10,000 phone numbers
and addresses?

142
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,720
There's something used to wrap
steamed rice roll and kanchan puti.

143
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,960
I'll use it to "win."

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,480
You do A to J, and you do K to T.

145
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,600
Who will make the calls from U to Z?

146
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,080
Who do you think?

147
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Congratulations!

148
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,559
We're calling on behalf
of the God of Wealth. Listen carefully.

149
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,960
Your lucky combination is 1045...

150
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
1033...

151
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,159
Make the purchase with these numbers.
If you win...

152
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Please donate
20% of the winnings to our foundation.

153
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
The donation will be used to build
a temple for the God of Wealth,

154
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,360
not for our personal use.

155
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,120
Thank you.
We wish you the best of luck.

156
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
Win big!

157
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,639
The first prize of the week goes to...

158
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
1045.

159
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
I've won again!

160
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,080
I made the calls for the top three prizes.
Take a look.

161
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,039
Get lost!

162
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,399
What's the celebration for?

163
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,559
Chief, the calls for the top three prizes
were all made by me. I'm so lucky!

164
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,360
It's only the top three prizes.

165
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,080
I made the calls
for the rest of the combinations.

166
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,919
A total of 20 prizes.

167
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,919
I'm luckier than you.

168
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,519
So great, huh?

169
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,960
-You both made all the winning calls?
-Yes.

170
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,399
Did you win any prize?

171
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,440
No.

172
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,480
What's there to celebrate?

173
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,639
Chief, we may not be the winners,
but we made those calls.

174
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,080
It still feels amazing.

175
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,919
Although I didn't win for a long time,
this feels good too.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
Morons. I look at it differently.

177
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,840
I came up with this system,

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
so I knew all along

179
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,120
that those 23 combinations
would be my winning combinations.

180
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,080
I'm the ultimate winner!

181
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Take down the addresses
and collect our commissions quickly.

182
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm such a genius.

183
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,159
Congratulations
on winning the third prize.

184
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,840
I told you,
this money is from the God of Wealth.

185
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,879
You'll need to donate
20% of the prize money to our foundation.

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,879
I'll send you the God of Wealth's
account number via SMS.

187
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,919
Thank you.

188
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,159
Win big!

189
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,399
Let me tell you,
Lady Luck will be on your side very often!

190
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,399
Win big!

191
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,559
This is not right!

192
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,399
You didn't bet on
the second-prize combination?

193
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,759
This is the God of Wealth's prize money.

194
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,799
You can lie to us,
but not to the God of Wealth.

195
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,200
Also... Hello? Hello?

196
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,240
He hung up on me.
What shall we do?

197
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,000
Have you been in the army before?

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,360
Your size is out of standard anyway.

199
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,840
They have something called
a "contingency plan."

200
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,519
So does our business.

201
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,519
Where does this guy live?

202
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,080
She's the one refusing
to pay us commission!

203
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,080
No worries, I'll call her.

204
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,960
Are you Chen Xiaohua?

205
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes, who's this?

206
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,519
Congratulation on winning the lottery.
Our God of Wealth never fails to deliver.

207
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,960
Please donate money
to help us build a temple.

208
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,559
I've told you,
I didn't bet on the combination.

209
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,440
How could I win if I didn't place the bet?

210
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,840
This is the God of Wealth's money.

211
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,200
If you've placed the bet,
you can lie to us, but not to a deity.

212
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
I've told you so many times,

213
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,039
how could I win if I didn't place the bet?

214
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,720
-Really?
-Really.

215
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,320
No worries.

216
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,799
Don't blame me
for any misfortune in the future.

217
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
So be it. Bye

218
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,080
-Okay?
-Okay

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,879
-Remember the target.
-Her head, right?

220
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
No, just to scare her.

221
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,279
Missed her head.

222
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Your aim must have been lousy
during your army days.

223
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,559
It's not easy to miss on purpose.
She'll transfer the funds to us tomorrow.

224
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,720
But this won't be feasible
when we have more customers.

225
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,080
We'll seek help from professionals.

226
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Professionals?

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,320
Loan sharks.

228
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,839
I see.

229
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,960
I don't owe you any money.

230
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,240
I'm not a loan shark. The God of Wealth
gave you your lucky money.

231
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,720
-Why didn't you make a donation?
-Donation!

232
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,599
Donation! Donation!

233
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,759
-I didn't place the bet.
-Are you certain?

234
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,960
You sure? You sure?

235
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,079
TRANSFER

236
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,839
I can't stop smiling.

237
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
Chief, this is easy money.

238
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,160
Our business will be great!

239
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,079
Chief, your idea is brilliant.

240
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,880
We need to copyright it.
If not, there will be copy dogs.

241
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,480
It's "copycat," not "copy dog"!

242
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,000
You're right. I'll need more manpower.

243
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,960
Recruit 100 students
with sweet voices to make the calls.

244
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,960
I'll run the business like an enterprise,

245
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,440
have my company listed.

246
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,519
Then I'll be filthy rich!

247
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm a genius, indeed!

248
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,880
GOD OF WEALTH ENTERPRISE

249
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,319
Hello. I'm a representative
of the God of Wealth Enterprise.

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,480
Good fortune to you.

251
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,759
Your lucky combination is 2305.

252
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
...6111.

253
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,799
However, if you win a prize...

254
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
Please donate 20% of your prize money
to us to build temples.

255
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,559
-Thank you.
-May you prosper!

256
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,839
Wow!

257
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,599
What's up?

258
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,400
If we continue making money like this,
We can afford the largest plasma TV

259
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,519
for next year's World Cup Live!

260
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,799
Are you okay?

261
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,039
If this continues,
we won't be watching TV,

262
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,279
but flying first class
to South Africa

263
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,119
to watch the match live!

264
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,359
You're right.

265
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,079
From 0000 to 9999,
there are 10,000 combinations.

266
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,279
Place a bet on one combination,
and you'll stand a chance to win a prize.

267
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,119
This is called "Four-Digit Lottery"
or "4D."

268
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,200
This lottery has been in Singapore
for decades.

269
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,839
It's a brilliant idea,

270
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,200
because anyone who bets
will feel a strong sense of victory.

271
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,839
It's very popular among citizens,

272
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,720
and also very good business
for the organization.

273
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,240
That's why even our government
is actively involved.

274
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,240
If you're interested,

275
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,680
I can make arrangements
for you to meet our officials.

276
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,839
Get back to me quickly.

277
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Time for lunch, Chief.

278
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,359
Chief, the Taiwanese are also interested?

279
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,920
Not only Taiwan!

280
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,960
My targets also include Hong Kong, Korea,
Japan, the US, England, Australia, Africa,

281
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,920
and all the countries in the world!
Everyone will buy my lottery,

282
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,799
including Westerners!

283
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,599
I'm a genius, indeed!

284
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,480
Congratulations. I'm here
to bring you good fortune.

285
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,920
Please take down this combination,

286
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,960
6-6-6-6.

287
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,400
Damn it! Someone is using our idea,

288
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
and they're telling me
to place a bet on 6666!

289
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,759
Really?

290
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,480
-Hello?
-If you win,

291
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,759
please donate 18% of the prize money
to our charity.

292
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,119
Go to hell!

293
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,480
They're even cutting commissions
to compete with us!

294
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,039
Yes, I told you to get the idea
copyrighted. Did you do it?

295
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,400
I did. They said you need
to wait five years.

296
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,000
Five years?
I'll starve to death!

297
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
Chief, want to place the bet on 6666?

298
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,799
My foot!

299
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,599
What if it wins the lottery?

300
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,079
It could be one
of the 23 winning combinations.

301
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
I hate both of you!

302
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,200
-Bet a little then.
-How much?

303
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,079
$200!

304
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,119
Get going, before it's too late!

305
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,400
-Bet a little then?
-$200?

306
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,920
...8-9-0-1.

307
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,680
The numbers are

308
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,599
1-1-5-5.

309
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,119
-Did the numbers win?
-Nope.

310
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,440
I knew it.
That guy cannot be trusted.

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,039
The third-prize combination is

312
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,279
6-6-6-7.

313
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,920
Didn't I tell you? I knew it all along.
It's utter rubbish.

314
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,200
The second-prize combination is

315
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,000
6-6-6-6.

316
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Hurray!

317
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,359
It's a windfall!

318
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,799
The first-prize combination is

319
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,279
6-6-6-6.

320
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,920
It's spot on!
This guy is a deity!

321
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,039
-He's so spot on with his prediction!
-What did you say is a deity?

322
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,400
I meant the table is dirty.

323
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,680
Dirty?

324
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,559
You're such an idiot!
Our Chief is the most formidable.

325
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,039
Cheers to our Chief!

326
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,440
Cheers!

327
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,000
-Hello?
-Congratulations.

328
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,240
You've won the first and second prizes.

329
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,880
I told you.

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,359
Please make your donation soon.

331
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,359
This is my idea.

332
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,599
You've stolen my idea,
and you expect a commission from me?

333
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,480
You're a moron!
Come and collect the money if you dare.

334
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,359
You haven't even paid me royalties.

335
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,680
You're such a loser!

336
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,079
Hope you get H1N1!

337
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,960
What's wrong?

338
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,640
He wants an 18% commission?

339
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,119
Who cares? Let's toast!

340
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,759
You guys deserve a treat.

341
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,319
Tonight, you can order
whatever you want. Go ahead!

342
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,599
Let's drink!

343
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,119
Let's drink!

344
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,920
$800,000 is so heavy!

345
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,000
-Let me help you, Chief.
-No need.

346
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,480
-I can lend you a hand.
-That won't be necessary.

347
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,440
We need to be discreet.
Hurry up.

348
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,359
You're old and skinny.
The money is safer with me.

349
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,119
Not required!

350
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,319
You have arthritis, Chief.
The weight is bad for your bones.

351
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
I said not required.

352
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,160
-I'm big. I can protect the money.
-Not required!

353
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,400
Chief...

354
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,680
Say no more.

355
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,039
Let me carry it for a while.

356
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,039
I've never felt the weight of $800,000!

357
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,519
No!

358
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,519
Chief, let me have it for a while.

359
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm willing to break my leg for it.

360
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,640
Over my dead body!

361
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,480
I beg of you. Let's play
rock-paper-scissors to decide.

362
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,359
Say no more!

363
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,680
-What's up?
-Who are you looking for?

364
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,039
You won the prize.
Why didn't you make the donation?

365
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,960
So you're that H1N1 loser!

366
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,599
You stole my idea!
How dare you demand a commission from me?

367
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,839
Your winning combination was given
by the Granny of Wealth behind me.

368
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,039
The prize-money donation
will be given to her.

369
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Granny?

370
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,240
What Granny?

371
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
Look at him, copying all our ideas!

372
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,759
Don't you have better tricks?

373
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,839
Your brain must be rusty.

374
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,240
She's right behind me.
Didn't you see her?

375
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,119
Yes!

376
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,839
-And I can even see Grandpa too!
-Right!

377
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,720
Grandpa is cooking it salty

378
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,079
Granny wants it less salty

379
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,359
Granny brought you such fortune,
you ungrateful bastards!

380
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
You'll be knocked down by a car.

381
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,119
Loser, trying to frighten me?

382
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,519
I'm so scared, my limbs are trembling.
I'm peeing in my pants.

383
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,200
I'll cross the road now.
Let's see if cars knock me down.

384
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,799
Come on, run me over!

385
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,000
-Come back, Chief!
-Run me over!

386
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,759
It's dangerous!

387
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,119
Did you see that?
I'm perfectly okay!

388
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,519
-Come back, Chief!
-Get the cars to knock me down!

389
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,519
I'm invincible!

390
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,359
Look up! Run for your life!

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Chief!

392
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,440
Next time, don't eat my oranges.

393
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,720
Ghost!

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,119
I'm so sorry, Mr. Spirit.
Our Chief wants to eat these fruits.

395
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,799
Please look for him
if you spirits are unhappy.

396
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
His name is "Li Ah Cai."

397
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,680
He's not afraid of you spirits,

398
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,799
but we respect you very much.

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
Sorry.

400
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,880
I respect you too.

401
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
Get the oranges.

402
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,480
It's inedible.

403
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
How dare you give me such rubbish?

404
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,440
DISASTERS IN LIFE

405
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,960
START WITH IGNORING DETAILS.

406
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,039
THERE ARE GHOSTS IN THE WOODS

407
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,640
Faster!

408
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,240
Yes, Master Sergeant!

409
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
Don't take this lightly!

410
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
Don't take shortcuts!

411
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,720
Don't be lazy!

412
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Don't be a smartass!

413
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,759
Yes, Warrant Officer.

414
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,319
No, Warrant Officer.

415
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,279
Put on your helmet on.
Move out.

416
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,279
Sir, can we be the last detail?

417
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,440
Can, come back next Sunday.

418
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,880
Report to the Master Sergeant.

419
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,160
Report to the Master Sergeant.

420
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,359
I heard that this forest is cursed.

421
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,359
-So?
-Many Japanese soldiers died here.

422
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,279
-What are you afraid of?
-Ghosts.

423
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,440
You look like a ghost yourself,
and you're scared?

424
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,039
Buddy, slow down.
I have something to tell you.

425
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:36,960
What is it?

426
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,759
My reasons for trying
to take off are all valid!

427
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,839
What are you trying to say?

428
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,640
I've seen five masters.

429
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,240
They all told me the same thing,

430
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,200
that I'm cursed
with a "blood encounter" this year.

431
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,880
"Blood encounter" curse?
Don't get me into trouble. I'm your buddy.

432
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,160
-How's your luck been this year?
-Extremely good, man.

433
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,799
That'll do. You can save me.

434
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
But what if I'm cursed
by your bad luck instead?

435
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,759
No.

436
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,279
No? I must complain
to the Ministry of Defense.

437
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,519
They'll need to consult my masters

438
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,160
before assigning me
a buddy from now on.

439
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,680
Right.

440
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,119
Stop. Don't move.

441
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,400
See? I've lifted
your "blood encounter" curse for you!

442
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,480
-Thank you.
-Don't move.

443
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,839
Blood encounter.

444
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,440
Stop!

445
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,319
B-L-O-O-D E-N-C-O-U-N-T-E-R!

446
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,839
Are you trying to get back to me?

447
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
These mosquitoes are formidable.

448
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,000
Just can't seem to hit any of them!

449
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,119
Buddy!

450
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
I think we're lost.

451
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,640
Says who? See?
We came this way, and we're here!

452
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,480
No, we came that way, and we're here!

453
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,759
No, we're there.

454
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Don't argue with me.
We're at this point.

455
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,160
-Take that thing out.
-That "thing" is called a compass.

456
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,759
See?

457
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
I think it's broken.

458
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,839
The compass points to this direction.

459
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,079
When you turn around,

460
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,240
it still points to the same direction.

461
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
If you turn back,

462
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,880
it still points to the same direction.

463
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,839
It's definitely broken!

464
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,599
Don't you know?

465
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,920
This is how a compass works.

466
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,240
It always point in the same direction.

467
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,079
It's always pointing to "Nan,"
meaning South.

468
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,200
How do you know?

469
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,319
-Do you see an "N" on it?
-Yes.

470
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,799
What about the "S"?

471
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,400
"S" is "See," meaning West.

472
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,920
What about the "W"?

473
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,960
"W" stands for...

474
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
There are women over there.
It's dangerous.

475
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,599
Rubbish!

476
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
So "E" stands for "Elephant"?

477
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,279
Don't fool me.
You think I don't know topography?

478
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,720
In fact, I really know nothing
about it! I used to be a military driver.

479
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,119
There's always someone
to tell me directions.

480
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,960
I know nothing about topography really.

481
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,079
I used to be in the military police.

482
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,759
I arrested people every day,

483
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,480
so I don't know topography either.

484
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,839
I always lazed around in my army days.

485
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,160
I used to be second sergeant.
Then I got demoted to third sergeant.

486
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,480
Can you be worse than me?

487
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,160
I went from first sergeant to corporal,
then back to third sergeant.

488
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,200
I was locked in the detention barracks
three times!

489
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,240
Three times?

490
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,640
No big deal.
My record was five times.

491
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,400
Listen carefully.
I was locked for 40 days every time.

492
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,200
You win!

493
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
Let's take a look.

494
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,680
If we follow the instructions,
we'll be here forever.

495
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,000
What shall we do then?

496
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,720
Do you dare?

497
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,279
-What are you talking about?
-Shortcut.

498
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,440
Buddy!

499
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,000
Why do we need to prowl like this?

500
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,279
We're taking a shortcut.

501
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,400
This tactical movement
will keep us from officers' view.

502
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,920
-This is the shortcut?
-Yes.

503
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is the Pan Island Expressway.

504
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,840
Idiot, we'll take a cab
from here straight to the end point.

505
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,039
Go to hell!

506
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,239
Pass me the map and follow me closely.

507
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,199
Learn from me, kiddo.

508
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,760
Let's see what you can do.

509
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,519
Why is there a tombstone
in the military training area?

510
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,440
Let's go.

511
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,119
Is there a lucky number on it?

512
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,960
-Cut the crap. Let's go.
-She is so pretty.

513
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,920
-Don't say "pretty."
-Okay, she's ugly.

514
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,719
Stop uttering rubbish! Let's go!

515
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,519
What's wrong with saying
"ugly" or "pretty"?

516
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,039
LU-YIN

517
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,840
What's the matter?

518
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,079
Do you smell something?

519
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,360
Nope.

520
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,880
Take a deep breath.

521
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:43,320
Yes, a scent of flower,
but I can't tell the name of the flower.

522
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,679
What is it?

523
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,880
I just farted.

524
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,079
Go to hell! Childish!

525
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,199
I was in front of you
when I farted along the way.

526
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,079
Didn't you smell anything?
Is there something wrong with your nose?

527
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,239
You're so childish!

528
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,880
My tummy aches. I need to poo.

529
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,239
It's getting dark.

530
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,480
You want to poo in the forest?

531
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,480
I can't help it. It's coming out.

532
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,599
If you take off your pants, squat down,
and see a cobra, what will you do?

533
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,039
I'll remain still.

534
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,679
If it bites your private parts?

535
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,480
I hit it with a stick.

536
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,039
-It'll be too late.
-What should I do then?

537
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,480
You take off the co-bra's "bra,"
give it a tight slap, and it'll fall.

538
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,360
Cut the crap!

539
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,760
I can't hold it anymore.

540
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,519
That's what you get
for playing pranks on me!

541
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,960
Wait for me.
I want to poo too.

542
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,639
-Buddy.
-What?

543
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,960
Do you smell something?

544
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,360
I just used this trick.

545
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,599
Can you be more creative?

546
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,320
It's true.

547
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,039
Take a deep breath.

548
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,119
Trying to fool me?

549
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,119
Use other tricks, please.

550
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,639
I'm not joking.

551
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,360
I smell something nice.

552
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,480
You're a weirdo.

553
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,079
You couldn't smell a thing
when I farted earlier.

554
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,800
Now you're saying
my waste smells nice to you.

555
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Your nose is really not working.

556
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,920
-Did you see that?
-I saw it.

557
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
-Is it...
-Sure!

558
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,639
Do you dare?

559
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
What is it?

560
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,199
Ask her for lottery numbers.

561
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,639
Why not?

562
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,320
Come on!

563
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,920
One, two, three...

564
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,079
Run!

565
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,800
Ghost!

566
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,400
Help!

567
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,719
What about our rifles?

568
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,239
Are you nuts?

569
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,159
We almost died.

570
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
Forget the rifles.

571
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,559
We'll be charged under military law.

572
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,760
Let it be!

573
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
Buddy...

574
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,280
Do you have a tissue?

575
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,119
What for?

576
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,119
I forgot to wipe my butt.

577
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
Me too.

578
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,639
Don't you feel dirty?

579
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,199
It can't be worse than that thing.

580
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,400
Then say no more!

581
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,559
I have a request.

582
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,679
Please don't laugh at me.

583
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,960
What request?

584
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,679
My hands are cold.

585
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Can I hold your hands?

586
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,159
Okay.

587
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,599
Buddies, hand in hand.

588
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,440
Buddies, poo in hands.

589
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,920
Give me a hand.

590
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,840
Will you fall in love with me?

591
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,519
-Go to hell!
-Just joking!

592
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,360
Our rifles!

593
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,119
The officers said if we see the canal,
we're on the wrong route.

594
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,800
The canal is the shortcut.

595
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,960
Be careful.

596
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,760
Look around carefully.

597
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,199
Don't let the officers see us.

598
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,960
Be careful of the canal.

599
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,239
We seem to be on a much better path,
thanks to you!

600
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,039
Of course, I drew the Singapore map.

601
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, as if I'll believe you!

602
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,199
On the count of three,

603
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,719
-we'll run over to that bush.
-Okay.

604
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Look out for officers.

605
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,480
Let's go.

606
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,519
This forest is divine!

607
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,519
I didn't know Singapore
could be so beautiful!

608
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,760
Where's this place?

609
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,760
I don't know.

610
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,559
But you drew the map, right?

611
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,079
I didn't finish drawing.

612
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,119
What the heck!

613
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,440
Be careful.
Look out for officers.

614
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,559
No more water.

615
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,960
It'll never be enough
if you keep drinking like a cow.

616
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,079
Look over there!

617
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,840
Miss...

618
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,599
Handsome.

619
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,320
It's tough to be a soldier.

620
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,960
Do you need water?

621
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,360
This is a deserted forest,

622
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,159
yet someone is selling water.

623
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,320
Get me a bottle.

624
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,519
Has to be cold.

625
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,079
-Here.
-Thank you.

626
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,320
So cooling.

627
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,199
You're lost, right?

628
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
How do you know?

629
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,440
I've been selling water here
for many years.

630
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,440
The soldiers I meet,
all get lost while taking a shortcut.

631
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,679
It's always the same.
Nothing has changed.

632
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,679
You' had an unforgettable night yesterday?

633
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,599
Last night, we saw a ghost.

634
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:36,519
She had long hair, red clothes,
but no face.

635
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,239
This is normal.

636
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,960
This ghost is very popular.

637
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,960
All the soldiers who had taken
a shortcut met her.

638
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:54,440
Glad we're not the only ones to see her!

639
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,199
$2 for a bottle.

640
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,639
Pay her $4.

641
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,880
Miss!

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,239
Do you know a shortcut to the end point?

643
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,239
You're asking the right person,

644
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,199
but I don't think you would be able to
understand my instructions.

645
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,119
Don't worry. I'm a university graduate.
I'll understand. Is there a problem?

646
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,800
Okay, listen carefully.

647
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,719
Go straight ahead. Turn left.
Turn right and straight--

648
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Enough, Miss! We'll find our way.

649
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,719
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

650
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,360
Why is the sky so dark suddenly?

651
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,440
Seems like it's going to rain.

652
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,239
Why the sudden change in weather?

653
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,239
This is the kind of rain

654
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,360
that will last a long time.

655
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,679
As it gets heavier,
the forest will soon be flooded.

656
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,159
Be careful.

657
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,239
Miss, is there a shelter nearby?

658
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,960
Yes, my house.

659
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:12,079
-What shall we do?
-Let's follow her.

660
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,440
Miss, wait for us!

661
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,199
Here we are.

662
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,719
This is my house.

663
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,639
What happened to your trees?

664
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,920
The branches hit my roof
whenever it rains, so I tied them up.

665
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,400
Come in. This is my home.

666
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
Why do you live in such a big house?

667
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,159
It's my father's.

668
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,280
I'm drenched.

669
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,920
I need a bath.

670
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
Buddy, it's good we found shelter.

671
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,559
Buddy...

672
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,480
Don't you think it's strange a girl
would live in such a deserted place?

673
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,159
Many girls stay in the forest
in Lim Chu Kang, Woodlands, and Yishun.

674
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,199
Who are these girls?

675
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,599
Prostitutes!

676
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,639
You're wrong.

677
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,400
Those prostitutes are young and pretty
with gorgeous figures.

678
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:47,599
This fat one is called a "boar."

679
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,000
So boring. It's a downpour.

680
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,480
My noodle stall can fetch me $500 a day,

681
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,039
yet I'm doing nothing now.

682
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:04,800
You can tell the Ministry of Defense
you earn $50,000 a month,

683
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,639
and be excused,
but the tax office will come after you.

684
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,199
Have you ever seen a pig shower?

685
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,840
No, I've seen farmers bathe pigs.

686
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,320
But have you seen a pig
taking bath on its own?

687
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,039
I'm curious. Don't stop me.

688
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,920
Buddy...

689
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,559
You're a sergeant.

690
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,079
Sergeants have desires too.

691
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,400
I meant you're a sergeant.

692
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:43,760
You should proceed with tactical movement.

693
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,440
You're right. Good one.

694
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,000
Are you for real?

695
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,360
Hope you get into big trouble.

696
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,840
Ghost!

697
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,880
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

698
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,039
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

699
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,559
LU-YIN

700
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,360
I didn't peep,

701
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,239
but he did!

702
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,679
Sorry, I won't do it again.

703
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,480
Why are you both running away?

704
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,199
Because you're a ghost.

705
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,920
I'm not a ghost.

706
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,360
She's my twin sister.

707
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:41,119
She died months ago.

708
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,840
I saw your mouth spilling blood.

709
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,599
I was brushing my teeth
and accidentally hurt my gums.

710
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,400
The blood is from my gums.

711
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,199
Right. It happens to me too.

712
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,639
So you're really not a ghost?

713
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,719
If you don't believe me, try feeling me.

714
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,039
No, no, no!

715
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,440
No? So do you both want to follow me home?

716
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,079
No, no!

717
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,000
Well, you can either stay drenched here

718
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,639
or go into the woods to meet with
those hundreds of ghosts in there.

719
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,960
I'm leaving.

720
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,000
My leg is stuck!

721
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,480
My leg!

722
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,760
Stuck?

723
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,199
Simply lift it from the log.

724
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,920
What's happening here?

725
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:43,039
It was stuck earlier.

726
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,119
What do you think?

727
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,519
There may be
hundreds of ghosts in the woods,

728
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,480
but only two ghosts in the house,
and both are female.

729
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,840
I think it's safer to follow her.

730
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,159
Let's go.

731
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:59,440
-Wait for us!
-Wait!

732
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:27,599
Come in.

733
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,679
You can stay outside then.

734
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,039
Come in.

735
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:43,360
There's a ghost in your room, I swear.

736
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:47,679
She has long hair and scary fingernails.

737
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:50,079
You must be seeing things.

738
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,880
See?

739
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,719
My gums are bleeding again.
You must be seeing things.

740
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,599
Let's check it out.

741
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
-Come on.
-No.

742
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,400
-Come on!
-No.

743
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,039
Are you men or not? Wimps!

744
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,679
She's calling you a wimp.
Prove her wrong.

745
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
No way!

746
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,760
Weren't you a medium before?

747
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,039
That was an excuse for getting a day off.

748
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:21,840
This is for real.
Don't get me into trouble.

749
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,559
-You check it out, and I'll run.
-What?

750
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,400
You'll have to follow me closely
to be safe.

751
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,440
Sound good? Good.

752
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:37,280
-Watch out for me.
-Okay!

753
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,920
Come and see.

754
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,840
No!

755
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,039
Come and see.

756
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,039
Come here.

757
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,519
We've been fooled.

758
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,079
So cowardly. Come on!

759
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,719
What are these things for?

760
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,039
They are my dad's.
He was a magician.

761
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,039
The renowned American magician
David Footballfield was his student.

762
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,000
You mean David Copperfield?

763
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,360
It was Footballfield then.

764
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:25,519
He changed his name when he became famous.

765
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,480
Without my dad,
he wouldn't be David Copperfield today.

766
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,639
I didn't know Singaporeans
were good at tooting their horns.

767
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,960
I'm tooting a horn?

768
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,719
I'll be performing David Footballfield's
most formidable magic stunt,

769
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,719
the Great Escape.

770
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,599
Prove it to us.

771
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,679
It's empty?

772
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,199
There are no flowers or rabbits.

773
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,239
Not even pigeons.

774
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,000
Here she comes.

775
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,519
-Tie up.
-Not me. Tie him up.

776
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:14,239
Tie you up!

777
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,199
Are you nuts?

778
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:20,280
I meant, tie me up.

779
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:21,440
You?

780
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,800
For real?

781
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,920
Just do it!

782
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,400
Come on!

783
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,559
Don't let me move around.

784
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,639
Come on.

785
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,239
One two, three, pull!

786
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:35,480
Lock up!

787
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,920
She's really a giant!

788
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,280
Wait a minute!

789
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,559
Remember, tie me up tightly.

790
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:46,960
-Will you die?
-It can be dangerous!

791
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,000
Piece of cake.

792
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,440
So arrogant!

793
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,480
Tie her tightly so she can never escape.

794
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:52,440
Just like wrapping a dumpling.

795
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:53,840
Be careful!

796
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,079
Careful!

797
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:01,679
You're not supposed to drop her!

798
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,920
Do you know how heavy she is?
Why don't you do it? It's not easy!

799
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,920
I'll get you when I'm out.

800
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,679
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

801
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,840
It's my fault.

802
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,760
-I will close it
-Close the chest.

803
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,719
Lock it up.

804
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:15,440
For real?

805
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,039
Count to ten, and I'll be out.

806
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,599
-So arrogant.
-Come on.

807
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:24,679
Lock up the chest.

808
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,679
I have the key.
She can never escape.

809
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,000
Are you okay, Fatso? Fatso!

810
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:37,679
There's not a sound in there.
Will she die in the chest?

811
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,039
So strange.

812
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,000
Fatso!

813
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,239
Will she die in the chest?

814
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,960
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

815
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,840
five, four, three, two, one!

816
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Fatso! Fatso! Fatso!

817
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,239
Aren't you inside the chest?
I'm holding the key.

818
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:06,760
How did you escape?

819
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,559
It's magic!

820
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,280
Look inside the chest.

821
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,679
Is she really that good?

822
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,039
It's true!

823
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:21,079
Amazing!

824
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,039
If I learned this magic, I could stop
frying noodles and perform on stage.

825
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,840
I'd perform in Las Vegas.

826
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,199
And it'd be at least $10,000
for each performance!

827
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,880
-Jackpot! Tie me up first, okay?
-Tie me up first!

828
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,400
You'll get your chance.
Tie me up first.

829
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,840
I'm fed up of giving in to you.

830
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,280
-Give in already!
-Don't be such a bully!

831
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,639
Buddy, you cannot imagine
how tight Master has tied me.

832
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,039
I'll give a better performance than you.

833
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,719
Nonsense!

834
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,840
Master has tied me much tighter,

835
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,800
so I can perform better than you.

836
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,440
Just wait and see.

837
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,559
Bring it on!

838
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,960
Master! Master!

839
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:08,360
Teach us the Great Escape trick, quick!

840
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,679
Relax.

841
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,320
I'll teach you something better
than the David Footballfield's stunt.

842
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,960
It's a new magic trick!

843
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,360
More tricks!

844
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,920
Tighter?

845
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,440
Tighter, Master!

846
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:24,800
Tighter?

847
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:26,400
A bit more!

848
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:28,239
Okay.

849
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:31,840
Did you see that?

850
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,920
I want mine to be
tighter than his, Master.

851
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,360
I want to perform better.

852
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,159
Let's see. Tighter, Master!

853
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,719
A bit more. A bit more...

854
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,559
Why are you holding knives?

855
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,800
It's part of the magic trick.

856
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,039
Are you going to kill us?

857
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:03,000
Be careful with it.

858
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:04,400
It's dangerous.

859
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,639
All magic stunts are dangerous. Scared?

860
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,000
Then forget about learning the trick.

861
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,480
I want to learn.

862
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,559
Aunt, I've found
the two substitute ghosts for you.

863
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,199
Can you let me go?

864
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,440
ONE YEAR LATER

865
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,559
Take your sweet time.

866
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,880
Want me to come hold your hands?

867
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:00,599
Check your equipment
and report to the Master Sergeant!

868
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,480
Who's not taking the shortcut?

869
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,519
Ridiculous!

870
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:09,480
If we get caught,
we'll be in deep trouble.

871
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,760
Have you heard
of Code of Conduct Number 7?

872
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,719
What?

873
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:16,920
You're still at Rule 7?
The latest is Rule 8!

874
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,159
-What?
-You are not a soldier if you don't cheat!

875
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:21,760
Gentlemen!
Say that one more time!

876
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:27,760
-Yes, Master Sergeant!
-Go!

877
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:04,719
THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY
FOR EVERY SHORTCUT YOU TAKE.

878
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,199
GHOST IN THE HOUSE

879
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,440
Mother, it's been a year,
and still no lottery blessing from you,

880
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,639
no starter prize, no consolation prize.

881
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,440
Nothing at all, not even a lucky draw.

882
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,000
Please remember
to let them win some lottery.

883
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,159
Thank you.

884
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,079
Mother, you're staying with us.
I pray to you every day.

885
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,880
You must remember
to give us some lucky "4D" numbers,

886
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,320
not give your granddaughters
all "D's" in exams.

887
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,639
Bless us, Mother.

888
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,440
Come pray to Grandma.

889
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,800
Mother, you must remember,

890
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,719
"4D" numbers and getting
four "D's" in exams are different.

891
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,280
Don't mess up again.
Bless us!

892
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,599
Mother, Lehman Brothers in America
is such a big company.

893
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:09,840
As a deity up there,
you must've known it would go under.

894
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,400
If you knew,
why didn't you inform me in advance?

895
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:15,079
My friend's father
tipped him off in his dream.

896
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:16,159
He managed to avoid heavy losses.

897
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,280
But I didn't.
I suffered a huge losses.

898
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,480
You must bless me.

899
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,400
Mother, are you still mad at us?

900
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,920
Please don't be angry.

901
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:27,800
We've apologized
and paid for all your medical bills.

902
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,079
Look at Stella.
She's so obedient now.

903
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:30,400
Stella, pray to Grandma.

904
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,840
Mother, please bless us all.

905
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:47,079
Mother, thank you for blessing us.
I'm finally pregnant.

906
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,639
Mother, you blessed me with a child,
but did not bless me with any earnings.

907
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,559
How will I feed my child?

908
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:59,599
Our business is getting worse every day.

909
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:03,599
Please open your eyes and look after us.

910
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,239
Please give us your blessing.

911
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,760
Take a break.

912
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,440
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

913
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,599
Our business is getting worse.
What shall we do?

914
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:20,239
The market is so bad.

915
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,599
What can we do, right?

916
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,360
Amid the economic downturn,

917
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,880
the government has launched a new scheme
to help small and medium businesses.

918
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,400
Let's apply for it.

919
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,880
Lots of incentives up for grabs.

920
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,559
Don't be naive, Second Brother.

921
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:39,719
Normally, you can apply,

922
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,840
but it doesn't mean you'll get approval.

923
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,039
"Apply" and "approve"
are two different words.

924
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,360
Many conditions apply.

925
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,239
It's never easy getting money
from the government,

926
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,199
but it's so much easier
in the private sector.

927
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,800
Private sector? How?

928
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:55,840
I have a friend who's a Datuk.

929
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,159
Datuk?

930
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:59,480
-Where?
-Kuala Lumpur.

931
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,239
He's loaded.

932
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,599
If he invests in our business,
we'll be rich.

933
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,639
Are you sure?

934
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:06,559
Okay!

935
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,800
You have to be careful.
There are cheats everywhere.

936
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,840
Rest assured, Big Brother, he wants
to see me. Here's my suggestion.

937
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,239
Next week, why don't we, as directors
of our company, meet him in Kuala Lumpur?

938
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,880
-Okay, we'll go where the riches are.
-Lovely!

939
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,039
Mother, this is our last chance.

940
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,960
You've been up there for a year.
You should have friends.

941
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:31,159
Please get them to bless us too.

942
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,800
Otherwise, your sons' future is doomed.

943
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,920
Please give us your blessing.

944
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,599
Win big!

945
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,480
Bless us.

946
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,199
Since Mother died,
we've not had dinner together.

947
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,880
Too bad.
We're all busy with our business.

948
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,920
Luckily, we made some profits initially.
Not anymore.

949
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,880
Too bad. No blessing from Mother.
What can we do, right?

950
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,800
Sometimes, I miss Mother.

951
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,159
Enough talk. Let's eat.

952
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,119
Who put a chair over there?
What is it for? Mother is no longer here.

953
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,119
I didn't do it.

954
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,559
Did you girls put the chair here?

955
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,599
Stella, mind your words
on the Seventh Month.

956
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:29,800
Sorry!

957
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,119
Take the chair away, hubby.

958
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,519
I'll do it.

959
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,559
She's our mother, nothing to be afraid of.

960
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,880
Don't be afraid.

961
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,400
Come sit closer.

962
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:38,920
More room for us.

963
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,639
This pig's trotter tastes great!

964
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,840
Sister-in-law, you've finally mastered
Mother's cooking.

965
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,239
This tastes exactly like Mother's cooking!

966
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,519
Congratulation! It's delicious. Eat more.

967
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,760
I didn't cook that dish.
Didn't you bring it here?

968
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,079
Don't look at me. It wasn't me.

969
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,320
I didn't bring it either.

970
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,199
I bought it.

971
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,960
You almost scared us to death.

972
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,719
Dear, I bought it
from the coffee shop near our place.

973
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,559
It tastes exactly like Mother's cooking.

974
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:14,800
Why didn't you mention it before?

975
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,199
Come on, let's eat.

976
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,280
Why is there another chair?

977
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,920
No, the chair was here all along.

978
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,920
The chair was never here.
Ask you wife.

979
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,239
He's right.

980
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,199
See?

981
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,480
Big Brother, that chair is gone!

982
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,440
I remember placing the chair over there.

983
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:53,800
Why is it here?

984
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:55,679
Is it grandma?

985
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,199
She wants to join us for dinner.

986
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,079
Mind your words. Just eat!

987
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,880
Tell me, did anyone talk nonsense
at the altar earlier?

988
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,320
-No!
-Someone must have done it!

989
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,639
Mother! Mother!

990
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:02,119
Ong, have you seen my bra?

991
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,519
Damn!

992
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,719
I saw Mother!

993
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,720
Darling! Darling!

994
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,680
What's up, dear?

995
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,600
I saw Mother!

996
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:28,159
Mother?

997
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,680
Where?

998
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,000
Here, she was here,
asking me for her bra.

999
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:35,159
I'm not kidding!

1000
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,600
Were you dreaming?

1001
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,880
Impossible!

1002
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,840
It's true. She was sitting over here,
right at this spot.

1003
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,960
I'm not lying!

1004
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:52,840
Ong, have you seen my bra?

1005
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,000
The red one with Mickey Mouse prints.

1006
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,279
I'll buy you another one.

1007
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,159
Get it in Singapore.

1008
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:33,960
Boss, you're selling green tea too?

1009
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,640
Yes. The trend follows
the dead to the underworld.

1010
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,560
They'll still prefer
their favorite drinks down there.

1011
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,640
-"Down there"?
-Of course!

1012
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,039
How can I help you?

1013
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,479
Do you sell bras?

1014
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,119
Bras? You came here to buy a bra?

1015
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,920
Are you serious?

1016
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:56,479
I've no choice.

1017
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,600
My mother haunts me every day,
asking me for her bra.

1018
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:04,199
You're the first customer
to make such a request.

1019
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:07,960
-Do you have?
-Okay, I'll have them tailor-made for you.

1020
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,760
Good. Give me two pairs.

1021
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,079
-Color?
-Black and red.

1022
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:14,039
I'll take it down.

1023
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,319
Can you add Mickey Mouse stickers to them?

1024
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,880
Mickey Mouse?

1025
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,439
-Your mother likes Mickey Mouse?
-There's nothing I can do!

1026
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,840
She keeps demanding
Mickey Mouse on her bra.

1027
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,119
If you can do it,
I can burn it for her.

1028
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,800
Burn Mickey Mouse?
Can't do it. Copyright infringement.

1029
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,199
You're right. This is such a pain!
I have a suggestion.

1030
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,319
Can you make it so that
the Chinese know it's Mickey Mouse,

1031
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,199
but Westerners can't tell.

1032
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,199
You're so hilarious!

1033
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,800
I'll try my best.

1034
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,640
-It's settled. I'll collect them tomorrow.
-Okay, okay.

1035
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,039
What's her cup size?

1036
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:10,520
She's been gone for a year,
but has never told me.

1037
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,560
What shall I do?

1038
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:14,319
We play safe, give her a large cup size.

1039
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,720
Large? Large one?
Yes, the larger, the better.

1040
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:22,000
Okay. Okay.

1041
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,560
Hui, have you eaten?

1042
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,840
Yes.

1043
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,600
Darling!

1044
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,159
Darling!

1045
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Did you ask me if I've eaten?

1046
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:00,880
Darling!

1047
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,920
You're insane.

1048
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:08,920
You've been asking me
the same question for days.

1049
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:12,399
And will you please
get the television repaired?

1050
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:14,479
It's been broken for days.
I think the wires are loose.

1051
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,720
I've missed my favorite drama series.

1052
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,760
So annoying.

1053
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,680
Look at this television.

1054
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,600
Must be a loose wire.

1055
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,800
Mother! She's inside the TV!

1056
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:42,000
No! Where is she?
You're insane!

1057
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,760
Loose wire...

1058
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,359
Mother is in the television!
She's inside!

1059
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,960
Don't scare me!

1060
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:15,359
You! It's not the television.
You're the one with a loose wire!

1061
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,840
You do the adjustment.
I'll watch from here.

1062
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,399
Look. Look carefully.

1063
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:35,039
See anything?

1064
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,520
This is a nice show.

1065
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:41,680
What a bad daughter-in-law!

1066
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:51,680
I dreamed of Mother!

1067
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,560
Hui, have you eaten?

1068
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,159
What a bad daughter-in-law!

1069
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,239
I can't take it anymore.

1070
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,520
Mother sits on my bed every night,
asking for her Mickey Mouse bra.

1071
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,640
I can't stand it anymore.

1072
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:24,960
I bought her a large Mickey Mouse bra,

1073
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:27,680
but she's still not happy
and continues to haunt me.

1074
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,000
It's worse for me.

1075
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:30,239
How?

1076
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,399
She only haunts you at night,
but she haunts me all day.

1077
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,760
-That's bad.
-I hear her words every minute,

1078
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,039
but see nobody around me.

1079
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:44,159
Now, she has a new trick.

1080
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,319
What is it?

1081
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,159
She hides in the television
and scares me.

1082
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,640
Which channel?

1083
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,920
Every channel.

1084
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:56,000
She kept repeating the same words
until my head almost cracked.

1085
01:14:57,319 --> 01:14:59,319
Second Brother, you look very relaxed.

1086
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:00,760
Mother didn't harass you?

1087
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,880
Nope.

1088
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Impossible!

1089
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:04,319
Maybe she thinks I'm a good son.

1090
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:08,239
You must be joking.

1091
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:09,640
I'll tell you honestly,

1092
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,079
if not for that packet of blood you took,
Mother would still be alive.

1093
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,119
-You're wrong.
-Why?

1094
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,960
Mother willingly volunteered
to save Stella.

1095
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:21,239
In danger, who would you save?
Mother or daughter?

1096
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:25,199
I asked for your opinions,
but both of you just avoided the question!

1097
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:29,119
She's our only Mother, the one and only.

1098
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,720
Even if she pulled the oxygen tube,
I would've plugged it back.

1099
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,239
Now you're saying this!

1100
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:37,560
Isn't it too late?
Your daughter isn't born yet--

1101
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,479
Don't you mention my daughter.

1102
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,159
You did it too.

1103
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,239
Stop fighting.

1104
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,359
It's been over a year, for goodness sake.

1105
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,479
But I don't understand,
why didn't Mother look for you?

1106
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,039
Big Brother,
how could you say such things?

1107
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:55,640
Mother must have tried haunting him,
but in vain.

1108
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:58,840
You've moved twice in a year,
hiding from Mother?

1109
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,319
-Nonsense!
-There's no use hiding.

1110
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:02,920
She'll find you one day.

1111
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,119
I'm not afraid of her!

1112
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:08,600
Why should I be?
She may even help me win the lottery!

1113
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,720
Don't be so mean to your own brother!

1114
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:15,399
I'm not afraid!

1115
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,079
You gave me a fright!

1116
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,439
Don't pat on my shoulder from behind.
It's the Seventh Month!

1117
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,840
You're so cowardly!

1118
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,840
Let me tell you something.
They've seen Mother around.

1119
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:41,920
I think we're next!

1120
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:46,399
Let's go.

1121
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,960
Are you sure?

1122
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,199
Hubby! Hubby!

1123
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,039
Give me a tissue.

1124
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:15,079
Hurry. My eyes are hurting.

1125
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:20,039
Hurry up!

1126
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,159
Your tissue.

1127
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,199
You gave it to me, right?

1128
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:35,000
No, I just got here.

1129
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:36,199
Then what's in my hand?

1130
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:37,680
But I just entered the room.

1131
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,359
Trying to scare me?

1132
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:42,479
I've wet my pants,
I'm so scared. Childish!

1133
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,479
Says who?
I'm not that easy-going.

1134
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:31,640
Darling, tell me honestly,
did you help me wash my face earlier?

1135
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,600
No.

1136
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:34,439
Come on.

1137
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,760
No.

1138
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,640
-Don't lie to me, please.
-No!

1139
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:42,600
-Can you lie to me? Say yes.
-What's wrong with you?

1140
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,039
I'll feel better this way.

1141
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:47,600
You're becoming more cowardly
as you grow older.

1142
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,640
I'm getting the feeling
that Mother is already in here.

1143
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,119
Why are you so afraid?
She lived with us before.

1144
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:57,880
Don't worry. Just sleep.

1145
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:02,680
We'll burn some incense for her tomorrow.

1146
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,800
Okay.

1147
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,600
Kiong...

1148
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:11,720
Did you hear Mother calling me?

1149
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,399
No!

1150
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:18,479
Kiong...

1151
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,920
This time, I did!

1152
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,039
Don't scare us, Mother.
I admit I'm not a good son.

1153
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:27,840
I'll burn some incense
for you tomorrow. Please!

1154
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:30,279
-Don't scare us!
-Let's sleep.

1155
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:33,319
Kiong...

1156
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:39,479
Don't trouble yourself over where I sleep.

1157
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,560
I can sleep anywhere.

1158
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:48,600
You saw Mother too?

1159
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,600
That was your wish, wasn't it?

1160
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,319
Now that it's has come true,
aren't you two delighted?

1161
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:55,760
-What are you talking about?
-Why would we want it to happen?

1162
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,239
Stop playing dumb!

1163
01:21:57,399 --> 01:22:01,760
Both of you were here last night,
jealous of Mother not haunting me,

1164
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,039
so you cursed me, and now she did
come haunt me. Are you two satisfied?

1165
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:08,159
-But we went to Johor yesterday.
-Exactly.

1166
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,640
Stop denying it!

1167
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,760
If you don't believe me,
I'll show you my passport.

1168
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,520
Yes, we were in Johor.

1169
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,199
Stop denying it!

1170
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:17,520
I'm not a fool!

1171
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:20,920
Are you dreaming, Second Brother?

1172
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,600
Dreaming?

1173
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,000
But I remember we meeting here!

1174
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:29,039
You're saying
even our meeting here was a dream?

1175
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:34,159
And I continued to dream of Mother.

1176
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,359
She almost scared me to death.

1177
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,640
-I also dreamed of Mother.
-Me too.

1178
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,079
Both of you?

1179
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,399
Mother appeared in all our dreams.

1180
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,119
What's her motive?

1181
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:49,039
Right.

1182
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,479
Big Brother,
did you perform the prayers correctly?

1183
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,760
Do you know the proper procedures?

1184
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:58,239
What are you trying to say?

1185
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,039
I don't need you juniors to teach me.

1186
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,880
In fact, I should've told you earlier,

1187
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:07,680
I'm not Mother's only son.

1188
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,039
Each of us should take turns monthly
to offer her prayers.

1189
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
I can't do it.

1190
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,840
Her tablet doesn't suit
the avant-garde design of my house.

1191
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:18,399
Same here.
You know that I'm busy.

1192
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:21,960
"Can't"? "Busy"?
I don't care! We take turns praying.

1193
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,560
Isn't that your friend?

1194
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:31,359
Wow, looks like he's having a good time.

1195
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:36,880
-Hey, buddy!
-Both of you, wait for me over there.

1196
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,840
Lucky you, driving a Mercedes!

1197
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,800
Mine broke down.
This is my maid's errand car.

1198
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,800
You must be earning a lot.
What's you job?

1199
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,960
I don't need to work.

1200
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:51,319
My mother's blessing me
with such good fortune.

1201
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:54,399
I keep asking her not to let me
win the lottery again, but in vain.

1202
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,079
I even won first prize
with unlucky numbers like 4444.

1203
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,760
I just keep winning.

1204
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,640
Even the bookies shun me.

1205
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,680
Your mother is that powerful?

1206
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,279
Didn't you know? When an elder dies,
the timing is important.

1207
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:13,159
If she dies at midnight,

1208
01:24:13,239 --> 01:24:16,239
she takes away all fortune
and leaves nothing for the descendants.

1209
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:19,720
But if the time is in the morning
such as 7:00 a.m.,

1210
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,520
the descendants will prosper,
leaving nothing for the deceased.

1211
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,600
And if she dies at noon,
both parties will split the luck.

1212
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:29,079
Get it? I doubt you do!

1213
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:30,920
So your mother died in the morning?

1214
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,960
It was supposed to be at midnight.

1215
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,039
The doctor tried to revive her
with injections and a defibrillator,

1216
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:40,119
and shook her through the night.

1217
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:45,079
She struggled all the way until daybreak,

1218
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:47,560
thereby blessing us with good fortune.

1219
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,760
That's what I call a great mother.

1220
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,159
I need to go.

1221
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,880
Forty thousand.

1222
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,359
Let's go have some fun!

1223
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,560
You'll be fined for illegal parking!

1224
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,680
What's the big deal?

1225
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,319
I'm loaded!

1226
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:09,920
Jealous of me?

1227
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,720
This is the life!

1228
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:22,239
Our mother died at night.
She left us with nothing.

1229
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:27,800
After hearing what he said,
I realize Mother cannot bless us anymore.

1230
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,319
So all the prayers are a waste of time.

1231
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,279
Forget it then.

1232
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:36,680
How can you say that?
We're her sons, for goodness sake!

1233
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:41,520
Big Brother, if you try too hard,
the situation may backfire.

1234
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,600
Our luck may turn from bad to worse.

1235
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,399
Now I know
why Mother appeared in our dreams.

1236
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,359
Why?

1237
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:50,479
She's trying to tell us
she can't bless us anymore.

1238
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,760
So, by scaring us,
she hopes we'll stay away from her.

1239
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:55,720
Therefore, we should stop all the prayers.

1240
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:57,239
Sounds logical.

1241
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,520
What do we do with the tablet?

1242
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,479
Listen, I know someone from a temple.

1243
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,119
The temple is quite remote,

1244
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:10,520
but we can house the tablet there
at discount rates. What do you think?

1245
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,479
-I'm good!
-Good?

1246
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:13,960
How about you, Big Brother?

1247
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,079
When Mother was alive,
you sent her to an old folks home.

1248
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,880
Now that she's dead,
you're sending her to an old temple?

1249
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,960
Have you no humanity?

1250
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:24,439
There's nothing we can do.

1251
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,840
There's no point continuing the prayers.
My mind is made up.

1252
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,159
Me too.

1253
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,399
What about you?

1254
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:33,359
Big Brother, if you insist,
do it at your own risk.

1255
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:36,720
-Don't say we didn't warn you.
-Think about it.

1256
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,119
Who will bring Mother to the temple?

1257
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:28,600
Mother, don't get the wrong idea.

1258
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,399
We're not bad sons.

1259
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,840
We've found a nice place for you.

1260
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,319
It's divine.

1261
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:43,239
See? Beautiful scenery on your left,

1262
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:47,000
and your old buddies on your right.

1263
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,720
They're all staying here with you.

1264
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,439
They'll keep you happy.

1265
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:56,600
You can chat with them,

1266
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,239
play games, talk about the old days...

1267
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:04,560
The air is very fresh.

1268
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:08,800
Butterflies, birds...

1269
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,039
Look! And even parrots!

1270
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,920
Mind your step.

1271
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:19,079
Be careful. Slowly.

1272
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,760
Up the stairs.

1273
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,560
Mother, here's your mansion.

1274
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:18,119
Hello?

1275
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,399
I'll tell you something very frightening.

1276
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:21,800
Come here quickly.

1277
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,279
Hurry!

1278
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,960
Big Brother, why didn't you bring
Mother's tablet into the temple?

1279
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:42,239
-I did.
-Then?

1280
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:44,359
I sent her in,
but she flew back here.

1281
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,680
Flew back here?

1282
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,520
Are you sure you weren't daydreaming?

1283
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,640
Or was it that you made a mistake?

1284
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:55,399
Why won't the two of you believe me?

1285
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:58,399
I brought Mother in personally,

1286
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:01,279
but when I came out,
she was already inside,

1287
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:04,000
even before I opened the car door!

1288
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,720
-Don't cry.
-Stop crying.

1289
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:13,560
I'm not crying.

1290
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,159
Do you know how frightened I am?

1291
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,960
Listen, don't try to be funny,
Big Brother.

1292
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:23,119
Tablets don't fly out on their own.
You must be joking, right?

1293
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:25,880
-Is this a prank?
-Why are you both so stubborn?

1294
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:29,920
Why won't the two of you just believe me?

1295
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,119
Why would I need to lie?
Why are you doubting me?

1296
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,720
-Why?
-Okay, we believe you.

1297
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,920
I think Mother wants us
to send her in together.

1298
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,119
Here we are.

1299
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,000
Here we come, Mother.

1300
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,319
All right, let's send her in together.

1301
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,880
He's doing all this
because he's unwilling to do it alone.

1302
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:14,920
Big Brother, we need to go.
Time is running out.

1303
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,359
I feel weird.

1304
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:25,720
Can we cancel the appointment
with the Datuk today?

1305
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,560
No, the Datuk is a busy man.

1306
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,840
We need to make an appointment
three months in advance.

1307
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,880
We have no other choice.
Maybe Mother will bless us with success.

1308
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,600
If we don't go,
how can she bless us?

1309
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,560
Exactly. Let's go.

1310
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:42,800
What's up?

1311
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,520
I'm looking for Mother's flying tablet.

1312
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,199
Don't be superstitious.
Did you actually forget--

1313
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:52,680
Here you go again!

1314
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,600
Enough talk. Let's get going.

1315
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,239
Come on, there's a traffic jam
at the causeway!

1316
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:22,760
Let me remind you, don't visit Mother
only on her anniversary.

1317
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,680
You should do it every now and then.

1318
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,279
If Mother blesses us
with success this time,

1319
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:30,640
I'll buy the whole temple
for her to stay in.

1320
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,279
Actually, I don't understand Mother.

1321
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:34,000
Take your friend's mother for example,

1322
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:36,920
always blessing your friend
with good luck.

1323
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,840
But our mother? Nothing.

1324
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,079
Not only are we not winning
any money in the lottery,

1325
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,520
even our business
is being left in the cold,

1326
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,800
making us struggle like hell.

1327
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:47,720
Exactly.

1328
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:50,119
How can you say that?

1329
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:52,279
Why are you
always complaining about Mother?

1330
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,640
She's our mother!

1331
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:57,319
We still have to respect her,
even if she's dead.

1332
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:00,760
Okay, enough talk.

1333
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,000
What's that sound?

1334
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,399
Must be those falling branches.

1335
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,399
Drive slowly.
Our children are still young.

1336
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,359
In fact, I'm more concerned than you are.
I have a pregnant wife.

1337
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:19,439
Just slow down.

1338
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,560
I'm only going 74 miles an hour.

1339
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:24,439
Says who?
It's 100 miles an hour.

1340
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,800
The meter's faulty.

1341
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,319
Remember, three lives are at stake here.

1342
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:32,560
Slow down. The rain is getting heavier.

1343
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,479
I'm driving. You're such a nag.

1344
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:43,119
Mother!

1345
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,640
Be careful, Big Brother!
It's very slippery.

1346
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,199
Watch your step!

1347
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:01,640
I know. You be careful too!

1348
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,720
Be careful!

1349
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:17,079
Don't look back. Just move!
The car is sinking!

1350
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:29,920
Hurry! Don't look back. Hurry up!

1351
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:42,720
-Did you see Mother?
-Yes, I did.

1352
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,319
-Did you see Mother?
-Yes.

1353
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:46,680
Why is she trying to scare us?

1354
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,840
And there goes our car!

1355
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:51,399
Mother.

1356
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:55,920
Look, Second Brother.

1357
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,239
Brother.

1358
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:00,720
Look, Big Brother.

1359
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:18,079
Let's go. Be careful, Mother.

1360
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,800
Mind your step.

1361
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,800
Be careful, Mother.

1362
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,520
It's your friend again.
What happened to you?

1363
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:38,880
Down on my luck.

1364
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:42,520
Didn't your mother
bless you in everything?

1365
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:44,920
Yes, she blesses me in everything.

1366
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:46,680
She gave me luck in the lottery,

1367
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,560
in Big Sweep,

1368
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,000
in Toto,

1369
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:51,920
even at illegal gambling.

1370
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,279
And now, she even gave me cancer.

1371
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,720
You have cancer?

1372
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,880
Damn the doctor.

1373
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:07,800
He said I was okay
after months of check-ups.

1374
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:10,680
I checked with another doctor
to confirm the results,

1375
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:14,640
and he told me
I've only three months left to live.

1376
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:19,239
I'm doomed!

1377
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,000
So what if I'm rich?

1378
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:28,560
My mother didn't bless me well.

1379
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:32,079
I've decided not to offer her
prayers anymore.

1380
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:40,359
Heed my advice.

1381
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:47,000
Nothing is more important
than our health and safety.

1382
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:48,880
Don't let me fall.

1383
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:53,159
If I fall, I may be left
with only one week to live.

1384
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,039
Let's go bring Mother home.

1385
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:45,239
WHEN YOU HAVE HEALTH AND PEACE,
DO YOU THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE?

1386
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,319
This is the money that
the God of Fortune gave to you.

1387
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:04,199
God of Wealth. Not God of Fortune.

1388
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,840
This is...

1389
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:09,119
This is God of Fortune...

1390
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,840
This is the money that
the God of Fortune gave to you.

1391
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,079
God of Wealth!

1392
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,479
Cheesy.

1393
01:40:15,159 --> 01:40:17,279
-I want to learn.
-I want to learn.

1394
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,399
Sit.

1395
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:25,760
It did hit.

1396
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,640
It did hit.

1397
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,840
-160...
-The meter doesn't work.

1398
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:36,199
Don't forget.
We all want...

1399
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:38,199
We are all together.

1400
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:41,439
When we are all together

1401
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,520
This is in the beginning.

1402
01:40:48,359 --> 01:40:50,159
-Eh...
-Mother!

1403
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,359
Mother! Ah!

1404
01:40:57,479 --> 01:40:59,399
Eh, mother! Ah!

1405
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:07,640
Nice job.

1406
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,279
If I see marble, all of a sudden...

1407
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:13,000
-Marble?
-Marble?

1408
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,880
If I see bubble...

1409
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,039
-Marble.
-Marble.

1410
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,560
-Mother don't sit too close.
-Our super crazy friends...

1411
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:29,199
Why did you...

1412
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,520
Bless us rich!
