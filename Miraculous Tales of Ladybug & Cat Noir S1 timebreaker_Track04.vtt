&lrm;Well? With or without?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.780
&lrm;[hesitantly] With?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.580
&lrm;You're sure it's not better without?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.300
&lrm;Either way, you look perfect.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.300
&lrm;It's not every day you celebrate
&lrm;your 20th wedding anniversary.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.060
&lrm;[father] Marinette! Can you come here?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.940
&lrm;Well?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.780
&lrm;Well what?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.660
&lrm;My moustache, I groomed it.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.620
&lrm;Is it too short? Should I shave it off?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.740
&lrm;Is it crooked?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.860
&lrm;You look perfect, dad...
&lrm;Except for one thing.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.140
&lrm;Thanks, sweetheart.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.100
&lrm;No problem, dad.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980
&lrm;You're going to be late.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.620
&lrm;Mrs. Chamack is coming to pick up
&lrm;her Eiffel Tower cake

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.780
&lrm;in 30 minutes. I'm depending on you.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.180
&lrm;Yeah, yeah, no sweat, piece of cake.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.700
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
&lrm;Married 20 years...
&lrm;pretty cool isn't it, Tikki?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.700
&lrm;Time flies when you're having fun.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.980
&lrm;Not when you're doing homework.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.940
&lrm;[Tikki chuckles]

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.300
&lrm;Hey.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.460
&lrm;They're Marinette's parents,
&lrm;a chick I hang out with.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.140
&lrm;Yes, I remember.
&lrm;They make the best bread in Paris.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.140
&lrm;Couldn't you have made
&lrm;more effort to dress nicely?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.020
&lrm;What d'you mean? I took off my cap.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.340
&lrm;But this is a special day.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.340
&lrm;Well, it's only a birthday.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.740
&lrm;[he tuts] No...

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.300
&lrm;This is a special birthday.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.780
&lrm;This family heirloom was made
&lrm;by an ancestor many years ago.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
&lrm;It's been passed down
&lrm;through the generations,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.860
&lrm;on the fifteenth birthday, and today,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.660
&lrm;it's your turn to inherit it.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.540
&lrm;It's sweet, but I've already got a watch,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.820
&lrm;synched to my phone.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.820
&lrm;Sometimes, there's more to things
&lrm;than meets the eye.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.780
&lrm;Let's just say our ancestor was...

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.460
&lrm;[twinkling]

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.220
&lrm;ahead of his time.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.900
&lrm;Of course, I'd understand

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.300
&lrm;if you'd rather me buy you
&lrm;a new pair of rollerblades.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.140
&lrm;No, dad, I'm stoked.
&lrm;It's awesome, thank you.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.660
&lrm;[her phone rings]

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.500
&lrm;Are your friends waiting?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.580
&lrm;Yeah, but I don't want
&lrm;to bail on you, it's cool.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.220
&lrm;No, no, go ahead.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.260
&lrm;Now take good care of it.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
&lrm;Yeah.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620
&lrm;Come on, Marinette, you can do it.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.500
&lrm;Just remember the formula.
&lrm;Think, Marinette.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.300
&lrm;I might be able to if you weren't
&lrm;distracting me.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940
&lrm;Hey, Alya. What's up?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.900
&lrm;The what?

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.620
&lrm;The bet between Alix and Kim?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.540
&lrm;No, of course I didn't forget.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.220
&lrm;I've made the banner.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.340
&lrm;I know everyone's counting on me.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.620
&lrm;In five minutes?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.060
&lrm;No sweat. I'm on my way already.
&lrm;Be right there.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.300
&lrm;But you have to wait for Mrs. Chamack.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.580
&lrm;I've 20 minutes before she arrives.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.540
&lrm;I told them I'd do the banner.
&lrm;They're counting on me.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660
&lrm;Besides, Adrien will be there.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.180
&lrm;You'll never make it to Trocadéro
&lrm;in five minutes, it's too far.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.980
&lrm;Not too far for Ladybug.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.380
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.620
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.780
&lrm;That's beautiful.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.180
&lrm;Impressive, Marinette.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.620
&lrm;You've picked the wrong side.
&lrm;Alix hasn't even shown up.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180
&lrm;Probably too chicken
&lrm;to race an athlete like me.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.100
&lrm;[Alix] Spoke too soon, Kim.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.460
&lrm;Your ridiculous bets are over.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.540
&lrm;I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.500
&lrm;You're no match for me.
&lrm;My neck's bigger than your thigh.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.980
&lrm;Is that a good thing?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380
&lrm;Let's review the official rules.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.780
&lrm;Two laps around the fountains,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.020
&lrm;approximately 500 yards.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.740
&lrm;The first over the line is the victor.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.340
&lrm;If Kim wins, Alix will relinquish
&lrm;her rollerblades to him.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.540
&lrm;If Alix wins,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.620
&lrm;Kim will be prohibited
&lrm;from making any dares

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.500
&lrm;for the rest of the school year.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.620
&lrm;We're through with those stupid dares.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.780
&lrm;-Yeah, that's right!
&lrm;-No more dares!

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.140
&lrm;On your marks.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.260
&lrm;Get set...

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.700
&lrm;Hold up!

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.580
&lrm;[he groans, the crowd giggles]

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.980
&lrm;Forfeiting already?

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.260
&lrm;Hold on to this, Alya.
&lrm;I don't want to drop it.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.540
&lrm;Hold on, girl. I can't. I...

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.260
&lrm;Guard it with your life.
&lrm;It's a family heirloom.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.620
&lrm;But...

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.860
&lrm;Marinette, take this.
&lrm;I gotta record the race for my blog.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.060
&lrm;On your marks.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.980
&lrm;Get set.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.260
&lrm;Go!

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.980
&lrm;But she asked you to look after it.
&lrm;I've gotta hold the banner.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.700
&lrm;Need any help?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.820
&lrm;Wh...? Yep, thanks,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.060
&lrm;Gotta be careful,
&lrm;even if you are amazing...

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.660
&lrm;At... holding things... in your hands.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.220
&lrm;[cheering]

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.900
&lrm;Last lap.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.940
&lrm;Amazing at holding things?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.540
&lrm;Adrikins? Whatcha got there?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.580
&lrm;Some super-old case or something?

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.860
&lrm;Careful, it's Alix's.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.220
&lrm;If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.540
&lrm;Give it back to Adrien, Chloé.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.820
&lrm;Yeah!

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.380
&lrm;I call a rematch.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.540
&lrm;That false start threw me off.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.020
&lrm;Did you do this?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.540
&lrm;I had to record the race,
&lrm;so I gave it to Marinette.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.540
&lrm;She had the banner
&lrm;so she gave it to Adrien.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.140
&lrm;Then Chloé snatched it and dropped it.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.740
&lrm;Then you skated over it.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.180
&lrm;My old man gave me this for my birthday.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.820
&lrm;This watch is totally a family heirloom.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.980
&lrm;It was an accident.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.300
&lrm;We didn't mean any harm.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.540
&lrm;As if... I totally had nothing
&lrm;to do with this.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.020
&lrm;You're all to blame!

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.940
&lrm;[she sobs]

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.100
&lrm;Alix, wait!

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.900
&lrm;-Marinette, what about the cake?
&lrm;-There's still time. Hide.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.060
&lrm;[evil voice] Such disappointment,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.620
&lrm;frustration, and negativity.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.900
&lrm;How it fills my heart with exhilaration.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.180
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma and evilize her.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.380
&lrm;Bon appetit.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.980
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.140
&lrm;It's Mrs. Chamack.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.900
&lrm;-Hello.
<i>&lrm;-Hi, I'm at the bakery,</i>

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.860
<i>&lrm;-but it's closed. I need my cake now.</i>
&lrm;-I know you do.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.620
&lrm;My daughter's home.
&lrm;She must be upstairs.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.340
&lrm;I'll phone her now.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.140
&lrm;Maybe we could fix it.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.260
&lrm;This watch was sick, one of a kind.
&lrm;It can't be fixed!

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.380
&lrm;There has to be a way
&lrm;to get it back to how it was.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.580
&lrm;Like, how?

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.580
&lrm;Go back in time and change the future?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.500
&lrm;When you figure out how, lemme know!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.980
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.020
&lrm;Oh no, this can't be good.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.140
&lrm;Hello, dad.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.660
&lrm;Timebreaker, I'm Hawk Moth.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.340
&lrm;I'm granting you the power to retaliate

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.060
&lrm;against the people who've wronged you,

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.180
&lrm;and to go back in time
&lrm;to restore the future.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.180
&lrm;But you must do me a favor in return
&lrm;when the time is right.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.180
&lrm;You got it, Hawk Moth.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.420
<i>&lrm;Mrs. Chamack is outside</i>
<i>&lrm;waiting for her cake.</i>

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.540
&lrm;I gotta go. Can't keep her waiting.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.020
&lrm;She was listening to music.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.540
&lrm;Run!

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.300
&lrm;Stop, Alix! What are you doing?

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.340
&lrm;The name's Timebreaker now.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.900
&lrm;I'm going back in time to save my watch,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.860
&lrm;using you punks to do it.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.300
&lrm;Go back in time?
&lrm;What did you do? Why is he fading?

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.700
&lrm;I needed his energy.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.460
&lrm;He was a pain anyway with all those bets.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.900
&lrm;He deserves to disappear forever,
&lrm;and so do you.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.060
&lrm;We've got to transform, now.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.500
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.100
&lrm;Yeah!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.020
&lrm;Time out, Timebreaker.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.740
&lrm;Please, help me.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.780
&lrm;I'm messed up, please, please,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.260
&lrm;No!

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.660
&lrm;[cackling]

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.300
&lrm;Sweet, Rose,

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.020
&lrm;always thinking of others before yourself.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.260
&lrm;One minute.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.540
&lrm;I gotta destroy her Akuma
&lrm;before everyone disappears.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.980
&lrm;Where's is that Cat?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.740
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.340
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.500
&lrm;[she cackles]

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.500
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;One and a half minutes.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.740
&lrm;You won't be able to stop me
&lrm;where I'm going, Ladybug.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.500
&lrm;Lemme guess,
&lrm;we're playing tag and you're it?

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.220
&lrm;Exactly!

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.540
&lrm;Don't let her touch you.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.820
&lrm;Missed me. Just a second too late.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.180
&lrm;No!

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.660
&lrm;Well she wastes no time, does she?

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.980
&lrm;The more people she freezes,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.420
&lrm;the more minutes she gets
&lrm;to go back in time.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.700
&lrm;Those kids are goners
&lrm;if we don't get that Akuma.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.300
&lrm;Keep your hands to yourself.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.460
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Now, Timebreaker,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.860
&lrm;grab her Miraculous,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.460
&lrm;her earring!

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.780
&lrm;Cat Noir, No!

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.140
&lrm;Wow, six minutes in one go.
&lrm;Musta been those nine lives.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.180
&lrm;Gotta go, the past is waiting.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.860
&lrm;Timebreaker, the Miraculous!
&lrm;Take his ring before he disappears!

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.620
&lrm;Go ahead and try.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.140
&lrm;Chill out, Hawk Moth, I have a sick plan.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.740
&lrm;[Ladybug squeals]

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.420
&lrm;Wh-What just happened?

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.580
&lrm;[cheering]

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.260
&lrm;Go, Alix, yeah!

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.340
&lrm;We've gone back in time, haven't we?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.980
&lrm;Watcha got there?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.500
&lrm;Careful, it's Alix's.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.700
&lrm;What is this?
&lrm;Some super-old case or something?

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.860
&lrm;If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.740
&lrm;Give it back to Adrien, Chloé.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.980
&lrm;My watch!

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.980
&lrm;Chloé, put the watch down!

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.740
&lrm;No!

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.620
&lrm;Ladybug, this time it's your fault!

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.300
&lrm;I need more energy.
&lrm;I've gotta go further back in time.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.780
&lrm;Ladybug, it's all Ladybug's fault!

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.460
&lrm;[evil voice] Could this be possible?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.060
&lrm;Do I see double vision in my future?

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.700
&lrm;Or should I say "double villain"?

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.980
&lrm;Fly away, my devilish Akuma,
&lrm;and join this troubled soul.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.780
&lrm;Everyone, get out of here!
&lrm;Don't let her touch you!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.220
&lrm;[Marinette] Who are you?

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.420
&lrm;I don't have time to explain,
&lrm;but I'm you,

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.340
&lrm;from a few minutes in the future.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.100
&lrm;She's right.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.220
&lrm;I can feel it.
&lrm;She is you... from the future.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.260
&lrm;Crazy!

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.180
&lrm;I know it seems unbelievable
&lrm;but trust me.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.220
&lrm;I mean trust... yourself.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.260
&lrm;And dad's gonna call me,
&lrm;I mean you, in two minutes.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.900
&lrm;He won't be happy because Mrs. Chamack
&lrm;is waiting at the bakery.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.580
&lrm;The cake... But I... I still have...

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.820
&lrm;Time? That's what I thought.
&lrm;She'll be early.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.180
&lrm;Just leave now and take care of the cake.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.980
&lrm;Don't worry, Ladybug can handle this.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.580
&lrm;How do I get myself
&lrm;into these crazy situations?

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.860
&lrm;Cat Noir, I can't explain now

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.060
&lrm;but we've gotta capture
&lrm;Timebreaker's Akuma.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.860
&lrm;Your life depends on it.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.700
&lrm;Which life? I've got nine.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.500
&lrm;I'm serious!
&lrm;The Akuma's in her rollerblades.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.500
&lrm;[Ladybug] We've gotta release it.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.100
&lrm;Am I seeing double?

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.100
&lrm;Another thing
&lrm;I don't have time to explain.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.740
&lrm;The energy from these two
&lrm;will be enough for us to go farther back.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.420
&lrm;I want my watch back. Let's do it.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.260
&lrm;Whatever you do, don't let them touch you.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.620
&lrm;Get the Miraculous, Timebreaker!

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.340
&lrm;If we were faster,
&lrm;they'd be no match for us.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.740
&lrm;Then let's stock up on more energy first.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.380
&lrm;Then we'll destroy them.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.300
&lrm;Oh, hold on, here she comes now.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.980
&lrm;It's fine, thanks.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.340
&lrm;It's all good.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.780
&lrm;Sorry again for making you wait.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.380
&lrm;[Tikki] Mission accomplished.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.060
&lrm;You mean Mission 1 accomplished.
&lrm;Time for Mission 2.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.180
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.420
&lrm;Yeah!

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.460
&lrm;We've got enough speed.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.220
&lrm;Let's go hardcore on Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.940
&lrm;Once we get their energy,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.100
&lrm;we'll have enough to go back together.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.420
&lrm;And get our watch!

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.500
&lrm;I thought we were chasing them.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.540
&lrm;[they yell]

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.020
&lrm;Hey, need a hand?

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.420
&lrm;Thanks!

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.100
&lrm;They're insane on their rollerblades.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.060
&lrm;Unstoppable on the ground.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.580
&lrm;So... what if they're not on the ground?

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.580
&lrm;Two Ladybugs? I'm in heaven.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.220
&lrm;We'd better go back now.
&lrm;There'll be less of them.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.180
&lrm;I'm down.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.460
&lrm;Don't fail me this time!

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.380
&lrm;[together] They're planning
&lrm;to go back in time again.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.700
&lrm;[together] Lucky charm!

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.980
&lrm;[together] Any ideas?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.260
&lrm;While you figure it out,
&lrm;I'll try to buy some time.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.340
&lrm;Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.420
&lrm;Of course.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.140
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.900
&lrm;Let's freeze her.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.220
&lrm;[panicked cries]

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.900
&lrm;We're going too fast! We can't stop!

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.700
&lrm;[they yell]

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.140
&lrm;Now!

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.300
&lrm;[they yell]

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.620
&lrm;[together] No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.180
&lrm;[together] Time to de-evilize!

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.580
&lrm;[together] Gotcha.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.820
&lrm;[together] Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.460
&lrm;[together] Miraculous ladybug!

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980
&lrm;[together] Pound it.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.500
&lrm;Here, I think this is yours.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.940
&lrm;Sweet!

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.060
&lrm;How did you fix it? Thank you.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.220
&lrm;I shouldn't have given it
&lrm;to someone else to look after.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.540
&lrm;It was my responsibility, my bad.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.540
&lrm;Responsibility isn't something
&lrm;to be taken lightly. I should know.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.820
&lrm;You're totally right.
&lrm;I'll be more careful next time.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.220
&lrm;Thanks, Ladybug.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.180
&lrm;I was getting used to having
&lrm;two Ladybugs around.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.940
&lrm;Now you're going
&lrm;to get used to no Ladybugs around.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.900
&lrm;I gotta split before I change back.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.100
&lrm;She'll fall for me someday.
&lrm;It's just a matter of time.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.900
&lrm;You slipped by me this time,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.820
&lrm;but one day, past, present, or future,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.620
&lrm;you will be destroyed,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.020
&lrm;and I'll have your Miraculouses!

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.780
&lrm;I will be unstoppable!

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.460
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.580
&lrm;Hey! So...

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.260
&lrm;did you have a nice anniversary?

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.420
&lrm;[father] We sure did.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.060
&lrm;Although, it was a close call.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.620
&lrm;Yeah. I'm sorry that I kept her waiting.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.020
&lrm;Next time, please wait in the bakery,

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.500
&lrm;not in your room listening to music.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.860
