-[Sofia] I'm here. I'm here.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.458
-I'm sorry.
-It's good. It's good. Okay?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.458
-[Riccardo] Almost done.
-[Sofia] Almost done.

14:08.541 --> 14:11.291
[Mark screams in pain, whimpers]

14:12.041 --> 14:14.208
Done. Elisa, call 118.

14:14.291 --> 14:15.375
[Mark whimpers]

14:16.041 --> 14:18.000
[Sofia] It's okay. It's okay.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.333
It's gonna be good. You're gonna be good.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.000
It doesn't work.

14:24.916 --> 14:27.208
-[phone beeps]
-[Sofia] There's no signal.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.958
-[Mark groans]
-[Sofia] Fabrizio.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.250
[Sofia] Fabrizio! Fuck! Call 118!

14:31.333 --> 14:34.000
-I tried. It's the same thing.
-[Riccardo] How can there be no signal?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.541
[Sofia] Do you wanna try?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.458
[Riccardo] Sure, I'll try. I'll try.

14:40.541 --> 14:41.458
[Riccardo] Nothing.

14:41.541 --> 14:42.541
[cicadas chirping]

14:42.625 --> 14:44.208
[Riccardo] Mine doesn't work either.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.416
[Mark grunts]

14:47.416 --> 14:51.041
[Riccardo] We need some help.
Try and stop someone on the road.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.458
There is no road.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.250
[Mark groaning]

14:58.333 --> 14:59.458
[latch clicks]

14:59.958 --> 15:04.125
[ominous music playing]

15:08.041 --> 15:11.333
[camper door creaks]

15:18.208 --> 15:20.625
-[Riccardo] Nobody saw anything?
-[Fabrizio] I passed out.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.625
[Sofia] So did I.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.458
-[Riccardo] Well, how did we get here?
-[Fabrizio] Ask Mark.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.583
[Sofia] What?
You think Mark took the camper out here?

15:27.666 --> 15:29.666
[Fabrizio] Maybe. Why don't you ask him?

15:32.125 --> 15:33.083
Guys.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
[ominous music playing]

15:54.750 --> 15:56.750
[ominous music continues playing]

16:03.041 --> 16:04.416
Is anyone at home?

16:04.500 --> 16:05.958
[Sofia knocking on door]

16:06.500 --> 16:08.000
[Sofia] We had a car accident.

16:09.666 --> 16:10.625
Hello?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.666
-[Sofia sighs]
-[Riccardo] No one is in. Let's go.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.375
[eerie sound playing]

16:19.333 --> 16:21.416
-Let's break in.
-[Fabrizio] What if the owner returns?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.750
We're not breaking in.
Let's go to the camper.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.250
[suspenseful music playing]

16:44.041 --> 16:46.708
[engine sputtering]

16:46.791 --> 16:49.416
[Mark] It was a goat.
It was something like that.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.666
It just appeared
in the middle of the road.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.416
I tried to steer away from it,

16:53.500 --> 16:56.375
but Fabrizio took the wheel from me,
so I couldn't--

16:56.458 --> 16:57.583
[Fabrizio] It's my fault now.

16:57.666 --> 17:01.208
Hey, man. If you hadn't taken the wheel,
we would've never driven off the road.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.250
He was falling asleep.
That's why he didn't see it.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.333
If I hadn't steered, we would've hit it.

17:05.416 --> 17:08.041
-[Mark] What did you say?
-That you were asleep at the wheel.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.875
What? Bullshit!

17:10.583 --> 17:13.000
Okay, maybe I was asleep
for, like, a split second,

17:13.083 --> 17:16.833
but we… we would've never hit the tree
if Chiara Ferragni didn't panic.

17:16.916 --> 17:19.000
-[Sofia] Okay, stop this.
-Ridiculous. He's a shithead.

17:19.083 --> 17:22.875
Mark, the tree we crashed into,
how far was it from the road?

17:22.958 --> 17:24.125
I don't know.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.041
Like, a few meters.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.625
There is no road in sight.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.583
We're in the middle of the woods.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.750
[Mark] That's impossible.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.666
[Ricardo scoffs] Impossible?

17:41.541 --> 17:42.875
Look at those trees.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.208
Thousands of trees,
and we passed straight through them.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.958
Or maybe we've just fallen from the sky
to this clearing.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.083
That's what I call impossible.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.166
-[Fabrizio] Where you going, Doctor?
-Looking for the road.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.416
-[Fabrizio] I'm coming with you.
-[Riccardo] No need.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.166
[Fabrizio] Don't go that way.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.083
-[Riccardo] It all looks the same.
-[Fabrizio] No, look at the sun.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.500
We have to go south.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.083
That is south.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.833
[Riccardo] Were you
a Boy Scout or something?

18:20.750 --> 18:23.208
[Fabrizio]
No, but I grew up in a place like this.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.125
[Riccardo] Okay, fine.
Go back to the others.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.333
MOM
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE

18:39.416 --> 18:41.458
I'M SCARED
WE NEED HELP

18:43.416 --> 18:44.500
[phone buzzing]

18:44.583 --> 18:46.250
[approaching footsteps]

18:47.875 --> 18:48.916
Are you okay?

18:49.791 --> 18:50.750
[Elisa] Mm.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.791
[chuckles] Look, he is such a dork.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.375
[dance music playing on phone]

19:08.750 --> 19:12.291
-[Elisa laughs]
-[Sofia laughs in video]

19:12.375 --> 19:13.833
[laughs]

19:16.333 --> 19:17.458
[Sofia sighs]

19:20.083 --> 19:21.500
Have you dated for a long time?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.958
Ever since I moved to America.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.250
Well, he's not American either.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.375
He had just arrived from Bristol.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.625
Where are you from?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.250
Odessa.

19:32.958 --> 19:36.416
But I lived here and there. Also in Italy.

19:37.041 --> 19:40.166
So I'm like a hummingbird.
Is that what it's called? Colibrì?

19:40.958 --> 19:42.083
[Sofia chuckles]

19:43.291 --> 19:44.625
So what do you do?

19:46.833 --> 19:50.375
I'm an intern at a consulting firm.
A Bocconi graduate.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.583
Wow!

19:51.666 --> 19:52.875
And you say it like that?

19:53.625 --> 19:55.875
I'm pretty much
stuck at a computer all day.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.750
I have a company.
We make 3D-printed jewelry.

20:01.458 --> 20:02.916
[Elisa] Your own company?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.541
-Mm-hmm.
-You're so young though.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.541
[laughs] It's only a start-up.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.000
[Sofia] Look.

20:09.958 --> 20:10.833
Pretty.

20:10.916 --> 20:11.916
[Sofia laughs]

20:20.250 --> 20:21.875
Do you think it's his fault?

20:26.625 --> 20:27.625
No.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.000
He'll be fine. You'll see.

20:30.083 --> 20:33.000
[ominous music playing]

20:40.958 --> 20:42.750
[Fabrizio] Doctor, you have a daughter?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.083
Sorry, I overheard your call before.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.041
What's her name?

20:50.541 --> 20:51.416
[Riccardo] Alma.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.000
Noble. Alma.

20:55.541 --> 20:57.250
It's nice. What does it mean?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.291
It means you should mind
your own fucking business.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.333
Focus.
We should've found the road already.

21:04.916 --> 21:08.375
[Fabrizio] One time,
I saw this American movie, right,

21:08.916 --> 21:11.666
about these people
who end up in a sort of Limbo,

21:11.750 --> 21:13.500
and they are not aware of it.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.666
So they are, like, in a trap, you know?

21:16.750 --> 21:19.125
And they are doomed
to repeat the same things.

21:20.125 --> 21:23.791
For example, they wake up,
and it's always the same day.

21:23.875 --> 21:27.250
Or they go downstairs,
and it's always the same floor, you know?

21:27.333 --> 21:29.583
[tense music playing]

21:40.541 --> 21:41.583
[Elisa] Sofia.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.083
[tense music continues]

22:02.625 --> 22:04.000
[Riccardo] What the fuck?

22:08.208 --> 22:10.208
[tense music continues]

22:10.291 --> 22:12.291
[flies buzzing]

22:26.791 --> 22:28.791
[suspenseful music playing]

22:35.250 --> 22:36.541
Is anyone there?

22:59.375 --> 23:00.375
What is that?

23:01.541 --> 23:02.833
Something satanic?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.583
[flies buzzing]

23:07.208 --> 23:10.500
THE THREE KNIGHTS OF HONOR

23:10.583 --> 23:11.583
More or less.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.791
What do you mean by that?

23:15.625 --> 23:17.583
It means we need to leave now.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.041
Look at the heads. The blood's fresh.

23:23.208 --> 23:26.000
[eerie rhythmic music playing]

23:39.916 --> 23:41.458
[music fades]

24:03.083 --> 24:06.875
[suspenseful music rising]

24:06.958 --> 24:08.041
[door slams]

24:18.708 --> 24:21.458
[door hinges creaking]

24:52.333 --> 24:54.041
[Fabrizio] The first has no eyes.

24:54.666 --> 24:56.750
But even in the dark, he'll find you.

24:58.166 --> 25:01.750
The second has no ears,
but he will surely hear you.

25:02.875 --> 25:06.875
The third has no mouth to speak,
but if you see him, don't say a word.

25:07.416 --> 25:11.875
[Fabrizio] A winged horse by his side
is the song of death.

25:15.041 --> 25:18.208
It's the legend of Osso,
Mastrosso, and Carcagnosso.

25:19.166 --> 25:22.083
My grandma always told me their story
when I was little.

25:26.708 --> 25:29.208
They are three brothers
who came from another world.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.958
A long, long time ago…

25:37.375 --> 25:39.208
people were dying of starvation.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.250
They promised to save them,

25:41.333 --> 25:44.500
but with the condition
that they receive a sacrifice in return.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.708
So the villagers chose the victim,

25:50.625 --> 25:52.583
and they prepared the ritual.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.416
To start, they cut out her tongue…

26:00.333 --> 26:01.416
then ears…

26:03.541 --> 26:04.791
and eyes.

26:07.291 --> 26:09.833
With her blood,
they rid the village of hunger.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.500
But everything comes at a price.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.250
So, since then, the starving people

26:19.333 --> 26:20.416
became…

26:23.833 --> 26:25.333
like a flock.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.333
Their flock.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.750
[ominous music playing]

26:36.416 --> 26:38.666
[Sofia] Your grandmother
told you some weird stories.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.416
[Riccardo] Okay.
Enough with this bullshit.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.833
The heads in the forest.
Are you sure there were five?

26:43.916 --> 26:45.041
Five.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.166
Someone's trying to freak us out.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.041
Let's sleep in the camper,
and we'll leave tomorrow.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.291
And Mark?

26:56.083 --> 26:57.791
We can't move him in his condition.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.583
Let's find help,
and we'll come back for him.

26:59.666 --> 27:00.666
[Sofia] Of course.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.083
[Elisa] Sofia.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.916
[chilling music playing]

27:26.375 --> 27:28.208
[chilling music fades]

27:32.750 --> 27:33.750
[radio static]

27:33.833 --> 27:35.541
Nothing. Nada.

27:36.875 --> 27:38.250
[Sofia] How's my baby?

27:39.083 --> 27:41.041
[Mark] I put you all in deep shit.

27:43.791 --> 27:47.208
[Sofia] Rest now.
Tomorrow will be a big day.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.333
Fifì.

27:50.708 --> 27:53.041
What are you doing with a loser like me?

27:53.125 --> 27:57.625
[Fabrizio laughing]

28:00.250 --> 28:01.625
[Riccardo] What's so funny?

28:01.708 --> 28:02.875
Nothing.

28:03.541 --> 28:04.791
Nothing at all.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.041
We crash into a tree
a few feet from the road,

28:09.875 --> 28:12.916
and we wake up
in front of the house of Sam Raimi.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.041
There are severed animal heads,

28:16.833 --> 28:18.958
pictures of crazy farmers…

28:21.250 --> 28:22.875
We are isolated.

28:23.541 --> 28:25.250
The phones don't work.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.500
Why hasn't anyone said it yet?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.083
This is the setup
for a classic horror movie.

28:33.166 --> 28:34.500
Go to sleep, man.

28:41.666 --> 28:44.250
-[Riccardo] Where you going?
-[Fabrizio] Gotta drain the lizard.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.583
That guy desperately needs a girlfriend.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.875
MOM

29:36.666 --> 29:37.750
[Riccardo in video] Ta-da!

29:38.708 --> 29:39.625
[Riccardo blows kisses]

29:41.083 --> 29:42.916
[girl in video giggling]

29:43.000 --> 29:46.208
What about this? Show it to Mom.
Show Mom how nice it is.

29:48.583 --> 29:50.166
A kiss? [kisses]

29:51.458 --> 29:52.333
[distant scream]

29:52.416 --> 29:55.250
You're so beautiful! Give me a kiss.
Give Daddy a kiss.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.375
Mom, look. She's giving Daddy a kiss.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.583
[kisses]

30:12.333 --> 30:13.166
What is it?

30:14.666 --> 30:16.333
[distant scream]

30:17.875 --> 30:19.500
Wait, where you going?

30:19.583 --> 30:20.708
Stay with Mark.

[squeaking]

30:57.375 --> 30:58.416
Stay here.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.458
Be careful.

31:10.791 --> 31:11.750
-[loud thump]
-[exclaims]

31:11.833 --> 31:14.708
Come out. Someone's in the woods.
We need to get outta here.

31:14.791 --> 31:15.875
What the fuck?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.500
-[Riccardo] What happened? Hey.
-[Fabrizio] Come.

31:27.916 --> 31:30.541
-[whispers] Fabri, what's going on?
-Quick! Go up!

31:31.458 --> 31:33.666

31:56.750 --> 31:58.375
[Elisa] They cut out her tongue.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.208
[Sofia] Shh.

32:10.708 --> 32:13.291
Hey, I don't think
you should get any closer to her.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.500
Yeah, he's right. Let's go.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.333
Are you guys gonna help?

32:18.875 --> 32:21.541
-[Riccardo] No. We need to leave.
-There's a little girl. Shh.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.750
-[Fabrizio] It's an awful idea.
-[Riccardo] Leave her!

32:23.833 --> 32:27.500
[Riccardo] Sofia!
Sofia, fuck, leave her alone! Move away!

32:28.875 --> 32:31.166

40:54.750 --> 40:57.458
-[Sofia] What are you doing?
-[Riccardo] I might find something to eat.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.416
Or something like this.

41:01.916 --> 41:05.333
What are you doing there?
Why the fuck are you just standing there?

41:07.625 --> 41:09.000
I'm with a bunch of idiots.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.541
Two little girls. A loser.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.208
[Sofia] You're a hopeless case.

41:13.708 --> 41:17.041
[Riccardo] What did you say?
What did you say?

41:17.958 --> 41:19.125
A hopeless case?

41:19.208 --> 41:21.333
Of course you're saying it.
We have to believe it.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.708
-'Cause, of course, you're the expert.
-Just say it.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.750
Get it out.

41:25.833 --> 41:28.208
Sure, I'll say it. I'll say it.
I have no problem saying it.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.666
-If we're stuck, it's because of Mark.
-How can you say that?

41:30.750 --> 41:32.750
-Have some respect, Doctor.
-[Riccardo] Respect?

41:33.458 --> 41:35.833
Respect for what now?
Because he's dead now?

41:36.500 --> 41:38.333
What the fuck you think
we'll all be tonight?

41:38.416 --> 41:40.333
He's dead because
you left him there to die.

41:40.416 --> 41:42.791
You abandoned him
and prevented me from helping him.

41:42.875 --> 41:46.083
Who the fuck do you think we are, huh?
The fucking Ninja Turtles? Come on!

41:46.166 --> 41:47.708
[sobbing] They were just farmers.

41:48.541 --> 41:49.666
Sick people.

41:49.750 --> 41:52.500
I refuse to die because an idiot
drove drunk and got us into this mess!

41:52.583 --> 41:56.541
-[shouts] Have I made that clear enough?
-[Elisa] Stop it! It was an accident.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.625
I'm a doctor.

42:02.375 --> 42:03.791
I cure sick people.

42:03.875 --> 42:05.500
I don't rescue them.

42:06.875 --> 42:07.916
Yeah, right.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.208
Can I ask you something, Riccardo?

42:12.458 --> 42:14.500
What doctor uses carpooling?

42:15.916 --> 42:19.583
[Sofia] As far as I know, doctors travel
by plane, train, car rental.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.333
Exactly what kind of doctor are you?

42:25.125 --> 42:27.666
And what the fuck has that got to do
with any of this shit?

42:27.750 --> 42:29.666
-[Fabrizio] Let's stop fighting.
-[both] Shut up!

42:31.958 --> 42:34.541
-[Fabrizio sighs]
-You didn't exactly do much to save him.

42:36.416 --> 42:37.875
Why didn't you bite my hand?

42:38.875 --> 42:39.875
Huh?

42:41.750 --> 42:43.666
Why didn't you kick me in the balls?

42:45.250 --> 42:46.166
Huh.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.166
You just didn't fight hard enough
to save the love of your life.

42:54.666 --> 42:56.666
You could've fought harder than you did.

43:30.208 --> 43:31.500
Can I see that?

43:36.250 --> 43:37.458
[Elisa] Is this yours?

43:41.208 --> 43:42.416
[Elisa] Chiara.

43:44.833 --> 43:45.916
What a pretty name.

44:14.791 --> 44:16.666
Do you know a way out of this forest?

44:35.875 --> 44:38.875
THIS IS NOT A FOREST

46:12.000 --> 46:13.333
[Riccardo] Where's the camper?

46:14.833 --> 46:16.375
[Riccardo] They took the fucking camper!

46:16.958 --> 46:20.541
I was certain we were walking
in the right direction. Walking south.

46:21.166 --> 46:24.458
-I don't understand how we're here.
-Yeah? You're certain?

46:25.166 --> 46:26.166
You're certain?

46:26.250 --> 46:28.666
So how the fuck is it possible
that we walked in a circle?

46:28.750 --> 46:30.166
-[Fabrizio] I don't know!
-You don't?

46:30.250 --> 46:32.000
-We were walking south!
-You don't know?

46:32.083 --> 46:34.833
I want to save myself as much as you do.
I don't understand why.

46:34.916 --> 46:36.708
[sobbing] We were walking south.

46:40.083 --> 46:44.291
[Riccardo] Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

46:45.208 --> 46:46.875
[Riccardo, Fabrizio sobbing]

46:49.083 --> 46:50.250
Look, it's okay.

46:51.041 --> 46:53.083
Maybe I'm in a… a coma.

46:55.208 --> 46:56.875
Maybe this is a nightmare.

46:58.958 --> 47:00.833
And you don't exist. [sighs]

47:02.291 --> 47:05.541
Doctor, believe me.
Right now, I'd rather not exist.

47:11.583 --> 47:15.250
[hopeless music playing]

47:18.833 --> 47:20.833
Well, at least they forgot this one.

47:28.625 --> 47:30.750
[Fabrizio] Yesterday,
they came after dark.

47:35.166 --> 47:38.625
I don't really want to go back inside,
but out here is worse.

47:39.916 --> 47:41.000
He's right.

47:42.291 --> 47:43.708
And if they return?

47:45.458 --> 47:49.375
If they come back, we'll burn it down.
These woods and that fucking house.

48:38.708 --> 48:40.458
No, thanks. I gotta be on watch.

48:43.625 --> 48:44.750
[gulps]

48:44.833 --> 48:45.916
[sighs]

48:54.125 --> 48:55.708
Disciplinary probation.

48:57.833 --> 48:58.750
[Riccardo] I made…

48:59.750 --> 49:00.875
a mistake…

49:03.416 --> 49:04.625
and my patient died.

49:07.041 --> 49:08.541
My job was my whole life.

49:10.083 --> 49:11.333
I lost all of it.

49:13.541 --> 49:16.166
[Riccardo] Then, things got even worse.

49:16.250 --> 49:17.750
I went home to my wife.

49:17.833 --> 49:20.375
I said something wrong
at the wrong time, and I--

49:22.666 --> 49:25.083
Now she doesn't even allow me
to see my daughter.

49:26.583 --> 49:27.666
Rightly so.

49:30.791 --> 49:32.625
I was going to live with my mother.

49:33.333 --> 49:35.541
She still treats me like a teen.
She said, "Come home."

49:37.250 --> 49:38.333
"Just come home."

49:47.291 --> 49:49.083
That's the kind of doctor I am.

49:54.666 --> 49:57.625
[inhales, exhales]

50:03.375 --> 50:05.541
[Fabrizio] Once, I was camping,

50:05.625 --> 50:08.458
and there was this guy
from a region up north

50:09.125 --> 50:11.708
who says, "You are a Southerner.
You are in the Mafia."

50:13.250 --> 50:14.375
So I told him,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.833
"No, look.
Not all Southerners are gangsters."

50:18.833 --> 50:20.291
But he was insistent.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.375
He said, "No, no. You are a Southerner.
You are in the Mafia."

50:27.916 --> 50:29.291
I tried to reason with him

50:29.375 --> 50:33.041
by telling him that there are Southerners
who don't actually eat pizza

50:33.125 --> 50:35.708
and some Southerners
who are not in the Mafia.

50:37.416 --> 50:39.666
The day after, he's back telling me,

50:39.750 --> 50:42.458
"No, you are a Southerner.
You are in the Mafia."

50:43.958 --> 50:45.666
So, I went and had him killed.

50:45.750 --> 50:46.875
[chuckles]

50:47.791 --> 50:48.875
[chuckles]

[all laughing]

51:11.125 --> 51:13.125
[ominous music playing]

51:16.833 --> 51:19.750
[Elisa] One day, I told my parents
I wanted to quit uni.

51:20.375 --> 51:22.083
I wanted to do something else.

51:23.708 --> 51:27.041
Mom put me in the car
and drove me to a seaside resort.

51:27.750 --> 51:30.250
We stayed at a gorgeous mansion
with a pool.

51:32.000 --> 51:32.958
She said,

51:34.125 --> 51:35.208
"Look at it."

51:36.791 --> 51:39.333
She insisted, "Look at it better."

51:42.250 --> 51:45.833
"This would've been ours
if we hadn't paid for your school costs."

51:47.083 --> 51:49.250
Two days later, I was back in class.

51:54.541 --> 51:56.000
I do it for Mark.

52:01.333 --> 52:03.125
You do it for your baby.

52:05.208 --> 52:06.291
So you knew?

52:06.958 --> 52:08.708
[Sofia] Sweetie, we all figured it out.

52:10.833 --> 52:13.958
He was doomed anyway,
even before ending up here.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.500

-Yes.

1:17:32.583 --> 1:17:36.666
So, basically, we can insert that shot
where everyone's in their masks.

1:17:36.750 --> 1:17:39.916
Yeah? And we stay a little longer
on the sacrifice of those two assholes.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.375
Okay? Then cut.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.541
And there she is, laying in the house.

1:17:44.625 --> 1:17:48.291
And I hold her tight in my arms,
and I say my beautiful line,

1:17:48.375 --> 1:17:49.583

If you hit her one more time, she'll die.

-[Fabrizio] With the beer.
-[Chiara] It doesn't work.

1:18:05.416 --> 1:18:08.541
[Fabrizio] You too. I mean,
all you can say is, "It doesn't work!"

1:18:08.625 --> 1:18:11.875
Listen. Mom was clear about that.
The client wants her to be aware.

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:15.541
[Fabrizio] Fuck Mom too! Fuck Mom too!

1:18:15.625 --> 1:18:18.041
-Lower your voice.
-No! The fuck I lower my voice!

1:18:18.125 --> 1:18:19.875
-I'm not lowering my voice!
-Lower your voice!

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:22.250
[Fabrizio] Look at the fucking mess
I had to go through

1:18:22.333 --> 1:18:26.333

1:18:26.416 --> 1:18:28.416
[Chiara] You made this mess.
You caused the accident.

1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:30.250
-And Elisa!
-[Chiara] I don't give a damn!

1:18:30.333 --> 1:18:32.750
The only thing she figured out
was the beer!

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:34.583
Do you think I care? Did I complain?

1:18:34.666 --> 1:18:37.458

-You're completely incompetent!
-…I cut your tongue out!

I'm going to tell Mom,

1:18:41.083 --> 1:18:44.666

because you can't do anything.

-Next time, I want to be the villain.
-Mom doesn't know shit about horror.

1:19:32.125 --> 1:19:33.291
Listen, she's the boss.

1:19:33.375 --> 1:19:36.333
If she wants her to be aware
when she dies, she'll be aware.

1:19:36.416 --> 1:19:38.791
She doesn't understand
that this thing doesn't make any sense.

1:19:38.875 --> 1:19:40.708
