<i>‎In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.980
<i>‎Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.860
<i>‎But there's something about me</i>
<i>‎that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.300
<i>‎Because I have a secret.</i>

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.740
‎♪<i>‎ Miraculous! Simply the best! </i>‎♪

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.900
<i>‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.500
<i>‎The Louvre will be unveiling</i>
<i>‎its latest acquisition today,</i>

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.980
<i>‎a mysterious statue</i>
<i>‎carved from hardened lava,</i>

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.540
<i>‎recently discovered</i>

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.100
<i>‎on the highest mountaintops of Tibet</i>
<i>‎by the museum's curator,</i>

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.460
<i>‎Mr Kubdel.</i>

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.340
‎Adrien...

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.620
‎Marinette, I asked Alix to get us in,
‎so I could show you

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.180
‎what I figured out about superheroes,
‎not so you could gawk at Adrien!

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.820
‎You can do that any day at school, girl!

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.780
‎Super-Adriens... uh,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.620
‎heroes! I'm all ears!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.740
‎Cool. So, first,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.900
‎you need to know
‎that Ladybug and Cat Noir

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.780
‎get their powers
‎from magic jewels called Miraculous.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.580
‎You told me
‎you'd stop researching Ladybug

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.220
‎not to jeopardise her identity!

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.420
‎Oh, I know! Except this research
‎has nothing to do with her identity!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.540
‎I'm gonna help Ladybug unmask Hawk Moth.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.100
‎And I think I found a connection

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.340
‎between superheroes,
‎Hawk Moth and the Miraculous.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.980
‎OK, I'm convinced Ladybug,
‎Cat Noir and others

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
‎have been depicted through the centuries.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.660
‎Until, for some reason, they disappeared
‎and the world forget about them.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.300
‎We already know this one.
‎The Ladybug from ancient Egypt!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.620
‎Here! A black knight

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.340
‎or Black Cat Miraculous holder?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.100
‎-Come on!
‎-Hmm.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.500
‎And here!
‎A lady or a Butterfly superhero?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.220
‎Now this.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.660
‎Hercules or Lion Miraculous holder?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.460
‎OK, so now there's a Lion Miraculous?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.820
‎Why not a Bunny Miraculous
‎while you're at it?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.580
‎ You know sculptures
‎were once painted, right?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.180
‎Most of the paint vanished over time,
‎but tiny pigments still remain.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.860
‎Thanks to this special app,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260
‎witness how it originally looked!

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.340
‎But here's the big thing.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420
‎All these works of art
‎have something in common.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.620
‎It's the same symbol!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.580
‎Look! It's everywhere!

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.180
‎Oooh!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.140
‎It's like a secret-society emblem,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.300
‎as if a kind of "order of guardians"

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.860
‎have been watching over the superheroes
‎since the beginning of time.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.220
‎Looks like the symbol
‎on the Tibetan statue my old man found.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.740
‎-Nathalie, are you OK?
‎-It's nothing, Adrien.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.220
‎Just a dizzy spell.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.620
‎Maybe we should head home now.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.380
‎According to my old man,
‎the statue is almost 200 years old!

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.620
‎I found there hasn't been
‎any Miraculous-wearing superheroes

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.140
‎for the last 200 years!

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.860
‎So, this statue would be

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.940
‎the last-known trace of a Miraculous?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.380
‎Until Ladybug and Cat Noir showed up
‎a few months ago, yeah!

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.540
‎That's rad!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.220
‎I'm sure my video will help Ladybug

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.820
‎-unmask Hawk Moth!
‎-Wait!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.380
‎You'll publish your theories
‎on the Ladyblog?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.900
‎Actually, I already uploaded the video!

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.460
<i>‎The Mystery of the Miraculous!</i>
‎It's beyond awesome!

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.020
‎For sure it is, right?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.820
‎Amazing! I'm sure Ladybug
‎will be super excited about it.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.500
‎And so will Hawk Moth.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.940
‎Uh... uh... I gotta go!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.380
‎I forgot I had, um, homework!
‎Catch you later!

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.740
<i>‎It's some kind of secret-society emblem,</i>

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.820
<i>‎as if an "order of guardians"</i>
<i>‎has been watching over the superheroes</i>

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.540
<i>‎since the beginning of time.</i>

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.140
‎It's my fault. I'm sorry.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.420
‎I shouldn't have
‎trusted her with a Miraculous!

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.060
‎Alya is an excellent journalist.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.500
‎She was bound to unveil this secret

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.100
‎kept under wraps for centuries.
‎But don't worry.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.940
‎It can't lead Hawk Moth to us!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.820
<i>‎And that same symbol is on this statue</i>

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.700
<i>‎that arrived at the Louvre</i>
<i>‎earlier this week!</i>

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.980
‎Impossible!

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.620
‎That's impossible!

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.460
‎We're doomed!

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.420
‎Because of a statue?
‎But a second ago, you were saying--

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.900
‎That's not a statue, Marinette!

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.540
‎It's a Sentimonster!

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.820
‎A magical creature
‎conjured from an emotion

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.700
‎shaped by the power of the Peacock!

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.460
‎But we've already defeated Sentimonsters
‎created by Mayura.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.140
‎Yes, but... none of them
‎came close to the power of this one.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.140
‎Huh?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.740
‎It was born from the negative
‎emotion of a young man

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.860
‎who had no idea what he was creating.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.100
‎Remember when I told you
‎I made a terrible mistake?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.620
‎For you to understand,
‎I must tell you the entire story.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.060
‎ <i>‎I was younger than you</i>
<i>‎when I was chosen to be a Guardian.</i>

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.420
<i>‎My parents told me that it was a great</i>
<i>‎honour, that I couldn't turn it down.</i>

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.660
<i>‎So they took me to the temple.</i>

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.500
<i>‎I wasn't very happy there.</i>

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.340
<i>‎I'd have preferred to live with my parents</i>
<i>‎and be with other children my age.</i>

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.660
<i>‎I didn't want to be</i>
<i>‎a guardian of anything.</i>

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.460
<i>‎One of the tests to become a Guardian</i>
<i>‎required me to watch over a Miracle Box</i>

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.660
<i>‎for a full 24 hours, without any food.</i>

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.460
<i>‎All I had for support</i>
<i>‎was my apprentice's staff.</i>

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.660
<i>‎Soon I was hungry.</i>
<i>‎With each passing hour, I became hungrier!</i>

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.700
<i>‎And it was all because of the Miraculous,</i>

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.620
<i>‎because I had to watch over them!</i>

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.820
‎I couldn't take it any longer.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.220
<i>‎So, I took the Peacock Miraculous</i>

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.100
<i>‎and used its power.</i>

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.380
<i>‎All I wanted was a nice little companion</i>
<i>‎I could send to the kitchen</i>

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.300
<i>‎to fetch me some rice balls.</i>

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.380
<i>‎But a Miraculous must never be used</i>

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.300
‎for the wrong reasons.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.300
‎The anger I was feeling
‎mingled with my intense hunger,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.980
‎and I created a Sentimonster

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.660
<i>‎that was very different</i>
<i>‎from the one I had envisioned!</i>

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.780
<i>‎A ravenous Sentimonster</i>
<i>‎out to devour everything,</i>

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.140
<i>‎but specifically the Miraculous,</i>

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.580
<i>‎since they were the bane of my life</i>
<i>‎at that very moment!</i>

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.380
<i>‎In my panic, I lost my staff,</i>

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.060
<i>‎the very object</i>
<i>‎that would have enabled me to control it.</i>

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.620
<i>‎I was just a young boy. I was so afraid</i>
<i>‎I didn't even think of destroying it.</i>

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.940
<i>‎By simply using the Peacock Miraculous,</i>

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.140
<i>‎I tried to erase all traces</i>
<i>‎of the foolish thing that I had done.</i>

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.620
<i>‎A monk told me to run away</i>
<i>‎with the grimoire he'd managed to save</i>

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.980
<i>‎and the Miraculous Box.</i>
<i>‎The very last Miraculous Box.</i>

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.220
<i>‎That's when I realised my Sentimonster</i>
<i>‎had devoured</i>

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300
<i>‎all the other Miraculous Boxes</i>
<i>‎that were kept in the temple.</i>

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.940
<i>‎And when the monks tried to stop it...</i>

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.860
<i>‎the temple,</i>

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.980
<i>‎the Order of the Guardians,</i>

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.860
<i>‎everything, it was destroyed.</i>

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.260
<i>‎I tried to run away</i>
<i>‎from the Sentimonster.</i>

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.420
<i>‎But by doing so,</i>

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.700
<i>‎I lost the grimoire</i>

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.380
<i>‎and both the Butterfly</i>
<i>‎and the Peacock Miraculous.</i>

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.140
<i>‎I thought the Sentimonster</i>
<i>‎had disappeared forever.</i>

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.700
‎As soon as Hawk Moth finds out about it,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.380
‎he'll be able to use the power
‎of the Peacock to bring it back to life.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.660
‎Master, if that happens,
‎Cat Noir and I will be there.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.260
‎But you won't stand a chance!

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.020
‎He's totally immune
‎to the powers of the Miraculous!

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.220
‎And please stop calling me Master.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.180
‎I have never been a Guardian
‎to begin with.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.340
‎I will not make another mistake.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.940
‎You and Cat Noir
‎will give me your Miraculous back

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.980
‎and I'll leave Paris with the Box,
‎since that's what the monster is after.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.860
‎It will come after me,
‎sparing the city and its inhabitants.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.940
‎But what if it catches up with you?

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.020
‎That will be my fate.
‎It's all my fault, after all.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.660
‎I won't let you leave alone!

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.900
‎When you chose me to become Ladybug,
‎you placed your trust in me.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.740
‎I'm asking you to do the same today.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.300
‎Thank you, Marinette.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.300
‎Thank you for everything.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.580
‎Nathalie gets dizzy spells,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.820
‎but it's nothing serious.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.220
‎It's thoughtful of you to be concerned.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.700
‎You don't have to worry about her.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.260
‎If you say so, Father.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.580
‎<i>‎ And that same symbol</i>

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.140
<i>‎is on this statue</i>
<i>‎that arrived at the Louvre this week!</i>

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.700
‎I felt an Amok within.
‎This isn't a statue.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.300
‎It's a dormant Sentimonster,
‎very old and very powerful.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.020
‎Which means you can destroy it
‎or bring it back to life.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.220
‎But I wasn't the one who created it,
‎so can't control it.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.460
‎I'll help you.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.100
‎It comes from the region
‎where were found our Miraculous.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.180
‎I've a strong feeling
‎it could prove very useful to my quest.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.820
‎You will return to the Louvre tonight.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.540
‎Very well.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.020
‎You should get some rest before you go.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.620
‎Don't worry. I'll be fine.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.740
‎Hey! Why the long face?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.660
‎My mom used to have dizzy spells,
‎just like Nathalie.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.820
‎My father said
‎those weren't serious either.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.220
‎How about a duet?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.260
‎You play the piano?

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.300
‎My talents go way beyond
‎sniffing out cheese, young man!

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.420
‎Mom's the only one
‎who could make me laugh like that!

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.420
‎Thank you, Plagg.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.780
‎I can feel its yearning,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.740
‎Hawk Moth.
‎It's hungry! Ravenous for Miraculous!

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.820
‎Yum yum, Miraculous!

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.300
‎You take one more step
‎and I'll take your Amok away from you.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.420
‎Do you really want me to destroy you?

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.700
‎The Sentimonster is all yours,
‎Hawk Moth.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.380
‎Ah,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.180
‎the frustration of a Miraculous
‎just out of your grasp!

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.740
‎I know that feeling of hunger
‎only too well.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.380
‎Fly away,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.300
‎my little akuma,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.940
‎and evilise this Sentimonster!

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.620
‎Feast, I am Hawk Moth.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.980
‎You have a consuming hunger
‎that only the Miraculous can satisfy.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.860
‎I'm giving you the power to track them
‎down and devour every single one!

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.860
‎But after
‎you've swallowed up their owners,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.660
‎you must bring two Miraculous
‎back to me,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.340
‎the one of Ladybug and the Black Cat.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.940
‎Oh, but don't you worry,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.780
‎I'll give them back to you
‎as soon as I'm done with them.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.820
‎I'll even give you the Peacock's
‎and mine as a bonus.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.620
‎And thus you shall have eaten
‎every single Miraculous

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.500
‎and your hunger shall be satiated.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.140
‎Do we have an agreement?

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.500
‎All right. It's dinner time, Feast!

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.060
‎Yummy! Miraculous!

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.340
‎Huh?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.860
‎I'm sorry.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.900
‎Aaah!

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.100
‎Wayzz?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.180
‎"Marinette,
‎you're a most incredible Ladybug,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.780
‎but I cannot let you and Cat Noir risk
‎your lives to fix a mistake that I made.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.980
‎I hope you can forgive me.
‎Be happy and forget all about me.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.820
‎Signed, Fu."

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.460
‎No way! Tikki!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.540
‎No!

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.260
‎Master!

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.340
‎ Wait!

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.940
‎No! Master, wait!

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.340
‎-Master, is this the best solution?
‎-It's the only solution!

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.820
‎Master!

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.620
‎Yum yum,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.900
‎Miraculous!

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.780
‎See, Wayzz?
‎If Marinette had kept her Miraculous,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.820
‎it would have swallowed her up!

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.260
‎Or she would have transformed
‎into Ladybug and fought it.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.980
‎Sometimes fighting is futile, Wayzz!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.380
‎Feast is attracted
‎by the Miraculous' scent.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.180
‎The man it's chasing can only be
‎the Guardian of the Miraculous!

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.700
‎Soon, he'll have nothing left to guard.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.940
‎Feast is going to devour everything!

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.020
‎And we shall relish the taste
‎of triumph, my dear Mayura!

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.620
‎Hi there, Bugaboo!

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.140
‎Cat Noir? Is that you?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.300
‎Who else would you expect by your side?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.500
‎Isn't that costume a little unsafe?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.420
‎Only on the outside! I've got a helmet
‎on under my banana peel, Bugaboo!

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.260
‎If you call me "Bugaboo" one more time,
‎I'll start calling you "Bananoir!"

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.460
‎As you wish, Bugaboo!

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.220
‎Let's take a shortcut!

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.700
‎There! The bus!

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.300
‎Hey, driver!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.580
‎I'm Ladybug and I need you to help me!

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.700
‎Ladybug? Right! And your buddy here's
‎the famous "Bananacat," I presume?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.140
‎Call me Bananoir!

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.100
‎Doesn't matter who we are!

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.420
‎That man is being chased by a monster
‎and we have to help him!

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.060
‎OK, you can count on me!

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.580
‎Thank you, super-driver!

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.540
‎Now!

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.020
‎Master, look! Ladybug and Cat Noir!
‎They haven't let you down!

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.660
‎Impossible!
‎They don't have their Miraculous!

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.860
‎OK! I'll help you, but ride on the side
‎of the road before you get hurt.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.620
<i>‎In the name of the law, I...</i>

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.500
<i>‎Oh, destruction of public property!</i>

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.820
‎♪ <i>‎My name's André, I make the ice cream!</i>
<i>‎I'm friends with... </i><i>‎♪</i>

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.140
‎Look! It must be them.
‎Who else would do something so crazy?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.060
‎Hey! Have a taste of this!
‎Some exploding Banana Split from Bananoir!

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.380
‎Much tastier than any Miraculous.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.700
‎Just look! There's no use in running.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.100
‎Your disciples never give up the fight
‎no matter what!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.340
‎With or without a Miraculous,
‎they are Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.700
‎I don't want to cause their disappearance!

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.780
‎Whether you like it or not,
‎you're the Guardian!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.860
‎Precisely. This is my decision to make!

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.940
‎ André!
‎We're outta ammo!

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.140
‎ André! Go somewhere safe!
‎We're going to handle this...

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.540
‎-I hope.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.260
‎Hey! Leave them alone!

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.060
‎I'm the one you've been wanting
‎the past 172 years!

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.700
‎The Guardian of the Miraculous
‎is this decrepit old man?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.220
‎Looking for this?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.220
‎Yum yum, Miraculous!

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.380
‎You won't have any trouble
‎getting rid of him, Feast!

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.060
‎Go and transform, quickly!

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.940
‎I'm the last of the Miraculous Guardians!

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.060
‎And I intend to accomplish my mission!

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.380
‎I'm not scared of you anymore!

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.060
‎Thank you, Ladybug.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.220
‎I knew you'd make the right choice!

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.340
‎Come on Wayzz, shell--

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.620
‎-Aaah!
‎-Master, your back!

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.740
‎You're too old to play superheroes!

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.380
‎We can handle this.
‎Take the Miraculous Box and go hide!

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.140
‎Enjoy, Feast!
‎They can't get away from you now!

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.100
‎We have to find its Amok!

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.260
‎Except this Sentimonster
‎isn't carrying any baggage!

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.060
‎Cover me!

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.540
‎Lucky Charm!

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.500
‎A metal detector?

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.340
‎When you created it,
‎you put the Amok in your staff, right?

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.420
‎Correct!

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.340
‎Was it made out of metal, by any chance?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.740
‎Partially, yes!

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.140
‎There are only two places your staff
‎could be. Where the temple was, or...

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.340
‎Hey!

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.540
‎Hurry, milady! This thing already
‎swallowed my stick whole! Aaah!

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.340
‎Go hide, Master!

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.620
‎-You sure it's the right time, milady?
‎-Ready to get the staff back?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.580
‎-Oh, no, not the tongue!

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.020
‎Yes! Great work, Feast!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.620
‎Keep those two Miraculous
‎nice and warm for me!

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.780
‎And enjoy the other ones.
‎You've certainly earned them!

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.980
‎Yum yum! Miraculous!

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.140
‎Wow! It's bigger on the inside!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.380
‎My stick!

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.820
‎What is that?

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.700
‎Is it digesting things or something?

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.260
‎Whatever he swallows
‎gets sealed here forever.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.020
‎We'd better hurry up and find out
‎where the Master's staff is hiding!

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.980
‎Farewell, my dear Wayzz!

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.180
‎You're the best kwami I could've ever
‎hoped to have by my side all these years!

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.100
‎It's been an honour to be your kwami.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.020
‎I knew it!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.460
‎It had to be intact, otherwise
‎the Sentimonster would have disappeared!

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.060
‎Be careful what you wish for!

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.380
‎Cataclysm!

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.420
‎ Ah!

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.900
‎No more evildoing for you!

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.860
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.860
‎Gotcha!

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.340
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.060
‎No! That's impossible!

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.860
‎I'm fine.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.620
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.060
‎ Pound it!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.740
‎Thank you, Ladybug.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.180
‎Because of you,
‎I won't have to run any more.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.740
‎I only put your teaching
‎to practice, Master.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.140
‎I know two people who'd better run
‎before they transform back.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.580
‎Goodbye, Master.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.700
<i>‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>
<i>‎"Extraordinary" and "inexplicable".</i>

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.500
<i>‎That sums up the surprising reappearance</i>
<i>‎of this temple in Tibet,</i>

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.420
<i>‎172 years after it was destroyed!</i>

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.340
<i>‎Let's go to Clara Contard, on location.</i>

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.420
‎That's correct. But what makes this
‎phenomenon particularly unexplainable

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.140
‎is that all the monks who used to live--

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.140
‎Wow! The symbol of the Guardians!

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.580
‎I've gotta add this to the Ladyblog.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.460
‎So, my mistake has been undone.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.460
‎The monks have been freed
‎and the temple has been restored.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.740
‎I can't thank you enough,
‎Marinette and Cat Noir.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.980
‎I'm finally free
‎from the burden of the past

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.260
‎that had been haunting me for so long.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.900
‎I shall go and see them someday soon
‎and explain everything to them.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.820
‎Your training is complete, Marinette.
‎You are now a fully-fledged Ladybug.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.140
‎And the time has come for me
‎to prepare you to become

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.100
‎the new Guardian.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.660
‎The Guardian?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.620
‎But, Master, you're the Guardian!

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.260
‎You have been for 172 years!

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.540
‎Precisely!
‎It's high time I handed it over.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.740
‎You have proven
‎that you are more worthy of it than I am.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.700
‎In fact,
‎your training is starting right now.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.100
‎You will spend the next 24 hours
‎meditating with the Miracle Box,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.980
‎without anything to eat.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.100
‎Uh... actually, I...
‎I need to help at the bakery!

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.340
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.620
‎I was joking!

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.500
‎Those strict traditions
‎did no good when I was your age.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.820
‎I have no intention of continuing them.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.540
‎Instead, your first task
‎will be to help me

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.580
‎carry these boxes to my van.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.860
‎Now that Hawk Moth knows who I am,
‎it's too dangerous for me to live here.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.660
‎But don't worry, Marinette.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.500
‎Whenever you and Cat Noir need me,
‎I will always be here for you.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:58.500
‎I'm not going anywhere until Hawk Moth
‎is defeated. I'll never leave you.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.620
‎I have not digested my defeat, Ladybug.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.340
‎It's simply honed my appetite
‎all the more.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.780
‎But now that I know
‎what the Guardian looks like,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.980
‎I intend to put that knowledge to use

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.460
‎and prepare a dish of revenge
‎especially for you.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.060
‎And it shall be served...

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.860
‎very cold.
