1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,260
Government s ources tell us
the world's energy resources

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,330
will be fully exhausted
within five years.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,750


4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,420


5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,090
Space Station was
completed today...

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,050
designed for a risky experimental mission.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,220


8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,860
Onboard the orbiting lab,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,850
is the Shepard Particle Accelerator.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,180
If astronauts can get
the Shepard working,

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,810
it would produce free energy,

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,810
solving the earth's energy crisis forever.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,020


14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,630
...as French officials
announce

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,740
new energy rationing provisions...

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,340
...the dissolution of
these international alliances...

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,870


18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,730
...international effort
is merely a drain on financial

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,080
and energy resources...

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,670
Yes.

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
I'll tell him.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Okay.

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,550
Thanks.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,890
Did you move at all?

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,640
Forward or side to side?

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,640
Joe says you owe him a call.

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,810
Did he ask you?

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,770
I feel like honking a horn.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,770
Yeah, because that will make
loads of difference.

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,270
Are you serious?

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,810
Stop.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,530
You've started a trend.

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,450
Come on.
That's like the fourth blackout today.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,030
Fifth.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Did he ask you?

36
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,420
And?

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
You know what I said.

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,670
I'm not leaving you.

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,090
That mission could be years.

40
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,970
You said you could be back in six months.

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,220
Do you want me to go?

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,680
Joe knows what we've been through.

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,490
And yet he still wants you on the crew.

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,240
- There are other officers.
- Yeah, but he called you.

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
Why are you pushing this?

46
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,310
Why do you think?

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,110
Forget about me and what I want,

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,030
which is for you to stay.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,400
Why do you think?

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,700
Because you are sweet.

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,920
Because people are starving.

52
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,880
Because our energy supplies
are running out.

53
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,550
And this mission could unlock
an endless supply of power

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,010
that could save us all.

55
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
If you go...

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
you and I...

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
will survive.

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,610
I'm afraid if you don't...

59
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,490
No one will.

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,590


61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,220


62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,520


63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,230
TAD throttle control, 8636.

64
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Line secure.

65
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,430
Accelerator system status?

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,050
It's holding for pre-ignition.

67
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,990
Shepard team, you are go
for countdown.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
We've all got fingers
crossed here at Mission Control.

69
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,170
Let's make this first one count.

70
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,020
- Status boosters?
- Go.

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,310
- The GNC.
- Go.

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Power up.

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,260
Commander, Shepard team
standing by for your go.

74
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,970
On my count...

75
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,230
Three... two... one... mark.

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,020


77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,990


78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580


79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,550


80
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,900


81
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,030


82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240


83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,300
Huntsville, this is Commander Kiel.

84
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,640
Firing... has failed.

85
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,020


86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,290


87
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,250


88
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580


89
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,600


90
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,560


91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Morning, beautiful.

92
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,200
- Sorry, I woke you.
- No. Look.

93
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
I'm working.

94
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,290
I've got a patient today with...

95
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,540
Camptodactyly-arthropathy-
coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome.

96
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,290
- What's that?
- I'll tell you after I do my homework.

97
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,010
I'm getting sick of only seeing you
on a screen.

98
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,930
- You okay?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,150
It's the rest of the world
I'm worried about.

100
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,270
You see the same news that I do.

101
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
It's madness.

102
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,360
Oil wars are spreading.

103
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,980
Russia is threatening
ground invasion now.

104
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Can you believe that?

105
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,240
Ground invasion, which will
waste their oil reserves.

106
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
Anyway...

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,540
normal life is
hanging by a thread.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
You?

109
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,710
We're all on edge.

110
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,090
And we only have enough fuel
for three more firings.

111
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,970
- I remember.
- If this doesn't work...

112
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,010
I can't even think about what happens
down there.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,600
I don't think any of us are feeling...

114
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,850
hopeful.

115
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,600
I miss you more everyday.

116
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Like I miss them.

117
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,570
And maybe I'm an idiot...

118
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
but I'm hopeful.

119
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,870
And not just for the work
that you're doing.

120
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,330
We can't go back in time
and know what we know now.

121
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,250
But I was thinking...

122
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,840
Maybe when you get back...

123
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,590


124
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390


125
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100


126
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,270


127
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,360


128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,080


129
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,840


130
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,590


131
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,460


132
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,550
Welcome to American Sunrise...

133
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,970
Two-one.

134
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,100


135
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,610


136
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,990


137
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,540


138
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,880
Six hundred and ninety-four.

139
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,630
Six hundred and ninety-four days
I've kept our O2,

140
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,640
CO2, N2, hydrogen, water vapor and methane
at optimal levels.

141
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
You know how many pressure leaks
we've had?

142
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,310
Not one.

143
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,140
No microbe overgrowth, nothing.

144
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,230
- You know why?
- This is a long speech, Volkov.

145
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,730
Because I disinfect the decks
every 72 hours.

146
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,190
I disinfect the decks, actually.

147
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,110
If you have a point, I'd make it now.

148
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,900
There's one part of this station.

149
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,660
One part that is not working.

150
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,630
This is interesting.
Do you know what part that is?

151
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,080
The Shepard Accelerator.

152
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,050
Eight billion
are counting on us. What are you saying?

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
I don't have a problem with you.

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,270
But your German boyfriend
over here, I do.

155
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,850
- Go back to your quarters.
- Don't treat me like you're my mother.

156
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,750
You're not.

157
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,610
- Okay, that's enough.
- Hey, chill out, Volky.

158
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,760
Two years on this station,
and this man has delivered nothing.

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Volkov!

160
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,300
You need to think very carefully
about what you're saying.

161
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,230
We've both heard the reports.

162
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,020
Germany is preparing for war

163
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,310
and everyday that goes by,

164
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,940
more and more Russians are starving.

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,370
Maybe you're not in a hurry
to get the Shepard working.

166
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120


167
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,540


168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,090
Easy! Easy!

169
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,710
This stops now!

170
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,710
If we can't keep our shit together
up here,

171
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,680
how can we ever expect them
to do it down there?

172
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,970
- Maybe they won't!
- Keep your mouth shut!

173
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,510
We have a job to do.

174
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,210
Another test aboard
the Cloverfield Space Station.

175
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,150
The 47th test in just over two years

176
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,700
is scheduled for
8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.

177
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,820
All eyes are on...

178
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,010
This is Huntsville...
we've got eyes and ears.

179
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,270
Morning, Huntsville.

180
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,330


181
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,450
Copy that.

182
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,330
- Schmidt, system status?
- Green across the board.

183
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,920
Right this minute, they are
testing a particle accelerator up there,

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,840
so we can learn how to make
unlimited energy down here.

185
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,510
But those who have accepted

186
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,970
the Cloverfield Paradox is real...

187
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,740
Shepard holding
for pre-ignition.

188
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Commander, Shepard team standing by
for your go.

189
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,810
Diagnostic mode off.

190
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,850
X-Deck modification complete.

191
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,400
Stabilizer active.

192
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,240
Qinhuangdao, confirm pre-ignition
sequencing authorization.

193
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,840
You're a go
for accelerator pre-ignition.

194
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,120
Huntsville and Qinhuangdao Control,
we'll call you post blackout.

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,220
- Copy.
- Stand by for protocol go.

196
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,180
Why does the accelerator
worry you so much?

197
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,420
Because that accelerator is
1000 times more powerful

198
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,880
than any ever built.

199
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,090
Every time they test it, they risk

200
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,170
ripping open the membrane of space time,

201
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,340
smashing together multiple dimensions,

202
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,050
shattering reality.

203
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
And not just on that station,

204
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,640
everywhere.

205
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,270
This experiment could unleash chaos...

206
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,730
the likes of whi c h we have nev er seen.

207
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,610
Monsters, demons, beasts from the sea...

208
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,810
To clarify,

209
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,230
you believe their efforts
to solve the energy crisis

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,950
might unleash demons?

211
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,700
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

212
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,490
Volkov, we're ready to take
the Shepard online.

213
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,080
- How's your station?
- Hold on,

214
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm calibrating our expensive compass.

215
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,850
And not just here and now...

216
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,290
in the past...

217
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,040
in the future, in other dimensions...

218
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,670
You have no idea how much I would

219
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,380
love to be wrong about this.

220
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,710
Monk.

221
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,240
- If you want to know more...
- Turn that shit off.

222
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
read my book...

223
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,600
Gyro is calibrating.

224
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,100
Our station is good.

225
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,610
You should ask Schmidt,
is his station good?

226
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,940
Jesus Christ.

227
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,560
Please, Mr. Monk,

228
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,020
hit us with your holy stick.

229
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,110
Oh, come on.

230
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,690
- Not now when we're...
- Schmidt.

231
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,870
The farther we travel from home,
the clearer it becomes

232
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,920
that there is a power infinitely
greater than us.

233
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,170
Please show Your mercy.

234
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,050
And allow the Shepard to work this time.

235
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,010
To provide the energy we need.

236
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,390
To prevent our countries

237
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,850
from going to war.

238
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,190
Please, God, be on our side.

239
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,890
Amen.

240
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,650
Amen.

241
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,030
That was righteous.

242
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,570


243
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Back to work.

244
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,450
Sunday School over yet?

245
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,210
Schmidt, power up.

246
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,580
Sequence running.

247
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,510
Thirty to ignition.

248
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,470
Commander?

249
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,900
Three... two... one...

250
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,230
mark.

251
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,360


252
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,530
Please don't break up on me, baby.

253
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,420


254
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,300
Yes, yes. Yes!

255
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,750
We have a successful collision.

256
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,810
What's our output?

257
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,060
We have positive energy flow.

258
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
For the first time.

259
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,150
Look at this, look at this.

260
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,320
- Holy shit, you did it.
- It's working.

261
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,990
- We are focused at 47 teravolts.
- Oh, man!

262
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,370
Hamilton, viewscreen mode.

263
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,660
- Yeah!
- Oh, man! Nice.

264
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,790
Oh, yeah man!
That's pretty.

265
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,290


266
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300


267
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,510


268
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,470
Schmidt, tell me something.

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,820
It says it hit 602...

270
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,470


271
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940


272
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,900
What the hell is happening?

273
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,150


274
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,410


275
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,910


276
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,040


277
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,920


278
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,510


279
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,590
- Extinguisher systems are down.
- Then we ventilate.

280
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,850


281
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,600
I need 63M open, now!

282
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,640
Oh, no.

283
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,650
Something's wrong here, guys.
It's all scrambled.

284
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,440


285
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,240


286
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,690
Qinhuangdao, do you copy?

287
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,100
The O2 tanks are leaking.

288
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,170
Our reserves are severely diminished.

289
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,400
- Qinhuangdao, do you copy?
- The systems are scrambled.

290
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,550
There's absolutely no guarantee

291
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,970
any executable will function as expected.

292
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,810
I'm rebooting the comms system.
I'm not picking up anything.

293
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Okay, what else?

294
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,690
Life support at 74 percent.

295
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,900
Main power is fried.
This is backup.

296
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,860
Temperature is all over the place

297
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,690
and nothing gets better
until Mundy and I get our hands on it.

298
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,540
- We've got gear to fix all this?
- Not by a long shot.

299
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,160
Request an ECL to send supplies.

300
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,630
This doesn't make any sense.

301
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,550
- The output, massive amount of energy.
- Tam, please kill that alarm.

302
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,180
There was some kind
of malfunction.

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
Really Schmidt?
There was a malfunction?

304
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,620
Kiel?

305
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,290
It isn't there.

306
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,260
The frequency
for Mission Control?

307
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,050
The Earth.

308
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,680
I... can't find anything.

309
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,810
We must have gotten turned around,
moved during firing.

310
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,270
It's big, blue, full of angry people.
Keep looking, you'll find it.

311
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,980
I've double checked the radio target,
but the target's gone.

312
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,850
Guys, the systems are scrambled.

313
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,480
Hamilton is right.

314
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,820
It's not here.

315
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,360
We're not picking up any signals.

316
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,700
The entire Earth is not gone!

317
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,220
Cycle the external cameras.

318
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,450
All of them.

319
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,160


320
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,890
Wait, are we saying
this thing of his

321
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,060
could have thrown us across the galaxy?

322
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,940
We knew it was dangerous.

323
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,770
That's why we had to go up in space
to fire this thing.

324
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,270
No, come on.
Bullshit!

325
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:28,080


326
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,150
You, did this!
I never trusted you.

327
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,830
- We all did this.

328
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,940
The Earth is gone.
The Earth is gone!

329
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,550
Are you sure
we checked everything?

330
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,340
Mundy, you've asked
that question six times.

331
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,800
It's a good bloody question,
isn't it?

332
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,970
- This is your fault.
- Of course you blame me.

333
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,260
Who else made this happen?

334
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,180
We've been working on this
for two years.

335
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,140
- Volkov is right, the Earth's gone!
- You don't know this.

336
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,090
- Somehow, we did it.
- Look out any goddamn window.

337
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,170
- Maybe we're missing something.
- We're missing the Earth!

338
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
- This is not our fault.
- None of us...

339
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,010


340
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,460


341
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,220


342
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,850
Alright, here's what we're up against.

343
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,810
The station's got problems
we don't have tools to fix.

344
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,060
At this point, looking for home

345
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,270
is a luxury for us.

346
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,150
First, we need to survive.

347
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,280
We need to consider, evidence or not...

348
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,360
that we might have ended the lives

349
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,700
of billions of people.

350
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,240
We didn't destroy the Earth,

351
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,660
we just lost it.

352
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,210
Totally routine day. Copy that.

353
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,330
Mundy, take Schmidt and deal with the O2.

354
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm a physicist.

355
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,090
And now you work for Mundy.

356
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,420
Oh, your lucky day.

357
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,130
Tam, you and Monk will search and repair
all power leaks.

358
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,720
Maybe we can get the temperature
under control.

359
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,890
Hamilton, Volkov, test all circuits,

360
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,430
then we can start looking for home.

361
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,520
When the Shepard overloaded,

362
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,390
something went wrong with
the station's orientation system.

363
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,230
- We'll replace the circuits.
- No shit. If that's the problem

364
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,520
It might be the gyro.

365
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,190
Then let's get that fancy compass fixed.

366
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320


367
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,200
- Volkov?
- Yes.

368
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,000
- I found the problem with the gyro.
- What, it's fried?

369
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,670
- It's not here.
- What do you mean, it's not here?

370
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,590
I secured this when we fired the ship.

371
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,720


372
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,520
This look okay?

373
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,240


374
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,330


375
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,880


376
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,180


377
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,900


378
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,290


379
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,880


380
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Tam.

381
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Tam?

382
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,190
- You alright?
- Shh.

383
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,490


384
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,490
What is that?

385
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,470
It's coming from inside the wall.

386
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,000
- In the wall?
- No, walls don't make noises like that.

387
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,080
- We have to open it.
- Volkov, get the tools!

388
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,170
Volky!

389
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,170
Before you rip off that panel
and damage God-knows-what,

390
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,270
can we at least discuss it?

391
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,710


392
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Mundy's right.
It could be dangerous.

393
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,880
- We should open it.
- No!

394
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,260
Who are you to decide?

395
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,760
Stop! We are doing this.

396
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,680
All right, good luck.

397
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,520


398
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,490
Three... two... one.

399
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,490


400
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,210


401
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,880
- We're here. We've got you.
- Hold on!

402
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,020
- We have to cut her free.
- We can't cut anything.

403
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,510
Those lines going through her body
are power lines.

404
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,610
- She's dying in there!
- Mundy, cut the power.

405
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
- Hold on!
- She's dying!

406
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,600
We don't have a choice.

407
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,720
We have a choice!

408
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,680
Stop it! We don't know what that is.

409
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,410
- Shut it off!
- We can reroute the power later.

410
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,520
Hold on

411
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,360
- Mundy!
- Module 17 powered down.

412
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,490
- Just breathe. It's okay.
- Power's down. Let's cut her out.

413
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,210
- Monk!
- She's bleeding out!

414
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,400
I can't do anything
until she's out of the wall.

415
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,580
- Help me.
- Guys, hurry!

416
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,250
Help me... Hamilton.

417
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,540
She just said your name.

418
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,460
What is happening to me?

419
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,760
What's happening to me?
What's happening?

420
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,380
We're gonna cut you free.

421
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,800
- Quick.
- Please.

422
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,200
- We got to get her out.
- Can you move her leg?

423
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,390
- Okay, got it.
- Hurry up!

424
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,230
Mundy, the saw. Quick!

425
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,940
Hold on. Stay with me.

426
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,110


427
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,590
- Careful with the pipe.
- That's no good.

428
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,610
- Hold her down.
- Careful.

429
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,800
- It's gonna be okay.
- Grab her leg.

430
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,410
This is a mistake.

431
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,270
Schmidt, I need more light!

432
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,370
You got her?
Keep her down.

433
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,220
- Breathe, breathe.
- Okay.

434
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,380


435
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,590


436
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,510
Get something to strap her down.

437
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,050
- Keep her still.
- All right.

438
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,970


439
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,130
You're okay.

440
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,300


441
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,220


442
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,890


443
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,190


444
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,790


445
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,160


446
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000


447
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,680


448
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,350


449
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,070


450
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,970
No official public
statement has been

451
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,790
made about what caused the explosion

452
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,540
that was thought at first to be
a nuclear weapon.

453
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,750
But we are being assured by authorities

454
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,580
that that is not what this is.

455
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,550


456
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,630
Are you on call?

457
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Good.

458
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Yeah, I saw it.

459
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Has the hospital issued Code Orange yet?

460
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,020
Shaw said what did it?

461
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,810
Jesus Christ.

462
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,510
- This is madness!
- Calm down.

463
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,120
We can't stay calm.
Not with that woman lying there.

464
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,970
Who is she?
And what the hell is she doing here?

465
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,290
She knew my name.

466
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,800
What if we're all going mad?

467
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,970
I'm not gonna say it again.
We have to stay focused.

468
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,710
We have other problems to deal with.

469
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,140
Speaking of other problems,

470
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,590
how the hell are we supposed
to find the Earth?

471
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,630
Without the gyro, we're lost.

472
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Any ideas?

473
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,800
Because honestly, I'm stumped.

474
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
You're assuming Earth is still there.

475
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
Earth disappears.

476
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,810
Station does not feel the same.

477
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,270
A woman appears in the wall.

478
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,020
We're definitely not in Kentucky anymore.

479
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,360
- Kansas.
- Kansas?

480
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,190
Really? Who gives a shit?

481
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,360
People from Kansas.

482
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,660
I don't know what's going on,

483
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,910
but one thing is clear.

484
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,040
The Shepard's done it.

485
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,290
Which means it might also undo it.

486
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,730
Right now, the integrity of the station
is all that matters.

487
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,420
We have repairs that need to happen,
immediately.

488
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,630
Monk will give us an update
when there is one.

489
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Let's get to it.

490
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,640


491
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,860
Meet me at X-Deck in ten minutes.

492
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,740
- Kiel wants me with him...
- I'm done with Kiel.

493
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,780
You and I need to take control
if we're ever going to get home.

494
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,100


495
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980


496
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,410
Hey!

497
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,490
The worms are missing.

498
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Guys?

499
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,370
The worms are gone!

500
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,050
Enhance the core density.

501
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,090
I did. I told you I did.

502
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,130
We have to think about the fact that...

503
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,050
Bullshit... no...

504
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,190
...there might be a larger problem.

505
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,280
We're gonna solve this thing.

506
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,510
And what if we can't?

507
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,410
We will, goddamn it!

508
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,180
Who else can fix this up here?
No one.

509
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,980
Now focus and get your shit together.
Understand me?

510
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,810
Speak to me like that again...

511
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,820
and you and I will have a bigger problem
than the Shepard.

512
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
You copy?

513
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,450
Give me the wrench.

514
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,470


515
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,410


516
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
What?

517
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
What?

518
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Excuse me?

519
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,690
Yes.

520
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
I know.

521
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,680


522
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,110


523
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,070


524
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,000


525
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,750


526
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,470


527
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,350


528
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Hey, Schmidt.

529
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,570
Look at these moisture levels.

530
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,860
Huh.

531
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,910
- What are you doing here?
- No.

532
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,530
What are you two doing up here?

533
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,000
- Against Commander's orders?
- I don't answer to you, Volkov.

534
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,330
- No?
- No.

535
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,580
Then who are you answer to?
German intelligence?

536
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,830
Where'd you get the gun from?

537
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,960
Please put that down.

538
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,340
- Chancellor Gerlach?
- Put that gown down, Volkov.

539
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,300
Was it Gerlach who gave...

540
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,130
Stop it!

541
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,470
Who gave you the wartime orders...

542
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,800
Put the gun down!
You need help, Volkov.

543
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,490
- ...to sabotage the Shepard?
- Drop it!

544
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,720
Are you crazy?
Put that gun down!

545
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,190


546
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,900


547
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,760
- Monk!
- Help!

548
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,430
- How long has be been like this?
- He tried to kill us.

549
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,800
Tam, why do you have a gun?

550
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,410
He came to us on X-Deck,
threatened us with this.

551
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,010
- Lock it away.
- Now theres a gun?

552
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
Since when is there a gun?

553
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,250
- What happened, Monk?
- What the hell?

554
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,340


555
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,210
Do something, Monk!

556
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,110
- Monk, what's going on?
- I don't know.

557
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,430
We have to help him!

558
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,550


559
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,100
No.

560
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,350
No.

561
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,900


562
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,480


563
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,990
Well, we found the worms.

564
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,660


565
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,250


566
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,800


567
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,970


568
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,200
Hamilton, she's awake.

569
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,590


570
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,350
Okay.

571
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,570


572
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,530
Ava.

573
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,910
How are you on this station?

574
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,500
I have the same question for you.

575
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,370
I don't know.

576
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,590
I was heading to X-Deck...

577
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
to find Mundy.

578
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,050
You know Mundy?

579
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,220
Of course I know Mundy.

580
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,850
We've been on this station for two years.

581
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
Mundy, Kiel...

582
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Volkov.

583
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,940
Jesus Christ, Volkov.

584
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,900
Everyone except her.

585
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,950
Who is that woman?

586
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,450
Who are you?

587
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,950
What do you mean, who am I?

588
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
It's me.

589
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Mina.

590
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,540
Mina Jensen.

591
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,380
- I'm the Shepard engineer.
- No, Tam.

592
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,010
Tam is the Shepard engineer.

593
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,680
What are you talking about?

594
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,120
What are you even doing here.
You're supposed to be on Earth.

595
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,430
Why would I be on Earth?

596
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,600
Because you're our civilian coordinator?

597
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,770
We trained together since ExoMars 6.

598
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,500
We're friends.
I'm your friend.

599
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,690
We've never met.

600
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,570
How can you not know who I am?

601
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,410
None of you know who I am?

602
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,040
None of us.

603
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,130
I don't understand.

604
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,380
I don't understand.

605
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920


606
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,050
How can you not know me?

607
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
How can you not know me?

608
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,480
I'm the Shepard engineer.

609
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,440


610
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,110


611
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,830
Listen to me.

612
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Ava...

613
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,340
don't trust Schmidt.

614
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
What?

615
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
It was him.

616
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,260
Schmidt sabotaged the ship.

617
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,870


618
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Commander.

619
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,790
What's going on?

620
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,870
Kiel, have you lost your...

621
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,920


622
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,170
You're making a mistake.

623
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,130
Stay out of this!

624
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,810
Jensen warned us about you.

625
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,890
The woman in the wall?

626
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,980
- I checked your communication logs.
- So what?

627
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,350
We deciphered your messages from the BND.

628
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,560
The BND?

629
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,650
We trusted you!

630
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,400
For two years, Schmidt.

631
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,360
- What are you talking about, Kiel?
- Two years!

632
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,190
You were ordered by German Intelligence

633
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,030
to keep the Shepard offline

634
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,820
until Russia was neutralized.

635
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,740
- I swear I never received such an order.
- I saw the order! I saw your response!

636
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,790
Have you lost your mind?

637
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,370
Maybe I am losing my mind.

638
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,330
But I will do everything I can

639
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,000
to keep us alive and get us home!

640
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,670
Until I say otherwise,

641
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,090
this is where you stay.

642
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,760
You're trusting her and not me!

643
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,800
You need me, Kiel!

644
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Kiel!

645
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,990
City wide destruction
has been reported,

646
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,650
stretching from the downtown area
to the residential suburb.

647
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,060
Michael, are you safe?

648
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,570
No, I'm headed to the hospital.

649
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,860
It's gonna be a mess.

650
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,780
Listen, can you get this message to Ava.

651
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,910
Tell her I'll to be in triage
for the next 72 hours.

652
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,990
Michael, listen.

653
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,040
We're trying to get answers here, b ut...

654
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
it's gone.

655
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,370
The station.

656
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,830
We lost signal.

657
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,500
- What?
- I know.

658
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,880
We're scanning everywhere.

659
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,670
It's off comms, off radar...

660
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Did it break apart?

661
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,670
Did the station fail?

662
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
We don't know.

663
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,650
Look, I promise I'll get back to you

664
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,090
as soon as I know anything.

665
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,850
I'm so sorry.

666
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,850
Just don't lose hope.

667
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,930
I believe it's still up there.

668
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:22,890
Somewhere.

669
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,690
Michael?

670
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I'll call you back.

671
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,530


672
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,000


673
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,170


674
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,090


675
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,180


676
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,020


677
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,490


678
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
Help!

679
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,410


680
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,460
Help! Help!

681
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,760
Help! Help!

682
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,020
Help! Help!

683
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:53,320
Here! Help!

684
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,110


685
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,860


686
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,080


687
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,500


688
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,590
Shit!

689
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,010
What the...?

690
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,510
Help!

691
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,680
Whoa!

692
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,640


693
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,230
Ouch!

694
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,770


695
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,940
- Mundy.
- Get me out of here!

696
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,450
Kiel, help me!

697
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,910


698
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,200


699
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,290
Help me!

700
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,870
Hamilton, help me out.

701
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,330
It's pulling me further in!

702
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,410
Pull me out!

703
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,170


704
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,630
Oh, man.

705
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,390
Anyone ever seen anything
like that before?

706
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Guys?

707
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,810
Where's my arm?

708
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,860
Where's my bloody arm?

709
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,780
- No pain?
- No.

710
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,370
Not physically.

711
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,370
It's like he was born this way.

712
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,870
Except I wasn't, was I?

713
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,420
He's in shock.

714
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,850
Can you stop talking like I'm a kid
and these are my parents?

715
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,880
Sorry.

716
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,340
I don't know the rules, now.

717
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,430
Do you think there's any chance...

718
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,640
it might grow back?

719
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,230
I don't know.

720
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,110
I don't know what to believe anymore.

721
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,030


722
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,610


723
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,960


724
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,790
This your way of apologizing?

725
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,510
Kiel?

726
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,430


727
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,310
Kiel?

728
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,820


729
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:48,120


730
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,290


731
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,710


732
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,060
I need the whole crew on M-Deck,
as fast as you can.

733
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,380
- Who let you out of the airlock?
- Just get here, now.

734
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,670
What is it?

735
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,090


736
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,510
What is that?

737
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,100


738
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,270
That's my fucking arm.

739
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,860
Hold it quick!
Hold my arm, please!

740
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,530
Quickly, come on!

741
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,740
Hold it!

742
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,450
Be easy with it.

743
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,870


744
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,030
Are you controlling it?

745
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,180
- I'm not controlling it. It's over there!
- Are you sure?

746
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,350
Yes, I'm sure because I'm giving you
the finger right now.

747
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,540
How is that alive?

748
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,260
Logic doesn't apply to any of this.

749
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,130
One thing is clear.
The overload did it.

750
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,800
None of us believed it was real,

751
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,260
but this is the paradox.

752
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,210
Excuse me?

753
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,880
Particles interacting with each other
across two dimensions.

754
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,720
Okay, I'm gonna sit down.

755
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,300
Two distinct realities in a multiverse...

756
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,520
fighting to occupy the same space,

757
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,020
creating chaos.

758
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,730
These aren't the things we know...

759
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,520
because they don't belong to us.

760
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,900
Jensen.

761
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,570
My communication logs.

762
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,070
Guys, check out my arm.

763
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,910


764
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,300
I think my arm's trying to
write something.

765
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,210
Somebody get a pen. Quick.

766
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,130
This is madness.

767
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,170
Go!

768
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,840
That's creepy!

769
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,100
"Cut...

770
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,220
Volkov... open?"

771
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,300
What are you talking about, arm?

772
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,030


773
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,120


774
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,330
- It's nothing personal, Volky.
- Mundy.

775
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,040
- He was your friend.
- He was about to shoot me.

776
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,880
- Well, you know, before that.
- Guys.

777
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,090
Monk?

778
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,760
Sorry, I can't do this.

779
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,510
Come on. You're the doctor.

780
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,050
I can handle it.

781
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,240


782
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,720
There's something...

783
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,510


784
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,640
No...

785
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,690
- What the...
- ...way, Jose!

786
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,640
Come on.

787
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,450


788
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,760
So we're hoping that
the piece of equipment

789
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,040
you found in someone's stomach

790
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,660
is what's going to save the day.

791
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,290
Good luck, everybody.

792
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,840
Putting it on the viewscreen.

793
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,010
Look, there's Cassiopeia.

794
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,590
It's upside-down.

795
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,010
We're upside-down!

796
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,680
Guys, we moved and we're upside-down.

797
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,100
Check the other side of the sun.

798
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,730
Scanning.

799
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,860


800
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,450
My arm helped us find the Earth!

801
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,120


802
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,790
Targeting all receivers.

803
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,710


804
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,710
I'd clap, you know, if I could.

805
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,780
Let's let them know we're still here.

806
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,700
We could receive, but we can't transmit.

807
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,240
Let's make that happen as fast as we can.

808
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,640
Let's request a shuttle and give them
status on the Shepard.

809
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,350
And have them send us some champagne.

810
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,170
Or some dumplings.

811
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,100
Wait! Guys, listen.

812
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,960
Sources say the number
of those killed today

813
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,610
could be even greater than the blitz
on Berlin.

814
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,400
- The fourteen-month-old European war...
- Fourteen months?

815
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,210
...no sign of resolution.

816
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,860
This, as China sends warships

817
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,870
further west...

818
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,160
What are they talking about?
What's going on down there?

819
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,160
...from All Chinese embassies.

820
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,290
All this with nations still reeling

821
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,290
after the destruction
of the Cloverfield Space Station.

822
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,090
Hamilton, is there video?

823
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,250
...most recent attempts
to create safe renewable energy...

824
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,480
- Oh, my God.
- Viewscreen mode.

825
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,430
...a catastrophic failure two days ago.

826
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,350
Losing its brave crew of six...

827
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,220
debris from the Cloverfield has crashed

828
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,810
into the Atlantic Ocean.

829
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,850
Salvage crews are en route.

830
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,810
President Usman is set to make a statement

831
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,320
from the Rose Garden at 5:00 PM
Eastern Standard Time.

832
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,400
I don't get it.

833
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,870
It's much worse than we thought.

834
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,860
It's not just particles of two dimensions
interacting.

835
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,780
We've traveled to another one.

836
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,660
To another dimension?

837
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,580
So, hold on.

838
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,750
If that's not our Earth...

839
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,420
can someone please explain to me
how we're supposed to get home?

840
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,910
We have to get the Shepard fixed
and fire it again.

841
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,390
What we know about Quantum entanglement

842
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,010
dictates it should bring us back.

843
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,930
Perhaps undo the damage we've done.

844
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,020
It doesn't matter what Earth that is.

845
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,900
We should go down and get help.

846
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,160
We need to go home...

847
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,190
to our home.

848
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,280
Look at them. At their war.

849
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,450
That will be us if we don't get back.

850
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,570
I'm with Monk.

851
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,030
I say we go to that Earth,

852
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,330
the one we can see,

853
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,040
and get the hell off this station.

854
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,910
That place cannot save us.

855
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The longer we stay here

856
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,250
the more dangerous it is.

857
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,420
For us and for everyone back home.

858
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,590


859
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,950
All circuits are busy now...

860
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,560
I can't get through to your home yet.

861
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,060
Circuits are busy.

862
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,560
That means no calls will go through.

863
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,480
I know what it means.

864
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,780


865
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,330
My uncle's dead.

866
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,040
There's nothing you could have done.

867
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,500
Molly.

868
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,050
Molly.

869
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,010
We're going to find your parents.

870
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,460
The most important thing right now
is keeping you safe.

871
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,190


872
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,980
Thanks.

873
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,870
You shouldn't text while driving.

874
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,500
You're a smart kid.

875
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,660
Only in emergencies.

876
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,710
This qualifies.

877
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,250


878
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,090
What did this?

879
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,640
We're not sure.

880
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,690
Bad things are happening.

881
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,940
But good people are
going to make it better.

882
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,030
We're going to need a lot of good people.

883
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,910


884
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,370


885
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,210
I'm gonna close the door.

886
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,220


887
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,680


888
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,100


889
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,030
Let me look at your arm again.

890
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,200
I'll do a better job this time.

891
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,910


892
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Thanks, Monk.

893
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,470
You got it working, didn't you?

894
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,260
You got it working.

895
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,100
Something went wrong.

896
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,230
Shepard smashed a Higgs boson.

897
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,810
Overloaded.

898
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,190
Somehow you ended up here.

899
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Your dimension crashed into mine.

900
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,740


901
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,370
Crew must be working on power.

902
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,460
Trying to fire the Shepard again
to get you back home.

903
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,500
Could you do me a favor?

904
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,010
Would you mind mention to your crew

905
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,800
that you escaping my dimension
will trap me in yours?

906
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,600
I've been thinking...

907
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,470
When we put out the fire, we ventilated...

908
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,980
What if condensation caused the Shepard
to overload?

909
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,150
Ventilation could fix that.

910
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:03,610
Run the numbers.

911
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:04,860
I'll check the circuits.

912
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320


913
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,780


914
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,630


915
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:41,850


916
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,650
Tam.

917
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:47,110


918
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,910


919
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,950


920
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,420
Schmidt!

921
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,210


922
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,970


923
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,180
M Deck, I need help in Airlock 6.

924
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,640
I can't get out!

925
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,230


926
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,030


927
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Tam!

928
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,790
Hold on!

929
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,000
- Hold on.
- It's jammed. Try and override it.

930
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,040
Tam, we're gonna get you out.

931
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,460
- Hurry!
- It's not working.

932
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,300
Come on, come on!
Mundy, let's do it manually.

933
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,470
Pull!

934
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:01,220


935
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,850


936
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,900


937
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:13,610
What's happening?

938
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,950
Get her out!

939
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,160


940
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,130


941
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:33,670
- Tam!
- Let go!

942
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,140


943
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,160


944
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:07,830
Tam figured out what we've
been doing wrong.

945
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,380
Condensation has been throwing off
our numbers.

946
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,960
We needed to ventilate.

947
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,760
We can't stay here.

948
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,850
This dimension is eating us alive.

949
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,640
We need to fix the Shepard and use it
to get home.

950
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,230
We can't.

951
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:29,980
Not without Tam.

952
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
Maybe not.

953
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,290
Are you sure about this?

954
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,750


955
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,250
- All circuits are busy now.
- Please...

956
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:00,470


957
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,970


958
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,810
All circuits are busy now...

959
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,440


960
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,940
- Hello?
- Joe, anything?

961
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,190
Not yet, but there's no debris.

962
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,690
That's a hopeful sign.

963
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,110
We're looking everywhere, I promise.

964
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:19,670
We'll figure out what happened to them.

965
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,100
It's the goddamn paradox, isn't it?

966
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,490
You can't find the station because
it isn't here anymore.

967
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,410
And they do this too?

968
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,000
What's happening here...

969
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,850
Michael, I'll call you as soon as
I know anything.

970
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,880
Look, I just need you to write this down.

971
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,300
I need you to contact
Andrew and Nancy Pontanuis

972
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,630
in Philadelphia.

973
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,130
My phone's not going through.

974
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,990
Just Tell them that their daughter
Molly is okay...

975
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,430


976
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,230


977
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,230


978
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,400


979
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,740
- Can you install Tam's algorithm?
- Yes.

980
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,450
- But I want all of Schmidt's work.
- What?

981
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,410
- Done.
- Kiel.

982
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,580
Once we get the Shepard operational,

983
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,870
we give her your work.

984
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,790
We put her in an escape pod
and send her home with the specs.

985
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,540
- What do you need?
- Power.

986
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,520
Parts of the core are irreparably damaged.

987
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,090
What's left isn't sufficient to fire.

988
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
How much?

989
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,010
I'd like 210 kilowatts for at least
eight seconds,

990
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:23,970
possibly as much as 12.

991
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,770
I'd like to take a bath
with identical twins

992
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,480
- and a tub of Rocky Road.
- Figure it out.

993
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,430
Hamilton, get Jensen whatever she needs.

994
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,440
Let's get this done and get
the hell out of here.

995
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,980


996
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,770
- You can change in here?
- Thank you.

997
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:42,650
Nothing of mine would fit you, but...

998
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,450
- try this.
- Thanks.

999
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,580
You know, as odd as it is for me

1000
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,290
to suddenly have you up here...

1001
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:59,210
I realize it must be much stranger
for you.

1002
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,380
Maybe I'm not the same Ava
you're friends with.

1003
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,220
No, you're the same.

1004
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:10,930
A little sadder perhaps.

1005
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,220
The situation calls for it.

1006
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:28,410
Mina?

1007
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,410
Did you know my family?

1008
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,960
Of course.

1009
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,920
Michael... Isaac...

1010
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Ayana.

1011
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,170
And your friend was...

1012
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,840
strong enough to stay.

1013
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,640
Stay where?

1014
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,100
On Earth.

1015
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,470
After the fire.

1016
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,020
What fire?

1017
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,690
The power cell.

1018
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,660
The one... I put in the house
so they could

1019
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,450
have reading lights at night,

1020
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:12,160
so they would feel safe.

1021
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:16,790
The fire.

1022
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,380
It killed them both.

1023
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,940
Hi, Mina.

1024
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,230
A little visitor has come to see you.

1025
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,070
Hi, Auntie Mina!

1026
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:49,200
We love you.

1027
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:50,700
Sending love.

1028
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,990


1029
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,040


1030
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,340
Ava...

1031
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,430
in this world, your family is alive.

1032
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,810
They're on Earth.

1033
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,520
That's why you didn't come up here.

1034
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,320
You're down there...

1035
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,190
with them.

1036
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320


1037
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:40,960
If I divert everything non-life supporting
from the station

1038
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,170
I can get us up to 170,

1039
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,210
maybe 180 kilowatts.

1040
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,750
- That's not enough.
- 210, I know.

1041
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,260
I started thinking about what
life-supporting elements

1042
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,260
we could sacrifice,

1043
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,630
which is when I landed on this.

1044
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,390
If I shut down the O2,

1045
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:55,390
I could get us up to 240.

1046
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,720
Power down the O2 pumps.

1047
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:57,930
There are six of us.

1048
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:00,390
That gives us two hours of oxygen,
more or less.

1049
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,560
So we turn off the O2 pumps,
fire the Shepard...

1050
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,020
then, with the power generated

1051
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,770
by the now operational Shepard,

1052
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,940
restart the pumps.
That's clever.

1053
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,480
I'm clever.

1054
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,570
Kiel, I need you for a minute.

1055
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,170
Anything you need, I'm here to help.

1056
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,750
I won't let you down.

1057
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,770
We're all dealing with a lot.
We've just got to keep it together.

1058
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,800
They're alive.

1059
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,720
In this place, my children are alive.

1060
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,260
I'll do everything you need,

1061
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,600
comply with every order,

1062
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,800
but if we do get the Shepard to fire again
to get back to where we came from...

1063
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,690
I won't be here.

1064
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:47,570
You want to take a pod.

1065
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,030
With Volkov and Tam gone,
there are enough vehicles

1066
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,190
- for everyone.
- Ava.

1067
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,450
This goes against regulation,
I know, but I don't care.

1068
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:54,820
I need to go to see them.

1069
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:56,030
What about Michael?

1070
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,740
And Jensen said you weren't
on the crew of her mission.

1071
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,040
- That means you're down there, too.
- I know.

1072
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,080
Ava, that's not your family down there,

1073
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,250
that's hers.

1074
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,420
What's gonna happen when you get there?

1075
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,050
You will never understand
what this is like.

1076
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,210
No, I won't.

1077
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,050
But as much as you want to see them,
this isn't right.

1078
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,680
This isn't just about me.

1079
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,720
The Ava that's down there
wants the same thing I do.

1080
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,810
I know her.

1081
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,560
She'll steal energy for her family

1082
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,270
just like I did, and they won't survive.

1083
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,860
I don't just need to see them...

1084
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,820
I need to save them.

1085
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,490
Michael would want me to.

1086
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:43,830
Okay.

1087
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:48,000


1088
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,010
Let's turn off the oxygen.

1089
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,990
The pumps will need to be deactivated

1090
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,570
- from the maintenance ring.
- Yeah.

1091
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:59,430
That means you'll be
working inside a giant oxygen tank.

1092
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,010
- One spark and...
- Kaboom!

1093
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,720
Yeah. No, I get it.
Kentucky Fried Mundy.

1094
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,380
- That's not funny.
- I'll be on my comms...

1095
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,730
Yeah.

1096
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,530
It's gonna be tight.

1097
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,320
Let's look at some the problems
we might come into.

1098
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,950
Listen, Kiel. Trust me.

1099
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,330
Even with one stumpy arm,
I think I can get this done.

1100
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,970


1101
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:42,470


1102
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,690
All right, Mundy.
What's your progress?

1103
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,110
Shutting down the auxiliary O2 pumps
in Maintenance Room 3.

1104
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,280
I can't understand anything
you just said.

1105
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,320
I'm nearly ready to transfer the oxygen.

1106
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,410


1107
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,290
Okay, we're good.

1108
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,370
Standing by on X-Deck.

1109
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,670
- Ready on M.
- All right, Mundy.

1110
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,170


1111
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,050
Okay.

1112
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,880
The oxygen is pouring in.

1113
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,470
I can feel it.

1114
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,180
Where's the power, Jensen?

1115
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,390
Test the actuator.

1116
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,350


1117
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,950
Mundy, good work.

1118
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,870
I got to say the pure oxygen
in here is sweet.

1119
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,620


1120
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,740
Guys?

1121
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,040


1122
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Guys?

1123
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Mundy?

1124
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,090


1125
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,050
Guys?

1126
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:05,010
Are you having magnetic issues,
by any chance?

1127
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Mundy?

1128
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,600


1129
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,570


1130
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,200


1131
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:26,740


1132
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,920
Help!

1133
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,040
Mundy!

1134
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,090
Guys?

1135
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,510


1136
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,850


1137
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,940


1138
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:55,900
- No! No!
- My God.

1139
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,980


1140
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,490


1141
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,840


1142
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,140
The maintenance deck gets
more unstable with every rotation.

1143
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,780
It's a matter of time before that thing
rips the station apart.

1144
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,330
The ring's spinning off axis
by 17 degrees.

1145
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,170
Anything more than 25...

1146
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:01,210
it won't hold.

1147
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,840
We'll all be in pieces.

1148
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,260
So we decouple the maintenance ring.

1149
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,610
If we're going to survive...

1150
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,470
we have to.

1151
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,770
Not you. Not Jensen.

1152
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,980
To do that job in the time we have...

1153
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,270
it has to be the three of us.

1154
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:28,610
I want to give you some
comforting advice,

1155
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,780
but I have no idea how this
is going to go.

1156
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,080
Gravity will be unpredictable,
so be sharp.

1157
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,910
Follow my lead.

1158
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,170
The Schmidt that betrayed you...

1159
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,170
you realize he's not me, right?

1160
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,890


1161
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,190
Oh, my God.

1162
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:17,160


1163
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,170
This isn't gonna hold much longer.

1164
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,290
Let's get across.

1165
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,340
Monk, get moving!

1166
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:38,350
The ring's at 20.2 degrees.

1167
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:41,350


1168
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,360


1169
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,950
Monk, you're almost there.

1170
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,220
Twenty-one point five degrees.

1171
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,830


1172
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,460
Monk, look at me!

1173
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,220
Give me your arm!

1174
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,710
Twenty-two point three.

1175
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,430
Hamilton, you need to hurry.

1176
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,890


1177
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,150


1178
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,080
Twenty-three point one degrees.

1179
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,580


1180
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,830
Hang on!

1181
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,350
Twenty-three point four degrees.
Keep moving.

1182
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:43,650
I'm clearing the debris.

1183
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,170


1184
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,220


1185
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,600
Come on.

1186
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,730


1187
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,110
It's jammed.

1188
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,950


1189
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,780
Twenty-three point nine degrees.
We have to jettison that ring.

1190
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:21,950


1191
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:32,510
What is it?

1192
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,220
Kiel?

1193
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,720
We have to shut down the hydraulics.

1194
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,430
Let's go.

1195
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,280
Twenty-four point two degrees.

1196
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,980


1197
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:48,960
Wait, Kiel.
What are you doing?

1198
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,320
To decouple the ring, this portal
has to be locked.

1199
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,690
Wait. No, Kiel.
We can do this remotely.

1200
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,320
I'm the commander of this station.
I have to do this.

1201
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,070
You can get the station home.

1202
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,320
You can do it.

1203
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:02,790
There's no other way.

1204
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,450
You have to.

1205
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:08,290
It's okay.

1206
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,750
Oh, Jesus!
The ring's at 24.8 degrees.

1207
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,470


1208
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,430


1209
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,520
Oh. Oh, God.

1210
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,560


1211
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:33,290
Twenty-four point nine degrees.

1212
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,690


1213
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,600


1214
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,650


1215
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,180
- How late?
- Super late.

1216
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,360
- Isaac with Jenny?
- I'm getting him at three.

1217
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,580
Thank you.
Oh, don't forget his antibiotics.

1218
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,590
- Yes, no I won't forget.
- Yes, you wont.

1219
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,200
- No you won't. Okay.
- No. I won't forget.

1220
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,140
- Have something in your hair.
- Where? There?

1221
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,940
- No. No, the other side.
- Did I get it?

1222
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,580
- It's over there now.
- Good? Did I get it?

1223
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:55,830
- You keep missing it.
- Where is it?

1224
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,540
- How do you keep missing it?
- Oh my God, what is it?

1225
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,300
- It's gone. You're good.
- Are you sure?

1226
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,320
You got it a few seconds ago.
I was just being stupid.

1227
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,500


1228
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:25,970


1229
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,270
Hey, beautiful.

1230
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,270
Just in case I don't make it
through this...

1231
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,070
what I wanted to say the last time
we spoke was...

1232
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,490
maybe we'll try again.

1233
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,030
I can't defend the idea now.

1234
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,040
There's no time to think about

1235
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,500
what we could have done
or what we'll do one day.

1236
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,260
The only choice we have...

1237
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,050
is to save the people that we still can.

1238
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,660
What's our oxygen level?

1239
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,680
We've got 43 good minutes left.

1240
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,690
We'll prep the Shepard to fire twice.

1241
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,660
Once to overload, which should
get us home...

1242
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,070
then again with Tam's equation
programmed in

1243
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:20,670
which will give us the energy we need.

1244
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,150
Jensen, copy all our data
from the Shepard

1245
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,150
and take it home.

1246
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,840
This should eventually help your planet.

1247
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,370
Schmidt, get the Shepard
to countdown mode.

1248
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,790
Here's Kiel's firing key.

1249
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,160
Jensen and I will take Pod 3 down
before you fire the Shepard...

1250
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:35,960
and hopefully get home.

1251
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,290
Okay.

1252
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,460
Okay.

1253
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,990


1254
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,710
Ava?

1255
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,590


1256
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:34,270


1257
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:41,690


1258
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,200
Shit.

1259
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,330
Jensen.

1260
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:14,430


1261
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:16,270
No.

1262
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:29,360


1263
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,200
We all set on X-Deck?

1264
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,250
What are you doing?

1265
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,170
I need the firing keys.

1266
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,670
I can't let you take the Shepard.

1267
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,630
I can't do that.

1268
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,510
It's not a request, Monk.

1269
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,810
Please. Jensen.

1270
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:59,060


1271
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:05,270
I'm sorry, but I need that key.

1272
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,990


1273
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,290


1274
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:23,370
No.

1275
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,080
Monk!

1276
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay. No.

1277
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,850


1278
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:43,290
I won't let you take the Shepard
away from my world, Schmidt.

1279
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:45,980
Jensen! Please.

1280
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,360
Why have you come back?

1281
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,570
You could have gone home.

1282
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:52,610
- We were a crew.
- We were never a crew.

1283
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,030
Stay away from her, Hamilton.

1284
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,450
This had to happen from the moment
you wiped my crew,

1285
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,990
my station, from existence.

1286
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,040
- No.
- You can't have it both ways, Ava.

1287
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,920
Your family here, but the Shepard there.

1288
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,420
You have everything you needed!

1289
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,250
We couldn't rebuild fast enough.
Think.

1290
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,340
People are dying down there, every day.

1291
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,050
You're going to kill us?

1292
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:14,430
If you're asking me if I am willing
to kill three people...

1293
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,180
to save eight billion...

1294
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,350
wouldn't you?

1295
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,110


1296
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:29,980
Go!

1297
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,610
Go!

1298
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,200


1299
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,620


1300
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,750


1301
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:46,880


1302
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:52,550


1303
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:58,640


1304
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,270


1305
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:28,670
Ava...

1306
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,630
don't fail them again.

1307
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:35,970
That is your family down there.

1308
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:46,850
The same kids.

1309
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:50,060
The same man you married.

1310
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:59,610


1311
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,750
You don't know how bad it is
down there.

1312
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,000
It'll only get worse.

1313
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,270
Listen to their voices, Ava.

1314
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:29,560
They need you.

1315
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,660
You may be willing to kill
your children again...

1316
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:52,130
but I won't let those people
down there die.

1317
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:58,460


1318
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:01,260


1319
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,680


1320
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,310


1321
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,850


1322
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,850


1323
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,520


1324
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,400


1325
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,070


1326
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,410


1327
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,250
Yes! I learned my back handspring.

1328
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:41,300


1329
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,510


1330
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,560


1331
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,230


1332
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,310


1333
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,400
Ava!

1334
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,650


1335
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,400
No!

1336
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,820


1337
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,080


1338
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,250


1339
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,590


1340
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,730


1341
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,950
I don't know where to start.

1342
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,090
But this isn't my world?

1343
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:06,630
As much as I want it to be.

1344
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,180
It isn't mine.

1345
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:19,810
It's yours.

1346
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:22,780
Ava...

1347
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,240
you're not losing your mind, I promise.

1348
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:30,990
There's no other way to say this.

1349
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I'm you.

1350
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,040
I have to be quick.

1351
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,300
Attached to this message,
are detailed construction

1352
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,800
and operation plans
for the Shepard Accelerator.

1353
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,720
I'm praying it helps your planet.

1354
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:50,430
I have the same hope for mine.

1355
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:55,810
I need to say two things

1356
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,940
that won't make sense to you.

1357
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,520
But please, hear me...

1358
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:03,940
and understand how important
these both are.

1359
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,320
First...

1360
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,700
if you've installed a power cell
at the house...

1361
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,660
take it out, now.

1362
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,160
It's wrong, and it's dangerous...

1363
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,370
and if these plans work,

1364
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,380
you won't need to siphon power anyway.

1365
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:24,920
And two...

1366
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,720
Whatever you're doing right now...

1367
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,510
whatever meeting you're in

1368
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,760
or wherever you're going, stop.

1369
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,310
Go to your husband and your children...

1370
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,020
right now.

1371
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:45,110
Go to them...

1372
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:46,980
and hold them.

1373
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:51,160
Hold them for as long as you can.

1374
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,160
Kiss them and love them,

1375
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,330
and know how blessed you are...

1376
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,000
to have them in your life.

1377
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:03,670
That's all there is.

1378
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,380
That's all there is.

1379
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,220


1380
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:25,570


1381
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:29,820


1382
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:38,450
Three... two... one...

1383
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:39,910
mark.

1384
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:43,830


1385
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,510


1386
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,630


1387
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,220


1388
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:00,980


1389
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,300
Cloverfield, do you copy?

1390
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:22,460
Huntsville, this is Hamilton.
Can you hear us?

1391
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:24,350
Where have you guys been?

1392
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,380
That's something of a conversation.

1393
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,060
We can explain later. Listen...

1394
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,550
I'd rush an emergency team
up here for repairs.

1395
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:34,260
Schmidt and I are all that's left.

1396
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,010


1397
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:40,350
Huntsville?

1398
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,730
What did you do up there?

1399
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,350
What's going on with the Shepard?

1400
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,150
Stand by.

1401
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,540


1402
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:16,130


1403
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:27,690


1404
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:30,480
We have a stable beam.

1405
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:35,240


1406
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,530
The Shepard...

1407
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,700
is working.

1408
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,660


1409
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,690


1410
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,020
Michael, we got them.

1411
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,110
You did? You found them?

1412
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,650
Ava, the station.

1413
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:17,780
We made contact.

1414
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,360


1415
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:25,300
She can't wait to see you.

1416
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:26,370
She's coming back.

1417
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:28,040
You're having her come back to Earth?

1418
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,040
Do they know what's happening here?

1419
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,420
No, there wasn't time.

1420
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:32,750
We lost contact.

1421
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,240
Listen, just get to the
Delaware coast.

1422
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,590
She splashes down at 4:30.

1423
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,240
- Have you lost your mind?
- The station's been through hell.

1424
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,980
You're having her come back
to these things?

1425
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,560
There's nothing we can do.

1426
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,930
They couldn't stay up there.

1427
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,440


1428
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,250
Michael, there wasn't a choice.

1429
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:57,070
There is a choice!
Tell them not to come back!

1430
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:59,990
- You have to listen to me.
- Tell them not to come back!

1431
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,860
Tell them not to come back!

1432
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:04,240
You hear me?
Tell them not to come back!

1433
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:06,910


1434
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,880


1435
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:25,050


1436
01:36:25,074 --> 01:36:31,074
