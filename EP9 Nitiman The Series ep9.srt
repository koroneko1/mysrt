(Previously)
You can tell me about it.

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,160
Do you feel embarrassed because
you're dating me?

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,340
I don't know.

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,940
I don't like the way they stare at us.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,780
I'm at a loss.

24

Jin, do you want to join us?

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,020
We lack one team member.

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,580
No, Jin is joining my team.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,980
Jin, you need to join my team.

28
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,370
We belong to the same faculty, you know?

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,420
Cut! Why are you being so shy?

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,500
Did you memorise the script or not?

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,180
If you aren't ready for this,
you should tell us earlier.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,950
That way, we don't need to
waste our time on you.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,450
We can have a one-on-one practice later.
Maybe you'll get better.

Hello?

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,950
Jin, what do you mean by the
profile picture that you've just posted?

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,250
Hey, calm down.

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,540
What's with the two of you?

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,140
There's nothing between us.

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,140
That's just a picture
to promote our drama.

41
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,700
Do you need to have body contact
with him in order to do so?

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,300
Yeah, but I didn't have
any body contact with Mark.

43
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,950
You shouldn't overthink it.

44
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,140
How could I not overthink it?

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,300
Look at the picture you just posted.

46
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,620
Hey, Bbomb, don't overthink it.

47
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,900
I'll talk to you
when I get back to the dorm.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,860
The drama will end by tomorrow.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,620
But I want it to end by now.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,300
Jin! Yin is calling for us.

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,300
Let's go.

52
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,330
I'll hang up now.

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,700
(Non-Stop)

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,200
(Penn: I've reached my dorm.)

55
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,140
Each of us has three chances.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,780
The loser will
treat the winner to a meal.

57
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,020
Fine.

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,000
Come.

59
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,700
Jay.

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,790
What is it? Out with it.

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,620
I think we should change this part
to this. What do you think?

62
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,580
That's fine.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,460
We'll follow your suggestion.
I think it's pretty good.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,460
But, I think

65
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,980
this part should be like this.

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,620
Let me try it.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,340
I think we play a F chord here.

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,220
A G minor chord.

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,940
And A minor chord.

70
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,340
Oh, sorry.

71
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,780
Help me put the strap on.

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,980
You're so troublesome.

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,780
You won't be able to live without me.

74
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,250
Come, let's continue.

75
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,580
You're the best.

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,260
What are you doing?

77
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Do it again? This part.

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,820
G minor.

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,700
A minor.

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,660
And C.

81
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,260
Do that for this part.

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,220
Only then, it can become
the highlight of our song.

83
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

84
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,250
This part will be the most unique part
of the song.

85
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,340
Som Som,

86
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,100
can I sit beside you?

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,870
Sure.

88
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,100
Here you go.

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh, I forgot about it.

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,660
It's part of my treasured collection.

91
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,940
Yeah.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,820
What do you want?

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,820
- You must order something.
- I...

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,790
I'll have the same one as hers.

95
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,460
Alright.

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Wait a moment.

97
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,860
Do you like her?

98
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,140
Do you want me to
get her number for you?

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,180
I can smell your sourness.

100
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,450
Keam, do you want to
swap your rice with mine?

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
What rice did you receive?

102
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,370
Oh, Bbomb, I can't take
spicy food either.

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,820
- What's wrong?
- Senior, I can't take spicy food.

104
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,820
Do you have other food available?

105
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,750
We've already given all of them away.
Can you eat this for now?

106
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,080
But, I really can't take any spicy food.

107
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,340
Juniors, is there anyone who's willing
to swap your rice with him?

108
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,300
He can't take spicy food.

109
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,080
Senior, I'm okay with it.

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,250
Thank you.

111
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,830
I want my spoon.

112
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,140
Here you go.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,020
Thank you so much.

114
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,630
You did great. Hurry and
look for your girlfriend.

115
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,300
Yes, sir!

116
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,260
Sawedee! Where are you?

117
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,580
- Tanapoong!
- Sawedee!

118
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm over here!

119
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,920
How do you feel?

120
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,100
I'm fine!

121
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
I missed you!

122
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,940
I missed you as well!

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,460
Over there.

124
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,380
Jin!

125
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,550
My child, you did great.

126
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,900
You were so cool.

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,020
I'm not a child anymore.

128
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,100
Do you have a crush on the female lead?

129
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,580
It's just a show.

130
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,380
Is that so?

131
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,580
Yeah.

132
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,860
You looked like you've changed a lot.

133
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,260
Mum, is that true?

134
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,020
Are you hiding any secret from me?

135
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,580
No.

136
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,340
Not even one secret?

137
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,460
Nothing at all.

138
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,100
You can tell me in private.

139
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,100
Okay?

140
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,020
Come, let's take a group photo.

141
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,940
Hurry, Bbomb. Help us take a picture.

142
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,660
Come, let's take the photo together.

143
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,540
It's fine. I'll take the picture
for you guys.

144
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,660
Really?

145
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,580
Thank you for that.

146
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,420
You're welcome.

147
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,940
Are you tired? You're the best!
You were super cool!

148
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,060
Come, let's take a picture.

149
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,100
One, two, three.

150
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,540
Let's take another shot.

151
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,300
You guys should be closer this time.

152
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,700
One, two, three.

153
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,660
Alright.

154
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,220
Yeah!

155
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,260
- How was it?
- Thank you.

156
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,900
Wen!

157
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,340
It's our turn to perform!

158
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,780
Alright, I'll be there immediately.

159
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,500
Aunty, sisters, I'll make a move first.

160
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,820
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

161
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,940
Ji, Jin, let's leave as well.
We don't want to be late for our flight.

162
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,980
Mum, you're right.

163
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,900
We'll make our move now. Goodbye.

164
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
My child, you did great.
See you next time.

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,420
- Do your best, okay?
- See you next time, Mum.

166
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,500
Goodbye.

167
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,540
Give us a hug.

168
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,660
Goodbye.

169
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,020
- I'll miss you.
- Do your best, okay?

170
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,100
I will.

171
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,670
Go now. Goodbye.

172
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,860
Did you sleep in your dorm last night?

173
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,060
Yeah.

174
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,590
I had an exam this morning.

175
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,090
What did you and my mother talk about?

176
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,550
Nothing much.

177
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,500
I saw you chatting with her just now.

178
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,380
She said I was handsome. She wants me
to be her son-in-law.

179
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,700
After that, I asked her about the dowry.

180
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
With this IQ of yours, I'm afraid
you couldn't afford it.

181
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,860
She said I don't need to
give her any dowry.

182
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,710
Hello, everyone.

183
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,630
I'm Song. This is my best friend, Jay.

184
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,980
I believe everyone here
knows who we are.

185
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,180
Yes, but today is a special occasion

186
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,980
because we're going to perform
the ending song for the drama.

187
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,260
Now, Tong will take over the stage.

188
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,660
Here you go.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,860
Is this for me?

190
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,020
Yeah.

191
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,260
You're giving me a toy cow.
Are you trying to insult me?

192
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,140
What about your comments for me then?

Yeah, I got it.

217
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,100
I was just afraid you might be shaken.

218
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,740
Don't you trust me at all?

219
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,900
Lend me your phone.

220
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,540
What's your password?

221
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,380

222
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,420
Is that your birthday?

223
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,660
It's the first day I met you.

224
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,500
(Set it as wallpaper)

225
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,290
Why did you like me in the first place?

226
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,680
To me, there's no
particular reason.

227
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,060
Maybe you've already forgotten about
that day.

228
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,710
But I've never forgotten about that day.

229
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,220
Juniors, is there anyone who's willing
to swap your rice with him?

230
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,180
He can't take spicy food.

231
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,380
Excuse me.

232
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
Hey, Jin.

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
How are you doing?

234
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm doing pretty good.

235
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,620
By the way, Jin, do you know
how to get to the concert hall?

236
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,080
Go straight and turn left.

237
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,130
Oh, thanks. Let's have a chat
when both of us are free.

238
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,500
Goodbye.

239
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,340
Is he your friend?

240
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,960
Yeah, we got to know each other
during a football match.

241
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,820
Bbomb, aren't you worried that you might
be making a wrong decision?

242
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,340
I mean, your decision in courting me.

243
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,140
I don't know about the future,

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
and I don't care about it as well.

245
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,670
What about you? Why are you
willing to date me?

246
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,420
Maybe it's because you're rich.
It's like I'm dating a sponsor.

247
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,130
Excuse me, senior.

248
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,080
Can I take a picture with you?

249
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,660
Sure.

250
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,420
Are you here to watch my performance?

251
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,880
Yes. I wanted to take a picture
with you as well.

252
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,340
One, two, three.

253
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,300
Senior, are you two a couple?

254
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm sorry and thank you.

255
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,590

I still remember the Pad Kra Pao.

307
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,580

You should stop eating.

What are you guys doing? Give it to me.

312
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,300
I'll put this on the grill now.

313
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,200
U, give me some of it.

314
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm going to go home.

315

320
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,310
Bring me out for lunch.

321
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,330
Alright, I'll pick you up later.

322
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,570
Very good.

323
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,450
Hey, Bbomb. Where are you going?

324
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,610
I'm going to look for Jin.

325
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,240
We became single dogs all of a sudden.

326
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,550
Sorry about that. I'll make a move now.

Show me your paw.

328
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,620
Don't you Bbomb is treating Jin
too nicely?

329
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,610
I'm sure they're dating each other.

330
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,750
Hey, stop pretending.

331

Cook it for me.

332

I haven't had one piece of meat yet
even though I've been cooking them.

333

337
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,360
Stir-fried dishes, soup, rice bowls,
porridge, or beef steak?

338
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,360
I want to have something with soup.

339
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,490
How about some rotating hotpot?

340

Are you footing the bill?

341
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,680
Yeah.

342
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
It's fine. It's not that far away.

343

Come here.

344
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,740
Get on.

345
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,320
Are you that hungry?

346
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,360
Yeah.

347
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,500
I need to use the washroom.

348
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,240
Okay.

356

Oh, I guess you had a comfortable ride.

357
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,740

That was difficult.

364
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,350
Yeah, I don't understand them at all.
There are too many of them.

365
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,400
Do you guys believe this? I'll forget
about it once I leave the library.

You guys didn't focus
during our classes.

And now, you want me to teach you.
I'm the one who's exhausted, you know?

I just took a small sip.

Are you sure it was a small sip?

Bottoms up.

410

some fruit juice with your buddies?

Bottoms up.

412

413
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,150
Easy? My foot. You were
biting your pen during the exam.

Come, let us give a toast to our gang.

423

Jin, what's wrong?

425
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,360
Nothing. I just feel like it's been a
long time since I've seen you guys.

426
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,570
You only realised that by now?

428

Jin, I understand you.

430

when he's drinking?

drink with our friends. Cheers.

Go.

444

445

The fried intestines here are amazing.
They're so chewy.

450

Can't you just let him spend some time
with his buddies?

456

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,995
Do you still remember the day
when we went to the pub together?

491
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:41,806
Hey, he's here!

492
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:43,461
Guys, I need to make a move first.

493
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:44,126
What?

494
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,294
Jin is drunk. I need to pick him up.

495
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,907
Wait.

496
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,040
Finish your last drink

497
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:50,240
before you leave.

498
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,292
Yeah.

499
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,991
Cheers.

500
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:56,590
Cheers.

501
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,780
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

502
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:02,484
Yeah, what about that?

503
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:07,162
After you went back to
the dorm with Jin,

504
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:09,160
did you feel...

505
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:16,151
I mean, did you feel
a special sensation?

506
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,903
I don't know. I felt ordinary.

507
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:22,968
Is that so?

508
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,210
Didn't you feel a tingling sensation?

509
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:29,844
No.

510
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:38,690
What are you doing?

511
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:42,349
Don't do this.

512
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:02,543
Jin,

513
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,252
don't move.

514
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,940
You'll touch it.

515
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:21,566
Are you guys hiding anything from me?

516
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:22,880
No.

517
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,722
I was just asking.

518
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,389
You were drunk back then. I thought

519
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:34,387
you tried to make Jin yours.

520
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:37,237
That's not true.

521
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Aren't you guys being too much?

522
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:02,400
Will we be okay?

523
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:03,873
Will you be okay?

524
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:04,896
I guess so.

525
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:05,684
What about you?

526
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:07,528
No problem.

527
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:11,023
Guys, I'll go and look for Jin.

528
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:14,320
Alright.

529
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,300
(Jin)

530
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,795
So, did our plan fail?

531
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:29,911
I think so.

532
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:34,113
I'm sure Aim will tell me off.

533
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,110
It's scary when I think about it.

534
00:44:36,694 --> 00:44:37,960
Don't overthink it.
I'm sure she won't do so.

535
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:38,821
Do you want her to tell you off then?

536
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:40,105
No thanks.

537
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:42,610
How's the progress?

538
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,894
Aim! I'm sorry!

539
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,692
I didn't mean it!
I've already done my best!

540
00:44:45,722 --> 00:44:46,955
But Bbomb did nothing at all!

541
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,277
- I'm sorry! I didn't know anything!
- Song!

542
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,715
I'm starving.

543
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:02,134
Do you want to join us for lunch?

544
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:03,882
I'll treat you to lunch. Come on.

545
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,248
No thanks, I'm going to look for Jin.

546
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:10,880
That's great! You should leave first.
Good luck.

547
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,008
Yeah, good luck.

548
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,920
- Go now.
- Go now.

549
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,511
Goodbye!

550
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:21,170
Stupid Song! It's your fault again.
You rat us out every time.

551
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:21,894
I'm sorry!

552
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,503
Beg me.

553
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:23,877
I'm sorry!

554
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:24,686
I'm sorry!

555
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,633
Kneel down.

556
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:27,642
Beg me!

557
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:28,446
Kneel down immediately!

558
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:32,210
I'm kneeling!

559
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:37,000
Let's go! You need to
treat me to a meal.

560
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,334
Oh, I thought it was someone else.

561
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,854
Come to the middle lane.

562
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:53,364
I'll go to another lane.

563
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:58,090
Jin, Jack, come and help me out
in the middle lane!

564
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:02,981
I'm dead!

565
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:07,225
Bbomb, look. It's because you poked me.

566
00:46:07,452 --> 00:46:08,063
I'm dead because of you.

567
00:46:09,195 --> 00:46:10,648
Why are you blaming him
when you're lousy at the game?

568
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:11,810
Jack!

569
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:15,242
I quit.

570
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,372
Top!

571
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:18,762
They're gone.

572
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,960
Singh, what are you doing?
Come and help us out!

573
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,945
I'll farm the jungle creeps for now.

574
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:26,669
I'm dead.

575
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,391
I'm dead as well.

576
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:31,448
I quit.

577
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:32,770
Let's have lunch.

578
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:34,206
I'm starving.

579
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:38,311
How about the mall beside our school?
We should get something simple.

580
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,848
Yeah, let's go.

581
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:42,155
Can you ride your bike?

582
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:43,490
Fine, I'll ride my bike.

583
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:46,905
Why don't you drive my car then?

584
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:47,680
Sure.

585
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:49,680
Let's go.

586
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,900
(This is an emergency meeting! See you
in the activity room this afternoon.)

587
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:07,414
Keam,

588
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:09,242
will you go home for the holiday?

589
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,494
No, since no one's home anyway.

590
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:15,903
By the way, Bbomb,

591
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,155
you should return to your dorm
after lunch.

592
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:19,313
But why?

593
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,905
Our drama club has
a drinking session later.

594
00:47:24,395 --> 00:47:25,343
For what reason?

595
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:27,814
To celebrate the end of our drama.

596
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,812
Jin, I'll leave first.

597
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:31,953
See you later.

598
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:39,500
Only my friends and
some of the drama casts

599
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:40,732
will attend the session.

600
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:45,343
Fine then.

601
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:46,951
I'll pick you up later.

602
00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:49,865
Suit yourself.

603
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,814
Remember to pick up my call.

604
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:53,570
Alright.

605
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,020
(1:00)

606
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,296
(You have reached the voicemail of...)

607
00:48:58,732 --> 00:48:59,797
Here's your change, 40 baht.

608
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:01,381
Please check your change.

609
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,000
Do you need a straw?

610
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,208
No thanks.

611
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,210
Thank you.

612
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:13,050
Hey, Bbomb. Are you here
to buy something?

613
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:13,670
Yeah.

614
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:17,500
Tonight will be a long night. That's why
I'm buying some food.

615
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,550
What about you? Is the gathering over?

616
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:24,623
The gathering has been over
for a while now.

617
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,071
What's wrong?

618
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:28,517
Jin hasn't returned to his dorm yet?

619
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:31,528
Yeah.

620
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:37,692
I don't know what's the situation
between both of you,

621
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,122
but brother, listen to my advice.

622
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:42,120
Never trust Jin entirely.

623
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:43,511
Understood?

624
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:46,290
Do you understand?

625
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:51,130
Yeah, I'll make a move now.
I need to study.

626
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:51,814
Goodbye.

627
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:54,366
Hello, what do you need?

628
00:49:54,842 --> 00:49:55,557
The usual.

629
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:57,031
The usual? What do you mean?

630
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,976
One sausage.

631
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:00,437
One sausage?

632
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,056
Yes.

633
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:03,090
Choi!

634
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:04,673
Choi!

635
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:06,585
One sausage.

636
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:08,972
Yes, brother.

637
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,371
(Jin)

638
00:50:46,707 --> 00:50:49,130
Bbomb, pick me up later.

639
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:50,581
Hey, you...

640
00:50:58,888 --> 00:50:59,511
Goodbye, Senior.

641
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:00,669
Goodbye.

642
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:17,936
Why didn't you pick up my call?

643
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,913
My battery was flat.

644
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:23,322
Don't your friends have any
batteries to spare?

645
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,473
I told you my battery was flat.
What else do you want me to do?

646
00:51:29,284 --> 00:51:30,345
Why didn't you return with
your friends then?

647
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:33,806
Because Mark told me to accompany him.

648
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:35,688
You knew I can't reject him.

649
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:37,604
You can't reject him, huh?

650
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,046
So, you'll say yes

651
00:51:40,736 --> 00:51:41,608
even if he wants to date you, right?

652
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:46,248
You always try to correct my mistakes.

653
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:48,766
You never trusted me.

654
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:52,176
Have you ever trusted me then?

655
00:51:53,162 --> 00:51:54,555
You aren't willing to tell anyone
about our relationship at all!

656
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:56,122
Because of what?

657
00:51:57,557 --> 00:51:59,002
It's because you can continue to
flirt with other people!

658
