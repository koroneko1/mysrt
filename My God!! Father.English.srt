1
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,750
Welcome to today's race.

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,541
This circuit has a length
of 4.5 kilometers

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,208
and a total of 12 turns.

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,541
Everyone has a chance to win,

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,750
but if nothing goes wrong,

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,416
keep your eye on car number seven.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,625
Let's see if he'll finally win
the championship

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,041
after a long and competitive season.

9
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,083
And it's the final lap.

10
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,375
Number eight shoots ahead from the curve.

11
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,416
Can car number three block him?

12
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,458
What a tight race.

13
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,375
Look at that.
Number three missed that right turn.

14
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
Number seven overtakes him
from the right side

15
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,791
in the last 50 meters of the race.

16
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,791
That's the flag.

17
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,916
That's awesome! How incredible!

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,750
The winner is Got Kiattipoom.

19
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,791
He's the champion
of Thailand Super Turbo 2020.

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,000
Who would you like to thank
for your success today?

21
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,375
First of all, I have to thank my crew.

22
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,666
They're the real heroes.

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,625
And of course, I want to thank…

24
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,041
my parents

25
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:05,208
for always supporting me
and doing everything for me.

26
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,916
Are they here today?

27
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,458
My parents…

28
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,958
They are watching me from heaven.

29
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,583
All right then. Thank you.

30
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,916
Hey.

31
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,791
Congratulations.

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:58,375
It's incredible that you've come
this far with Hot Rod.

33
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,708
Hot Rod?

34
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,791
I've told you a thousand times
that my car is called King of the World.

35
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,541
Why King of the World?

36
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,041
It's the ruler of the blue planet
in the Solar System.

37
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,625
That's too long. Hot Rod is way better.

38
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,166
No, it's not.

39
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,166
It's an obscene joke for obscene people.

40
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,958
If you had known I'd get here,

41
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,916
would you have stopped me
from racing when I was a kid?

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,166
Your mom told me to look after you.

43
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,500
Car racing is dangerous.

44
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,500
Not every racer can win a championship.

45
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,583
Is that right?

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
Mom shouldn't have asked you
to do anything.

47
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,958
If you hadn't gone to prison,
she wouldn't have killed herself.

48
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,958
You're going too fast.

49
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,875
People say that
in the seconds before you die,

50
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,625
your whole life will flash
before your eyes.

51
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:10,333
Is that true? How can that be?

52
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,333
I don't see anything. Am I not dying?

53
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,666
Hey. Wait a second. Hang on.

54
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,250
No. I don't want any flashbacks.

55
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,583
Put these away, Got.

56
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,833
-You need to make him study hard.
-Your grades are shit.

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,375
Help me.

58
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,916
Where are you going, Got? You punk.

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
Troublemaker!

60
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,458
If you want to be
a race car driver, call me.

61
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,333
Do you have a problem?

62
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,541
Dad.

63
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,208
Dad.

64
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,666
Dad.

65
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,875
Didn't he die with me?

66
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,416
Out of my way! Watch where you're going.

67
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,125
Thank you.

68
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,541
Thank you.

69
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,125
Miss…

70
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
Are you Ms. Somsong?

71
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,125
It's really you. I'm Kiattipoom.

72
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,166
You were my teacher in sixth grade.

73
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,375
You showed my report card to my dad

74
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,333
and he kicked my ass in front of you.

75
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,625
It must have been around 2010
if I remember correctly.

76
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,166
Are you nuts? 2010?

77
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,000
We're in the year 1998.

78
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,041
-What?
-Get out of here.

79
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,500
Ms. Somsong.

80
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,791
It's Got.

81
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,250
I'm Kiattipoom.

82
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,958
What the hell?

83
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,916
Do you have a death wish?
Watch where you're going.

84
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,500
He stole my purse! Help!

85
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,500
Hey.

86
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
I'm already dead.

87
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,166
I can do anything.

88
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,041
Watch out!

89
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,833
What the hell is that?

90
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,041
You rock, dude.

91
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,125
I'll take it from here.

92
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
That's not fair.

93
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
You're a real badass.

94
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,291
You're awesome.

95
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,916
Let me go.

96
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,541
Dad?

97
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,625
Who's your dad?

98
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,041
-Dad.
-Dad, my ass!

99
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,750
You're still alive.

100
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,666
What?

101
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,750
Hey. Wait.

102
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,958
This is the police.

103
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,000
-Hands up! Don't move!
-All right.

104
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
What's going on? What the hell is this?

105
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,458
It doesn't look like an official ID card.

106
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,708
I already told you everything.

107
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,083
Stop wasting our time.

108
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,291
Tell us the truth,

109
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,791
or I'll add another charge
to your crimes besides perjury.

110
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,791
You'll also be charged with forgery.

111
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,333
When is your birthday?

112
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,125
Next year.

113
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,750
You have the right to remain silent,
but not the right to be a pain in the ass.

114
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,541
What the hell?

115
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,958
I didn't do anything wrong.

116
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,041
For God's sake.

117
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,958
If you don't want to go to jail,

118
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,166
you must get someone
to confirm your identity.

119
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,375
-Take that.
-Damn.

120
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,416
Boss, you suck. You're a wimp.

121
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,375
Come here.

122
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,791
Anyone can insult me

123
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,500
except you, Bo.

124
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,541
Come on.

125
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,375
Boss, why did you hit me?

126
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,875
-You drew on my face, punk.
-It's the police, Prem.

127
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,791
The police are here. I'm out of here!

128
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,875
Who's that monkey?

129
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,583
That's Lham's son, Bo.

130
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,375
And who are you?

131
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,208
I'm Bae.

132
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,458
My dad owns a clock
near the eyewear tower.

133
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,250
I mean, he owns an eyewear store
near the clock tower.

134
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,000
This doesn't concern you.

135
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,458
Is this thug your brother?

136
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,500
I'll be damned! It's my little brother!

137
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:34,125
Damn! Long time no see.
I almost didn't recognize you.

138
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,625
He said it's been a week.

139
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,875
We're tight. One week feels like forever.

140
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,458
That's right. I miss him
after not seeing him for a day.

141
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,750
Two days is excruciating.

142
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,791
I barely remember his face
after three days.

143
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,833
Right, brother?

144
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,875
Who's your dad?

145
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,166
-Somchai
-Sommai.

146
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,208
-You're lying.
-Hey!

147
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,625
We're half-brothers.

148
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,750
You two kind of look alike,

149
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,166
but I won't believe it

150
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,250
unless you can show me proof
that you're really brothers.

151
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,750
I'll tell you what.
You can go look under my bed upstairs.

152
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,666
Crawl under the bed and look up.

153
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,541
You'll see a wad of cash taped underneath.

154
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,958
-Lieutenant Tu.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,208
-Hey!
-Deputy.

156
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,208
I found nothing, sir.

157
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,833
This means…

158
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,833
You asshole! I hid my money there.

159
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,791
Did you dare steal it?

160
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,250
What money? What are you talking about?

161
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,958
Come on. You'd better come clean.

162
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,750
Get over here.

163
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,625
Come here.

164
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,375
I had to do it
or they wouldn't believe me.

165
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,958
You didn't have to punch me so hard.

166
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,916
What's your name?

167
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,166
-I'm Got.
-Got?

168
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,125
Like a Tamagotchi?

169
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,208
What was your dad thinking,
giving you such a silly name?

170
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,458
It's just Got.

171
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
Did he name you

172
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,583
after the monster Godzilla?

173
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,833
Hey, Godzilla.

174
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,958
Godzilla.

175
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,791
Stop it. You watch too many cartoons.

176
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,416
What kind of name is Got?

177
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,125
It's so kooky.

178
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,375
"Kooky"? No one uses that word anymore.

179
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,416
What are you doing?

180
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,583
It's for your bruises.

181
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,625
Stop it.

182
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,750
If Dad is this young,
Mom must still be alive.

183
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,833
This means I can finally meet her.

184
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,333
-Do you have a girl, sir?
-What the hell?

185
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,041
Why are you being so formal?
Are you a snob?

186
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,375
We are chums now, okay?

187
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,625
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

188
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,583
No.

189
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,041
It's not appropriate.

190
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,166
What's your girlfriend's name?

191
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
What's the matter with you?

192
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,291
You haven't asked me my name,
but you want to know hers.

193
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,833
Don't tell me you're hanging around here
because you want to steal my girl.

194
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,875
Are you nuts? Who would do that?

195
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,416
Your name is Prem.

196
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,083
I already know, so I didn't ask.

197
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,500
Listen.

198
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,291
Do you want to join my gang?

199
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,541
What gang?

200
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,708
Gangly and lanky?

201
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,666
Hot Rod Gang.

202
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,916
Why does that sound familiar?

203
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey. Do you know what hot rod means?

204
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,958
Of course. That's why I call my gang that.

205
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,125
Before you can join Hot Rod,
you need to pass a test.

206
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,166
Do you see that guy with a gun?

207
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,583
That's Neung. He works
for a mob boss in Bangkok.

208
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,916
He runs a used car tent

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,750
as a cover for his loan shark ring.

210
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,125
How did you know all this?

211
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,375
Through my girlfriend.

212
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,750
She mortgaged
her dad's karaoke bar with him.

213
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,250
I actually hit the target.

214
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,583
Shit.

215
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,833
He's practicing shooting.

216
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
This isn't a good hiding place.

217
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,916
Got.

218
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,875
Come have dinner
at my girlfriend's place tonight.

219
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,583
Can I come too, boss?

220
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,666
No.

221
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,041
Why not? Please let me come.

222
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,333
There aren't enough seats.

223
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,875
This is an old house.
It looks exactly the same.

224
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,333
An old house is supposed to look the same.

225
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:44,791
Otherwise, it would be a new house.
What a stupid thing to say.

226
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,625
Hey. Why do you seem so excited?

227
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,291
I want to know what's for dinner.
I'm hungry.

228
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,416
The fish is ready.

229
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,958
-It's coming out now.
-Okay.

230
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,291
Holy shit!

231
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,041
Are you Mom or Grandma?

232
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,750
I'm not your mom.

233
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,875
-I'll smack you with this.
-Take it easy, Mrs. Toy.

234
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,166
This guy is a loose cannon.
Don't mind him.

235
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,458
Sorry to keep you waiting.

236
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,583
I'll head out to the market.

237
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,333
Won't you have dinner with us?

238
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,583
No. I'm not in the mood.

239
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,416
This is Got, our new gang member.

240
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,208
This is Bew, my girlfriend.

241
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,333
-Oi!
-What?

242
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,750
-She's my girlfriend.
-Okay.

243
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,958
Wait a minute. Her name is Bew.

244
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,791
-Give me lots of it.
-Okay.

245
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,333
Hang on. What's your real name
and last name?

246
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,708
Well, I used to be a fortuneteller.

247
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,708
I can tell things from your name.

248
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,625
Really? Do mine. My name is Prem--

249
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,416
No. I only do girls' names.

250
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,291
I'm not good with guys' names.

251
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,708
So, what's your real name?

252
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm Pranee Cheevakul.

253
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,458
Damn it. She's not my mother.

254
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,166
No way. It can't be. This can't be right.

255
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,458
How long have you been together?
Is it serious?

256
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:09,375
Well, we're planning
on getting married soon.

257
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,041
-You can't!
-What the hell, man?

258
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:19,541
I mean, you can't do that
because you shouldn't rush into marriage.

259
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,416
We've only been together for 12 years.

260
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,250
Shit. They are serious.

261
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,166
I would never be born.

262
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,833
You should eat more.

263
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,666
-Stop it.
-What's your problem?

264
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,333
Just eat your food. She can help herself.

265
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,666
-Have more veggies.
-No.

266
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,166
Just eat your food.

267
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,791
Do you need a hand?

268
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,208
No.

269
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:11,916
Bew.

270
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,291
Do you like movies?

271
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes.

272
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,875
If you're free at 7 p.m. tomorrow,

273
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,083
shall we go to the movies?

274
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,333
Shall we?

275
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,125
Okay. The bar's closed tomorrow.

276
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,083
Why are you smiling?

277
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,958
It's nothing.
I'm just helping Bew with the dishes.

278
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,708
All right.

279
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,500
Bew, I'll take off now if you don't mind.

280
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,500
Okay.

281
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,250
-See you.
-See you.

282
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,208
See who?

283
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:48,041
I mean, I'll come see her
with you some time.

284
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,041
Let's go home.

285
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,958
I know Jo gave you this gun
so you can finish your job.

286
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,875
Don't keep him waiting.

287
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,666
I know what I have to do.

288
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,583
I'll take care of it.

289
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,375
Be patient.

290
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:20,333
Should I wait
until you're done screwing this whore?

291
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,500
She's my wife, you prick.

292
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,125
Just get your job done.

293
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,125
You'll be in deep shit
if Jo has to get his hands dirty.

294
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,708
Got it?

295
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,666
Got.

296
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,708
How did my date turn into this?

297
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,833
NEW WORLD RAMA

298
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,458
Bew.

299
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,583
Hey.

300
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,625
-What's that for?
-Sorry.

301
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,750
We should go inside.

302
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,041
You keep hanging out with those thugs.

303
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,583
Pha.

304
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,583
Life is tough
when you're a gangster's wife.

305
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,708
Hey.

306
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,375
Do you know a girl named Naree?

307
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Yes.

308
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,666
She sings that song which goes…

309
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,541
I prostrate myself before--

310
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,583
No.

311
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,083
That's Sunaree.

312
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,833
Didn't you mean her?

313
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,791
Orn.

314
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,625
Yes?

315
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,333
Can you do me a favor?

316
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,000
Can you do something for me first?

317
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:32,958
Of course. I can do anything for you.

318
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,625
Get your head out of the way.

319
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,541
I can't see the leading actor.

320
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,000
Can you do me a favor?

321
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,708
What favor?

322
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,375
Let me join your gang.

323
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,708
Come on.

324
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,166
Got, duck your head.

325
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,708
Take it easy. Calm down, people.

326
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,375
We're just changing the reels.
Can't you wait?

327
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,708
Not if you talk like that.

328
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,666
Then don't! Just get the hell
out of here, but there's no refund!

329
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,791
Stop it! What about you people?

330
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,666
-We'll wait.
-Okay then.

331
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,500
Bo, did you get a lotus for a monk?

332
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,875
Sadhu.

333
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,833
No! It's not for a monk.

334
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,041
It's for Orn.

335
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,541
You're the man!

336
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,291
Most girls get roses,

337
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,458
but he gives his girl a lotus flower.

338
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,458
Now it looks like a rose.

339
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:38,541
Bo, I already have someone I like.

340
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:42,875
Hey.

341
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:43,875
Who is it, Orn?

342
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,041
Tell me. I'll smack his ugly head.

343
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,833
I'd better go.

344
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,125
Orn.

345
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,541
-Let me go.
-Orn.

346
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,583
Don't touch me.

347
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,791
Bo.

348
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:00,000
I think you're trying too hard.

349
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,500
You make Orn uncomfortable.
That's why she left.

350
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,750
Girls like something unpredictable.

351
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,500
They like something like…

352
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,333
this.

353
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,458
Marry me, Bew.

354
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,291
Jesus Christ!

355
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,208
Shit.

356
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,416
What did you say?

357
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,666
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

358
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,125
You know, Bo likes petite girls.

359
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,625
She's exactly his type.

360
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,125
Do you really like her?

361
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,666
-Yes.
-All right. Let's talk business.

362
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,000
Our Hot Rod Gang is…

363
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,833
Hey! Are you even listening to me?

364
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,291
This is serious business.

365
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,333
Our main source of income

366
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,583
is from the protection racket money
from businesses in the area.

367
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,000
Mister, you need to pay
the protection racket.

368
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,791
One basil fried rice costs 25 baht.
You ordered three.

369
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,791
That's ten baht.

370
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,625
-Pay up then.
-You pay me, asshole.

371
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:22,000
Another source of our income
is from girls.

372
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,125
Are you the matron here?

373
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,250
Why not? My dad owns this place.

374
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,750
These girls grew up in this neighborhood.

375
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,375
This is where they can make a living.

376
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,750
Hey. You're the new member of our gang.

377
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,375
You can pick any chick you like.

378
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,625
There are too many of them.
I can't decide.

379
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,208
Are you a chicken?

380
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,166
Never mind. Come on, Bo.

381
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,875
Watch and learn.

382
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,708
I pick…

383
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:04,708
No.

384
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,375
I'm too shy, boss. I can't pick.

385
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:14,375
Hot Rod guys are the top dogs
who help protect these girls.

386
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,708
It just so happened that

387
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,750
I fell in love with the gorgeous matron
who runs this place.

388
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,583
What do you think? Aren't I a genius?

389
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,291
-Cheers!
-Cheers, guys.

390
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,166
I think our gang needs a proper salute.

391
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,166
How about this?

392
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,916
Hot Rod, arise.

393
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Is that cool enough?

394
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,041
-It's cool.
-What?

395
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,541
-It's brilliant.
-Is it?

396
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,083
But it's too simple. Anyone can do it.

397
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,541
Let's do something like…

398
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,958
Get your ass up and do it together.
Come on.

399
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,500
Hot Rod,

400
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:04,125
arise!

401
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,958
-Assemble.
-What?

402
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,416
Lock our legs together.

403
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,708
-Lock your leg with mine.
-Okay. Wait.

404
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,041
-Shit.
-Damn it.

405
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,375
Just untangle our legs.

406
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,291
This place is closed! Get out!

407
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,416
Listen, Bo. When you talk to him,

408
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,291
keep your voice deep to sound formidable.

409
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,791
Boss.

410
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,291
I want your bar.

411
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,625
Come on. We pay interest every month.

412
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,125
What's wrong with your voice?

413
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,458
You'll get kicked.

414
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:49,958
Forget the interest.

415
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,333
I want the bar.

416
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,875
Are you nuts? This is a real business.

417
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,208
We're not playing Monopoly.

418
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,666
You can't just march in here
and take it, asshole.

419
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,916
Of course, I can.

420
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,375
You all probably recognize this.

421
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,250
If you want to see him alive,

422
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,875
sign the bar over to me.

423
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:10,708
Let's go.

424
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,625
Whose glasses are these?

425
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,916
Screw the glasses.

426
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,208
We can't let them insult us
on our own turf.

427
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,083
Boss, watch your foot.

428
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,125
What about his foot?

429
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,500
It's on my hand.

430
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,208
Sorry, Bo.

431
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,458
Why didn't they come for him?

432
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,458
If we had taken Prem's girlfriend,
they would've come running.

433
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,500
You dickhead.

434
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,916
Mark my words.

435
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,125
I do not hurt girls.

436
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,833
Can't we find a better bait
than this wimp?

437
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,458
This is so rad.

438
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,958
Where did you get it?

439
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,750
I went to the mall yesterday.

440
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,750
They were setting up
a sticker-photo booth,

441
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,958
so I gave it a try.

442
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,000
This is it. This is the future.

443
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,958
Just imagine.

444
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,833
Teenagers love taking pictures.

445
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:14,708
We'll put a bunch of these photo booths
where kids like to hang out.

446
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,041
Can you imagine that, Got?

447
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,500
We're going to be rich.

448
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:26,666
You're always so sure of your ideas.
It's why we were so poor when I was a kid.

449
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,083
Bo, you jackass.

450
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,458
What's that for?

451
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:33,833
What are you doing
putting these stickers on my bike?

452
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,458
You made a mess of it.

453
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,750
Get them off.

454
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,625
Yes, boss. I'll just put them on my bike.

455
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,208
We don't need that wimp
now that we have this guy.

456
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,375
I see. Do you all work for Nueng?

457
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,416
Shut your mouth, asshole.

458
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,666
Hey, Got. What's up?

459
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,500
Nueng and his men took Bae.

460
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,958
They tried to take me too, but I got away.

461
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,875
Do they want to test me?

462
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,833
No. You sit tight. I'll drive.

463
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,125
Move it. Come on.

464
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,166
Again, Lieutenant?

465
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,958
-Sir, watch out!
-Lieutenant!

466
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,125
Move it. Stop!

467
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,625
Come on, Lieutenant Tu. Hurry.

468
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,041
Wow! You were like superheroes.

469
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:50,416
Then how come you look so beat up?

470
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,291
I made up a few details.

471
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,916
But remember this, Bo.

472
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,750
Every dog has its day.

473
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,416
I'll get my revenge next time.

474
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,875
Come here.

475
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,416
-No.
-I haven't even touched you.

476
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,208
This will hurt.

477
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,250
I don't mind getting hurt from this.

478
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,375
Sweet Jesus.

479
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,500
You're acting weird, Got.

480
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,500
No, I'm not.

481
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,666
It's nothing.

482
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,458
Don't believe everything Prem says.

483
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,333
You know he likes to brag.

484
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,333
-Come on, Bew.
-She's right.

485
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,708
Even Bo was onto him.

486
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,708
I have to go.

487
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,500
Wait up, Bew.

488
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,458
Bew.

489
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,708
Have some hot pot with us.

490
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,416
That's right. We're about to eat.

491
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,375
I can't.

492
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,000
I have to close the books.

493
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,333
The girls will complain
if they get paid late.

494
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,416
I feel bad for them.

495
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,625
So, I guess it's just us.

496
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,666
Come on, Bae. Let's prepare the food.

497
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,416
Hey, Got. What really happened?

498
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,583
Do you want to know?

499
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,041
Freeze!

500
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,166
Turn around slowly.
Take your fingers off the trigger.

501
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,083
Don't try to shoot me
or you'll go straight to jail.

502
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,541
Here, Got.

503
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,916
Tell me the truth.

504
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,458
You guys didn't even know
that I was kidnapped, right?

505
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,750
Come on, Bae.

506
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,875
Take this fish tofu. It's my favorite.

507
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,250
Just forget about it.

508
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,666
-Right. Have some pork.
-Eat up.

509
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,458
Seriously, though.

510
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,250
Don't you have anything better to do

511
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,250
than being in this gang?

512
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:41,583
I mean, don't you have dreams
that you want to achieve?

513
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:44,291
Do you have one? Do you?

514
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,000
Tell me.

515
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,625
Of course, I do.

516
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,583
I want to be a godfather.

517
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,750
But my gang…

518
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,583
will only do good things.

519
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,000
I'll help people.

520
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,541
I'll take down the bad guys

521
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,875
and protect the good guys.

522
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,958
I'll be like an action movie hero.

523
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,541
You're delusional.

524
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,583
What about you, Bo?

525
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,791
Me?

526
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:16,208
I want to help my boss
make our gang the greatest.

527
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,833
We'll rule this country together.

528
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,958
That's my man.

529
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,166
-I'm your man, boss.
-Good.

530
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,541
And you? What's your dream?

531
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,166
I want to be a film director.

532
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,625
Come on. Nobody wants to see Thai movies.

533
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,541
Well, some people do.

534
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,250
At least there will be four of us.

535
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,500
Hey, Bae. Cast me in your film.

536
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,833
I'll take Bew to see it.
That's five people.

537
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,291
You bet, boss.

538
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:49,333
What about you, Got?
You're doing all the asking.

539
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,375
What's your dream?

540
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,166
My dream?

541
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,458
I want to be…

542
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,791
I want to be a race car driver.

543
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,166
A race car driver?

544
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,583
That's super cool!

545
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,541
Good for you, man.

546
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,708
A race car driver?

547
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,416
That's good. That's fantastic.

548
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,375
He'll be a race car driver.

549
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,500
But my dad doesn't approve.

550
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,916
He tries to stop me all the time.

551
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,041
What a prick.

552
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,333
What kind of father stands in the way
of his son's dream?

553
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,541
A father should let his son
live his own life.

554
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,833
That's just wrong.

555
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,958
Calm down, boss. He's still Got's dad.

556
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,666
Tell your dad to change his attitude.

557
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,041
Otherwise, I'll go kick his ass.

558
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,333
-You will?
-Definitely.

559
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:43,708
-Let me help.
-Good.

560
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,750
-We'll kick his ass.
-We'll change his mind.

561
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,541
-Shall we go now?
-Hey.

562
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,791
Let's forget about my dad.

563
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,458
Come on.

564
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,375
-Cheers!
-All right!

565
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,416
-Bottoms up!
-Yes!

566
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,333
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

567
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,666
Drink up.

568
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,375
Why do you want to see me?

569
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,916
My TV is broken.

570
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,583
Can you fix it for me?

571
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,583
Can you fix it?

572
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,791
Of course.

573
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,041
Just the TV, right?

574
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:06,875
I see. It must be the CRT.

575
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:21,875
So, do you know where Prem is?

576
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,333
I don't know.

577
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,000
He said he'd be back late tonight.

578
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:34,208
Goodness. It's so muggy today.

579
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,750
Can you do me a favor?

580
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:00,333
Do you want ice cubes?

581
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,625
We don't need ice.

582
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,291
Just use this.

583
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,541
Can you massage me?

584
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,166
Here?

585
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:30,875
You have a unique name.

586
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:36,666
Well, it's Got

587
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,666
as in America's Got Talent.

588
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:42,208
Sort of.

589
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,750
My lousy dad gave me that name.

590
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,291
I've got a lousy dad too.

591
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:50,541
He left me and my mom.

592
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,750
So, I've been using my mom's family name.

593
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,500
Our fathers are assholes.

594
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,000
Right?

595
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,541
If I went by my father's last name,

596
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,958
it would sound awkward.

597
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,416
How?

598
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:15,833
My name would be Pranee Rogers.

599
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:17,750
Rogers?

600
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,000
Are you mixed-race?

601
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,291
Yes.

602
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,833
My dad's an American GI.

603
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,125
Do you know anyone named Nui?

604
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,583
I don't.

605
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,958
But a fortune teller once told me

606
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:41,125
that I should change my nickname to Nui

607
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:45,208
and change my first name
from Pranee to Naree.

608
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:48,750
Pranee to Naree?

609
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,375
That's it.

610
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,375
I don't think I can do this.

611
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,833
Take off your shirt then.

612
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:02,500
No, that's not what I mean.

613
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,708
It's okay, Got. I don't mind.

614
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,625
But I do. I do mind.

615
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,166
-I don't mind.
-Please do.

616
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,291
-It's okay.
-It's not okay. I can't.

617
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,000
-It's okay.
-Please don't do this.

618
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:13,583
You passed the test.

619
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,166
What?

620
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,416
Congratulations.

621
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,583
You're a true friend.

622
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:22,916
This is a test to see
whether I can trust you.

623
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,125
And you did great.

624
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:28,583
You've proven that you can take over
our gang once I'm gone.

625
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:30,750
What?

626
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,916
-Gone?
-Yes.

627
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,291
Gone where?

628
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:38,333
And why me? Bo joined the gang before me.

629
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:39,833
Got.

630
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:43,958
You're a smart guy. Stop acting dumb.

631
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:47,250
Look at Bo. How can I trust
that loser with anything?

632
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,166
Our gang will fall apart.

633
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:52,333
Hey.

634
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,125
Bo.

635
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,208
How did you get in there, Bo?

636
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,208
I came to deliver your stuff.

637
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,916
I didn't see anyone,
so I just walked in here.

638
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,583
Then I heard you and Bew come in.

639
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,083
I didn't want to get chewed out,
so I went to hide in the cupboard.

640
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,666
At least we weren't hiding in the same…

641
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,791
Bo!

642
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,833
Do I mean anything to the gang at all?

643
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:33,875
I know I'm a dimwit.
I don't have cool ideas like you guys.

644
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:40,458
But at least this dimwit is ready
to die for our gang.

645
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:44,083
I may be just a tiny cog in a large wheel,

646
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,041
but Hot Rod Gang…

647
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
is my whole life.

648
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:59,625
One day, I'll prove to you

649
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,166
that you can always rely on me.

650
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,500
Hey. Come on.

651
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,041
You should go apologize to him.

652
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,250
No. Let's have a drink.

653
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,750
Come on, Got.

654
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,125
Wait.

655
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,000
I thought we were going to see Aunt Toy.

656
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:29,125
Can we go later? I'm not in the mood.

657
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,000
Your aunt isn't going anywhere, is she?

658
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,333
She's ill. That's why I want to visit her.

659
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,333
Should I wait for her to get better first?

660
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:38,541
Let's go some other day.

661
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,750
It's not just Bo.

662
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,916
None of us means anything to you.

663
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:53,416
Hey. I think you're blowing this
out of proportion.

664
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,958
All of you seem to love each other.

665
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,083
Mom…

666
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,041
I mean Bew.
Maybe you just don't see what he's like.

667
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:05,833
Why are you taking his side?

668
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,666
Do you think you know him well?

669
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,250
How long have you known him?

670
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:15,750
The women here are so fierce.

671
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,833
Prem might have been a bit too blunt,

672
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,708
but I think Bo will understand.

673
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:27,041
See? You're taking his side.

674
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:31,291
A guy like him is too selfish
and insensitive to care for anyone.

675
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,375
You don't even care
about your most loyal guy

676
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,458
who devotes himself

677
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:41,000
to his equally dim-witted boss.

678
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,666
Is that right? Really?

679
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,875
Really?

680
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,458
Really now?

681
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,416
Hey.

682
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,083
Guys, come on.

683
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,833
Just calm down.

684
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,833
What I'm trying to say

685
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,208
is Prem really values Bo.

686
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,000
Isn't that right?

687
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,708
You'll go look for him later, right?

688
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:07,708
There's a fine line
between valuing someone and using them.

689
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,166
I'm not sure how Bo feels about it.

690
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:23,458
Hey. Hang on. I just mean…

691
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,208
Please make up and move on.

692
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,750
Don't be mad at each other.

693
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,208
-Let's go drink.
-Hey!

694
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,750
We have to find him.

695
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,208
Do you mean Bo?

696
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,291
Yes.

697
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,291
Hey. Couldn't you find him?

698
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,000
He's not in that alley.

699
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:10,666
Let's try that way.

700
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,416
Hey.

701
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:33,958
Listen.

702
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,333
I must admit…

703
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,208
that I never knew before…

704
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:47,458
that the you I used to know
and the you that I know now

705
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,125
would be so different.

706
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,500
-Hang on. When did you know me?
-Let me finish.

707
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:57,916
You are so kind and caring.

708
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,875
You look out for other people.

709
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,916
I'm utterly perplexed

710
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,166
how you were then and now
are as different as chalk and cheese.

711
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:13,000
Are you finished?
I don't want to interrupt you.

712
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,541
I'm done.

713
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,541
Just to be clear,

714
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:22,166
that guy you're talking about is not me…

715
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,625
because I'm not a shifty guy.

716
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:27,791
I've always been like this.

717
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,166
All right.

718
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,958
Tell me honestly.

719
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,541
Let's say you got married
and you got thrown in prison.

720
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:37,250
Your wife killed herself

721
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,291
and left you a son. Would you--

722
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,250
Jeez! Why is my life so miserable?

723
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,333
-It's a hypothetical scenario, okay?
-Okay.

724
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:48,375
I just want to know
how you would raise your child.

725
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,166
If it were only me

726
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,875
and my son,

727
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,208
I would be devastated.

728
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:04,208
I would probably be
very protective of him.

729
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,958
I would never let him
put himself at any kind of risk.

730
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,166
Maybe that's not what he wants.

731
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,666
You said a father
should let his son live his own life.

732
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,333
Yes, but freedom always comes with risks.

733
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,333
That's how I will raise my son.

734
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,041
I'll force him to do as I say.

735
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,666
Nobody likes being forced.

736
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,791
I don't care!

737
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,791
If it means he'll have a better life

738
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,958
and it helps him survive in this world,
I'll be strict with him.

739
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,916
Here you are, you punk.

740
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,416
You're nothing but trouble.

741
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,875
Get the hell out of here! Go!

742
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,625
I might have to give him
a beating or punish him sometimes.

743
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,708
Got.

744
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:01,416
You've seen how pointless my life is.

745
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,541
I want a better life for my son.

746
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,166
I don't want him to end up like me.

747
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,791
He can get mad and curse me,
or hate me all he wants,

748
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,583
but his life must be better than mine.

749
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,833
I'll make sure of that.

750
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,208
Got.

751
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,250
Got.

752
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,458
Got.

753
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:52,166
What's with you? Get your hands off of me.

754
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,208
Got.

755
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,916
What's wrong with you?

756
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,625
Wait for me here.

757
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,541
I have to go talk to someone.

758
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,666
Who?

759
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,291
Never mind that.

760
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,833
Just wait here and don't go anywhere
until I come back.

761
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:13,875
Okay?

762
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,625
Okay. I'll wait here.

763
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:24,208
I just thought of one good thing
about my father.

764
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:27,250
When someone tells him to wait,

765
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,791
he will wait there

766
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,750
without ever asking why.

767
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,708
Since I have no idea how I got here,

768
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,125
it means that

769
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,791
I can disappear at any second.

770
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,291
I can't waste any more time.

771
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,500
Where's Bew?

772
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,541
She's taking a day off.

773
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:59,416
Please accept our alms offerings.

774
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:15,500
May you be blessed with a long life
filled with happiness and strength.

775
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,791
I don't know why,

776
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,958
but I feel like you and Prem
have something in common.

777
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,458
What is it?

778
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:52,250
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

779
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,750
Why didn't you tell anyone

780
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,000
you were staying
with Mrs. Toy at the hospital?

781
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,625
I was looking for you all night.

782
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,750
Is there something urgent?

783
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,041
Is it about yesterday?

784
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:24,625
Don't worry about it.
I didn't really mean what I said.

785
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:28,166
I know he's like that.

786
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:32,916
He's a straightforward guy
who always speaks his mind.

787
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:38,666
But when he loves someone,
he doesn't know how to express it.

788
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,500
He always does the opposite
of what he feels.

789
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:50,500
Clean your face up.

790
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,958
I can't read him.

791
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,666
I can't tell what he's really like.

792
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,541
Are you sure you can't?

793
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:09,875
What?

794
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,166
You spoke up for him yesterday.

795
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,250
Listen.

796
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,291
Let me ask you something.

797
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,416
How come you never talk about your family?

798
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,083
To be honest,

799
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,041
I hardly ever call him my dad.

800
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,500
I don't want to talk about him.

801
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,625
What about your mother?

802
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:39,916
What is she like?

803
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,708
My mother?

804
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:56,500
I don't remember what she was like.

805
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,583
She died when I was little.

806
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,583
My dad was sentenced to six years in jail
when she was pregnant.

807
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:16,375
She had depression
after giving birth to me.

808
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:20,583
She jumped off the building to her death.

809
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,250
That's a shame.

810
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,083
If she had a chance to see you now,

811
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:39,125
she would be so proud of you

812
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,083
and she wouldn't have done such a thing.

813
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,166
Well…

814
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,375
I should go.
I kept Prem waiting all night.

815
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,375
Are you leaving already?

816
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,916
I'm so happy I got to meet you.

817
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:48,041
If she had a chance to see you now,
she would be so proud of you.

818
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,416
She wouldn't have done such a thing.

819
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,583
Damn you, Got.

820
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:22,541
Where were you?
I waited for you all night.

821
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,333
I'm sorry.

822
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:31,416
Can you do me a favor, sir?

823
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,291
You don't mess around, do you?

824
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,666
You've got some nerve.

825
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm out of cigarettes.

826
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,125
Here.

827
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,958
Nice cigs.

828
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:51,541
Before you ask me for a favor,
do me one favor first.

829
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,875
Stop being so formal with me.

830
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:57,791
Stop calling me "sir" already.
Be real, man.

831
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,208
-I'm begging you.
-No. Don't do that.

832
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:07,458
If that's what you want,
I'll do as you ask, man.

833
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:11,125
Yes! That's much better.
That's what I'm talking about.

834
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,833
What favor do you want from me?

835
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,541
-Number one.
-Okay.

836
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,916
Don't get into any fights

837
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,083
in the next six months no matter what.

838
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,375
Can you do that?

839
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:26,500
Sure. That's easy.
I'm not one to start a fight anyway.

840
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,375
Number two.

841
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:35,875
Have your wedding as soon as possible
and let me be your wedding planner.

842
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:38,583
Okeydoke.

843
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,291
I'm fine with that.

844
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,000
Why do you want to plan my wedding anyway?

845
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:47,666
There's one more thing.

846
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,041
Are you not done?

847
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:56,708
If you have a kid,
don't ever hit or kick him.

848
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:01,416
Are you nuts?
I'll be a good father to my kid.

849
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,166
Why would I lay my hands on him?

850
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,666
I will never treat my kid
like a punching bag

851
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,291
if he's a good kid.

852
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,666
I knew it.

853
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,125
Is someone grilling chicken?

854
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,125
I don't think so. Look at the smoke.

855
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:25,166
-Shit! My house's on fire!
-What?

856
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,875
Shit!

857
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,708
Wait up.

858
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,083
My house!

859
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,791
Let's get out of here.

860
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,291
You go ahead. I have to go get something.

861
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,916
No way! I'll go with you.

862
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,250
I'll be right back!

863
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,666
Let's just go.

864
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,166
-Let me go!
-We have to go.

865
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,583
Hey!

866
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,916
Let us through, please.

867
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:59,500
Hey. What's that?

868
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:01,416
-You're still here?
-I'm waiting for you.

869
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,708
Let's get out of here!

870
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,291
Let us through.

871
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,416
Damn it. I told you not to wait for me.

872
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,625
Did you risk your life for this?

873
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,250
It's my dad's photo. It's important.

874
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,500
Damn. I've really misjudged you.

875
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,666
I almost didn't get to have my wedding.

876
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,958
These are my life savings.

877
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:38,583
Boss!

878
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:39,833
-Boss.
-Bo.

879
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,583
Are you hurt?
I was worried sick about you.

880
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,791
I'm fine. Don't worry.

881
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,166
I think someone is trying to hurt us.

882
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,666
We'd better stick together at all times.

883
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,291
What if we need to use the bathroom?
Should we stick together then?

884
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Look at this.

885
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,291
This is one chopstick.

886
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,458
It can be broken easily.

887
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:19,583
But if we put three chopsticks together,
they won't be so…

888
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,458
That didn't work.

889
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,166
Here, Bo. Try and break these.

890
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,875
When you put a bunch
of them together, they won't…

891
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,250
They won't…

892
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,250
Here.

893
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,625
They won't break.

894
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,666
What are you trying to say, Got?

895
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:44,750
Here's my point.
If we stick together, they can't…

896
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,250
Hey.

897
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,083
Don't look so confused. You don't know me.

898
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,500
But you might know this guy.

899
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:23,166
You probably don't know
that this karaoke bar is situated

900
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:27,291
in a very good location
filled with positive energy.

901
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,000
I want it.

902
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:30,625
Why are you telling me?

903
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,958
That's my girlfriend's bar.

904
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,041
You dimwit!

905
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,708
You know, I actually don't like
doing illegal businesses myself.

906
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,625
I want you to do it.

907
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,375
Come work for me.

908
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,666
Hot Rod Gang has dignity.

909
01:08:58,541 --> 01:08:59,875
We don't work for criminals!

910
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:05,791
You'll have an easy job that pays well.

911
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,583
You won't have to borrow money
from anyone again.

912
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:11,375
Your girl can keep her job.

913
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:13,000
She's good at it, isn't she?

914
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:19,791
Come on, you asshole! Bring it!

915
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:23,625
I gave you a generous offer.

916
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,416
Asshole!

917
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:42,958
Dad.

918
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:02,208
Prem.

919
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,375
-Got.
-Got.

920
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,458
Got. Damn it! My leg hurts.

921
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,625
Aunt Toy!

922
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,833
How are you feeling?
Do you want to see a doctor?

923
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,708
No. I'll be fine.

924
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:26,875
You're always like this.

925
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,083
Did you two get into a dogfight somewhere?

926
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,416
We would've been fine
if it was just one dog

927
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,583
and not a pack of mongrels.

928
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,416
Don't be so cocky.

929
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,000
You keep causing trouble after trouble.

930
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:45,583
Aunt Toy, are you cooking something
on the stove?

931
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,083
Right. I forgot.

932
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:00,166
How did you get into a fight?

933
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,166
Who did this to you?

934
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:04,708
It was nothing.

935
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:07,166
It was just a little row.

936
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,166
Can you let it go then?

937
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,625
No. There are scores to settle.

938
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:15,916
If something happens to you,
what will I do?

939
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,500
How can I let them go after--

940
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:18,750
I'm pregnant.

941
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,583
Bew.

942
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,041
Are you pregnant?

943
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,833
Yes.

944
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:51,041
I'm so happy, Bew.

945
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,750
Prem.

946
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,958
Yes?

947
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,208
Hey! What the hell? Back off.

948
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,166
I'm having a moment with my wife.

949
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,083
I want to be part of this.

950
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,041
I'm happy for you two.

951
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,500
Are you really pregnant?

952
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,375
Yes.

953
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,125
Can you promise
not to get into any more fights?

954
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:35,125
Of course. We promise we'll stop fighting.

955
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,750
I promise. There will be no more fights.

956
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:41,375
He can't fight anyone
with that crippled leg.

957
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,916
I can still kick you with my good leg.

958
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,625
Calm down. I'll give you a massage.

959
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:48,708
Hey! Watch it, Got!

960
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,291
Hey. What are you doing?

961
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,375
I'm giving you a foot massage.
Pregnancy will make your feet swollen.

962
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,583
What the hell are you doing, Got?

963
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,750
Got, stay away from my wife.

964
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,333
-It's just a massage.
-Just stop.

965
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,750
Come on, Bew.

966
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:14,500
-Get up slowly. Be careful.
-Let me help.

967
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,166
Back off.

968
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,416
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

969
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,791
I wouldn't have believed that my dad

970
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:39,333
and this crazy guy are the same person.

971
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:46,166
At least I know now
where I got the crazy streak from.

972
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,583
I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

973
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,541
A boy, of course.
You'll have a handsome boy.

974
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,916
Will we have a healthy baby?

975
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,958
Don't you worry.
He'll be as tough as a nail.

976
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:05,708
Damn it! Can you shut up
and let me talk to my wife?

977
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:07,458
I'm just happy.

978
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:12,083
Our baby will be…

979
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,041
Boss.

980
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,916
Bae ran away again. He only left a note.

981
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,750
What did he say?

982
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,458
"Dear Prem, Bae…"

983
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,291
Jeez! Give it to me.

984
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,375
You read it.

985
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:32,125
Do you call that reading?
Let me read it. Can't you read?

986
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:36,500
"Dear Prem."

987
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:37,708
That's me.

988
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
"Bot."

989
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:44,375
-It's Got.
-Right. Got.

990
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:50,041
"I can't distance farewell."

991
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,833
I know. He wants to say goodbye.

992
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:54,166
Damn.

993
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,583
-Is that right?
-Right. Damn.

994
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,625
Why did he write to me just to say that?

995
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,833
Please stop. You're not even close.

996
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:03,125
You're a bunch of idiots.

997
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,791
I'll read it for you.

998
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:08,500
"Dear Prem, Bo, and Got."

999
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,791
"If you're reading this letter,

1000
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,875
it means I've already left."

1001
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,583
"The distance between reality and dreams

1002
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:21,166
has driven me to embark on a journey."

1003
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,416
"Thank you for everything."

1004
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,000
"All along,

1005
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,791
I know that I'm different from you guys."

1006
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,125
Shit.

1007
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:36,000
"I really don't belong in the gang."

1008
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,458
"I don't want to be a burden to anyone."

1009
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,916
You guys keep loitering around
like a bunch of losers.

1010
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,916
Get up and help me clean up.

1011
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,041
Are you drinking beer?

1012
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,750
-It's chrysanthemum juice.
-Right.

1013
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,833
-Like hell it is.
-Give me five.

1014
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:51,416
-Hey!
-That's your high five.

1015
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:56,958
"No one knows what the future holds,

1016
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,083
but I don't want to become
an old man who runs an eyewear store."

1017
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,208
"Goodbye, my friends."

1018
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,625
"Until we meet again."

1019
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:13,208
"No one can escape their future."

1020
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:19,458
"But we can choose
the kind of future we want."

1021
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,583
"With love, Bae."

1022
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:31,791
Why did you close your eyes?

1023
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,375
We have to take another one.

1024
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:36,916
-One, two--
-Hold on.

1025
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,916
Hey! You can just tell me.

1026
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,458
Move closer together.

1027
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:49,416
Okay. We're good.

1028
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,125
-One, two--
-Just a second.

1029
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:56,541
Lift the camera higher. No. Go lower.

1030
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:59,500
It doesn't look right.

1031
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,791
-The angle is--
-Just stop it.

1032
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,125
All right then.

1033
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,000
What are you doing?

1034
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,791
You do it. Just take
the picture the way you want it.

1035
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,583
Do it yourself since you're so fussy.

1036
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:15,541
Are you ready?

1037
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,875
One, two…

1038
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,916
Hey, Got. Have you seen Bo?

1039
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
He disappeared after the morning ceremony.

1040
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,000
He'll come back.

1041
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,916
It's a good thing
the dress code isn't green.

1042
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:40,500
Why is that?

1043
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:45,250
Today is Saturday.
It's unlucky to wear green today.

1044
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:48,166
Those who wear green will have bad luck.

1045
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,125
Right.

1046
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:57,416
This is for the Hot Rod Gang.

1047
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:14,791
Is that everyone?

1048
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:37,291
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1049
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,458
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1050
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:44,250
The MC hasn't arrived
due to heavy traffic.

1051
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:48,416
As the wedding planner,
I have to apologize for that.

1052
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,333
While we're waiting,

1053
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:56,916
I'll dish some dirt on the bride and groom
in the meantime.

1054
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,250
First of all, I have to say

1055
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:07,583
that the bride looks
absolutely stunning tonight.

1056
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:15,833
I don't know what Prem ever did
to deserve this beauty?

1057
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,625
Do you agree?

1058
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,041
Look at this.

1059
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,958
I have a confession to make.

1060
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,541
I used to hate this guy with a passion.

1061
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,666
Before I knew it,

1062
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,333
he became my best buddy.

1063
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:39,208
I never knew who I was
or where I came from,

1064
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:41,666
and how I got here.

1065
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,708
Until I met these two.

1066
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:50,875
If you know Prem, you'll know that

1067
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:55,041
he doesn't deserve Bew at all.

1068
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,958
-Watch your mouth, Got.
-But…

1069
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:02,333
But let me tell you that you're wrong

1070
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:08,916
because there's no one in this whole world
whom I'd rather see by Bew's side

1071
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,291
except for this wacko.

1072
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:41,875
The hand of destiny

1073
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:45,416
It brings us together

1074
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:51,666
We were once far apart
But destiny played a trick on us

1075
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,916
And it led me to you

1076
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,083
Maybe we are soulmates

1077
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:04,916
Fated to be together

1078
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:08,166
Since the moment I met you

1079
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,416
My world became brighter

1080
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,416
You and I are meant to be

1081
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:37,000
If we weren't destined to be together

1082
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:40,416
Our love wouldn't have survived it all

1083
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,500
We wouldn't get our happy ending

1084
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:45,833
Sorrow would've found us

1085
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:49,791
We would've drifted apart
Never to see each other again

1086
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:53,250
We are destined to be together

1087
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:56,458
To cherish and love each other

1088
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:01,875
Our love is written in the stars

1089
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:05,416
You and I are meant to be

1090
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,875
I now believe in love

1091
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:13,500
For I am madly in love with you

1092
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Lost in my reverie now and forever

1093
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:24,875
What do you want?

1094
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,000
I want your leg
as a wedding present for my boss.

1095
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:41,000
Or you can bow at his feet
and I'll spare your life.

1096
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,000
I'll give you a chance to leave.

1097
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:46,666
I have work to do.

1098
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,000
All right then.

1099
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,541
You can say goodbye to your leg.

1100
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:22,875
I gave you a chance to run
and you refused.

1101
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:51,375
The police are here!

1102
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:54,458
-Good evening.
-Hello.

1103
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:57,416
What's going on?

1104
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:16,875
One day, I'll prove to you
that you can always rely on me.

1105
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:27,083
I want to help my boss
make our gang the greatest.

1106
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:29,583
We'll rule this country together.

1107
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,708
Damn it!

1108
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:36,916
Fuck!

1109
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,291
Hey. Where are you going?

1110
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,833
-Leave me alone.
-Stay. Don't go.

1111
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:55,791
-Let me go.
-You're not going anywhere.

1112
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:57,208
-Out of my way!
-Stay here.

1113
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:00,041
Don't go. Don't you remember
your promise to Bew?

1114
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,375
You promised her you would stop fighting.

1115
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,166
Damn it!

1116
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,625
That bastard Jo.

1117
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,541
Where are you going?

1118
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:01,666
Are you okay?

1119
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,500
No problemo.

1120
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:17,791
Dad!

1121
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:33,291
Dad.

1122
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:34,875
Dad!

1123
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:41,958
Dad.

1124
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:46,000
Dad! Wake up, Dad!

1125
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:48,666
Dad!

1126
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:51,875
Wake up!

1127
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:58,666
Dad!

1128
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,791
Stop calling me Dad.

1129
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,041
Don't squeeze me so hard. It hurts.

1130
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:12,958
Got.

1131
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,208
Bo.

1132
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:29,000
I've avenged your death.

1133
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,958
Although I couldn't change anything,

1134
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,958
but to hell with it.

1135
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:48,958
Are you okay?

1136
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:54,500
Got, I just thought of something.

1137
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:59,291
I don't care if my child
will be a boy or a girl.

1138
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:02,458
I'll name it Got.

1139
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:05,583
What do you think?

1140
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:12,583
I've always suspected that my name
must have had a story behind it,

1141
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:19,250
but I never expected the story
to be so silly.

1142
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:27,333
If you name your baby after me,

1143
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,708
you can't hit him, all right?

1144
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,541
I know. I already told you I won't.

1145
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:37,625
You have to give him
a generous allowance as well.

1146
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:38,791
All right.

1147
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:42,916
-And you have to--
-Why are you so obsessed with my kid?

1148
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,500
You're too much.

1149
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:49,666
Hey.

1150
01:31:57,708 --> 01:31:59,000
Prem!

1151
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,375
You promised
there would be no more fights.

1152
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,041
Bew.

1153
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,375
I'm sorry.

1154
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,458
Got.

1155
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,250
If something happens to me,

1156
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:30,833
take care of Bew for me.

1157
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,416
Bew.

1158
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,375
There's a box under the bed at home.

1159
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,958
You can sell everything in that box.

1160
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:59,666
Use the money to raise our kid
and keep our family going.

1161
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:24,416
This is how we'll communicate
in the future.

1162
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:27,541
This will be worth more than gold one day.

1163
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:34,958
The finish line in front of you

1164
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:38,791
may be just the beginning of a new day.

1165
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,500
As long as you're still breathing,

1166
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:47,250
you can always start over.

1167
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:06,375
You're 16 weeks pregnant
and the baby's very healthy.

1168
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:09,708
It will start kicking more often.

1169
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:14,250
Don't be alarmed if your baby starts
to kick you harder.

1170
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:02,625
Sometimes, you only realize
who means the most to you…

1171
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,416
when it's already too late.

1172
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,208
Dad.

1173
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:37,916
How are you doing, son?

1174
01:40:01,916 --> 01:40:03,041
Don't you think…

1175
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,083
that gesture is a bit too simple?

1176
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:42,375
Everything will be all right.

1177
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:01,416
