1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,280
Do you want me to grab your boobs…

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,400
2 WEEKS BEFORE THE 2U EVENT

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,920
…or knock you out with a kiss?

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,200
Knock me out with a kiss?

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,640
I've heard that countless times, and I haven't been knocked out once.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,840
Is that a challenge?

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,800
Yes.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
Since you ask for it…

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,600
I shall grant it to you.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,520
Wat, I'm here to pick you up.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,480
I have to go.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,440
Just call me when you have time.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,720
Even if I don't have time, I will.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,320
Get the door for me.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
I see that I'm very welcome here.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,680
-Hey. -I'm out now.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
See you.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,920
Want some help with that?

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,960
Take care of him for me, Dim.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,520
Don't worry.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,120
-I'll do my best. -I'm sure I'm in the wrong hands.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,960
What did you just say, Wat? I can take care of you just fine.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Stop with that sad-ass face. What's wrong?

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,520
Who would have thought

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
that my first relationship would become a long-distance one?

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,520
Damn.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,760
Sathorn and Ladprao? Is this your definition of long-distance?

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Unbelievable. Ladprao is not Las Vegas.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
But I miss him.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,840
We see each other every day.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
He's not in the mood.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,040
Wow.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
Is this really your house, Dim?

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,800
Wow.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,400
Make yourselves at home.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Pay respects to my house spirits too.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
-Okay. -Look.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,000
-What? -This is the yard Green told us about.

39
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,680
Really?

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,440
-Right here. -It's hardcore.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,200
-They did it outdoors. -Right here what?

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,440
-Nothing. We're talking about dogs. -Yes.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
It's nothing.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Let's go inside, you assholes.

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,280
I don't have dogs, by the way.

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,040
-In front of the house spirit shrine? -Damn.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,800
Yuck. Stop it already.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,800
-Did they really do it here? -The gate is always closed, you know.

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
We know.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's go.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,880
-Someone can climb anyway. -They weren't ashamed.

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,360
-Damn. -Wow.

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,040
They're all new.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,760
I've set up this room for you to practice for fun.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
For fun?

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Why didn't you take us here in the first place?

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,440
-These instruments are not mine. -What?

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
I borrowed them all.

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,200
This electric guitar belongs to Jennie.

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,520
Damn. It's a legendary guitar.

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,920
-Let's take a selfie, guys. -Sure. This is cool stuff.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
-Let's capture the memory. -Yes, we must.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,400
Come here. Let's make memories together.

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,520
Wat, come here.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,880
-This is the last chance. -I see.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
-Take a snap. -What?

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Are you done?

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
What now?

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
-I'll keep it for you. -Why?

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
Good musicians must focus on their music.

71
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
If I don't do this, you will chat with your partners all day.

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,760
Hey.

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,680
I'll take care of your phones for you. Give them to me. Don't argue.

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
-What if my mom calls? -I'll pick up for you, Non.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,040
Wat, come on.

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Don't buy your time.

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,160
Give it to me. Now.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,480
Everyone is waiting.

79
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,800
-I'm an exception because I am single. -Really?

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,800
But you're on TikTok every day. I'm following you.

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Ms. TikTok Star.

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Give it to me.

83
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
Seriously?

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
-Quickly. -Fine.

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,800
When will we get them back?

86
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
After practice, of course.

87
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,360
-You mean today? -No.

88
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,920
After this schedule is completed. After two weeks.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
-What? -Really?

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
This is your practice schedule.

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Hold on.

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Do we even have breaks?

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,040
-Are we allowed to eat? -Oh, god.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
We don't have any days off. Isn't it too tough?

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,880
-Right. -Will we be able to do it?

96
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
If you guys can't do it, then quit.

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Go home.

98
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
It doesn't matter anymore.

99
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,640
Go ahead. I'll return these musical instruments.

100
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Okay. Fine. We'll do it.

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,440
-We'll follow the schedule. -Are you sure?

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
-Yes. -Yes.

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,120
-Good. I'll lock the house. -Lock the house?

104
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,960
Then you all can start practicing.

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
-Do you need to do that? -Of course.

106
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,240
-For two weeks? -Yes.

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,800
-How are we going to eat? -I'll bring you food.

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
-One, two, three. -It doesn't matter

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,960
Who is in your heart

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,360
As long as you

111
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,120
Look my way

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,520
Non, you're not consistent. The beat goes up and down.

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,400
Sorry. Let's do it again.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,760
All right. Try again. Go.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,600
One…

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,800
It doesn't matter who is in your heart

117
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,000
As long as you look my way

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,640
Non, you're too slow.

119
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,520
Go and practice your strokes without the drums.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Boom. Your bass didn't go well with the drum pedal.

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Listen to more songs and learn the basics carefully.

122
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,560
Wat, you're fine, but you just couldn't concentrate.

123
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Put on some light music and calm your mind.

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
As for you, Earn, you made lots of mistakes.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,440
Ask Wat for help. He could be your teacher.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,680
You're good, Temp.

127
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,080
You can sing now.

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Sing with who?

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,160
You shooed them all away.

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,800
They will be back. Just wait until they're okay.

131
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
That's all for today.

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll see you again tomorrow.

133
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,960
-Our phones? -Right.

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,640
You did poorly today. How dare you ask for your phones?

135
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm not giving you anything.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
Come on.

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,600
Right.

138
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,160
All men sleep in the same room.

139
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,440
Earn, you sleep in my room.

140
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,080
No way. Who wants to sleep in your room?

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,800
How can I contact Tine?

142
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,320
-And my mom? -What about my TikTok?

143
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,920
-Can I call Tine, please? -Mommy.

144
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,880
Take care of yourself.

145
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
Well, well…

146
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,120
Sarawat, when you're done flirting with your man,

147
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,560
turn the light off for us.

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,160
Everyone is sleeping now.

149
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
You go to bed.

150
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,840
-Turn the light off. -Okay.

151
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,920
See you soon.

152
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,720
Will you all get back inside?

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,240
-We're just going to get some beer. -I have plenty inside.

154
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,520
Hey.

155
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,280
I miss you.

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
I miss you too.

157
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
Can I hug you?

158
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,080
Good night.

159
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,480
Night.

160
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,000
Get some sleep.

161
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,240
-Is he all right? -I don't know.

162
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,640
I think he's losing it.

163
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,520
Guys, hurry up.

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,000
We need to learn all the songs tonight.

165
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,960
We finished just now.

166
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Quickly, Non.

167
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
You're the slowest one.

168
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Temp, why don't you eat?

169
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,960
I've been having heartburn since last night.

170
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,440
Then you'll say you're sick. Am I right?

171
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm feeling sick.

172
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,680
See? You just want to slack off.

173
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,000
-Did you guys plan this together? -We didn't.

174
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
Hey.

175
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,200
-Temp. -Temp.

176
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,560
Are you okay, Temp?

177
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Hey.

178
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,280
-Are you really sick? -Nice acting.

179
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
Don't use this trick.

180
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,440
-You're wasting time. -Drink some water.

181
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,200
-Are you all right? -I don't think so.

182
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
-Not good. -Dim, he's not faking it.

183
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,040
I think he's sick.

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
Fine.

185
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,760
You guys continue your practice here. Temp, can you walk?

186
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
I can.

187
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,800
Come. I'll take you to the hospital.

188
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,160
You all must practice. Don't ever goof off.

189
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,840
-Sure. -Let's go.

190
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,720
-Please take care of him. -Okay.

191
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,520
Hey, guys.

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,280
Dim's gone. What should we do now?

193
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,320
I have two hours. I can make it.

194
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
-Where are you going? -I'm going to see Tine.

195
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
No, you can't.

196
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,840
Someone needs to go with you, otherwise you won't come back.

197
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,320
-Wait for me here. -Hurry.

198
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,720
-Let me get my bag. -You stay here.

199
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
It's nice. Is this your new place?

200
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes, we just moved in.

201
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,200
Slow down. Tine won't go anywhere.

202
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,400
We're running out of time. I miss him to death.

203
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
When it comes to your boyfriend, you're very active. Damn you.

204
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
Tine!

205
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,280
Tine? Where are you?

206
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Tine.

207
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
His laptop is here.

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,720
Where has he gone to?

209
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
He's not here, Earn.

210
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,360
What do we do now? Should we go back?

211
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,200
What a crappy guy. Why is it so hard to say?

212
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
You have dragged me to this point…

213
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,400
where I'm talking to your doll all alone.

214
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
When you were around,

215
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,200
all I did was nag,

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,080
but you always did something that bugged me.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,040
You didn't turn your clothes inside out.

218
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,840
You liked to steal my stuff,

219
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,840
and you wanted to grab my boobs all the time.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,440
Now that you're not here,

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you know, I'd let you do anything to me…

222
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
in exchange for you coming back.

223
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,240
Just like you said…

224
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,560
I must be patient.

225
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
I must be strong.

226
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,040
I'll wait until this event is over.

227
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,200
I'll wait until we meet again.

228
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,720
But there's something I want to tell you.

229
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,760
I miss you so bad, Wat.

230
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Hey.

231
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
We should go.

232
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
Come on.

233
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,360
I miss you so much too, Tine.

234
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,640
I didn't know you had a romantic side.

235
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
Why?

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,720
-Of course I do. -All right.

237
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,560
All you wanted was to see his face.

238
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,120
What a whipped boy.

239
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Tine is trying his best to be patient.

240
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
I'll do the same.

241
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
Good.

242
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,240
At least the distance…

243
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,320
makes our longing for each other more worthwhile.

244
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Damn.

245
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
Is that your new song?

246
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,800
You just love Tine so much, don't you?

247
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,400
Isn't it normal?

248
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,080
No. I don't think so.

249
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
Let's suppose…

250
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Let's say I like girls.

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
I don't know if I'd be open like you.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,520
It isn't about being open or not.

253
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
We're just two people who love each other.

254
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
Just like other couples.

255
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,560
It's not about courage.

256
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,760
It's all about love.

257
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,880
I guess you're right.

258
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,840
It's up to the ones loving each other.

259
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,040
It's their call if they want to be open or not.

260
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
-Exactly. -Right.

261
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
You got it right.

262
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,440
Where's Temp?

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
We have a problem.

264
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,360
He has gastritis and was admitted to the hospital.

265
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
But…

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,720
The contest is two days away.

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,240
You be the front man.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll find a new guitarist.

269
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
What?

270
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,200
Hey.

271
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,240
2U TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL MATCH DAY

272
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,880
Guys, don't be nervous.

273
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
Take it as a normal event we've attended.

274
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,360
Well…

275
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,480
Is this the building?

276
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
It is.

277
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,680
Come on, Tine.

278
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,680
You just told them not to be nervous.

279
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,640
You seem more nervous than they are.

280
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm trying to keep cool,

281
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,800
but it's the biggest event for me as the club president.

282
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm just hoping for the best.

283
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,320
Don't worry.

284
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
You can do it, Tine.

285
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
-Good luck. I'm rooting for you. -Come on.

286
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
You've been hugging me a lot lately.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,920
Shut up. By the way, Pear…

288
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,440
I think we should do this.

289
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,960
SPECIAL GUEST: SCRUBB

290
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
Tine, what are you doing?

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh, it's nothing.

292
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,800
Right.

293
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,120
About that day, I'm so sorry I yelled at you.

294
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
It's all good.

295
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,200
I know you did your best for the club. No hard feelings.

296
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,040
Have you eaten anything?

297
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,520
Did you get enough sleep? Will you be okay?

298
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm good.

299
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,280
Tine.

300
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
Just so you know, I'm not wearing heavy makeup today.

301
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,240
Sure. I'll tell the makeup artist to put on light makeup for you.

302
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
-Really? -But you look good wearing a heavy one.

303
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,280
Thanks.

304
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
It's like taking a speed boat.

305
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,960
Hurry up.

306
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,240
This event is surely big.

307
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,880
I'll play to my heart's content.

308
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
Are you looking for Tine?

309
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Your boyfriend is in that club too. Aren't you going to wish him good luck?

310
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,280
Watch your mouth. I don't have a boyfriend.

311
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,280
And where is our last member?

312
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,760
Oh.

313
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,160
He's sleeping.

314
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,880
Hey! Wake up.

315
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
Sorry.

316
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,840
Let's go.

317
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,320
-Hi there, Man. -Type.

318
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,560
Jib let us print any name on the jersey. Take a look.

319
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,880
Here.

320
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,080
Did you see it? It's you.

321
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Look. Isn't it cute?

322
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
It's "Duper White."

323
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,080
Who is Jib?

324
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,000
Can you just pay attention to my jersey here? Look.

325
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,440
Did you see it?

326
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
Yes, I did.

327
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,800
Who on earth is Jib?

328
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,160
Type, my jersey is the point here.

329
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,680
I have a meeting soon.

330
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
You must tell me who Jib is when I get back.

331
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,040
Type, wait. What's with him?

332
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,160
I showed him my jersey. Why did he keep asking who Jib was?

333
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
-What's on your jersey? "Duper White"? -Cool.

334
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Lame. Mine is better.

335
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,120
Did you have "Dr. Pear" printed on it?

336
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,600
That'd be too simple.

337
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,200
-What? -Look.

338
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,720
I printed her cute nickname.

339
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,440
Three syllables.

340
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
Dear Doctor?

341
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,920
-No. It's too basic. -What?

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,880
It's Cute Doctor.

343
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,440
That's nice.

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Just wait and see.

345
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,160
I'm coming.

346
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,400
Great. You'll blow her mind today.

347
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,000
It'd be a bit tight.

348
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,200
-Guys, your food is here. Let's eat. -Great.

349
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
The food arrives.

350
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
Take one.

351
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,440
-It looks good. -Hurry.

352
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Wait a moment.

353
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,360
Don't eat too much. You might get side stitches.

354
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,880
We have to be on the field around 12:45.

355
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
-Got it. -Sure.

356
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,280
What's on the menu?

357
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,920
Okay, Mil.

358
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,160
I'll be there shortly.

359
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,520
-Phukong. -Yes?

360
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Aren't you going to eat?

361
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm not really hungry.

362
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,600
Right.

363
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,560
Tine.

364
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,880
If we're all set now,

365
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
can I stop by the Music Club for a bit?

366
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you going to see Wat?

367
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,680
Right. I'm going to see my brother.

368
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,120
Who else could it be?

369
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,080
I want to go with you,

370
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,480
but I have the final rehearsal with people on the bleachers.

371
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,680
Well…

372
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Oh.

373
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
One moment.

374
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Here.

375
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,240
Can you take this to Wat for me?

376
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,120
-What is this? Can I look at it? -No.

377
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,120
What?

378
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
It's for Wat, not you.

379
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,120
Can't I just take a peek?

380
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
No, it's for Wat.

381
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,960
You're being possessive.

382
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm his brother.

383
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
-Take it to him. -Okay.

384
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
-See you later. -See you.

385
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560
-Thanks. -Sure.

386
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
Dim, can I see Boom?

387
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
Anything urgent?

388
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
If you want to give him anything,

389
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,280
leave it with me. I'll give it to him.

390
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Damn.

391
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,640
I just want to see my boyfriend. Why are you such a love blocker?

392
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
You can't eat this. You're being a jerk because you fought with your boyfriend.

393
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,640
Watch your mouth, or I'll eat them all.

394
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
-Damn you. -Stop it.

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
Dim.

396
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Is Mil here?

397
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,160
Why? Are you his boyfriend?

398
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
No, I'm not. Someone wanted me to give this to him.

399
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm just kidding.

400
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,280
You two will never be a thing.

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll get him for you.

402
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,360
-Mil. -Yes?

403
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,760
-Sarawat's brother wants to see you. -Phukong?

404
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,080
Yes.

405
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,360
What's the matter?

406
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,320
I don't know. He's here to see you.

407
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm going to have lunch.

408
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,000
It's your watch now. Don't let the lovebirds see each other.

409
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,560
-Just like I did earlier. -I see. Okay.

410
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
My eyes are like scanners.

411
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,920
-I can tell who's dating who. -Right.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,560
-You're a genius. -I know.

413
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
-Have a seat. -Okay.

414
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Here.

415
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,960
Tine wants to give this to Wat.

416
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
Can you give it to him?

417
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,880
What about mine?

418
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,280
That's all I'm here for.

419
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
Really?

420
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,880
But I can smell crispy pork with kale.

421
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,680
Well…

422
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,560
You're as good as a dog.

423
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,000
Are you picking on me?

424
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
No.

425
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Here.

426
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,920
I got it right.

427
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,560
Thanks.

428
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,520
Is that all?

429
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,840
All I get is "thanks"?

430
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Here.

431
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
I told you many times, this is the brother zone.

432
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Why don't you remember?

433
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm going to kick your ass.

434
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Come on.

435
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,680
Are you happy now?

436
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,840
Yes.

437
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,160
You're not wearing much makeup today. You look good.

438
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,080
If I did, someone would need to clean it for me.

439
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
There's something in your hair.

440
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,560
There.

441
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Right there. I got it for you.

442
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,200
All right.

443
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,440
You can go now. I'll see you later.

444
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,400
-See you. -See you.

445
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,240
-Dim, bye now. -Bye.

446
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,480
What is it?

447
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,920
Well, I didn't know brothers would pat each other's heads.

448
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,920
Well… There was something in his hair. That's all.

449
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,960
I see.

450
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,280
-We're like brothers. -Brothers?

451
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,640
I can pat your head too.

452
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
Brothers. I see…

453
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,520
Mil, you little…

454
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm sorry, bro.

455
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
Wat. Here.

456
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,640
It's from Tine.

457
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,080
Thank you.

458
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,960
Why did you agree to be our guitarist?

459
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,920
If this was last year, I wouldn't do it,

460
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,840
but everything has changed now.

461
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,800
A good drink will make you fresh and give you energy on stage.

462
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,960
Wat. Sorry, I'm so busy

463
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,120
that I can't bring this to you myself.

464
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,200
I cooked this because you mentioned it all the time.

465
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,800
This chicken green curry from Chef Tine is full of love.

466
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,560
When the cheerleading contest is over, I'll be there supporting you.

467
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
I miss you.

468
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,200
Hey.

469
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
Your food looks kind of special.

470
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,080
Well…

471
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,200
It's the new menu from a nearby restaurant.

472
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,960
Just what I thought.

473
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,320
It's their special lunchbox to boost sales, right?

474
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,040
It looks good, though.

475
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,280
When you guys do the soundcheck, do it slowly.

476
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,160
Do not rush it, okay?

477
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
It's refreshing.

478
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,880
I'll stand by near the stage and help you get it right.

479
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,280
-This is the best. -We still have time.

480
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,640
-I'll stand by near the stage. -We're going to win.

481
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,480
And I'll help you get it right.

482
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,000
-Look at me. -We did great last year.

483
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,440
-I'll guide you with the volume. -This year will be better.

484
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,920
Green, you lead them to the field.

485
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
Wat, do you understand?

486
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,440
Okay. Look.

487
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,760
Hold your drumsticks tight.

488
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,840
Good luck.

489
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,320
Good luck!

490
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,800
Good luck to you too!

491
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,760
Wat.

492
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Thank you.

493
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
Wat, hurry up.

494
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,560
We're running out of time.

495
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,840
Tine!

496
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,600
Let's go.

497
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,720
Wat. Come on.

498
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
2U TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL MATCH 17

499
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,920
Hello, everyone!

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,360
Welcome to 2U,

501
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,520
the 17th Traditional Football and Music Day.

502
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,480
Apart from the fun football match to watch, there's another highlight.

503
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,400
Which is?

504
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,240
The cheerleading contest, of course.

505
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
They are super gorgeous.

506
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,040
I saw the cheerleaders in the purple costumes. They're great.

507
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,480
-What is great? -The cheerleaders.

508
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,640
They are breathtaking.

509
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,600
I think just the same.

510
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,560
Look at them.

511
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,520
-They're so natural. -Be serious.

512
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,480
We're about to play now.

513
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,840
Hey, Boss.

514
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes?

515
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,080
That's Pear, your Dr. Pear.

516
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,080
-Oh, that's your beloved doctor. -Shut it.

517
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,040
I'll wait until the match is over.

518
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,520
-It's your chance, man. -No!

519
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,960
-It's now or never. Pear! -Don't.

520
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,360
Go ahead.

521
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,800
Pear!

522
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
Pear.

523
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes?

524
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,520
We're allowed to print the names of someone we like on the jerseys.

525
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,800
-Pear, look at Boss's shirt. -Where?

526
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,920
Here.

527
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,200
"Cute Piggy"?

528
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,600
-What? -Who do you have a crush on?

529
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,040
It's really "Cute Piggy," man.

530
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,040
That's cute.

531
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,280
They spelled it wrong.

532
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm going to check out the cheerleading team.

533
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,960
Bye, guys. Good luck to both of you.

534
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,920
-Good luck. -Good luck.

535
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,200
Let me check your costumes.

536
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,240
Let me see.

537
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,400
There, there. Don't cry.

538
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,240
I shouldn't have encouraged you.

539
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,920
2U TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL MATCH 17

540
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,680
When this band is done, you can proceed with the soundcheck.

541
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
Is it okay?

542
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay.

543
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,200
Let's go.

544
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,600
Hey.

545
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
I heard your band changed the vocalist.

546
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,160
That's good.

547
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,880
When you lose, it's on you. No excuses.

548
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,080
Stop barking.

549
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,280
Keep your mouth shut and just sing, dumbass.

550
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Let's go, Wat.

551
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Okay, guys. Let's gather around.

552
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
Come.

553
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,480
We've practiced for so long just for this event.

554
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,920
These past two weeks,

555
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
I know you guys have condemned me silently,

556
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,680
but it's nothing compared to what I've carried for two years.

557
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,440
Forget all the struggles we had. Just go out there and do your best.

558
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,160
I admit that, at first, I just wanted to get

559
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,400
what I missed last time.

560
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,560
But spending time with you for two weeks gave me a new idea.

561
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,080
No matter what happens, smile away.

562
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,320
Just play it with your heart.

563
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
No matter what the result is, I'll be happy with it.

564
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,400
-Are you ready? -Ready!

565
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,800
-Are you ready? -Ready!

566
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,800
One, two, three.

567
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,040
-Ctrl S! -Ready.

568
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
Ready!

569
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,160
Boss, you can do it!

570
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,480
I will do everything

571
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,280
I will try every possible way

572
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,760
It makes me know

573
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,200
How we are going to be

574
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,480
It doesn't matter who you like

575
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,480
Just look at me

576
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:21,240
That's all That's all it takes to make me happy

577
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,760
I don't care who you like

578
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,240
It doesn't matter what the reality is

579
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,200
All I know is that you are the one

580
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,560
In my heart

581
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,160
The referee just blew his whistle to end the first half.

582
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,760
-What happened? -They're now tied at 1-1.

583
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,720
We will see who wins this game in the second half.

584
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,240
-Let's take a break here. -Sure.

585
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,120
You can use the toilet in the meantime.

586
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,400
Come back again for the second half.

587
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Damn it.

588
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,200
Is the contest over? We came to see your team compete.

589
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,640
It isn't. We've just reached halftime.

590
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,280
I just saw Dim earlier.

591
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,200
He said his band is about to perform too.

592
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
What are you going to do?

593
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,800
Too bad the football match started late.

594
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,520
I'm not sure I can make it there on time.

595
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,560
Tine.

596
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,840
You can go and support Wat.

597
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,400
I can take care of things for you here.

598
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,840
It's all right. Don't worry about me.

599
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,200
Just do the best you can.

600
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
I will do my best here as well.

601
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,280
-Hey. -It's fine.

602
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,480
You sound cooler than Fong now.

603
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Is this possible?

604
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,480
You're so cool.

605
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,480
Right.

606
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,040
Fong. Ohm.

607
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
You two should go and see Wat.

608
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,800
-Us? -Right. I'll catch up with you later. Go.

609
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,600
Thanks, guys.

610
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,320
-Go ahead. -Okay.

611
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
Let's go.

612
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,080
That one with the Duper White jersey is as good as a Japanese player.

613
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,880
-They're neck and neck. -Of course.

614
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
There are three minutes left.

615
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,840
-Right. -If they still tie, it's going to be fun.

616
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,280
-How so? -We'll need to go for extra time.

617
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,320
Boss, you can do it!

618
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,200
It's number two, Cute Piggy. He has the ball.

619
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,920
-He speeds up and runs to the goal. -Yes.

620
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
He shook one player off.

621
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,280
-He went on and shook another off. -Wow.

622
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,200
He's now in the penalty area.

623
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
And he just got tackled there.

624
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,960
-Will the referee give a yellow card? -I think so.

625
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,520
There's a call for a penalty kick towards the end of the game.

626
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,440
Goodness.

627
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,760
A penalty kick!

628
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,560
-Right now, we only have one minute left. -Yes.

629
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,880
If he can make it, we sure have the winner of this game.

630
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,920
But if he can't, we'll need extra time.

631
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,880
This kick will decide the result.

632
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,640
-Goal. -Goal.

633
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,000
-Goal. -Goal.

634
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,360
-Goal. -Goal.

635
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,560
And…

636
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,280
With you

637
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,080
-Awesome. -Hey.

638
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,720
This is our last song.

639
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,560
Do your best.

640
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
When will Tine come?

641
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm so happy to be here again today.

642
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,840
I was here once, looking for someone,

643
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
but I didn't find him.

644
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,080
He's also here today,

645
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,520
but I don't think he can make it on time.

646
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,520
That's okay, though.

647
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,280
No matter how far apart we are,

648
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,640
we always feel close to each other.

649
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,400
This song is called "Together."

650
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
GLOWING BRIGHT

651
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,680
Walking past people They were merely strangers

652
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
This was how I felt Whenever I looked at them

653
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,880
Every time

654
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,720
All the time

655
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,160
Looking back into the memories I had

656
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,080
There used to be just me The only one I knew there was me

657
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,920
Always me

658
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,400
Always me

659
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,880
Time used to be nothing more than a breeze

660
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,800
But a person has made my time

661
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,520
Become more meaningful

662
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
A person has changed

663
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,240
Everything in my life

664
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,240
That person can make me smile

665
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,000
No matter how sad I am

666
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,160
You are that person Who has changed my view on love

667
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,320
I may not totally understand why

668
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,160
Maybe we are meant to be together

669
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,400
Thank you.

670
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
They all forgot about me.

671
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,840
Here.

672
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,760
How is your leg? Does it still hurt?

673
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,640
A lot, actually.

674
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,040
I can't feel my knee.

675
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,640
How are you going to get home in this condition?

676
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Well…

677
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,680
I don't know.

678
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,360
I don't think I can go by myself.

679
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,040
Well, how about…

680
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
I call a cab for you?

681
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,280
A taxi.

682
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,840
-A taxi? -Yes.

683
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,080
I'm willing to help.

684
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,960
Good idea.

685
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,680
Okay. One moment.

686
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,760
And the winner of this year's 2U Music Contest is…

687
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,800
-Ctrl S! -Is…

688
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,920
-Back Off! -The winner is…

689
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,760
-Ctrl S! -The winner is…

690
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,040
Back Off!

691
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,760
And the winner is…

692
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,960
Ctrl S!

693
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,480
Congratulations to Ctrl S.

694
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,400
Give it up for them, guys.

695
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,880
Type.

696
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,400
Look. Am I cool?

697
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,360
I scored the winning goal.

698
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,080
Can you tell me now who Jib is?

699
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,000
Not again.

700
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,840
She is a staff member of the football team.

701
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,320
Pay attention to me. I just won a big game.

702
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,920
I know. I was just teasing you.

703
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,440
What reward do you want most?

704
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I don't want any reward.

705
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I just want you to see the goal medal yourself.

706
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,600
-Okay, then. -There you are.

707
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,160
You came at the last minute, Tine.

708
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,560
I ran as fast as I could.

709
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,520
Hey.

710
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,320
Thanks for your support today.

711
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,440
You too, Ohm.

712
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,360
See you. Bye.

713
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,320
Bye.

714
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,360
-What are we going to eat? -How about hotpot?

715
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
She just thanked me.

716
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,640
But she touched my arm.

717
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,800
She looked into my eyes.

718
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,160
But she grabbed my shoulder. She likes me.

719
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,120
-Are you sure? -Yes.

720
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
What's with you guys?

721
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,600
She likes me. You can ask Tine. Do you agree with me, Tine?

722
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,600
She likes me.

723
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,080
Are you free this Saturday?

724
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
-You're tricking me into building a model? -No, to see a movie.

725
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,120
-Really? -Yes.

726
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,120
It's my turn to play hard-to-get.

727
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,080
So this is how you're going to be?

728
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,800
What a perfect day. Our cheerleading team and band won.

729
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,080
-Bye. -Bye. See you.

730
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,000
See you later, kids.

731
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,680
Where should we celebrate?

732
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,120
-At the pub? Are we going to dance again? -Sure.

733
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,480
How about Thong Lor?

734
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,800
The band is going to celebrate at Jae Tun's tonight.

735
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,240
If you guys don't have plans,

736
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
you can come and join us.

737
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,200
Are you just saying that or what?

738
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,960
I can go, but I get to make the call about that thing.

739
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,920
Again? That thing again?

740
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,720
No way!

741
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,480
Then get lost.

742
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,480
Guys, let's throw our own party.

743
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,880
Bye!

744
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,680
What are you looking at?

745
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,840
Why did you tag me when you posted a picture of yourself?

746
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,840
Who told you it's just me? It's a picture of us.

747
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,800
A picture of us?

748
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,480
I somehow got the familiar vibe being here.

749
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
So I looked it up in my gallery.

750
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,600
I didn't expect I would find a familiar face in there.

751
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,520
Is that me?

752
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Me?

753
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
That means…

754
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,000
the guy I saw at that concert was you.

755
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,280
Thank you for looking for me.

756
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,440
Thank you for coming back to me.

757
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,000
You looked so hot that day.

758
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,680
I look much hotter now.

759
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,240
I saw you from behind back then.

760
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,080
What a shame. The other band performs the last act tonight.

761
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,040
If today was that day,

762
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,800
we'd get to hear Scrubb songs again.

763
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
You can hear it tonight.

764
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,480
Again?

765
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,320
Same old trick.

766
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,560
It always works, though.

767
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,280
Your ear, please.

768
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,000
Thanks.

769
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,080
I think I get it now.

770
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,600
What?

771
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,800
Do you want to know?

772
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,320
Come closer.

773
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,200
Come closer.

774
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,360
Damn you.

775
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,080
There are many people around here.

776
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,680
Where are they?

777
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,240
-I saw no one. -They're all inside.

778
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,160
I'll just show them this.

779
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,520
But no one saw us.

780
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,960
You're unbelievable.

781
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,080
Are you blushing?

782
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,040
No.

783
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,160
I now get

784
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,480
how good it is to have you by my side.

785
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,880
Two years ago, we bumped into each other.

786
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,840
Last year, we waved our hands at a concert together.

787
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,440
This year, we stand next to one another.

788
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,880
The years to come… It can be anywhere as long as we're together.

789
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,560
