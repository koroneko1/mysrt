&lrm;[Chloe huffs] This is rubbish.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.500
&lrm;I don't have a thing to wear.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.380
&lrm;This one is way too pink,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.220
&lrm;those are so last season,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.220
&lrm;those ones didn't cost enough

&lrm;I hate all of these!

&lrm;Come back, shoes.

&lrm;[snoring]

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.700
&lrm;That girl's a wreck.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.540
&lrm;Maybe she misses her BFF.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.300

&lrm;What is it, Chloe?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.860
&lrm;Someone pulled my hair.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.180
&lrm;I didn't do it, Mrs M.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.580
&lrm;It wasn't her!

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.020
&lrm;It's... it's some...
&lrm;invisible, mystical being,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.140
&lrm;like a leprechaun or a unicorn,
&lrm;without the horn.

&lrm;[laughter]

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.700
&lrm;Quiet, everyone. Eyes on your papers!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.660
&lrm;[gasping] It's happening again.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.620
&lrm;Chloe, sit down.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.340
&lrm;I can't. My purse is beating me up.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.460
&lrm;Chloe, don't run in the classroom!

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.420
&lrm;Get back to your seat.

&lrm;Miss, I have to go to the restroom.

&lrm;Thank you.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.420
&lrm;So do I, please.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.940
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.300
&lrm;Somebody seems to have it in for Chloe.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.820
&lrm;The hard part is finding out who doesn't.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.580

&lrm;Something strange is going on.

&lrm;Damaging my daughter's reputation is like

<i>&lrm;soiling the reputation of</i>
<i>&lrm;the Mayor of Paris, which is me.</i>

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.300
&lrm;An attack on Chloe is an attack on Paris.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.860
&lrm;We'll find the culprit, you have my word.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.220
&lrm;Chloe, my darling,
&lrm;we've got special guests.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.380
&lrm;[excited] Ladybug!

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.460
&lrm;I knew you'd save me,
&lrm;considering we're good friends.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.700
&lrm;[Mayor] I had to make an emergency call

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.220
&lrm;to all the big designers.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.740
&lrm;Can you imagine my daughter
&lrm;wearing department-store clothing?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.980
&lrm;How humiliating!

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.380
&lrm;[camera clicks]
&lrm;[frustrated groan]

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.780
&lrm;Have you had any run-ins
&lrm;with anyone lately?

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.060
&lrm;I never have run-ins with anyone.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.700
&lrm;Everybody loves me.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.620
&lrm;Really?

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.700
&lrm;Not even with your closest friends?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.780
&lrm;Sabrina?

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.180
&lrm;[puffing] Impossible.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.900
&lrm;She adores me. I'm her idol.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820
&lrm;She's safe here with the doors locked.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.740
&lrm;This enemy may be invisible
&lrm;but it can't go through walls.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.020
&lrm;I'm sure you'll make
&lrm;my life perfect again,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.460
&lrm;like it was before.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.340
&lrm;Is something up?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.940
&lrm;She's hiding something.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.460
&lrm;Whatever you tell us stays in this room.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.780
&lrm;She did have a run-in with someone.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.820
&lrm;[lift beeps] Miss Chloe and Sabrina

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.540
&lrm;like to impersonate Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.980
&lrm;I was playing the part
&lrm;of Big Mustachio that day.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.740
&lrm;Big Mustachio?

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.380
&lrm;One of Chloe's ideas.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.260
&lrm;Big Mustachio wants all Parisians
&lrm;to have heinous moustaches.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.980
&lrm;What a hairy situation?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.660
&lrm;Please, go on.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.140
&lrm;[Mrs Chamack] Thank you for this interview

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.140
&lrm;about your new album, Mr Stone.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.700
&lrm;Can you tell us how...

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.060
&lrm;Jagged Stone?

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.220
&lrm;Ladybug,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.180
&lrm;what are you doing here?

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.900
&lrm;When I heard you were here,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.860
&lrm;I knew you'd want to see me.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.740
&lrm;I had to come say hello.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.420
&lrm;Well, you did right.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.740
&lrm;What's the deal with your hair?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.860
<i>&lrm;I... the old hair was so drab.</i>

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.660
<i>&lrm;This colour is amazing.</i>

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.060
<i>&lrm;Don't you think?</i>

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.140
<i>&lrm;I've got a few minutes to spare.</i>

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.700
<i>&lrm;I'm sure you'd jump at the chance</i>
<i>&lrm;to interview me?</i>

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.660
<i>&lrm;Hey, wait.</i>
<i>&lrm;I thought you here to say hi to me.</i>

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820
<i>&lrm;And I did.</i>

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.620
<i>&lrm;Now, where were we?</i>

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.660
&lrm;She pretended she was me?

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.420
&lrm;How often does that happen?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.140
&lrm;She idolises you.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.820
&lrm;Chloe, I've found Big Mustachio.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.420
<i>&lrm;Chloe? But...</i>

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.900
<i>&lrm;You're not Ladybug. You're a fake!</i>

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.460
<i>&lrm;[Chloe huffs] No, I'm not.</i>

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.300
<i>&lrm;I'm Ladybug, look.</i>

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.900
&lrm;[Chloe huffs] But, Chloe...

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.900
&lrm;How was I supposed to know?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.700
&lrm;That's the problem!

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.460
&lrm;You never know anything!

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.220
&lrm;That crocodile
&lrm;has a larger brain than you!

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.500
&lrm;Get out!
&lrm;I never want to see you again.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.180
&lrm;Mademoiselle does argue
&lrm;with her friend Sabrina at times.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.540
<i>&lrm;I'd say that it's...</i>

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.740
<i>&lrm;"the norm",</i>
<i>&lrm;but it was different this time.</i>

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.940
<i>&lrm;Sabrina came back the next day.</i>

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.740
&lrm;Sabrina who?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.300
&lrm;I don't know any Sabrina.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.780
&lrm;But of course you do, Chloe, it's me...

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.660
&lrm;your BFF.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.020
&lrm;You should talk to her. She's right here.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.940
&lrm;I don't see anyone.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.980
&lrm;She must be invisible.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.180
&lrm;As far as I'm concerned
&lrm;she doesn't even exist.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.060
&lrm;This invisible person,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.260
<i>&lrm;it's Sabrina.</i>

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.500
<i>&lrm;Who's been akumatised by Hawk Moth.</i>

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.860
&lrm;Impossible. She's too weak
&lrm;to do something so bold,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.460
&lrm;especially to me.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.700
&lrm;You're wrong.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.740
&lrm;You've been a great help to us. Thanks.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.580
&lrm;It won't be easy
&lrm;to find someone we can't see.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.100
&lrm;We'll just have to wait
&lrm;for her to find us.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.980
&lrm;And we have an advantage.
&lrm;She doesn't know we're onto her.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.260
&lrm;And now I do, Ladybug.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.020
&lrm;It's time to fulfil
&lrm;our agreement, Vanisher.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.260
&lrm;Cat Noir and Ladybug are at your mercy.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.740
&lrm;Take their Miraculouses
&lrm;and bring them to me!

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.980
&lrm;They'll never see me coming, Hawk Moth.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.260
&lrm;The flower... it...

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.420
&lrm;[gust of wind]

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.460
&lrm;Look out, Ladybug!

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.420
&lrm;If it really is you, Sabrina,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.820
&lrm;then I'll be the one to take you down.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.420
&lrm;You didn't get my costume.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.180
&lrm;Now, you'll have to face me.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.500
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.300
&lrm;How handy.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.860
&lrm;Looking for me Sabrina?

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.780
&lrm;I'm right here. Come on!

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.460
&lrm;Oh no, seriously? You need to leave!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.100
&lrm;If you stop this ridiculousness right now,

&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.900
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.900
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.340
&lrm;Miraculous ladybug!

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.860
&lrm;What am I doing here?

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.100
&lrm;Pound it!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.100
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.380
&lrm;Chloe...

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.060
&lrm;I'm really sorry.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.900
&lrm;I should have taken your advice.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.540
&lrm;Well, in that case...

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.700
&lrm;I might reconsider.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.980
&lrm;Reconsider what?

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.020
&lrm;I might just have to stay
&lrm;your most devoted fan after all.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.860
&lrm;Yeah... well...

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.900
&lrm;Thanks... I suppose.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.620
&lrm;In that case,
&lrm;let me offer you some advice.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.820
&lrm;you should work things out
&lrm;with your friend, Sabrina.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.380
&lrm;Well, since it's coming from Ladybug...

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.460
&lrm;Thanks for your advice, Cat Noir.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.260
&lrm;Course, we're a team, aren't we?

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.060
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.700
&lrm;[Ladybug] Unstoppable.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.220
&lrm;Bug out!

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.780
&lrm;[school bell rings]

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.660
&lrm;Hey, here's Antibug.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500
&lrm;And Vanisher.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.420
&lrm;Now all we need
&lrm;is Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.980
&lrm;Well? What are you doing? Sit down.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.900
&lrm;Did you see that?
&lrm;Chloe smiled nicely... kind of.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.900
&lrm;I think she's actually happy
&lrm;to have Sabrina back.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.540
&lrm;Weirdly, I think the feeling's mutual.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.820
&lrm;And put it on your sweater.
&lrm;It'll make it less horrible.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.900
&lrm;Thank you, Chloe.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.820
&lrm;Yeah, yeah, show me your gratitude later,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.260
&lrm;class is starting.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.380
&lrm;I think they'll always be BFFs,
&lrm;in their own way.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.260
&lrm;I still prefer our way.
