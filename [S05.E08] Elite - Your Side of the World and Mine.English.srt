1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,160
What matters is we have this now.

2
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,960
Who could it be this late?

3
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,439
Samuel, I need to speak with you.

4
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,280
Alone.

5
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,640
Ever since my mother died,

6
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
my family's been
on the verge of falling apart.

7
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,520
It is true
that there is a thread, um, binding us,

8
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,799
connecting us all,

9
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,200
and…

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,040
…that even when it seems about to break,
in the end, it always prevails.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,319
But if you hand that card
over to the police,

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
that thread will forever be broken,
Samuel.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,239
But I will accept
whatever you decide.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,519
If you decide to protect yourself,

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,079
I'll understand it.

16
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,560
Okay?

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,719
Oh, I know Samuel, and I know the way
he looked at me when we were talking.

18
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,959
He's fond of you, and he loves me.

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
He won't hand the card in. We can relax.

20
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,319
I don't remember a thing.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,919
Yeah? That's because we all had
a great time.

22
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,199
The Ibiza paradox.
The less you remember, the better.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,599
So, always live in the present.

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Good morning.

25
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,159
Hi.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Remember anything about Ibiza?

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,680
No.

28
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,319
We did too many drugs.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,879
Iván, I don't understand.
Why are you so worried?

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,560
You had a great time.
Just look at your Stories, right? No?

31
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,879
But was there anything strange?

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
What are…?

33
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,439
Come on.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,639
All that happened is we went to my empire
and had a fucking great time there.

35
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,080
But hey, don't thank me.

36
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,159
I don't know.
You try to remember something.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
Because I'm trying, and I can't.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Come on, dude. Join us.

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
What was I doing?

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
And you?

41
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,080
Did you join them?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,120
The thing is just,

43
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,960
I think Isadora seems…

44
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,719
-I don't know. She seems… fine, right?
-Fine?

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, if anything bad had happened,
she wouldn't be like that, right?

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Come on, Iván.

47
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,280
No fucking way, Phillipe.
I could never do that, man.

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,919
I'm not that kind of guy.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Oh, and I am?
Is that it? I'm that kind of guy?

50
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,599
No, man. Uh, I mean…
That's not what I meant. Phillipe.

51
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
I need you to disappear.

52
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,960
I need to fucking erase you

53
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,560
once and for all from my mind,

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,439
Patrick.

55
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,399
You two hooked up?

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
Come on, you coulda told me.
I mean, really.

57
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
-Just like you told me you fucked him?
-Sorry, what?

58
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,720
Am I the only one of us
who hasn't fucked this guy?

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,399
Is he just really good in bed?

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,079
Stick to Rebeka, sweetie.

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,920
Rebeka's history.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I mean, come on. He messaged you, though.

63
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,480
No, he got mixed up
because he was on drugs.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Okay, but maybe
what he mixed up was the name,

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,439
and what he wanted to say was,
"I need to erase you from my mind, Ari."

66
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,680
I don't think so. It wasn't for her.

67
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,639
-Yeah.
-For sure.

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
Uh…

69
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,319
All right. Fuck you both.

70
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,160
I won't fuck up their lives
or Ari's.

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,319
Benjamín will help me
with the trial, like he promised,

72
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,959
and he'll secure my future.

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,920
-Done. We all win.
-You're right.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
That's how integrity dies.

75
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,879
By chasing empty promises. That's great.

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Yeah, I love Ari.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
I also want to survive
and get what's mine.

78
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,199
So, does that make me a shitty person?

79
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,120
Rebe, give the card back to Mencía.

80
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,199
And while you're at it,
cut the shit and win her back.

81
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,680
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

82
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,680
-You're not fucking serious.
-What?

83
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,879
I won't let you go to jail
if you're not guilty, dude.

84
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,639
You really wanna see
the Benjamíns as your family?

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
'Cause they blinded you with their pools
and promises and shit?

86
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,680
Know where your real family is?
In Morocco.

87
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,000
And with Omar, who's there supporting you,
no matter what you decide.

88
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,399
And me too. I stuck my neck out for you.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,680
I gave up the fucking love of my life.

90
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,879
You didn't ask me to.
I did it willingly.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,079
Because lovers come and go,
Samuel, but friends are what stay.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
And I consider you my best friend.

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,720
Know what you are to Benjamín?
You're a fucking pebble in his shoe,

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,240
and all he wants
is to dispose of you as soon as he can.

95
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,600
Get that through your fuckin' head.

96
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,279
Yeah?

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,959
Caye, I need your help.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,800
I can't. Sorry.

99
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,319
-I'm fired. I'm picking up my stuff.
-It's urgent. Please.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,199
She denies that anything strange happened,
but I know that it did.

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, I don't know.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,279
The thing is, I can't remember.

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,519
What makes you think that?

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,920
Well, we were all super wasted
around her, and,

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,959
honestly, I don't think
we were in control of our actions.

106
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,600
Caye,
please don't look at me like that.

107
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,439
Maybe it's all in my mind,
Nothing like that happened.

108
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,279
Sure, now that I'm reacting,
maybe it's all in your mind?

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
What the fuck, Phillipe?

110
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,079
I'm trying to do the right thing,
I promise you.

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Where is she? I want to talk to her.

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,759
Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you.

113
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,879
Maybe she'll open up to you more than me.

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
And you can talk things out more.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,839
Hey.

116
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,040
Just what I fuckin' needed.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,759
How was Ibiza?

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,439
Fuckin' awesome. Thank you.

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,120
Man, I told you yesterday,
and I'm telling you now, okay?

120
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,759
Leave me alone.

121
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,120
I see.

122
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,839
So, now that you've come down
from that huge high of all the drugs

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,839
you did in Ibiza,
you've forgotten the message.

124
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,079
What message?

125
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,040
The one you sent Ari.

126
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,319
By mistake.
Because it was meant for me, huh?

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,879
"I need to fucking erase
you once and all from my mind, Patrick."

128
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,839
I got
the names mixed up, okay?

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,079
Because I'd taken a bunch of drugs
and because you really hurt me, Patrick.

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,680
But it was for Ari, okay?

131
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,960
In any case, it makes no difference
who I sent it to

132
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,159
because… I'm moving
to Qatar with my father.

133
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,720
What?

134
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,240
To be honest, I'm looking forward
to the sun and beach all year round.

135
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm sick of this fucking cold weather.

136
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,720
Ah.

137
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Isadora?

138
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,679
-Don't come in, babe. I'm naked.
-You're good.

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,399
Don't worry. I kinda assumed
you weren't showering in a wet suit.

140
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
I'll talk to you from here, okay?

141
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,360
-What do you want?
-Um… I just…

142
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,919
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm with you.

143
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,840
And that… that you can count on me
for whatever you need

144
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,639
because I'll believe you.

145
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,240
I'll support you until the end.

146
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,399
What's wrong with you?

147
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,600
What, are you the one
doing drugs at school now?

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,559
I'm talking about Ibiza.

149
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,559
So, you've been gossiping
with Phillipe behind my back.

150
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,559
He was worried about you,
so he came to talk to me.

151
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,320
I've told him 1,000 times,
and with you, this will make 1,001.

152
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,840
Nothing went on. You got that?

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,279
Okay? Nothing.

154
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Right.

155
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,399
No pressure.
You don't have to say anything to anyone.

156
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,360
But I just want you to know
that you also have a right to talk,

157
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,679
if that's what you want.

158
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
Whatever you do,
it's fine if that's what you want to do.

159
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,720
Isa?

160
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,480
Baby?

161
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,279
I know you can't wait
to get your revenge on me.

162
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,200
That you're just dying
to have that "I told you so" moment

163
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,519
and paint me as a victim like you.

164
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,799
But not only am I not one,

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I won't give you the satisfaction.

166
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,120
-You sure about that?
-Yeah.

167
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,799
If Phillipe doesn't remember,
it's because he passed out

168
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,480
in the middle of the party like everyone.

169
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,759
That's it.
Can you drop it, please? I'm so over it.

170
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,200
Okay, okay. All right.

171
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,080
It's okay.

172
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,960
And just know my offer to support you
has no expiration date.

173
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,879
None.

174
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm no longer the cleaning lady

175
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,799
because Benjamín fired me
for sneaking into his office last night.

176
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,120
And so, if you want,
I'll tell you about it over a drink.

177
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,919
We can be friends whenever you want.

178
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,279
Or whenever you need it.

179
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Just call me, okay?

180
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,480
Give me the SIM card.
I'm gonna go give it to the cops.

181
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,200
I don't trust you.

182
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,000
You're gonna trick me to help Ari.

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,919
She said she'd accept
whatever I did, right?

184
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,559
Let's see if that's true.

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

186
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,000
Samuel?

187
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,600
Samuel!

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,519
Samuel.

189
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,279
Where are you now?

190
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm over at the police station.

191
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,600
I see.

192
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,360
Listen to me.

193
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
Before you hand it over,

194
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm gonna ask you to please give me
the opportunity to talk to you in person.

195
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,320
Do it in honor of… the relationship
of mutual trust we've built,

196
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,879
even though you think I've betrayed you.

197
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,919
But I'm pleading. I'm begging you.

198
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,159
Do it for me and for my family.

199
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,039
I'm hoping that
we can maybe talk face to face.

200
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,639
Samuel?

201
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
All right, then.

202
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,200
See you at your place.

203
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm gonna need you to take your siblings
and go and entertain them for the evening.

204
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,720
And don't come back
until I call you, okay?

205
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,519
I need to talk to Samuel alone.

206
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,320
Guys,

207
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,200
I think she's unconscious.

208
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,120
I think Isadora's passed out.

209
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,519
Come on, dude. Join us.

210
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,000
It was fuckin' awesome.

211
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,080
-Come on. Tell me it wasn't awesome, guys.
-Quiet.

212
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
Hey.

213
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,360
What are you doing, you idiot?

214
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,559
Stop filming her!

215
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,440
Calm down, Your Highness.

216
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
This is fucking mind-blowing.

217
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,600
Stop, guys!

218
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,600
Iván.

219
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,159
We need to reach Isadora, man.

220
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,519
Hey.
I'm gonna put this on the door.

221
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,759
Hey, she had passed out already.

222
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,839
So, what? She was totally into it.
We were all wasted and partying and--

223
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,240
-"So, what?" That doesn't excuse it.
-Oh, come on.

224
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,200
She was the one who said to strip naked
and make ourselves at home.

225
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,880
She was horny.

226
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,799
That's no excuse, okay?
It doesn't matter if she was into it!

227
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
Once she passed out,
it should have stopped!

228
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Seriously?

229
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,799
Of all people, you think you have
any right to lecture me on nuances?

230
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,319
Get this nuance, you bastard!

231
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,359
Phillipe, stop!

232
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,400
-Phillipe, stop!
-You're a dead man!

233
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,440
-I swear!
-Know what? You were also at that party.

234
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,440
We didn't do anything!
We didn't touch her!

235
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,240
You would have if you hadn't been so high!

236
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,640
-Fucking stop it!
-Get off!

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,359
We're gonna do things right, okay? Relax.

238
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,640
Son of a bitch. Let's go.

239
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh, my shady Barbie.

240
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,240
Hey, dude,
I'm gonna miss you like bonkers.

241
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,759
-Me too.
-Mm-hmm.

242
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,200
Without you, these hallways just aren't…

243
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,839
-I'll see you out in the world, won't I?
-I mean, I'd hope so. Right?

244
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Yeah, of course.

245
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
Well, now I'm gonna follow my dreams.
But we'll see each other, absolutely.

246
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,680
Hey, you and I should start
something together, y'know?

247
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,599
Got a plan?

248
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,839
-Maybe doing porcelain nails?
-Porcelain nails, huh?

249
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,680
-Don't laugh, Caye. I'm being serious.
-Okay.

250
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,519
-No, no, no. Hit me.
-So, fuck. Hear me out.

251
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,279
I'll put up the bread,
or my old lady will. I'm straight broke.

252
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,720
-You'll design them.
-Uh-huh.

253
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
We'll strike it rich. You're a genius.

254
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,240
-Stop laughin'. I'm fuckin' serious.
-Know what?

255
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,599
I've actually never thought of that,
but maybe we should--

256
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
My God.

257
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,880
-Shit. Fuckin' crazy.
-Yeah, I know.

258
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,119
Okay, but anyway…

259
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,920
So, you and Mencía…?

260
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
-Rebe, come on. Life is short.
-I know.

261
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,119
Don't waste your time
wondering how things could've been.

262
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,279
Text her.

263
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,200
Imagine you've just started liking guys,
and then you move to Qatar?

264
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,640
Iván's in for a shock.

265
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,119
-How about a sibling afternoon?
-Oh, yes. Please.

266
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,799
-Wait for me outside, okay?
-Okay.

267
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,440
WE'RE MEETING AT SAMU'S
FOR A DRINK. WANT TO JOIN US?

268
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,319
-Should we go?
-Mm-hmm.

269
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
She's coming this way.

270
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,720
I am such a dumbass.

271
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
So, Qatar, huh?

272
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
-Yeah.
-Can I sit with you?

273
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,559
I don't think that's a good idea, Patrick.

274
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,680
When are you leaving?

275
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,200
This weekend.

276
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,200
I'd like to say goodbye to you.

277
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,960
To say our goodbyes together.

278
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
I'll be outside.

279
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,720
We weren't discussing anything special.

280
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,079
Iván.

281
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,720
To what do I owe the surprise?

282
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,119
Well…

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,599
…let's see.

284
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,000
You told me to text when I'm ready
to come to your side of town.

285
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,279
Well, I kinda skipped over
the texting part.

286
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,119
Sorry.

287
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,200
Weren't you working today?

288
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,000
Um, I got fired.

289
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,440
Seriously?

290
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,960
I can explain over drinks
if you want me to.

291
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,000
Uh, but to sum it up for you,

292
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,319
I think it happened
'cause it was meant to happen.

293
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
I wasn't happy.

294
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,799
But I was sometimes. Well, I don't know.

295
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,119
But I feel
like I was getting into a rut, you know?

296
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,920
Like I wasn't fighting
for what I wanted and believed in.

297
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,680
It's a good thing I said,
"To sum it up for you."

298
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,960
I just talked your ear off big time.
Sorry.

299
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,279
Well then, welcome, Cayetana.

300
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,200
Welcome back.

301
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,400
There's nothing I want more
than to do something… normal with you.

302
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,480
Have a normal coffee or a normal beer.

303
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Well, there's nothing I want more than
to have you talking my ear off, actually.

304
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,559
So, that's perfect.

305
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,599
You know what?

306
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,279
There's a tapas bar near here

307
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,519
that serves tapas
the size of a normal meal. Wanna go?

308
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,480
-Yeah, I do.
-Yeah?

309
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,440
Mm-hmm.

310
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,119
Look, uh…

311
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,519
-What?
-Let's go for it.

312
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,960
I mean, let's get this out of the way
because we can't take this tension.

313
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,799
I mean, at least, I can't anymore.

314
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm here.

315
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,799
Hey, Patrick.

316
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Hasn't my father given you the keys yet?

317
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,559
Because, I mean,
that's all he's got left to do now.

318
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,880
Thanks for coming and hearing him out.

319
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,079
-He's waiting for you by the pool.
-Okay.

320
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,039
I WANT TO SEE YOU NOW.

321
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,759
-Girls, something important just came up.
-What?

322
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,680
-Get another taxi. I'll call you later.
-Are you serious?

323
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,400
-Patrick.
-Come on, Patrick!

324
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,440
-Ugh, that's just typical Patrick!
-Hundred percent.

325
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,400
Well, let's get another taxi.
Where are we going?

326
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,440
I have an idea.

327
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,920
What's up, sexy?

328
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,160
-Not here.
-Okay, where, then?

329
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,759
In there.

330
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
What's he doing here?

331
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,480
We all need
to stop running away. Don't you think?

332
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,200
Yeah, good thing you gave me your keys.

333
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,480
'Cause I don't know
what he's doin', but he isn't here.

334
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,240
He's taking way too long,
and it's seriously stressing me out.

335
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,000
Jesus, that is some storm.

336
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, it's about to break here.

337
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,920
-Samuel?
-I'm at Benjamín's.

338
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,519
-Can't talk now.
-What? Why the fuck are you there?

339
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,839
-I'll call you later.
-Samuel?

340
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,720
-All good?
-Yeah.

341
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,000
It was nothing.

342
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,400
-He's at Benjamín's house.
-You see that? I told you, dude.

343
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,200
I said, in the end,
he was gonna screw us over for Ari.

344
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
Just a minute, kid.
Someone's ringin' the doorbell.

345
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,519
Oh, man. It's Mencía.

346
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,079
And with that fuckin' Ari.

347
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,759
What? At my place?

348
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,839
Well, it's not your place anymore.
But, yeah.

349
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,839
-Can I ask what they're doing there?
-Let's see. Hold on.

350
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,960
-Hi.
-Hi.

351
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,640
-I came over, after all.
-And "that fucking Ari" came over too.

352
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,599
-Samuel isn't here.
-Ah, I know that. Samuel's at my house.

353
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,039
Samuel's having a civilized,
British conversation with my father,

354
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,720
so don't worry about him.

355
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,799
While you two talk,
I'm gonna serve myself a drink.

356
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
I haven't had a drink in a bit.
So, why not? Hmm.

357
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,119
Omar, I'll call you back.
I can't talk now. Later.

358
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,400
I know it was wrong,
sneaking in here to get the card.

359
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,240
Well, those who are desperate
do desperate things sometimes.

360
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,000
It was my fault
for putting you in that predicament.

361
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,319
You know, for some time now,

362
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,359
I've been feeling
that my family's falling apart.

363
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
And you're the only person
who's stuck by my side unconditionally.

364
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,799
And what have I given you
in return, Samuel?

365
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,599
Other than promises that are unrealistic
and favors that never came to fruition?

366
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,400
So, here is everything that I owe you

367
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,880
in a form that's a bit more tangible.

368
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,640
It's preadmission to Saïd Business School

369
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,319
at Oxford University.

370
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:33,359
Your tuition, as well as room and board,

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,119
all on my tab.

372
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,559
And there's a 3,000-euro monthly allowance
to cover your expenses.

373
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,960
No questions asked, no explanations.

374
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,599
Complete trust.

375
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,759
Trust means hush money now?

376
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,680
When you finish your studies,
there's a contract awaiting you

377
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,839
on the management team
of my holding company.

378
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,400
I've signed all the papers.

379
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,079
Samuel, what I'm offering you

380
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,920
is a lifetime occupying
the place that is rightfully yours.

381
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,119
A place you've earned.

382
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,039
I'll be honest with you,

383
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,279
my life's in your hands right now.

384
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,759
But then again, so is yours.

385
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,759
This how the world works?

386
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,480
People get an envelope
in exchange for their integrity?

387
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,440
Come on.

388
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,400
You've only stuck by me all this time
because you expected this in return.

389
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,160
And you're the only father figure
I've ever known.

390
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,000
You wanna talk about Ibiza?
Let's talk about Ibiza.

391
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,880
If what really happened
is what you're saying happened…

392
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
…then I am a victim.

393
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,559
Right?

394
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
And you? That makes you what, precisely?
A repeat offender?

395
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,920
I didn't do anything.

396
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,359
Oh, convenient, no?
That you just didn't do anything at all?

397
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,240
I'm sure if I go tell that to everybody,
they'll believe me right away.

398
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,599
Honestly, Phillipe, the best you can do
for both of us is just stop.

399
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,599
And no, nothing went on. Forget it.

400
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
Just move on.

401
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,640
Stop bringing it up,
and let's just carry on with our lives.

402
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,720
Isa…

403
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,839
…I don't know if I've ever told you this…

404
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,319
but I really like you.

405
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Why say this? Why now?

406
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,720
Because honestly,
I want what's best for you.

407
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,960
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure you're all right.

408
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,839
You can trust me, Isadora.

409
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,519
And you can always ask me for help.

410
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,319
No matter what you do,

411
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,119
or whatever you may decide,

412
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,839
whatever happened or didn't happen there,

413
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,920
whether or not you want to forget it.

414
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
To me, you'll still be my empress.

415
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,799
Don't ever forget that.

416
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,559
No one's ever told me anything like that.

417
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,200
Thank you.

418
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,000
I honestly mean it, baby. Thanks.

419
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,880
-Did you sleep together again?
-I'm so sorry. I really screwed up.

420
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,759
Oh, really?

421
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,519
Well, thanks a lot, man.

422
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,839
Look, as far as I'm concerned, guys,

423
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,279
you can run away to Bali
and get married. I don't care.

424
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,680
Was this your plan?
To gang up and hurt me, that right?

425
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,119
Patrick, I want to thank you

426
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,319
because you've helped me finally see
a part of me that…

427
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
that I've been denying a long time.

428
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,559
A part of me that I don't really like
and that I'm not sure I'm prepared for.

429
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:05,920
But

430
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,599
thanks to you, it exists.

431
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,759
It's real. It's made itself known, and…
and now, it's up to me to deal with it.

432
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,279
Don't know how I'll do it,

433
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,240
but I will.

434
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,440
What I won't do again is… sleep with you

435
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,680
because, please don't be offended,
you're just a kid.

436
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,440
And I've reached a certain age, and…

437
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,359
and I've had enough of this sick game of…

438
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,880
you running to me
whenever my son hurts you

439
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
because the fact is that, actually,

440
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,279
he's the one you're really in love with.

441
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,720
Iván.

442
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,319
Forgive me…

443
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Stop, Dad. I don't care.

444
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,319
Both of you, leave me the hell alone!

445
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,079
I don't have feelings for him!
He's all yours!

446
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,559
-Iván.
-No, no, no. Stay here. Don't move.

447
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,480
I turned down Qatar.

448
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,920
We're staying, if that's okay with you.

449
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,440
So, everything you said

450
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,200
about staying away from Patrick

451
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,319
was only to shut me up.

452
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,079
You want to be with him.

453
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,039
That's not why we're staying.

454
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,720
It's because, for the first time,
you're happy somewhere

455
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,319
and you have friends.

456
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,799
You found someone special.

457
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,359
Do it for me.

458
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,119
You should experience this.

459
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,240
I'd never forgive myself
if you didn't because of me.

460
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
I want you to be happy.

461
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,279
And I want us to have a home,
like normal fathers and sons do.

462
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,079
You are everything to me, Iván.

463
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,279
I love you.

464
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,720
I love you so much, son.

465
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,359
We're going to stay.

466
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,519
So that you have a shot at happiness.

467
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,400
Happiness I won't allow myself to have.

468
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,799
Get back in there

469
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,920
and go get him.

470
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,039
Go, son.

471
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,480
Excuse me.

472
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,400
Patrick?

473
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,839
The guy who was sitting
at the table with us.

474
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Uh, he paid the bill and left.

475
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,599
Do you know where he went?

476
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,400
I'm not your father, Samuel.

477
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,519
But if you give me the SIM card…

478
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,599
…you'll want for nothing.

479
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,159
And… And if that's not enough,
then well, whatever you want.

480
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,519
There are some things money can't buy.

481
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,440
-And then you wonder why you're all alone.
-Come on, Samuel.

482
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,199
Give me the fucking card.

483
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,239
Or what?

484
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,519
Run out of things to offer me?

485
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,639
You gonna take it by force?

486
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,719
No.

487
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,679
Dirt on your hands is beneath you.

488
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,960
You're accustomed to
others doing your dirty work.

489
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,280
Give me the damn card.

490
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,559
You're making this difficult.

491
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,599
-Let go!
-Give me the card!

492
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,119
Go ahead, Isadora.

493
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,039
I'm here to, uh…

494
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,320
I'm here to report a… a crime.

495
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
I need to report a rape.

496
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,400
Help me get him out.

497
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,719
We were arguing, and he slipped.
It was an accident, I swear.

498
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,199
Call an ambulance! Come on, do something!

499
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,320
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

500
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,119
-Let me think.
-Think about what?

501
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,840
We don't have time. We have to help him.

502
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,039
-Come on.
-Can't you see it's too late?

503
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,360
They'll want to pin this on me.

504
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,159
If… If they accuse me of this,
this family's going to be broken forever!

505
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,519
Do you hear me?

506
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,760
Patrick, we need to figure this out
between the two of us.

507
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,000
Together, father and son.

508
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,079
Huh?

509
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,559
Don't leave me alone.
Please.

510
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,159
Thank you.

511
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,559
I love you.

512
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,360
Wait for me here. Okay? Wait.

513
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,239
What's the matter?

514
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,880
I think we should stop.

515
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,639
What are we stopping?

516
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,599
This here? Us making out?

517
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,039
Our relationship?

518
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,639
Mencía, I've come to realize that

519
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,360
I love myself without needing you.

520
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,400
And I think that,
right now, I need to be alone.

521
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,920
Patrick, my love.

522
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,039
What?

523
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,679
Yeah, sure. We… We'll be right there.

524
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,159
Ari, not now.

525
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,360
Mencía, I'm sorry.
We have to get back to the house.

526
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,639
Patrick called. Something happened
with Dad and Samuel. I'm not sure what.

527
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,559
Let's go.

528
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,199
Hi, Rebe? Did Samuel show up?

529
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,039
Huh?

530
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,440
Fuck. I'll get changed and come over.

531
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,920
All right.

532
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,239
It's almost ready to go.

533
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,360
We're gonna put him in the car
and drop him off at a hospital.

534
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Like some dog? No.

535
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,280
If we don't want to be implicated,
that's how it is.

536
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,880
Dad?

537
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,039
-What are they doing here?
-Patrick? Samuel?

538
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,760
We need to hide him.

539
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,760
I called them.

540
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,320
-You did what?
-I called them.

541
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,519
Why, goddammit?
Go hide the body behind those bushes.

542
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,280
Hurry. I'll handle the girls.

543
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,800
-Dad!
-What's wrong?

544
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,000
Where is Samuel?

545
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,159
Uh, he left earlier.

546
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,880
What do you mean, he left?
Patrick called. He was worried about him.

547
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,639
He called you?
Uh, well, what did he call to say?

548
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,679
So, what is it you're keeping from us?

549
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,400
Huh?

550
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,639
Ari.

551
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,719
Samuel? Samuel!

552
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,400
Samuel, are you all right?

553
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,280
What happened? Where's Samuel?

554
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,280
I told you, he left.
I don't know where he is.

555
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,440
Not sure how
since his bike's still outside.

556
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,639
-Dad! Dad!
-No.

557
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,840
No, no. Don't call him over.

558
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,360
Calm down. You need help.

559
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,559
-Okay? Calm down.
-Your father did it.

560
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,280
-Let me go.
-No. No, no, no. You're delirious.

561
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,039
Let me get away.

562
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,440
Samuel!

563
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,840
Samuel, wait!

564
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,880
Samuel, wait!

565
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,920
Samuel!

566
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,039
Please, get out of my house.

567
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,960
If you did anything to him,
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

568
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,880
Patrick! Patrick!

569
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,480
Patrick!

570
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,159
-Samuel!
-Samuel!

571
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,079
Hey!

572
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,920
What the hell did he do to you?

573
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,719
It was… It was an accident.

574
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,679
It was an accident.

575
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,920
It was an accident.

576
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,039
Patrick, tell them.

577
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,400
-Explain that it was--
-What did you do to him?

578
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,039
-I didn't do anything!
-What?

579
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,960
-I told you. Nothing. He fell!
-Yes, please. It's urgent.

580
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,000
-What? He fell. Samuel!
-No!

581
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,559
Tell them, Samuel, how you fell
and hit your head on the side--

582
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,719
Stop it, Dad!

583
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,360
The police are gonna come. That's it.

584
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,199
He did it. He did it.

585
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,880
He did it.

586
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,360
Samuel?

587
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,159
Samuel, look at me.

588
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,559
Hey. Look at me, man. Look at me.

589
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,679
No!

590
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,639
Samuel, come on. Samuel.

591
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,119
Samuel? Dude, look at me.

592
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,199
Samuel. Samuel?

593
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,280
Samuel?

594
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,639
Ari.

595
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

596
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,000
Samuel, look at me. Samuel.

597
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,400
Samuel.

598
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,159
Hey, Samu.

599
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,800
We're going home, man. C'mon.

600
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,800
Samuel?

601
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,400
Hang in there, okay? We're leaving.

602
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,320
Hey…

603
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:37,159
POLICE
