00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,240
Where are Pure and Folk?

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
Folk isn't feeling well.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,280
So Pure is taking him to a doctor.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,600
He also said he's sorry
for not being able to tell you himself.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,801
I see.

8
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,041
It's fine, actually.

9
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,080
The activities today don't matter much.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,240
Anyway, he is okay, isn't he?

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,651
Pure said he's feeling better.

12
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,011
Was it because of me?

13
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,601
Folk will be fine.

14
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,641
He has Pure.

15
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,160
Pure is good at comforting people.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,401
Trust me.

What are you smiling at?

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,521
You seemed fond of my smile last night.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
So I'm smiling at you again.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,481
What's up with you?

37
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,640
Are you into me?

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Yes.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,279
You're exactly my type.

40
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,080
It's too bad...

41
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,039
that we are friends.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
Woe is me!

43
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,400
Have you heard of the term
"friends with benefits?"

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,599
Hey.

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,000
That's my favorite English expression,
second only to one-night stand.

46
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,680
Why do you ask?

47
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,599
Are you smitten by me?

48
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,079
Not really.

49
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,479
I just don't know
why I should make my life difficult.

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,041
If love is hard,

51
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,781
I want to try simpler things,

52
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:13,861
like sex.

53
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,320
Right.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,479
Good for you.

55
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,250
But...

56
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,439
to do "friends with benefit" with me...

57
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,341
there's one thing
that you might find hard.

58
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,450
What is that?

59
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,999
Positions.

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,039
Ah, don't get excited.

61
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,919
Do you see this?

62
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,080
Okay. Fine.

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,359
I see.

64
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,799
Now that you've slept with me,
you think you can do whatever, right?

65
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,130
How about some other time?

66
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm tired today.

67
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,559
Okay.

68
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,280
I'll leave then.

69
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,201
By the way,

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,320
I'll be right next door.

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Holler if you need anything.

72
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,359
My friend with benefits.

73
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,679
See you later.

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,119
Oh.

75
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,520
Darn it.

76
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,359
What's the matter with you?

77
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,679
Oh.

78
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,439
There's a car crash outside my room.

79
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,200
Can I take refuge here for a while?

80
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,680
Manage your traffic light better then.

81
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,200
Or else, it might happen
outside my room too.

82
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,760
I don't want to deal with any casualties.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,000
Come on.

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,359
Don't worry about that.

85
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm not high maintenance.

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,741
I don't care if you cremate
or bury my body.

87
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:50,821
You can do whatever you want.

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Anyway,

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,239
what are you doing?

90
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,959
Making breakfast.

91
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,479
I'm making porridge.
There is pork, shrimp, and seaweed.

92
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:03,999
Do you want some?

93
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,120
The taste, however,

94
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
isn't that great.

95
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,400
Want to taste?

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Here.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
What's up with you?

98
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:20,640
Nothing.

99
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
It's just I never had this kind of moment
with any of my partners.

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,080
When you drop the "with benefits..."

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,679
you still have "friends," right?

102
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,200
So, do you want some?

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Hurry up.

104
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,520
All right.

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
-What do you have?
-I'll let you choose.

106
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
I choose...

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,000
Can I have this?

108
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,279
No, you can't have it.
There's only one packet.

109
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,440
Why can't I?

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,159
-Choose something else.
-All right. I'll choose this one.

111
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,560
You're choosing mine.

112
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
Can't I?

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,119
-You can't.
-You said there's one packet.

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Are you lying to me?

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
Are you almost done?

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes. Just one more question left.

117
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,599
Whoa.

118
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,679
That's quick.

119
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,119
Oh, Folk!

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
Come sit with us.

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,760
(Ethics?)

122
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,159
Greetings.

123
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:20,399
It looks like a lot of first-year students
enrolled in my class this year.

124
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,320
I'm delighted to see this.

125
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,919
So, I've prepared a pre-test for fun.

126
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,640
It's for you to assess
your pre-existing knowledge.

127
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Boo!

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,221
But before we begin the test,

129
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:37,010
I'd like to ask you the classic question.

130
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,490
The question is...

131
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,400
What is ethics?

132
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,400
Yes, Ittikorn?

133
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,719
Pantoon wants to answer the question.

134
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,599
So, Pantoon?

135
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,919
I'm listening.

136
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:18,040
Ethics is separating right from wrong.

137
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,920
The Thai term is derived from two words,
etiquette and virtue.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,719
Etiquette is the rules for behavior.

139
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,640
Virtue is moral goodness.

140
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,621
To put it briefly,

141
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,280
ethics means having a sense
of what is right and wrong.

142
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,879
That's a very good explanation, Pantoon.

143
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,679
Guys, give him a round of applause.

144
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,160
Stop messing with me.

145
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,439
You're clever.

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,520
You should know how to stop me.

147
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,400
I will win the contest.

148
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,000
I will beat you.

149
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,079
And I will get my earring back.

150
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,640
Quit promising the impossible.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,199
Get it for me?

152
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,250
Get it yourself.

153
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,959
-I'm leaving.
-Sure.

154
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,079
See you.

155
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,199
Folk.

156
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,559
Can I talk to you?

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,880
Folk, are you mad at me?

158
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,199
No, I'm just...

159
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,319
I'm just trying to get over you.

160
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,799
Can you give me some time?

161
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
All right.

162
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,120
I understand.

163
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,520
What are those?

164
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,039
Face masks and hand sanitizer.

165
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51,719
This Mr. 950 of yours
sure has a creative mind.

166
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:59,360
(Take care. Mr. 950)

167
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,400
Got the present. Thanks a lot.

168
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,400
Next time, don't bother. I feel bad.

169
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,160
Please let me do something for you.

170
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,719
(Mr. 950: Please let me do something
for you.)

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
(2020 Star Contest)

172
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,239
Okay, guys.

173
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,560
There will be special rules
for this year's Popular Vote award.

174
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,839
This time, they're different.

175
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,081
Since our contest is based
on the concept of social responsibility,

176
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:49,421
the voting scores
will come from two sources.

177
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:52,301
First is the vote count
for each competitor.

178
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:55,479
Second is the amount donated
to the account...

179
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,280
for which each competitor is a campaigner.

180
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,240
But what hasn't changed
is that each individual...

181
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,240
has to prepare their own show.

182
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,759
Did I make myself clear?

183
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,079
If not, please read the sheets.

184
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,959
All right. That's it for today.
You're dismissed.

185
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,000
Waan, is there anything you want to say?

186
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
Well...

187
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,959
It's my friend.

188
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,199
He wanted to invite you to a meal.

189
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,080
This friend of yours
has asked about me a lot.

190
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,679
So, who is he?

191
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,160
Well, I guess he couldn't make it today.

192
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,320
My apologies.

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,639
I should go.

194
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,359
No, wait.

195
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm not accepting your apology.

196
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,001
You invited me.
You should take responsibility for that.

197
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,441
You want me to take responsibility?

198
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:54,120
Okay. Sure. I got this.

199
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,541
-Sure.
-How bad of him.

200
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,781
I'll take responsibility.

201
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:58,921
-For sure.
-Right.

202
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,221
-Let's go. Okay.
-Should we go now?

203
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,661
Come on. I'll take responsibility.

206

No.

207
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,000
I just came up with a scene for my novel.
I've got to write it down quickly.

208
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,520
You're always like this,
burying your head in a novel.

209
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,520
This is why your life doesn't go anywhere.

210
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,861
Well, if my real life
didn't have a good man like Pai,

211
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,340
I'd prefer to continue
burying my head in a novel.

212
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,120
What about sex?

213
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,880
Unlike you, I'm not like a lover boy.

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,959
Besides, I've got other things
to do in life.

215
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,839
Don't you ever get bored
thinking about it every day?

216
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,479
I should go.

217

Let's party.
I've got something to show you.

221
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm not going.

222
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,559

Oh!

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,400

And relax right here.

248

Feeling better?

249
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,640
A little.

250
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,519
Now, tell me where you got stuck.

251
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,160
You see,

252
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,080
there are two characters in the story.

253
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,050
The first character
is secretly in love with the other one.

254
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,519
And the other one is incapable of love.

255
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,360
I mean,

256
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,959
I can't figure out a scenario
where they fall in love.

257
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,719
Well...

258
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,810
That's hard.

259
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,330
Do they need a scenario to fall in love?

260
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,279
Without a doubt.

261
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,239
Then how would love happen?

262
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,400
I haven't been in love
for a very long time.

263
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,720
But I don't think that...

264
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,800
it would take a complicated situation
for me to fall in love with someone.

265
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,839
For example,

266
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,919
if I fell down a mountain
and he came to rescue me.

267
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,399
Not everyone will fall down a mountain.

268
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:18,560
Sometimes, it could
just be the little things in life...

269
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,000
such as the way someone talks,

270
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,519
their temperament,
or how they paying attention.

271
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,279
I read something about this.

272
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:30,760
It's said that love...

273
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,360
can happen easily.

274
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,999
It might happen
as soon as you open up your heart.

275
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,439
Wow, that's good.

276
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,959
I like it.

277
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,840
You must be so forgetful.

278
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,199
I read it from one of the novels here.

279
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,759
-Did you?
-Yes.

280
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,330
Anyway, thanks so much.

281
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,160
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have thought of that.

282
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,400
You don't need to thank me.

283
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,199

can you move this speaker over there?

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,320
That brute has no idea.

371
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,320
He's just a dimwit.

372
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,759
If he hits you again, say something.

373
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,279
Here.

374
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,160
You'll get hit if you stand there
being lost in thought.

375
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,840
Don't you want to play basketball?

376
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,320
I can teach you.

377
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,239
I won't annoy you.

378
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,879
That's why I should be afraid.

379
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,120
Because it's you.

380
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,720
Yes.

381
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,439
Many of our faculty's freshmen
are good players.

382
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,400
-He missed it.
-Yes.

383
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,239
Take it.

384
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,239
What are you doing?

385
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,319
Throw it back.

386
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,929
Generate force from your wrists like this.

387
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,679
Is this what you want?

388
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,279
Here.

389
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,719
Dang it.

390
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,480
Waan.

391
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,889
-Waan.
-Waan!

392
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,759
We need first aid!

393
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,040
Don't move. Let him check on you first.

394
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:44,399
Is it here?

395
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Ouch.

396
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,199
Are you here for Pure?

397
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,319
He's not here.

398
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:15,080
Are you his friend with benefits?

399
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,199
He's been making excuses
not to party with us...

400
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,880
because he wants to spend time with you.

401
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,359
What are you doing?

402
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,369
You must be good.

403
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,120
That's why you can tame him.

404
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,000
What do you mean?

405
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,560
Let me check you out.

406
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,489
-What are you doing?
-I want to know how good you are.

407
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,199
You low-life scum!

408
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,879
Let me go!

409
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,319
Let me go!

410
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:47,839
Let me go!

411
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,679
Ouch!

412
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,960
Let him go!

413
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,719
Get off him!

414
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,520
-What the heck?
-What?

415
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,080
What's gotten into you?

416
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,759
You're not normally like this!

417
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,199
You always share things with me!

418
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,359
What's wrong with you?

419
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,929
He's different.

420
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,080
Get out.

421
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,119
I said, get out!

422
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,440
Now!

423
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
Fine! I'll go!

424
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,319
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me.

425
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,369
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me!

426
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,560
-Listen to me.
-I said, don't touch me!

427
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,520
-Listen to me.
-I've had enough of listening to you.

428
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,279
-Folk...
-You really are a bad person.

(Room 3102 Witsanu Sawetwart
Age: 20 years old)

430
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,960
Your wrist is slightly sprained.

431
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,399
I think that it's more than slightly.

432
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,159
I'm sorry.

433
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,399
You got hurt because of me.

434
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,199
It's not your fault.

435
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,640
I got hurt because of myself.
I wasn't paying attention.

436
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,040
I know you hate me.

437
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,960
But why didn't you take it out on me?

438
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,399
Don't, Pai.

439
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,399
Take your hatred out on me.

440
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:42,489
Punch me.

441
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Come on.

442
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,279
Do it!

443
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:52,279
I didn't mean to hurt him.

444
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:54,359
-I just...
-You hate me.

445
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,359
But from now on,
it won't be one-sided hatred anymore.

446
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,279
Remember,

447
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,849
I hate you too.

448
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:07,080
Guys, please calm down.

449
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,359
Yes. Talk to each other nicely.

450
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,600
All right.

451
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,119
Now that we hate each other,

452
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,040
I'll make it easier for you.

453
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:22,879
I won't bother you anymore.

(Photography club)

455
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,759
Itt, are you there?

456
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,640
Folk must really hate me.

457
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:07,040
What should I do?

458
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,560
Are you ready to settle down?

459
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:20,969
I don't know.

460
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,640
What will you do about Pai?

461
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,279
I don't know.

462
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,640
Well,

463
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,760
I have achieved all of my goals.

464
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,161
It makes me happy just to see him...

465
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,721
stand up for what he wants.

466
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,280
Even if...

467
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,040
that doesn't include me.

468
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,239
It's painful.

469
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:12,759
I did everything...

470
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,201
because I wanted him to be confident
in expressing his opinions,

471
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:21,600
his feelings, and to show his liveliness.

472
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,120
I want others to see
that he's a good person.

473
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,759
I want them to see
that he can be fun to be with.

474
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,220
Also, I want him to know that...

475
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,679
he's the only light in my life.

476
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:46,239
How will he know your true feelings...

477
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,199
if you don't tell him?

478
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,560
Will you let yourself dwell on regrets?

479
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,879
It's over.

480
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,839
It's over between me and him.

481
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,679
It's okay.

482
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:36,969
Thanks.

483
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:39,839
I'm sad when you're sad.

Pure, can you not hit on Beau?

486
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,719
I don't want us to fight over a woman.

487
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:07,679
And you don't need to use 950 anymore.

488
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
950?

489
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,719
Yes.

490
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,120
The number isn't for this room.

491
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,719
I want to sing a song for someone
who's very important to me to listen to.

492
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,929
Won't you let me see
how the room looks like?
