4
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:22,160
Tomorrow will be the last day we’re here.

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,363
I just want to have a date with you where we first met.

6
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,528
Up here on this mount.

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,096
Your hand is burning hot.

8
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:30,664
This is not okay.

9
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,226
Why don’t you tell me you’re sick?

10
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,410
Prince, are you okay?

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,409
His body is so cold.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,428
He’s shivering.

13
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:36,609
No.

14
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:37,742
Hey, why are you back here?

15
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:40,218
If you’re looking for antibiotics, I moved them outside.

16
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:41,739
I’m looking for medicines for malaria.

17
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,568
If he doesn't get cured now, he can be dead.

18
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:45,792
Look at Prince now.

19
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,517
Let me take care of him.

20
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,768
We can clearly see here you can’t take care of him.

21
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,231
Teacher Prince.

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,240
I bought you and the kids some snacks.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,105
Wow!

24
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:05,689
Thank you so much, Uncle Phang.

25
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:06,473
No problem.

26
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:08,928
Did you just get back from somewhere?

27
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:12,204
I went down to pick up the three new volunteers.

28
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:13,880
Guys,

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,870
a new volunteer doctor said if we help him clean his house,

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,133
we will get to play new mobile games.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,394
Oh, Teacher Prince.

32
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:27,560
Did you threaten them?

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,824
I just asked them to help me clean up in exchange for some mobile games.

34
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,631
If you came up here just to change a place to drink,

35
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,109
you better go back.

36
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:39,077
It’s true we’re here because we did something bad.

37
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:43,101
But my friend isn’t here just to change a place to drink as you said.

38
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,134
I made it.

39
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:19,596
It might not be as good as the food in Bangkok.

40
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:20,864
But it’s not spicy.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,161
I think you can handle it.

42
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:23,548
Thank you.

43
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:25,729
Hello, Dao.

44
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,760
It’s me, Fah.

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,658
I borrowed Mesa’s phone.

46
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,296
There’s no phone signal up here.

47
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,552
I had to walk all over the mountain to get the signal.

48
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:39,892
Dao,

49
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,206
I gotta go.

50
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,240
I guess I’m being too loud.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,690
People might come yelling at me.

52
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,567
Okay. Talk to you later.

53
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:00,892
Prince.

54
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,346
Prince.

55
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,048
Prince.

56
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,267
Prince.

57
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,595
Finally, you’re awake.

58
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,962
I was so worried.

59
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,160
Did I…

60
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,016
Prince,

61
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:18,376
you had malaria.

62
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,664
It nearly killed you.

63
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:22,908
If it wasn’t for Sincere who drove you to this hospital,

64
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,440
it could be bad.

65
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,041
Drink some water.

66
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:41,665
You know, Prince?

67
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,500
You slept the whole day.

68
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,688
But you’re fine now.

69
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,768
Thank you so much and…

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,221
I’m sorry if I worried you.

71
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,753
And don’t worry about the villagers.

72
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,513
Everyone is doing well now.

73
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,200
You can head home with no concerns.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,403
I heard your new semester is about to start.

75
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:08,320
What about Dr. Fah?

76
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,201
He already left the mountain.

77
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,515
Probably on his way back to Bangkok now.

78
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:24,407
I think you should take some rest in order to recover quickly.

79
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,280
Thank you so much, Uncle Phang, for driving us all the way here.

80
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:52,016
No. I should thank you.

81
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:55,000
If it wasn’t for you, my life would be a disaster.

82
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,126
I made you guys grilled pork and sticky rice.

83
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,252
Here. Enjoy.

84
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,940
Thank you.

85
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,551
Yes, chief.

86
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,016
Ah!

87
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,393
Teacher Prince is conscious now?

88
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,557
Doctor, Teacher Prince has awoken.

89
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:15,465
Can I please talk to the village chief?

90
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,610
Chief, Doctor Fah would like to talk to you.

91
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:19,794
Thank you.

92
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:22,685
Hi, village chief.

93
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,068
Can I please have the name of the hospital Teacher Prince is in?

94
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,000
To be honest, Doctor.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,502
I’d like to tell you that.

96
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:38,441
But Sincere asked me not to tell where Teacher Prince is.

97
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,726
I must apologize.

98
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,413
Okay.

99
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,318
I understand.

100
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,971
So?

101
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,117
Which hospital?

102
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,978
Don’t think we can go.

103
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:59,603
They aren’t okay if we go visit.

104
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:01,568
Seriously?

105
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:04,038
Yeah.

106
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,663
And I have work tomorrow.

107
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:08,763
I can’t hang around.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,704
Then I wish you all a safe journey.

109
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,823
Come visit us again.

110
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:16,677
Sure.

111
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,434
When you’re home, don’t drink too much.

112
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,696
All right.

113
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:25,000
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Goodbye, Uncle.

114
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,119
Thank you so much.

115
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,235
- Bye.
- Bye now.

116
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,519
To celebrate your return.

117
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,030
Cheers.

118
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,835
The grilled pork is yummy.

119
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,118
I like it.

120
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,059
Right?

121
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,159
I told you his pork is superb.

122
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,731
The weather is nice. The food is nice.

123
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,170
I guess you lived comfortably up there.

124
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:11,074
Not even close.

125
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,770
No electricity.

126
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,360
The internet barely worked.

127
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,135
It wasn’t just cold. It was freakin’ cold.

128
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,202
To keep me warm, I almost set myself on fire.

129
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:25,170
But every time you talk about it, you seem so happy.

130
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,256
Well,

131
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,075
it’s positive thinking.

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,902
I lived up there for so long.

133
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:34,654
If I wasn’t being optimistic, my life would be miserable.

134
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:40,871
Fah,

135
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:45,312
I talked to Dao and decided to go to Germany with friends next week.

136
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:47,505
Wanna join us?

137
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,892
It’s a long weekend next week.

138
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,300
And you still got your visa left.

139
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,681
Slow down, guys.

140
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,335
I just got home.

141
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,671
You want me out again?

142
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,955
I also need to check if I’ll be available.

143
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,671
Come on, Fah. It isn’t like we get to travel together very often.

144
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,032
You can take the one on the mountain with you.

145
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,496
Are you okay, Fah?

146
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:24,567
I am.

147
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,040
It’s just that we don’t talk anymore.

148
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,932
Sorry. I didn’t know.

149
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:36,210
Why did you two stop talking?

150
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:41,990
Things just didn’t really work out.

151
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:43,919
Forget it.

152
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:45,824
Let’s not talk about it.

153
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,437
Let’s drink.

154
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,455
Here. Let me pour it for you.

155
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:57,646
You poured it for yourself too.

156
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,622
Actually,

157
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,623
it’s for you but...

158
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:39,925
many things happened.

159
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:46,672
Well then.

160
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,280
Can I just give it to you now?

161
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,654
Get well soon.

162
00:10:58,468 --> 00:10:59,842
After your recovery,

163
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,561
I have something for you as well.

164
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,157
Of course.

165
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,642
They've invited me to the medical supplies handover ceremony.

166
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,404
I think you should go.

167
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,450
At least you will get to say a proper goodbye.

168
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,607
I just want Prince to be with someone good.

169
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:52,130
Someone who can take care of him.

170
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,947
I don’t have to take care of patients.

171
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:55,567
I have time for Prince.

172
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,893
Unlike when he was with you.

173
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,186
ONE MONTH LATER

174
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,599
How are you?

175
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:27,660
I’m good.

176
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,234
Fah.

177
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,638
I’d like to trade shifts with you this Saturday.

178
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,446
Ah!

179
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,686
You sent someone to talk to me earlier, right?

180
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:37,737
You got it.

181
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:39,003
Alright. Thanks so much.

182
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,480
Sure. My pleasure.

183
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,036
Hey.

184
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,135
Seriously, what’s your boost, man?

185
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,029
You work like a horse.

186
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,848
I finally got back to work. I want to do my best.

187
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,912
Don’t just work.

188
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,110
Find someone to share things with.

189
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:58,112
Our profession doesn’t really afford that opportunity.

190
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:02,403
Maybe I’m better off alone.

191
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,645
Will you excuse me?

192
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,571
Of course.

193
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,358
Wow!

194
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:11,259
You all did so well today.

195
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,232
I’m sure the real event will be just spectacular.

196
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,479
You’re so great.

197
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,599
Everyone can go home and rest now.

198
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,415
Prince.

199
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:37,023
It shouldn’t be just me who gets a medical checkup.

200
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,940
You should get one too.

201
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:40,725
That’s all right.

202
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,822
I’ll get it some other time.

203
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,949
I don’t think there’s a problem.

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,902
Of course.

205
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,820
Being in a hospital just reminds me of Doctor Fah.

206
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,667
Have you two been in touch?

207
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,554
We have not.

208
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,352
Why not?

209
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,116
I got his number from the village chief but it’s not reachable.

210
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:33,121
He probably changed it.

211
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,779
You want me to help find Dr. Fah’s phone number?

212
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,540
I’m sure he wants to reach out to you as well.

213
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,599
If he really does, he should have called long ago.

214
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,687
Maybe he doesn’t have your number either.

215
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:51,309
If he called the village chief, he would get it right away.

216
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:52,746
Never mind him.

217
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:56,747
He might work so hard and forget all about me by now.

218
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,338
Fah.

219
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,211
There’s a letter for you.

220
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,214
The credit card company?

221
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,930
I think I just paid them.

222
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:14,334
No.

223
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,436
Look. It says here it was sent from the mountain.

224
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:18,647
Really?

225
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:32,618
They've invited me to the medical supplies handover ceremony.

226
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:33,694
Wait.

227
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,787
Why you, Fah?

228
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:40,884
Because I was the one filing the request to station these supplies on the mountain.

229
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,010
You know what?

230
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,590
It was so hard to request anything.

231
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,483
What a good heart you have.

232
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,136
Are you going?

233
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,196
Don’t think I can.

234
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:01,793
I got work here.

235
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:02,977
Yeah?

236
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:07,055
Not because you don’t have the guts to see the teacher up there?

237
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,783
Hold on.

238
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,807
How did you know about this?

239
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,276
Mesa and JJ told me everything.

240
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:18,194
I think you should go.

241
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,286
At least you will get to say a proper goodbye.

242
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,295
Don’t leave it hanging.

243
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:47,658
Hello, Uncle Phang.

244
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:48,561
Hello.

245
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,074
Didn’t think I’d get to see you again this soon.

246
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:55,917
It’s my day off so I thought I should visit.

247
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:56,799
Sure.

248
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,614
These are vitamin C for the chil…

249
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:28,265
Oh.

250
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:30,592
Teacher Prince went to the restroom.

251
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,511
Ah!

252
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,649
And what are you guys drawing?

253
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:39,175
Teacher Prince told us to draw whatever we like.

254
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,367
Wee-ah,

255
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,496
do you have paper and colors for me?

256
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:46,642
I do.

257
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,026
May I borrow them?

258
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,122
Have you guys finished?

259
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,504
We have.

260
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,621
If you’re finished, hand it to me.

261
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,651
This is my assignment, Teacher.

262
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,230
What are you doing?

263
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,021
The assignment you gave.

264
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,110
Draw whatever I like.

265
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,119
[By Prince]

266
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:07,936
Hey.

267
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,990
How come you’re here alone?

268
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,474
Isn’t Teacher Prince with you?

269
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:21,230
I was going to return him the tote bag he forgot.

270
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,956
After we both went home, we never contacted each other.

271
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,015
Why?

272
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,812
Did you have a fight?

273
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,832
Not exactly.

274
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,595
I think there is someone who can take better care of him than I can.

275
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:39,834
Come on.

276
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,101
What now?

277
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,192
Are you giving up already?

278
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,487
I’ve thought it through, Yayah.

279
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,357
Know what?

280
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:54,618
I was gonna make a more beautiful and bigger bag for Teacher Prince.

281
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:56,063
But he didn’t want it.

282
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,739
Do you know why?

283
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,336
His reason was simple.

284
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:03,812
He said he just liked this embroidery.

285
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,812
Life is that simple.

286
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:09,953
Sometimes,

287
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,977
you don’t need reasons to like something.

288
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:18,045
But…

289
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,667
I think it’s too late, Yayah.

290
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,845
He probably has a new tote bag now.

291
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,077
Just got back from the mountain?

292
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,851
Yes.

293
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,349
You look disappointed somehow.

294
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,781
Guess you didn’t see who you wanted to see.

295
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:16,552
I went to Chiang Mai

296
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,029
hoping to see Teacher Prince. That’s all.

297
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:27,007
I wanted to know if he’s happy under your care.

298
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,569
You don’t need to ask.

299
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,511
I don’t have to take care of patients.

300
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,123
I have time for Prince

301
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:36,694
when he needs it.

302
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,812
Even so,

303
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,796
he doesn’t seem happy.

304
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,796
Unlike when he was with you.

305
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,749
I know I don’t have the right to say this.

306
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:58,812
I just want Prince to be with someone good.

307
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,316
Someone who can take care of him.

308
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:06,021
From now on,

309
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:07,930
please take care of him.

310
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,371
Hello.

311
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,879
I don’t think I can take your shift tonight.

312
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:33,812
I’m going to Chiang Mai.

313
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:49,418
Teacher Prince.

314
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:50,473
Are you home?

315
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:51,307
Teacher Prince.

316
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:53,212
Prince.

317
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,382
Hi, Mr. Kuafah.

318
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:02,547
Hello.

319
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,010
Is Teacher Prince home?

320
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:05,712
Sorry, sir.

321
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,247
Nobody is home.

322
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,799
This family is traveling to Germany.

323
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,036
Germany?

324
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,534
Fell in love with the teacher on the mountain.

325
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,293
And going to Germany to look for him.

326
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,874
- More romantic than a movie.
- More romantic than a movie.

327
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,212
It’s Germany, not Siam.

328
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,583
I’ve kept him waiting for so long.

329
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,614
I don’t want him to wait any longer.

330
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,206
Seriously, Fah?

331
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,209
Yes.

332
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:19,133
I’ve made up my mind.

333
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,184
It’s Germany, not Siam.

334
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,807
I’ve kept him waiting for so long.

335
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,703
I don’t want him to wait any longer.

336
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:36,518
Let’s go then.

337
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,526
Prince?

338
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:58,035
I’m already at the airport.

339
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,786
That’s okay.

340
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:05,637
I should be the one who feels bad for missing your event as a drum major.

341
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:08,837
But I know you’re great. You will definitely nail it.

342
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,029
Keep fighting.

343
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,633
Don’t forget to record the video for me to watch later.

344
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:14,924
Sure.

345
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,451
I’ll see you.

346
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:17,821
Bye-bye.

347
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:01,032
Wow!

348
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:03,833
And that was our opening parade.

349
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,847
It was just gorgeous.Right, everyone?

350
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:08,304
Let’s give it up for them.

351
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:23,319
Here.

352
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,043
What are you doing?

353
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,348
I’m taking you traveling but you’re messing with me.

354
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:49,850
Just giving you a drink.

355
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,746
As a thank-you for taking me out.

356
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:20,658
Excuse me.

357
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,855
Guys.

358
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,882
Is anyone there named Prince?

359
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:26,304
There’s someone asking for you.

360
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:29,118
Prince?

361
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,031
Hey! Prince.

362
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,731
Someone is looking for you.

363
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:33,751
Over there.

364
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:46,467
Prince!

365
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:49,835
Prince!

366
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:50,996
You wait right there.

367
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:52,771
Okay.

368
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,474
There he is.

369
00:28:55,713 --> 00:28:57,713
Aw!

370
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:00,573
Go.

371
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:02,467
I’ll walk you.

372
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,078
Come on.

373
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,382
You…

374
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:20,104
How did you know I’m here?

375
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,546
We got an hour before we can check-in.

376
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,566
So that’s the story.

377
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:36,578
Whoa!

378
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,459
That is so cool.

379
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,540
Fell in love with the teacher on the mountain.

380
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,183
And going to Germany to look for him.

381
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:45,423
- More romantic than a movie.
- More romantic than a movie.

382
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,308
Don’t support him on that.

383
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:49,570
Trust me.

384
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,992
You can never find him.

385
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,168
Your story sounds familiar by the way.

386
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,335
It’s like my friend’s story.

387
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:01,174
He said when he was a teacher up on the mountain, he git his heart broken by the doctor there.

388
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:02,106
Really?

389
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:02,818
Yeah.

390
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:06,233
So many coincidences in this world.

391
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:13,096
Your friend doesn’t happen to be named Prince, does he?

392
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:17,505
How did you know that?

393
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:20,705
Wait a minute.

394
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:26,479
Does your friend Prince have the last name of the northern monarch?

395
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,543
Damn right.

396
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,788
How did you know that?

397
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,266
For real?

398
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:37,020
Is this world really that small?

399
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,689
Smaller than you think.

400
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,004
Prince is also my and Kluen’s friend.

401
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:42,732
Huh?

402
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,543
Let’s leave the small world aside.

403
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,524
Prince isn’t in Germany right now.

404
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:50,146
He’s a drum major right now at his university.

405
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,085
That’s right, Fah.

406
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:54,524
Then.

407
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:55,762
I should go.

408
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:56,509
What?

409
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,086
Such a small world.

410
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,059
Keep going, Fah.

411
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,552
Find him!

412
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,269
Fighting!

413
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,592
And here I am.

414
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,308
So…

415
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:15,529
Why do you want to see me?

416
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,525
I got something for you.

417
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:27,840
I chose the pink stone that brings good luck in love.

418
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,084
So our love will grow beautifully.

419
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:34,497
Aw!

420
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,911
May I?

421
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:13,012
Will you be my boyfriend?

422
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:26,069
Say yes.

423
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,276
What are you even saying?

424
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,059
What do you say?

425
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:37,668
Say yes.

426
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:38,294
Um.

427
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,754
Don’t leave me again.

428
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:56,867
No one can make me leave because I will never leave you.

429
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:23,488
What are you doing?

430
00:33:25,015 --> 00:33:25,746
Why?

431
00:33:25,908 --> 00:33:27,178
Because we’re in public?

432
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,187
Do you think I care?

433
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,356
Let’s go.

434
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,925
Teacher Prince.

435
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,289
I used to be so afraid to climb the Himalayas.

436
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:50,612
Now I’m not anymore.

437
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:51,986
Why?

438
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:54,583
I have you to climb it with me.

439
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:58,238
Are you sure you will be my Prince?

440
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,287
Hello.

441
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:40,225
Didn’t think we would meet again so soon.

442
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,266
And now you got more friends with you.

443
00:34:59,654 --> 00:35:00,850
Teacher Prince.

444
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,003
Teacher Prince, I made this for you.

445
00:35:58,307 --> 00:35:59,337
Tell me.

446
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,925
How much is 1+1?

447
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,125
2.

448
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,999
And 2+2?

449
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,474
4.

450
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:08,805
And Kluen+Dao?

451
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:09,903
Boyfriends.

452
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:39,294
- I…
- I…

453
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,016
- have something for you.
- have something for you.

454
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,510
You made it for me too?

455
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:46,641
Yes.

456
00:36:47,847 --> 00:36:48,818
May I wear it for you?

457
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,983
It’s chilly up here.

458
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,535
You’ve been warned to wear warmer clothes.

459
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:27,476
You are just stubborn.

460
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,974
Stubborn but still cute, right?

461
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:50,315
Is it better?

462
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,984
Thank you.

463
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:08,532
You know?

464
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:15,176
I used to be so afraid to climb the Himalayas.

465
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,474
The Himalayas?

466
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:22,953
It’s a metaphor.

467
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,328
I compare the Himalayas to life achievement.

468
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:36,662
I used to dream of climbing the Himalayas with someone.

469
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:41,218
After I and my ex broke up,

470
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:44,820
I’ve been so afraid to climb it.

471
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:50,590
But now,

472
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:54,221
I’m not anymore.

473
00:38:58,989 --> 00:38:59,695
Why?

474
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:03,127
Well.

475
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:06,969
I have you to climb it with me.

476
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:24,884
Please stay with me and climb the mountain together.

477
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:27,531
Teacher Prince.

478
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,785
Are you sure

479
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:42,376
you will be my Prince?

480
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:45,261
No.

481
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:52,595
It’s you who will be mine.

482
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:01,321
Are you ready,

483
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,515
my Kuafah?

484
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,260
You’re on.

485
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:50,147
Nevertheless…there is only one Himalayas in the world.

486
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:59,174
Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul

487
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:23,565
Fah asked you to come over for a meal.

488
00:41:24,603 --> 00:41:25,651
Hey!

489
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,805
You two should keep your distance sometimes.

490
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:30,362
Hey.

491
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,870
Daonuea and Khabkluen have been together so long.

492
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:35,564
Don’t be overprotective.

493
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,233
I don’t know.

494
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,560
I despise him.

495
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,596
Should we go to Hua Hin this weekend?

496
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:48,099
Prince, I want to thank you a million times for bringing back the old Fah.

497
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:49,325
I love you.

498
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:52,177
Dao,

499
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:54,247
after graduation,

500
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,166
will you live here with me?
