00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.740
<i>Gabriel Agreste's</i>
<i>fashion show was delayed</i>

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.060
<i>after the Queen of Fashion,</i>
<i>Audrey Bourgeois, was akumatized!</i>

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.140
<i>But everything is back on schedule,</i>

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.740
<i>after Ladybug heroically stepped in</i>
<i>to save the day, as usual!</i>

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.900
<i>The fashion show can finally begin!</i>

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.380
I don't want to break our promise, but
I can't keep putting our son in danger.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.980
Style Queen was supposed to be
my masterpiece, but even she failed.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.540
I feel like I've done
all I possibly could, you know?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.220
I'll never be able to fulfil my wish
without Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.260
Forgive me, Emilie.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.020
I'm giving you up, Nooroo.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.780
Scoop! The hat Adrien Agreste is wearing
was made by my BFF Marinette!

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.340
Anything you'd like to say
during my livestream?

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.340
What?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.340
-I don't believe this.
-Huh?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.740
Scoop number two.
Gabriel Agreste has just turned up!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.780
And that means we'll be seeing your hat
in every single photo and news broadcast!

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.860
<i>This was his first public appearance</i>
<i>since his wife disappeared.</i>

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.900
This Fashion Week
is full of surprises and shockers!

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.820
My dear Audrey, I heard about the
unforgivable misfortune you had to endure.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.180
I'm still quite overwhelmed!

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.020
I want you to know I fired the person
responsible for the misunderstanding.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.100
Only one row in the house is befitting
to Audrey Bourgeois and that's the first.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.140
Let's not overdo it, huh, Gabriel?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.060
-Did you enjoy the show?
-So-so.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.540
This hat is not a Gabriel Agreste!
Are you responsible for that?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.260
[whispering] Stand proud.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.660
I... I'm the one who created it.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.740
Marinette won
a fashion-design competition.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.460
It's the most...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.460
exceptional thing I've ever seen!
You're a visionary, Marinette!

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.060
Glitter's had its day.
Feathers are the trend of tomorrow!

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.540
I haven't felt
this much emotion since... you.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.100
She does have talent.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.260
-You want to be a fashion designer, right?
-Uh... yes, ma'am.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.620
Then come to New York with me.
I'll make you the biggest name in fashion.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.220
-I'm sure you'll even upstage Gabriel!
-I'll be able to model for you!

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.740
We'll be there for you
no matter what you decide.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.700
My helicopter will be leaving
for the airport at 8pm tonight.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.580
Isn't this awesome for Marinette, Chloé?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.980
It's... It's ridiculous!
Utterly ridiculous!

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.460
I've never been to New York with you
and you're taking Marinette?

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.940
I'm taking her because
she's exceptional, Claudette... Chloé.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060
I'm exceptional too!

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.220
The only exceptional thing about you,
my dear, is your mother!

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.300
Audrey dear! Chloé!

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.940
I'll show you how exceptional I can be!

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.940
-No!
-Chloé!

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.860
Huh?

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.660
-How may I please you, my queen?
-What is that thing?

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.620
Chloé, what are you doing?

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.780
Pollen, buzz on!

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.300
I am Chloé Bourgeois, and from now on,
I'll be your new superhero, Queen Bee!

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.180
We'll soon see if you think Dupain-Cheng
is still more exceptional than<i> moi!</i>

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.220
Spinning top!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.100
What is happening to our beloved daughter?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.620
She always was such a show-off!

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.060
See you tonight, Marinette.
I'll meet you at my helicopter.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.940
Un-bee-lievable! Paris got a new
self-proclaimed super-hero

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.980
<i>whose not-so-secret identity</i>
<i>is Chloé Bourgeois,</i>

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.180
<i>daughter of Audrey Bourgeois!</i>

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.140
How could Marinette have given
the Miraculous to that Chloé girl?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.540
There is no way
she would have given it to her.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.060
But I know whatever transpired,
she will set things right.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.700
We'd better be going home, Adrien.
Thank you all for coming.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.300
It's probably not a good idea
to stick around

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.860
with Chloé thinking she's the bee's knees.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.100
I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir
will fix everything.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.060
Let's go back home.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.660
I hope Chloé doesn't do anything foolish.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.180
I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir
will deal with her.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.540
Hmm. Hmm!

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.260
There's nothing exciting going on
in this city, no one to save! Argh!

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.180
Huh!

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.180
Hmm. If you want it done right,
you have to do it yourself!

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.900
[phone rings]

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.420
Nadia Chamack?
Chloé Bourgeois here. I mean, Queen Bee!

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.260
Come ASAP. I'm about to rescue
the passengers of a metro in peril!

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.500
You have got to film this!

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.020
We'll open a bakery in New York

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.860
and introduce our pastries
to the Americans!

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.940
Are you sure, Tom?
You've always been afraid of flying!

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.260
I'd fly to the moon and open a bakery
for my daughter if I had to!

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.180
What should I do, Tikki?
It's my dream come true.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.940
I can go to New York
and become a real fashion designer!

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.580
-Who will protect Paris if you leave?
-Cat Noir... Rena Rouge...

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.940
Only Ladybug can capture akumas.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.380
I wouldn't be able
to come to New York with you!

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.780
Nothing will come between
my daughter and her dreams.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.620
What was that?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.020
Venom!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.740
Aaah!

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.420
[screaming]

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.180
<i>Passengers, have no fear!</i>
<i>Watch Queen Bee in action!</i>

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.500
<i>You can thank me later!</i>

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.540
-A new superhero?
-Who is it?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.500
Is she gonna save us or not?

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.860
She's not going to pull it off!

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.380
-Master?
-I still have one chance, Nooroo.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.980
All is not lost.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.980
I have a unique opportunity to akumatize
someone with a Miraculous.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.780
A superhero turned supervillain
can only be... exceptional!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.860
Nooroo, dark wings rise!

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.260
I hope we're not too late!

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.460
Plagg, claws out!

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.020
Uh... Uh...

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.420
Stay here, I'm gonna help your dad.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.300
-Tom, make it stop!
-I'm doing my best!

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.460
It's time we brought Chloé down to earth!

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.980
Tikki, spots on!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.940
Yeah!

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.740
Cat Noir! What are you doing here?

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.820
Waiting for the next train.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.220
Come on!

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.500
-Need a helping paw?
-Stop staring!

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.900
-Can't you see you're distracting me?
-This is not a playground.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.180
Cat Noir, I'll slow it down as much
as I can. You stop it!

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.220
Aaah!

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.460
Thanks for your cooperation.
Please keep on being pawesome

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.540
-and evacuate the station calmly!
-Ladybug! Thank you!

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.780
You're welcome, Ma... Madam... and sir!
I'll take care of the driver.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.540
You're welcome!
It was nothing. I was merely--

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.860
-Queen Bee! This was your doing!
-Oh, Ladybug, you're too kind.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.900
This was teamwork!

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.380
Oh! How amazing is this?
We're a team now!

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.100
You're the one who paralysed
the driver, aren't you?

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.260
You created this situation
just to make yourself look good!

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.420
-Who cares? We saved them, didn't we?
-Completely irresponsible!

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.140
Queen Bee, or rather, Chloé Bourgeois,
we're on the air with your mother,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.500
Audrey Bourgeois.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.260
Audrey, do you have anything to say,
live on TV?

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.620
<i>What? Regarding my daughter's ineptitude?</i>
<i>I think it speaks for itself, doesn't it?</i>

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.940
Chloé, give me back your Miraculous.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.740
Finders keepers, losers weepers!

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.580
Did you lose a Miraculous?

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.100
Listen, you lost a Miraculous once, too!
May I remind you I was busy

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.740
taking care of Style Queen all by myself!

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.940
Queen Bee! Chloé! Wait!

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.420
Chloé!

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.740
She must have transformed back by now.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.620
She's probably gone home. I'll pay her
a visit and get the Miraculous back.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.900
I'll come with you!

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:32.620
It was bound to happen. Superpowers aren't
child's play, my dear Chloé Bourgeois.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.140
Fly away, my little akuma,
and evilise this fallen hero!

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.140
Queen Wasp, I am Hawk Moth.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.380
Ladybug and Cat Noir
don't want you as their friend,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.100
so you will be their most powerful enemy.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:07.420
Nobody has managed it yet, but you will
defeat them, because you are exceptional!

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.380
In return,
you must seize their Miraculous.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.500
You can count on me, Hawk Moth.
I'll teach them to respect me.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.900
-Chloé!
-Queen Bee?

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.140
Looks like she's not here! Let's go!

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.100
-What's that? An insect bite?
-That's impossible!

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.620
She can only use her special power once,
like my lucky charm.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.500
She should have transformed back.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.700
Cat Noir, watch out!

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.060
Your reign is over, Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.780
I don't care
if you don't give me your Miraculous.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.140
My wasps will paralyse you
and I'll simply take them myself!

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.700
Nice work, Queen Wasp!
You truly are exceptional! I knew it!

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.300
Wasps... Venom!

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.020
Run!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.860
He must have akumatized her
while she was Queen Bee.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.780
I bet the akuma is in her Miraculous!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.340
That make sense!
But they're indestructible.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.820
We'll need your cataclysm
to release the akuma.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.180
I'm all yours, Milady!

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.820
We just have to find out
how not to get stung!

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.820
A ladybug doesn't stand a chance
against the Queen of Wasps!

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.260
[evil laugh]

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.380
Put your claws away!

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.580
[evil laugh]

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.020
So, who's exceptional now, then?
Them or me?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.900
To claim total victory, you must
take their Miraculous, Queen Wasp!

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:08.300
I was just having a bit of fun, Hawk Moth,
before delivering the final sting!

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.660
Jump!

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.540
You can't escape my wasps!

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.460
Bring Ladybug and Cat Noir to me!

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.060
Dispersal!

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.300
-What? You think I'm a catfish?
-I don't know,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.660
but I do know we're gonna
have to come up with another plan.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.620
Lucky charm!

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.900
A snorkel?

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.780
Your lucky charm has a great sense
of humour! At least you won't drown!

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.300
Drown! That's the idea!
Wasps don't like water!

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.540
We may have to get a little dirty,
Cat Noir.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.620
That's ironic. We just took a bath!

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.260
Ugh! Just follow me!

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.020
Where are they?

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.740
Ugh! That's disgusting!

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.300
Cat Noir, now!

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.740
You'll never get it back!

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.620
Cataclysm!

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.740
No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.700
Time to de-evilise!

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.860
Gotcha!

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.020
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.860
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.380
Pound it!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.740
-I have to get the Miraculous back, Chloé.
-Give me a second chance, please!

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.860
Audrey Bourgeois, tell us
how you feel about what happened.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.460
<i>According to me,</i>
<i>Chloé just clearly demonstrated</i>

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.660
<i>that there is nothing "exceptional"</i>
<i>about her!</i>

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.420
I know that you did the things you did
to impress your mother.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.100
Anyone can make mistakes,
even a superhero.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.020
What matters is how you fix them.
I made one by losing that Miraculous.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.420
Don't make the mistake
of not giving it back.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.220
Act like a hero.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.140
And show everyone
how exceptional you can be.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.140
Thank you!

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.740
Ladybug... Cat Noir...

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.860
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.220
Time to go, ma'am.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.220
I give her the chance of a lifetime
and she dares to be late?

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.180
Unacceptable! Utterly unacceptable!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.220
-Should we leave?
-No. Give it one minute more.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.580
Are you really OK with this, Marinette?

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.740
I've thought about it long and hard.
I'm sure I'm making the right decision.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.900
-Go away!
-That was the plan, but... no.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.020
Dupain-Cheng?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.100
Well, well! It's about time!
We can take off now!

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.620
I won't be coming to New York with you.
I still have so many things to do here.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.340
All those I love are here,
my parents, my friends...

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.660
You're making a mistake, Marinette.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.420
I think you're wrong. A huge part
of your life is here in Paris, too.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.620
Chlorine... Uh... Chloé?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.500
Uh...

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:59.180
-Why don't you love me, Mom?
-But... uh... of course I... love... you!

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.300
You're wrong
about her not being exceptional.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.500
In fact, Chloé is exceptionally mean!
She's the worst person I've ever met!

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.580
She may be more heinous,
pompous and selfish than you!

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.500
Compared to both of you even a rock
seems more capable of love.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.140
-How dare you?
-How dare you?

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.980
-[gasp]
-See?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.340
You're both much more alike
than you think!

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.860
Are you as mean as this Maria says?

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.780
Well, I don't have one single friend
in school, except for Sabrina.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.460
But she doesn't realise
that I'm just using her!

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.260
-I love giving Jean-Eudes a hard time!
-You mean Jean-Yves?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.420
Who cares what his name is?
Jean-Thingy! Put my luggage in there!

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.980
No, not like that! Take them out and stack
them from smallest to the biggest!

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.820
I think I may have judged you unfairly,
Chloé.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.700
Martha... Uh... Marinette's right.
You are exceptional, just like me!

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.220
I've decided
I'm staying in Paris with you!

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.460
So we're not going to the airport
after all, then?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.860
[both] You're fired!

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.860
Ladybug and Cat Noir made a mistake today,
and there will be others.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.620
Then we'll finally be together
once again, my love!

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.900
You said you were going to stop.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.060
I can't give up, Nathalie.
I miss her too much.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.620
I understand, sir.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.300
Are you sure you won't regret this,
Marinette?

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.980
I'm sure, Dad.
Paris is my city, our city...

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.500
Besides, everyone I love is here.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.980
Yeah, and one guy in particular!
ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.580
Ha, ha, ha, ha! And my best friend!
