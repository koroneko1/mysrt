1
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,440
You look spectacular.

2
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,079
Thanks.

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,840
Hey, can a friend invite a friend
for champagne?

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,719
Just as a simple gesture of goodwill.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
So, I can't tell
if you're joking or not right now.

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,560
No, I'm totally serious.

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,719
Why do you think I invited you
to this place swarming with people?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
I'll do all I can to make you feel
comfortable with me again.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,039
Okay.

10
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,960
Champagne?

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,240
Okay.

12
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,159
To friends.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah, sure.

14
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,560
What's going on?

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm gonna talk
to the manager.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,959
He sent me a recording of his voice.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,799
Will that be enough evidence?

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Is that Elodie?

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,400
Elodie,
I know it's probably too late now,

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,519
but I beg you to forgive me.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,840
Now you have a voice message
from me admitting what I did

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,239
and that I was wrong.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,400
Use it as you see fit.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,799
I know the Triesen authorities
will defend His Royal Highness.

25
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,000
In this recording,
Phillipe admits having done something,

26
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,640
having made a mistake,

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,319
but he does not say what it is.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,239
I know that bringing down a prince
is impossible,

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,159
but I won't be silenced.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have no intention of hiding my truth.

31
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,799
The truth.

32
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,359
And the truth

33
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,520
is that Phillipe Florian von Triesenberg
raped me.

34
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,400
Samuel…

35
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,759
are you sure about this?

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,080
Are you sure… about your confession?

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,479
-Miss Isadora.
-Home sweet home.

38
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,639
My God.

39
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,680
CRUZ, THE NEW EMPEROR

40
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
Huh?

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,920
Dad.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Huh?

43
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm going to school.

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
What time is it?

45
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,199
A quarter to eight.

46
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,720
Ah, damn.

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Give me a minute, and I'll drive you.

48
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,439
1.2 MILLION FOLLOWERS

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
Take the Aston Martin
and go.

50
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,279
-Yes, when I turn 18.
-Okay.

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,199
-I'm leaving. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,639
Thanks.

53
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,360
Son.

54
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,079
-I'll take these vitamins and drive you.
-Hangover?

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,319
If the club knew about your parties…

56
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,360
But what a party!
Did you see the girl I had by my side?

57
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,639
-Wow.
-Seriously, Dad.

58
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,879
At your age…

59
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,519
At your age, I had left Portugal
and was working in Brazil. Alone.

60
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
I had a mansion with a pool, a Ferrari.

61
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,560
What have you done?

62
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,680
Not a damn thing! Nothing.

63
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
What does age have to do with it?

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,879
Get the fuck up.

65
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,839
Hmm. Okay, okay. All right.
Just give me five minutes, please.

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
Come on.

67
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,639
-Stop it. Five minutes.
-We're late.

68
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,879
Fuck. Why can't you knock first, dude?

69
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,040
You don't have to wake me up
every morning like you're my dad.

70
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,480
'Cause you're not, you know.

71
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,959
Yeah. Thing is,
if I don't, you're late.

72
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,839
I mean, a simple thanks
would've been fine. But, sure.

73
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't get pissy, Omar.

74
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,439
Oh well.

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,399
I'm going to repeat the rules
that have already been communicated.

76
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
So, you should familiarize yourself
with them.

77
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,720
Strict punctuality is required.

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,240
-Sorry, miss, you're late.
-Seriously?

79
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,680
Students who don't enter

80
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,959
first thing in the morning
without a valid reason

81
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,160
will be denied entrance
for the rest of the day.

82
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,480
In addition, they'll be penalized
on their final grade point average.

83
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Next regulation.
The use of private personal devices

84
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,759
or the school's devices for such purposes
as browsing social media

85
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,160
without a justified reason
is strictly forbidden.

86
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,040
The same applies to phones,
which from this point on,

87
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,920
should be stored away
in your lockers throughout the school day.

88
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,439
In adherence with health
and safety guidelines,

89
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,639
gatherings of more than three people
in the common areas

90
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,439
for nonacademic purposes
is strictly forbidden.

91
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Scrupulous physical distance
must be maintained at all times.

92
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,519
Any situation of fraternizing or intimacy
that violates this rule will be penalized.

93
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
I hope that together we will all
be able to abide by these new rules

94
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,759
and adhere to the three precepts
of our school's motto.

95
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,360
Discipline, excellence, achievement.

96
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,439
Come on, let's go to class.
Come on, now. You can't be that close.

97
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,120
Girls, move it along!

98
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,360
Come on, you need to disperse.
No groups larger than three.

99
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,560
You know the rules.

100
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,199
You fucking kidding me?

101
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,800
The stupid dickhead says
I can't come in?

102
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,439
Seriously? I've come to school
dressed like this for two years.

103
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,079
Morning.

104
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,399
You don't want to know
what the line's like

105
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,240
in the chicks' bathroom, let me tell ya.

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,919
Look…

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
…he's clearly never seen
a hot chick before, either.

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Hey, Mencía. What's up? It's Rebe, dude.

109
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,799
I snuck into the school.
Can you let me know when you've…

110
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,840
CAYETANA, THE RAPIST'S LITTLE BITCH

111
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,919
They're on display.

112
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,399
-For the goddamn world to see.
-But we're not together anymore.

113
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,519
-And Phillipe apologized.
-Fine, but he hasn't paid for it.

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,519
And you can't sit on the fence here, dude.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,360
Yeah. It's just not easy to take sides--

116
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,519
-Isn't it?
-No.

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,159
You're either with him,
or you're against him. See? Easy.

118
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,440
Cayetana, Phillipe can't stay here.
You know that.

119
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
Even, I mean,
if Benjamín still covers for him.

120
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah.

121
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,679
Listen, girl. I'm not gonna pry. Okay?

122
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,279
But think about
whether this guy's done something to you.

123
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,320
Honestly, even
if you believe it's trivial.

124
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,679
Even if you believe it's minor.
Think about it.

125
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm sure there's something.

126
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,799
I mean, for real, dude. Just tell on him
and let them kick him out already.

127
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,279
Okay?

128
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

129
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,639
Okay, I'm gonna get something
to clean this up.

130
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,639
Okay.

131
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,600
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CASTRATE YOURSELF

132
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
Yeah!

133
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,240
-There he goes.
-He's here.

134
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,519
Get the fuck outta here!

135
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,159
-From behind?
-You defending this piece of shit?

136
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,279
-You're defending him?
-No, I'm not.

137
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,279
Enough! Shut up. Are you crazy?

138
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,919
-Get back!
-Isadora!

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
-Get off!
-What the hell? You dumb bitch!

140
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
-Don't you ever touch me again!
-What's goin' on here?

141
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,759
I saw everything, Benjamín.

142
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,039
They jumped him.
He fell to the floor. It was horrible--

143
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
Thanks, Artiñán,
but it's all been recorded.

144
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,559
So, it's up to you to report it.

145
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,639
Sure. And then someone ends up
stringing me up from the basketball hoop.

146
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
I'd rather leave here.

147
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,639
Oh no, baby. Don't say that.
It doesn't need to escalate.

148
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Artiñán.

149
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,799
Benjamín, I should go back to my country.
Talk to my parents.

150
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,679
I have tried, but they refuse.

151
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,840
But if you leave now,
it would be like admitting they're right.

152
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,679
It also, uh…
Well, there's the school's image.

153
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,960
Oh great.

154
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,480
Just know if I am found lying in the road,
it's gonna be your fault.

155
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
Baby, don't leave this way.

156
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,559
He can't leave this way, right?

157
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,919
I can't tell you how proud
it makes me you didn't join the mob.

158
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Just defended someone
who'd been attacked.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't know what I think about Phillipe.
I'd prefer not to think about it.

160
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,200
So, the debate team's opened your mind
to a range of grays.

161
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,200
I already ruined
one classmate's life for revenge.

162
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,480
And, well, I realized
everyone has a right to redeem themselves.

163
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,879
Can I go now?

164
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,039
Yes.

165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,120
Why haven't you gone to see Ari?

166
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
It's not like you.

167
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,080
Is it because of Nunier?

168
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,480
No. I mean, sort of.

169
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,679
He left without much notice.
Do you have any idea why?

170
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,919
Also,
Ari doesn't want me to come see her.

171
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,559
Right.

172
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,200
Well, it's…

173
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,279
it's just, she's scared
and still in shock.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,879
Please don't hold that against her.

175
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,799
Look, Samuel, I…
I still have great plans for your future.

176
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,759
But you have to remind me why it was
that I bet on you from the beginning.

177
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,519
So,
just be a man and go see her.

178
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,159
As you know,
one of your classmates has been the victim

179
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,159
of unacceptable treatment.

180
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,159
Serious accusations once were leveled
against Phillipe von Triesenberg.

181
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,320
Since then, his name has been cleared.

182
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,360
But his innocence hasn't protected him
from a series of attacks

183
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,080
that are lamentable and cowardly.

184
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,360
And I will not allow that behavior
at this school.

185
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,720
Hey, man.

186
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,519
Am I bothering you?

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,279
Uh, not at all. No.

188
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,039
Well, um, I'm new here,

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
and I can't find the locker room,
and I've been walking around in circles.

190
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,679
Well, it's down the hall
on your left-hand side.

191
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,919
-Okay. Down the hall?
-Yeah.

192
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,919
Good. Thank you.

193
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,360
I'm also going there.
If you want, I'll go with you.

194
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
Okay.

195
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,919
You sure you're going to shower?

196
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,679
You're all dressed up, dude.

197
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,919
I dress up for workouts.

198
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,639
Well, thanks for guiding me.

199
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,159
I'm not gay.

200
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,440
What?

201
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,240
You've had your eyes on me
since you saw me in the hallway.

202
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,240
Don't sweat it.

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,240
Look as much as you want.
It doesn't bug me.

204
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
You been at Las Encinas long?

205
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,039
I got here from London
at the start of the year.

206
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,080
-What class are you in?
-Not yours.

207
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,240
I would've noticed.

208
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,679
Well, thanks for rescuing me
when I was lost back there.

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
If it hadn't been for you…

210
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,960
Maybe you'd still be lost.
Around here, people get confused.

211
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,960
-Yeah. See you around.
-Yeah.

212
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,039
You can tell me what class you skipped
so you could shower with me.

213
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,679
Huh?

214
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,039
"Boner." That's how you say it?

215
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,639
Hey, Mencía.
What's up? How's it goin'?

216
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,679
Happy New Year.

217
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,000
How are you?

218
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,200
-Six feet away, please.
-Quit it, dude.

219
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,480
What happened over Christmas? Huh?

220
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,639
Did your old man get you a lobotomy
for the holidays?

221
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
You wanna know what happened?

222
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,000
What happened is that you're the icing

223
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,159
on the shit cake
I unleashed on my family this year.

224
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,519
The what?

225
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,960
-Just leave me alone.
-No, no. Shh. Hey. Just a minute.

226
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,879
Shut your pretty mouth and listen, okay?

227
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,360
You were flogging yourself
about Ari like about your mother.

228
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,080
Well, you know what, Mencía?
You are not to blame for any of that.

229
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,960
None of it. Not what happened
to your sister or to your mother.

230
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,879
-You can't blame yourself for everything--
-Actually, you know whose fault it was?

231
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,879
Yours.

232
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,879
What?

233
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,159
For telling Ari.

234
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,399
Hey, over here.

235
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,679
She snuck back in here
after you had thrown her out.

236
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,440
What are you doing?

237
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,440
Miss, come with me.

238
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,279
Okay, okay. Okay. I can leave on my own.

239
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,039
Dad. Do you know
who's the new guy in the Aston Martin?

240
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,799
Why do you want to know?

241
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,480
He's new,
and we have to welcome him, right?

242
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,880
-But he's not in your class.
-So what?

243
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,599
-I don't think it's any of your business.
-Why do you care?

244
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,599
Could you stop thinking about yourself
and partying and boys? Is that possible?

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
What is this about?

246
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,359
If you'd put yourself
in this family's shoes.

247
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,279
Your sister has been on the verge
of death, and you weren't around.

248
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,680
-Dad, Patrick didn't--
-No one asked you anything!

249
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,119
So, I would love it
if you'd quit being a spoiled little brat!

250
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,079
Okay.

251
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,480
Patrick!

252
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,400
Hey. Huge scene with my father.

253
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,720
Can we fuck and talk about it?

254
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm coming. Oh, I'm coming.

255
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,599
-I'm coming.
-I'm waiting for it.

256
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm coming.

257
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Oh my God.

258
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,960
God.

259
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,400
Dude.

260
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,839
Let's make it the norm
to just fuck away our frustrations, okay?

261
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
That was fuckin' amazing.

262
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,920
That's what my father really needs.
Just a good long fuck.

263
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,200
I mean, yeah.

264
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,480
He's even more fascist than normal, right?

265
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,799
Semen retentum venenum est.

266
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
What did you say?

267
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,759
He could be scared shitless
by what happened.

268
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,200
You know?

269
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
And all he needs right now
is to feel… closer to you.

270
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,000
No. My father's never opened up
to us in his fucking life.

271
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,480
Maybe with Ari, if anyone.

272
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,920
But now she's a victim.
He doesn't respect her.

273
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,559
He protects her, doesn't respect her.

274
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,799
So, get close to him,
even if he doesn't ask.

275
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,839
Even if it's just to get him
to stop screwing over our class.

276
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
Just kidding.

277
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,279
Take Ander and me, for instance.

278
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,480
He's so reserved

279
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,640
and rarely ever asks for anything.

280
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,200
But I mean, we've managed to stay together
and communicate,

281
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,400
even though he's on the other side
of the fuckin' world, you know?

282
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,400
We still write to each other.
We call each other.

283
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,640
Oh no, handsome.

284
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,759
He doesn't write to you.

285
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,559
Ander replies 'cause you won't stop
sending him messages all day.

286
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,519
Because you're kinda intense and annoying.

287
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,400
-What's your problem?
-What's my problem?

288
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,839
-I mean, that's not true.
-It's not?

289
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,880
No.

290
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,079
Hey, um, I'm gonna take a shower
and get some air before I go home. Okay?

291
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,039
Look, I don't know.

292
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,559
I have no excuse for it.

293
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,400
I haven't been there.

294
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,359
That's a fact.

295
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,079
But I'm telling you,
you can go back to living your life.

296
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,440
Because now I'm gonna be there,
and I'm going to support you.

297
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,039
You'll be there how?

298
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,279
As what?

299
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,440
As my friend?

300
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,640
Um…

301
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,400
As a couple, if you'd like.

302
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,759
A couple?

303
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,559
I want to be with you, Ari.

304
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,279
But why have you been avoiding me
only to come here and tell me this now?

305
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,279
Were you scared?

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,200
Were you afraid that… that I would say no?

307
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,039
Yeah.

308
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,559
Well, then. That's it.
You are definitely an idiot.

309
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,920
Now, you would normally come here,
give me a hug and a kiss. Wouldn't you?

310
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Don't worry, okay?

312
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,079
I missed you.

313
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,720
Thanks.

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You have a reservation
for six tonight, right?

315
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,599
All right. Come this way, please.

316
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,039
Okay, here's the thing, Samuel.

317
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,799
Don't you want Ari
to overcome her PTSD and depression?

318
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,039
I know I want Mencía
to stop flogging herself

319
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,640
and behaving like a fucking clone
of her old man.

320
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,599
I think if we tell her
Armando's in the lake, breeding worms,

321
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,599
we'll pull her
out of the black hole she's in.

322
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,119
What are you doing out here?

323
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,359
-Fuckin' scared me, Omar.
-You shouldn't be out here.

324
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,920
Just give me a sec. This is important.

325
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,079
No, what's important
is the madhouse inside.

326
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,720
Let's go. Get to work.

327
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,240
Come on.

328
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
-Don't look at me like that.
-I'm going to tell you nicely.

329
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,599
You're letting being put in charge
go to your head.

330
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,079
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

331
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,880
You're on top of everyone and everything.
All day. At work, at school, wherever.

332
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
And you're complaining
Ander doesn't reply.

333
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,440
It's 'cause you won't let us breathe.

334
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,720
Should we go in?

335
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,359
Hello?

336
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,759
Hmm?

337
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,680
Good luck.

338
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,839
-Aren't you goin' inside?
-Uh, no. I'm waiting for a friend.

339
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,759
Patrick, just watch out
for your GPA this quarter.

340
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah.

341
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,680
You nervous?

342
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,599
-It's weird.
-Hmm. Well, it's cool to see you back.

343
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,720
-Love you.
-Love you too.

344
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,640
-Wanna go in together?
-I'll be right in.

345
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,079
-Ciao.
-Okay.

346
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,279
I know, right?

347
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,200
-Hey.
-Hey! No!

348
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,839
Dad! Dad!

349
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Huh?

350
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,839
-Have you seen my charger?
-My son!

351
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
-What charger?
-My charger.

352
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
What charger?

353
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,319
This charger.

354
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,559
It's your fault
my alarm clock didn't work!

355
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,000
-I'm sorry.
-Bullshit! It's always the same with you!

356
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,039
-The music can't stop.
-It never does!

357
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,599
-It's on all day, every day!
-Calm down.

358
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,319
I'll drive you to school.

359
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,440
I'll drive you right now, son.

360
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,359
Five minutes, Omar!

361
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,599
Caye.

362
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,039
-I just--
-Phillipe.

363
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,319
-Social distancing.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

364
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,599
Let's stay away from Phillipe, no?

365
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,119
You're doing that too
'cause it's affected you.

366
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,599
-I never said that, though.
-Well, but it's what you want.

367
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,160
You didn't say it, but both our problems
would be solved if I go back.

368
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,200
Help me get out of here.

369
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,440
What are you… What do you want from me?

370
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know. As long as my principality
and Las Encinas say I am innocent

371
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,960
of the thing with Elodie,
we can't do anything.

372
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,839
"The thing with Elodie"?
Is that what you call it?

373
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,720
-You know what I mean.
-Uh… no, Phillipe.

374
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,680
And what, uh… I mean…

375
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,799
So, what exactly do you call
what happened in the limo with me?

376
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,480
Call it whatever you want.

377
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,240
Okay?

378
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,759
But tell everyone.

379
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,720
Then there will be
two complaints against me,

380
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,720
and it'll be impossible to keep me.

381
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,079
Caye, they're after me.

382
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,640
I know people in my country hate me too,
but it's safer than here.

383
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,119
Because I don't know if I can survive
an entire school year being a victim.

384
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,200
Elodie might know something about that.

385
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,319
She's been one for a year.

386
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,559
She's the victim, Phillipe. Not you, okay?

387
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
And I'm the one
who could have been one, not you.

388
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,920
Don't you see? Is that not clear to you?

389
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,720
Well, maybe I'm not able to.

390
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,039
You see?

391
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,640
Now it's up to you
to go out there and tell everyone.

392
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,799
Put an end to this once and for all.

393
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,160
Everything okay?

394
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,839
How could you possibly
have been victimized by Phillipe?

395
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,400
Sorry. You were being very loud.

396
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,599
-What are you? Phillipe's shadow?
-No. No, no, no, no.

397
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,920
Just pissed off
at the injustice he's suffering.

398
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
I see.

399
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,599
Right, why don't you take on the school
and leave me alone?

400
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,640
No, stop. No, no, no! Stop right there!

401
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,039
Don't hit me, please. I'm serious!

402
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,039
-Don't hurt me!
-Stop. Nobody's going to hit her!

403
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,920
-Don't come near!
-Nobody's going to.

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,680
What are you doing? She's going psycho.

405
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,319
-Nothing's going on. Relax.
-Stop!

406
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,160
You see,

407
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,000
I could pretend to be your victim
like you claim you're Phillipe's victim.

408
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm sorry, were you there?

409
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,319
Huh?

410
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,160
Look, forget it
because this is really just… Honestly.

411
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,119
Do you really want Phillipe to leave?

412
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,359
Well, yes. Maybe I do. I don't know.
Maybe it's best for everyone. Jesus.

413
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,359
Right. I don't want that either.

414
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
But please, don't be like
all those hysterical haters.

415
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,920
-They're all just ugly commies, you know.
-I'm sorry, what?

416
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,759
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Don't be offended, baby.

417
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm not saying you are.
I'm saying you shouldn't be.

418
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,279
Excuse me, Paris Hilton,
but I have things to do.

419
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,319
Did Phillipe screw up?

420
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,680
Possibly.

421
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Did he say sorry?

422
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,799
Repeatedly.

423
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,480
Does he want to change?
I think it's very clear that he does.

424
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,720
But in order for a person to change,
you have to let them. Right?

425
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
Not cancel them for life,

426
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,920
like all these unhinged, crazy girls
are doing at the school.

427
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,480
They've totally scared the shit
out of Phillipe.

428
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,240
Don't let them scare you shitless too.

429
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:29,119
You don't have to help him escape.
Honey, you have to stand by him.

430
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,599
Just stand by your man.

431
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,599
No, he's your friend, no?

432
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,000
Or… I won't get into that.
It's not my business.

433
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,119
But stand by him.

434
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,240
Stand by him. Be happy together.

435
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,920
Be free to live the life you want to live.

436
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,119
That right there,

437
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,559
that is feminism.

438
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,400
Well…

439
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,119
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU?

440
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,079
YOU COULD AT LEAST REPLY.

441
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,160
DON'T SAY THERE'S NO SIGNAL.
YOU COULD ACKNOWLEDGE ME.

442
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,759
So, the Nazi's son
was kicked out for being late?

443
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,240
There's no hope for the rest of us.

444
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,000
-You know who I am?
-The whole school knows who you are.

445
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,559
I checked up on you. I like you, man.

446
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,680
Patrick, right?

447
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,599
All I know
is that you drive a… Aston Martin.

448
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
That's super sexy.

449
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,559
I was here waiting
for you to drive up in it.

450
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,319
Ah. The car is my father's.

451
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,119
But uh, I'd rather not talk about him.
He's been getting on my nerves. A lot.

452
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,079
My dad has been getting on mine
since Christmas, so I feel you.

453
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
So, you didn't go inside either, man.

454
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,880
You were hangin' out here.

455
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

456
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,640
You know, honestly,
I can't tell if I'm into it

457
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,480
or if it's super cringe.

458
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,480
Have you seen me?
I think your only choice is to be into it.

459
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,279
Why don't we go have a drink
and, I don't know,

460
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,279
talk shit about our fathers?

461
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
-Sounds fun.
-Cool.

462
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,000
SHOULD WE SKIP CLASS? I NEED A HUG.

463
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,440
Hey, uh, I don't even know your name yet.

464
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,480
Iván.

465
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,319
Patrick.

466
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,759
Well, you all do two kisses here, right?

467
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,720
"We"?

468
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,440
Who is "we"?

469
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,039
All right,
you know what I mean.

470
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,720
Two kisses.

471
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,519
Come on, let's go.

472
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,480
Okay. But where?

473
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,799
To get drunk!

474
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,079
Mr. Blanco?

475
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,039
Good morning.

476
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,000
Can I have a minute
with you and your children, please?

477
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,319
-Patrick won't answer. I'll get him.
-I'll cut to the chase.

478
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
We're aware that your son Patrick
went missing

479
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
around the same time de la Ossa vanished.

480
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Patrick had nothing at all to do with it.

481
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
How do you know that?

482
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,880
What are you insinuating?

483
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,799
That my son had something to do
with that son of a bitch's disappearance?

484
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,599
A lot of witnesses

485
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,720
assure us that they saw
de la Ossa with Mencía

486
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,160
at a concert organized
by one of the students from this school.

487
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,880
And they said the two of them
were rather, well, friendly.

488
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,960
And they saw Patrick
in a fit of aggression there.

489
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
Patrick had nothing to do with it.

490
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
-I'm the one you need to--
-Don't!

491
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,039
Mencía.

492
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,640
-How did you meet him, Mencía?
-Mencía, please don't.

493
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
Ari, thank you,

494
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,000
but that's enough.

495
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,920
Because you're always covering up for me.

496
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm the only one who's to blame
for this awful fucking situation.

497
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,799
-I need to come clean.
-Very well.

498
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,799
I'm listening.

499
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,880
One daughter was a victim of assault,
another was sexually abused by de la Ossa.

500
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,319
If you plan on leaving the city
at all, or country, notify me.

501
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,039
Good day, sir.

502
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
Are you all right?

503
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,119
Yes.

504
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm fine.

505
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,719
Okay.

506
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,840
If, uh… If I can help you
with anything, tell me.

507
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,119
It's not a problem.

508
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,119
I lost my wife.
Almost lost Patrick.

509
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,320
Now I almost lost Ari and Mencía.
It's… all a disaster.

510
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,239
And I know that I haven't been
the man my family needed.

511
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,119
You try to have… everything under control.

512
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,480
You think you know how.

513
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,079
But what's the point?

514
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,320
Tragedy strikes everyone sometimes.

515
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,280
Nothing you can do to avoid it.

516
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,519
I could have been more on top of them.

517
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,559
I could've…

518
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,000
I could have controlled the thing
with Armando.

519
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,679
He was in my house.
He met my children, and I didn't--

520
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,599
I didn't even have an inkling.
I didn't suspect anything. I could've…

521
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,719
I don't know.

522
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,039
And now…

523
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,800
my legs just shake to think
that he might come after my girls again

524
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,519
and that… and that once again,
I won't be able to do a thing.

525
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
I wouldn't worry about Armando.

526
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,719
He won't come back.

527
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,519
Everything will be okay.

528
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,320
You teenagers like all that kind of stuff.
Like, New Age and Mr. Wonderful.

529
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,360
I'm completely serious.

530
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,840
You gotta trust me.

531
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,360
Armando isn't ever coming back.

532
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,079
Uh, yes?

533
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,519
Benjamín, do you have a minute?

534
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,440
Yes, come in.

535
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,639
-I'll leave you guys.
-Garcia.

536
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,199
Thank you.

537
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,599
It's about Phillipe.

538
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:12,719
You're beautiful.
Beautiful.

539
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,159
Your…
Your dad put this together?

540
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,920
Wow.

541
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,239
Son.

542
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Son.

543
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Introduce me to your buddy.

544
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,760
-Patrick.
-Nice to meet you.

545
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,800
Hi.

546
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,239
-What's up?
-I'm good.

547
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,239
Join us.

548
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,519
I wanna just go up to my room and chill.

549
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,280
Come on.
Just a little while.

550
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,639
-It's a pleasure.
-Pleasure.

551
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
What?

552
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,440
I think I'm hammered.

553
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,480
-Hey.
-What?

554
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,800
I hate to break it to you,

555
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,480
but, yeah, your father is nothing…
I mean, nothing like my dad.

556
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,039
He seems like a bro.

557
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,920
That's the problem.

558
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,280
How about a nap before we keep goin'?

559
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,559
This buzz is kinda too much for me.

560
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,599
Wait, wait, wait.

561
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,079
So then, we're not going
down to the party?

562
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,960
Nah. Just a little nap.

563
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,079
Little nap.

564
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,039
All right.

565
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
No.

566
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,199
Where are you goin'?

567
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
-I don't know. To find a sofa.
-What? No, you dumbass.

568
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,639
You're sleeping right here with me.

569
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,199
I want you to be comfortable.

570
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
Let's see.

571
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,360
Help me. I can't do it.

572
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,559
I gotta charge my cell phone.

573
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,159
Oh, shit.

574
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,079
Boy, that's some ass you have
with that underwear, huh!

575
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,880
Better than a lot of girls.

576
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,920
No wonder they're all crazy about you.

577
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,840
But…

578
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,519
…crazy about you.

579
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,760
Oh, shut up.

580
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,599
I'm giving you such a hard-on, huh?
You little perv.

581
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,599
-No.
-Nap time? And that was a joke.

582
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,119
Oh shit.

583
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,519
Iván?

584
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,360
-Iván?
-Mm?

585
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,199
You asleep?

586
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,519
Put out the light.

587
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,199
Oh shit.

588
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Son.

589
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,360
Son, I need to recharge my cell phone.

590
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,800
It's only for a second.

591
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,920
I'll bring it back.

592
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,719
-Hey, man.
-Shit!

593
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,840
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

594
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,199
No, chill out. Chill out.

595
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,519
Shit. I'm so, so sorry.

596
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,239
I'm sorry. It's just that I was in bed--

597
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,719
-Relax.
-I lost it--

598
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,920
I get it. Want to shoot your load,
come downstairs.

599
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Have a couple chicks having drinks
who are smoking hot.

600
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,559
-What?
-Come on. It's okay.

601
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,800
Nothing to be ashamed of.

602
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,800
Thanks, but no.

603
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,920
But why not?

604
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,199
I'm kinda gay.

605
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,639
-Ah.
-But thanks anyway.

606
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,280
That's all right.

607
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, we got a gay down there.

608
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,719
No, no.

609
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,559
Okay.

610
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,639
Well, carry on, then.

611
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Patrick, right?

612
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,400
Yeah.

613
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,280
Enjoy it, Patrick.

614
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:12,519
But have you and Iván? Are you guys…?

615
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,800
-No. We're just friends. That's all.
-No?

616
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,920
-Ah. Just friends, huh?
-Yes.

617
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,239
Okay.

618
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,440
Hello, everyone.

619
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,760
Um, I wanted to talk
to you about something

620
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,679
that I understand
you have a lot of opinions about.

621
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,840
Uh, but I'd like you to listen
to me a moment, though.

622
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Phillipe made an awful mistake.
He messed up.

623
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,199
But he's trying to redeem himself.

624
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,679
I mean, it's impossible
to have an immaculate life. No one can.

625
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,960
And I'm not trying to justify anything.

626
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,480
But without forgiveness,
we can never move forward… on either side.

627
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,280
Phillipe, if you go to your country,
you'll continue to enjoy your privileges

628
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,519
and make the same old mistakes
without any consequences.

629
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,239
Stay here and learn.

630
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,280
And I'd like to stay by your side
to support you while you do that,

631
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,280
and I hope I won't be the only one.

632
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,119
I understand that not everyone agrees
with my opinion on this,

633
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:42,960
but the solution

634
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,079
shouldn't be to kick him out and forget.

635
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,239
I'm sure after this,
people will relax, dude.

636
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,960
-Plus, in a couple days, it'll blow over.
-Get out of my face!

637
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,320
Are you sure about this?

638
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,039
What do you mean, am I sure about it?

639
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,400
Your confession.

640
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:41,760
Of course I'm sure.

641
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,000
I killed him.
