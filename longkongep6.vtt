1
00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.169
Why don't you confess your love
to him here at camp?

2
00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.404
I'm sure it'll go well.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.806
Be courageous and take that first step.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.809
I'll tell Ida I like him.

5
00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.179
I really have fallen in love with you!

6
00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.482
Why don't we try being a couple?

7
00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.184
Since you were serious
in the way you told me,

8
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.652
I wanted to acknowledge it.

9
00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.657
Seriously?

10
00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.092
You did it, Aoki!

11
00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.994
Aida! Quit shouting!

12
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.897
Sorry about that.

13
00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.269
So it worked out, right?

14
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:37.837
Yeah.

15
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.273
However,

16
00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.777
only if my memory of it is right.

17
00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.479
Huh?

18
00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.114
Could it be…

19
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.821
that school camp was all a dream?

20
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.723
Why are you so darn insecure?

21
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.958
I never thought he'd say "yes"!

22
00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.227
-I wasn't ready for it.
-You're such a pain.

23
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.264
You're the one who said you like him!

24
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.832
I know that, but…

25
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.804
You just don't understand
my complicated feelings about this.

26
00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.609
I mean, my ideal youth was
to have a cute girl tell me she likes me…

27
00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.078
and go on dates.

28
00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.880
This sure is fun, Hashimoto!

29
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.149
That's how it was supposed to be.

30
00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.684
This is so much fun, Aoki!

31
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.219
This is fun, Aoki!

32
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.090
But now it turns out to be me and Ida?

33
00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.626
Your idea of a date is totally bizarre.

34
00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.730
But he likes you, so why does it matter?

35
00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.968
I wonder
if he's actually serious about it.

36
00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.804
So that's what you're worried about.

37
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.609
Quit letting it eat away at you.
Let's go ask Ida directly!

38
00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:50.577
What?

39
00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.111
-Let's go!
-Where?

40
00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.446
-The gym.
-Now?

41
00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:54.814
-Yeah.
-What?

42
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.719
Ida…

43
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.991
Okay, it's time to go
and find out if he's serious!

44
00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:11.598
Aoki?

45
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.237
Gather round!

46
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.938
Yes, sir!

47
00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.913
-Darn you! Why did you do that?
-What's wrong?

48
00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.185
Before our practice match
with Shiroyama High tomorrow,

49
00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.220
there's something I want to tell everyone.

50
00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.523
They've got a match tomorrow?

51
00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.258
You should go cheer them on.

52
00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.894
Why would I do that?

53
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.929
Why can't you be honest
about your feelings?

54
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:48.067
But there's one more person
who can really cause us trouble!

55
00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:52.005
That's right! It's their super-pretty
team assistant, Kokomi Matsuuchi!

56
00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.041
That's just stupid.

57
00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.876
That has nothing to do with volleyball.

58
00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.212
You won't believe this,
but Kokomi Matsuuchi

59
00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.381
has a crush on someone

60
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.950
from the Higashigaoka High School
volleyball team!

61
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.355
You all know Toyoda's girlfriend
goes to Shiroyama High.

62
00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:13.860
She heard directly from Kokomi.
At tomorrow's practice match,

63
00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.162
she'll give a present to whoever it is!

64
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.331
Is that right, Toyoda?

65
00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.000
Yeah.

66
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.001
Who could it be?

67
00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.537
The only one who's ever had
a girlfriend among us is Toyoda.

68
00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.106
Which of one of us
could Kokomi possibly like?

69
00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.809
The only one it could possibly be is…

70
00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.081
That would have to be Kosuke.

71
00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.684
Huh?

72
00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.954
That's bad news, Aoki.

73
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.056
You've already got a rival in love.

74
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.759
It doesn't bother me in the least.

75
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.829
But your legs are trembling.

76
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:12.986
EPISODE 6

77
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.498
So what are you going to do?

78
00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.835
What am I going to do about what?

79
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.203
If you're not careful,

80
00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.872
that beautiful team assistant
might snatch Ida from you.

81
00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:37.410
I'm not worried about him.
He's not the playboy type.

82
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.146
He'd never cheat on me.

83
00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:44.083
"Cheat"? But you said you're not sure
he's even serious about you.

84
00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.719
Yeah, but…

85
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.690
Have you asked Ida how he truly feels?

86
00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:51.658
Huh?

87
00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.526
Have you asked him if he likes you?

88
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.229
Of course not.

89
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.531
How could I ask that?

90
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.403
If you're going to be a couple,
shouldn't you make sure?

91
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.447
Impossible!
I couldn't ask him that to his face!

92
00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.382
-Then ask him in a text.
-Huh?

93
00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.418
Ask him casually in a text.

94
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.360
What should I type?

95
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.329
How should I know?
This is between you and Ida.

96
00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.298
-You're right.
-Yep.

97
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.068
You can do it.

98
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.240
I'm in no position
to be helping you though.

99
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.978
-Hasshi! We'll go on ahead!
-I'll be there in a sec!

100
00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.768
Say, Aoki…

101
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.838
"Do you like me?"

102
00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:14.741
No, that's way too direct.

103
00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.243
I'll use emojis to disguise it.

104
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.848
He always asks me for advice
but doesn't care about my problems.

105
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.394
ARE WE A COUPLE?

106
00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.429
No way.

107
00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.231
That's so lame!

108
00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.967
Forget it. I'm not sending this.

109
00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.102
Sota!

110
00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.874
Get in the bath!
Heating it up again is a waste of energy!

111
00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.143
Fine! I'm coming!

112
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.779
Darn her…

113
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.148
What?

114
00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.884
No way! Oh, crap!

115
00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:00.920
He read that fast!

116
00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.591
But I'm not ready yet to know his answer!

117
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.963
He reads it then ignores it?

118
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.634
Maybe it really was all a dream.

119
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.309
Let's talk about it at school sometime.

120
00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.214
"Sometime"? When is "sometime"?

121
00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.451
Is he putting off answering me

122
00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:36.055
because he intends to move on
to that beautiful team assistant?

123
00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:47.867
Stay calm.

124
00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.436
Ida isn't fickle like that.

125
00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.544
Sota!

126
00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.281
Have you seen my opera glasses?

127
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.863
Watch carefully.

128
00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.130
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:24.270
She's folding things so carefully.

130
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.340
I wish our assistant was like that.

131
00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.542
-She's beautiful.
-She's the best.

132
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.416
She's the diligent, hard-working type!

133
00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:42.622
She's so dedicated, she doesn't
cut corners even when nobody's looking.

134
00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.027
She's got the true beauty of someone
who makes sacrifices for others.

135
00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:52.231
Kokomi Matsuuchi, a formidable opponent!

136
00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.367
This is bad!

137
00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.738
She'll steal the heart
of that dense Ida in no time!

138
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.242
Here it comes! The present!

139
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.681
Oh, no! She's going over!

140
00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.685
Mr. Taniguchi, hello.

141
00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:16.188
-We're looking forward to the match.
-We are too. Thanks.

142
00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:19.025
This is our starting lineup.

143
00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.426
Why, thank you.

144
00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.095
And here is ours. Here you go.

145
00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:25.898
Mr. Taniguchi…

146
00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.135
Um…

147
00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.973
Uh…

148
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.509
-Gather round!
-Yes, sir!

149
00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.116
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

150
00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.622
Mr. Taniguchi,
what did you two just talk about?

151
00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.958
It looked like she had a present.

152
00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.526
Oh, that.

153
00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.963
There was someone
she wanted me to give a present to.

154
00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.665
I told her to give it to them herself.

155
00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.370
I knew it. It's Ida.

156
00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:06.906
No doubt about it, she's after Ida.

157
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:26.525
That was close! He almost spotted me!

158
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.196
Aoki?

159
00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.698
He's spotted me.

160
00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.703
Huh? Well, if it isn't Ida.
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.672
I've got a practice match.

162
00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.509
What about you, Aoki?
Did you come to watch?

163
00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.277
What? No way!

164
00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:47.880
I forgot something!

165
00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.282
I ain't got no interest in your match!

166
00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:56.422
Well…

167
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.628
I was wondering a little bit
about your text to me last night.

168
00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:07.033
Oh, that. I thought it would be quicker
if we talked about it at school.

169
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.604
That's what you thought?
Then what's the point of texting?

170
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.973
You could at least text me the gist of it.

171
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.809
-I'm not good at using mobile phones.
-Are you an old man?

172
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.247
I also realized something
when I saw your text.

173
00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.416
Huh? Realized what?

174
00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.118
That I didn't tell you properly.

175
00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.255
"Properly"?

176
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.593
Could it be… he wants out?

177
00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.229
I'm looking forward to it.

178
00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.733
We're a couple, right?

179
00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:42.735
Huh?

180
00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.805
Oh, right.

181
00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:47.907
I look forward to it too.

182
00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.811
Good. I've got a match to play in.

183
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.046
What? That's all?

184
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.083
It seems like nothing's changed.

185
00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:02.922
Good point.

186
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.293
Say…

187
00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:12.898
Ida, do you…

188
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:18.237
li…

189
00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.974
-like me?
-I don't know.

190
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.942
What?

191
00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:26.245
I've never fallen in love before.

192
00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:31.750
Without anything to compare it to,
I can't really say.

193
00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:35.554
Then isn't it crazy to say we're a couple?

194
00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.325
Oh! Kosuke!

195
00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.229
"Kosuke"?

196
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.397
Oh, Matsuuchi.

197
00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:47.833
Huh? You know her?

198
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.535
Yeah.

199
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.171
Toyoda's girlfriend introduced us once.

200
00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:55.274
You're not on the volleyball team.
Is he a friend?

201
00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.412
Yeah…

202
00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:04.517
I'm Aoki, his "classmate."

203
00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.385
-Are you angry?
-Not at all.

204
00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:11.023
-So what can I do for you?
-Oh, right.

205
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.360
Actually, I was wondering
if you heard what I said

206
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.695
to Mr. Taniguchi earlier.

207
00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:19.698
No.

208
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.301
He's pretty dense
and doesn't care about that stuff.

209
00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:25.604
He can't use a mobile phone
and hardly ever texts back.

210
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.741
Apparently, I'm an "old man."

211
00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.711
That's what I like about you, Kosuke.

212
00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:36.215
You're calm and mature.

213
00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.983
Mature, like an old man.

214
00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.386
I like guys who are like old men.

215
00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:43.022
-What?
-I want to seem more mature,

216
00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.991
so I wear makeup
and dye my hair and stuff,

217
00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.426
but it's just no good.

218
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.995
Isn't dying your hair
against school rules?

219
00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:51.030
You're so serious.

220
00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:53.399
-You're a by-the-book type, aren't you?
-Huh?

221
00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.701
-That kind of thing is so cool.
-What?

222
00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.271
Here. Please have this.

223
00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:05.644
What is it?

224
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.846
A shoe bag.

225
00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:11.717
I worked really hard to make it,
but don't use it if you don't need it.

226
00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:14.119
Bye. Best of luck in the match.

227
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.387
Matsuuchi, wait!

228
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.692
Kosuke, it's about to start.

229
00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.097
Is that you, Aoki? What's up?

230
00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:31.003
Oh, I heard that pretty team assistant
was coming, so I wanted to see her.

231
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.239
But Ida got to her first.

232
00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.508
You're a lucky guy, Ida. Good luck!

233
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.918
Thank you.

234
00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.390
We didn't stand a chance.

235
00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.068
What's wrong, Kosuke?

236
00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.138
Oh, it's nothing.

237
00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:23.255
Oh, there you are.

238
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.024
Matsuuchi…

239
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.026
Are you looking for someone?

240
00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.193
Huh?

241
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.030
You look a little depressed.
Is something troubling you?

242
00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.766
Kind of…

243
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.934
Say…

244
00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:37.870
Say…

245
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.338
Do you…

246
00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:41.974
like me?

247
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.945
Without anything to compare it to,
I can't really say.

248
00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:50.115
Then isn't it crazy to say we're a couple?

249
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.084
Kosuke!

250
00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.119
Oh…

251
00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:59.191
-You're not even listening, are you?
-Sorry. What did you say?

252
00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.893
You see,

253
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.730
I think you're pretty nice, Kosuke.

254
00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.066
So…

255
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.301
would you go out with me?

256
00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:11.503
Why?

257
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.405
Well…

258
00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.276
because I like you.

259
00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.611
Huh? Why?

260
00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:21.980
Weren't you listening?

261
00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.716
But you like someone else.

262
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.319
-Huh?
-Sorry.

263
00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.689
Actually, I did hear you earlier.

264
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.560
This is a shoe bag.

265
00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.628
Please have it, Mr. Taniguchi.

266
00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:41.200
Thank you. But I really can't
accept this kind of thing.

267
00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.403
This is important to you, isn't it?
You can have it back.

268
00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.145
Why didn't you say so before?

269
00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:58.517
Aoki was there.
I'm sure you didn't want him to hear.

270
00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.789
You sure are kind.

271
00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:07.559
You're similar
to Mr. Taniguchi in that way too.

272
00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.836
When I came here for my first match…

273
00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.271
Are you okay?

274
00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:21.173
I got hit by a ball.

275
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.341
I'm okay.

276
00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:26.945
Mr. Taniguchi was so worried,
he stayed with me the whole time.

277
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.617
Since then,
I often come to him for advice.

278
00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:33.886
I confessed my love to him several times,

279
00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:36.321
but he treats me
like a child and brushes me off.

280
00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.859
I made up my mind to give up
if he turned me down today.

281
00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:47.232
Then I decided to ask you out
since you're similar to Mr. Taniguchi.

282
00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.869
I'm really sorry
for making stuff up and talking like that.

283
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.543
I feel so stupid for having
such a big crush on him.

284
00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:00.712
-It drives me crazy.
-It's not stupid.

285
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.515
It's impressive you can
care about someone so much.

286
00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:08.654
You think so?

287
00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.390
Yeah. It's awesome.

288
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.059
I guess it is.

289
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.764
Oh, there you are.

290
00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.468
Mr. Taniguchi…

291
00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.838
The guys from Shiroyama High
have been looking for you.

292
00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.172
It's time to go.

293
00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.809
-Thanks.
-Okay.

294
00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:37.850
You think we're similar?

295
00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:39.618
Yes, you are.

296
00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:41.987
Let's both keep trying, okay?

297
00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.423
Huh? What do you mean?

298
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.892
You like someone too, right, Kosuke?

299
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:47.793
Huh?

300
00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:52.097
Your head was in the clouds
when I was talking, so I could tell.

301
00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.799
You can't help looking at them

302
00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.668
and you think, "I wonder
what they're up to now." Right?

303
00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.438
Is that what love is?

304
00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:01.073
It sure is!

305
00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:08.981
Oh… I see.

306
00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.652
Feel free to ask
for advice anytime. See you.

307
00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.420
Bye.

308
00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:33.972
I could see you, you know.

309
00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:52.291
You're still mad?

310
00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.361
I'm not mad.

311
00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:00.766
In fact, I'm sorry
for my lousy attitude earlier.

312
00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.338
I wish you and Kokomi the best.

313
00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.741
There's nothing like that between us.

314
00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:12.411
Besides, Matsuuchi likes someone else.

315
00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.580
What? She does?

316
00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:18.050
Yeah. You saw me
give her back the shoe bag, right?

317
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.224
But what about you?

318
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:27.993
Huh?

319
00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:33.131
Didn't it make you think
you'd rather have a cute girl

320
00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.900
than someone like me?

321
00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.637
You said you needed
something to compare it to.

322
00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:44.409
Yeah, I do have a better idea now.

323
00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:51.683
I realized love doesn't have anything
to do with making comparisons.

324
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.487
What's that supposed to mean?

325
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.356
I've got a better idea

326
00:20:58.824 --> 00:20:59.958
of what love is.

327
00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.733
I wonder…

328
00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.503
Could it be that I like you too?

329
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:17.209
What? Don't ask me!

330
00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:22.914
It's that candid side of you
that I like, Aoki.

331
00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.950
Cut that out! I can't take compliments!

332
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:30.589
It may have been too soon
to say that we're a couple,

333
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.991
but I do hope that…

334
00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.662
someday we will be.

335
00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:48.173
I'm glad I got to hear
how you really feel.

336
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:05.357
I also hope that someday

337
00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.593
I'll be deserving enough…

338
00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:11.763
for you to ask me out for real.

339
00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:18.470
Good.

340
00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.144
You look stylish in your street clothes.

341
00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.681
-You think so?
-Yeah.

342
00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:31.416
Thank you.

343
00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:38.356
Class prez, good morning!

344
00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.225
Take good care of us again today!

345
00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.794
Vice prez, good morning!

346
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.496
Your hair's looking nice again today.

347
00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.765
What happened with Aoki?

348
00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:50.168
Why does it matter?
As long as he's having fun.

349
00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.874
A text from Ida
first thing in the morning?

350
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.343
MIO HASHIMOTO

351
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.446
Aida rejected me.

352
00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:02.347
What?

353
00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:05.550
Where are you now?

354
00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.020
The school rooftop.

355
00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:18.697
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.

356
00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.098
