1
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,280
GRADUATION PARTY

2
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,200
FIVE MONTHS EARLIER

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,920
But... that can't be true.

4
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
All right. Thank you.

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
He's been released, hasn't he?

6
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,159
-Do I really have to go back?
-Why wouldn't you?

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Did you do anything wrong?

8
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
Then you should go back...
and with your head held high.

9
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,960
Go on, get dressed.

10
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,479
Why the hell didn't we hear he was out?

11
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
Same reason we didn't hear
he'd been locked up.

12
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,000
One of his moms is influential.
She owns newspapers and magazines.

13
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,280
-But that won't get him out of jail.
-Don't you have anything to say?

14
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,680
-Or will you say nothing as usual?
-At least she finally talked.

15
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,080
Some people knew
and never said a damn word.

16
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,879
Ander? Holy shit! You knew too?

17
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,599
So, everybody knew but me?

18
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,159
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

19
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,719
Correction. I have nothing to do with you.
I just would've liked to have known

20
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
that the boy sitting next to me
was a fucking killer.

21
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
Polo didn't do anything.

22
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,159
You expect us to believe you
of all people, Liar Barbie?

23
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,000
-Should we remind the class who you are?
-No need. Thanks.

24
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,199
All they have against him
is a statement from a jealous ex.

25
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,919
You don't get it, do you?

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,240
So, this whole show you put on
was totally pointless, right?

27
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,080
-Too bad.
-Like we needed your opinion, lowlife.

28
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,720
-Excuse me?
-Sit down and listen up, please.

29
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,959
Your classmate has been released on bail.

30
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,480
There are charges against him,
and he's still being investigated.

31
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
I told his family that I cannot allow him
to come back given the circumstances.

32
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,040
So, he won't graduate?

33
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,560
Fortunately, it seems
all this will be resolved soon.

34
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,480
What?

35
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
The judge has requested a confrontation
between Polo and his accuser in two days

36
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,279
to compare their accounts
and decide whether to pursue

37
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
or drop the charges.

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,639
I know it's hard to distance yourselves,
but I urge you to do it for your own good.

39
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,680
This week, we have representatives

40
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,959
from the world's best universities
coming to meet you.

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,279
With any luck, they could offer you
admission or a scholarship.

42
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,480
This is a crucial time.
There's a lot at stake. Stay focused.

43
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't let the past ruin your future.

44
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,120
Good morning.

45
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,560
Merry Christmas, happy New Year,

46
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,120
happy holidays, happy everything!

47
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,600
Leave. Now.

48
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,720
-Why are you here?
-I'm going to class.

49
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

50
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,759
-Why aren't you in Chile?
-Because I'm a responsible student

51
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,879
and I'm here to finish the school year.

52
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,839
Where are you sleeping? Who are you with?

53
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,319
Who needs to sleep here?
Baby, please.

54
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,360
This isn't a game, Valerio.

55
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,680
You know what Dad will do
when he finds out you're near me.

56
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,879
Maybe he'll buy me
another ticket to Chile,

57
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,839
and I'll be able to live off that
for a good while.

58
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,519
Listen up and try to get this
through that drug-addled brain of yours.

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,800
Dad will kill you when he finds out.
And that's not a figure of speech.

60
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah, of course.

61
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,399
I mean, after all,
I'm the one who corrupts minors...

62
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,839
and you're the innocent,
virginal victim, right?

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Because that's what you told him.

64
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,279
Did you bat your eyes at him
when you said it?

65
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,920
Do you know why he believes me?
Because I'm a model daughter.

66
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,360
Good, healthy...

67
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,879
And, above all, a liar.
If you'll excuse me.

68
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,879
-What are you doing?
-What you asked me to do.

69
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,759
Distracting you
when I catch you obsessing over it.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,920
-Do you need to do that by hitting me?
-Well...

71
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,120
I can think of another way. Come on.

72
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,079
Here, start playing.

73
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,519
-Seriously?
-Come on. Pretend I'm not here.

74
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,720
Look at the TV.

75
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,240
OK.

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Which game?

77
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,240
A fighting game? With jacked guys?

78
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Just shut up, play, and enjoy.

79
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,920
Hey, what's this?

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
What do you think, Omar?

81
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,879
-The usual.
-No, right here.

82
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,879
On your groin.
It's like a small lump. Look.

83
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,519
-I don't know. I have no idea.
-It's probably nothing.

84
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
What could it be?

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,639
Nothing.

86
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
But you should see a doctor.
Just in case.

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,519
Yeah.

88
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,040
-Should I keep going or...
-Yeah, don't worry.

89
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,519
I'm sure it's nothing.
Just get it checked out.

90
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,040
Come on, relax.

91
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,200
They haven't found the trophy.
He'll never be convicted without evidence.

92
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
Carla will get him convicted.

93
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,120
You don't know what they're like
when they're together.

94
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,039
One look from her,
and Polo will shit his pants.

95
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
-He'll end up behind bars.
-You don't know that.

96
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,759
He deserves it.

97
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,360
Since you're rich,
this'll blow your fucking mind,

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,720
but people don't always get
what they deserve.

99
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
What the hell do you want?

100
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,519
I spent Christmas
in a fucking juvenile detention center.

101
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,879
Where were you? Skiing in Andorra? 
Shopping in Milan?

102
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,480
Yeah, it was a blast
watching my parents' marriage go to shit.

103
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,360
Do you think it was easy for me?

104
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,639
We could go back to the way it was.

105
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,039
-All you need to say is you made it up--
-The way it was?

106
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,159
I used to live in fear of someone
finding out what happened.

107
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,200
I don't want to go back to that.

108
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
-Listen to me.
-I'm going to tell the truth,

109
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,679
but I'll give you a chance
to do it first.

110
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,759
Confess and you'll get
a reduced sentence.

111
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,919
Then it'll be over.

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,039
What a mess, right?

113
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,360
No comment.

114
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,679
Sure, because the killer
being the classmate

115
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,559
of the victim's boyfriend and brother
is something you see every day, right?

116
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,480
Didn't you hear Azucena?

117
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,679
I'm focusing on my future.

118
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,600
Oh, shit.

119
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,960
So, that's why you were shut away
in your house all break, ignoring texts?

120
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,919
-You were prepping for these interviews.
-If you want to talk, talk to Samuel.

121
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,639
I'll pass.
The "missing person" can go to hell.

122
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,360
-I don't take shit from anybody, Nadia.
-Weren't you crazy about him?

123
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
I got over him, like the flu.

124
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,399
A tropical flu. Lasted for months.

125
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,799
When I see him now,

126
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,240
all I can think about is how much
the jerk looks like Harry Potter.

127
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,080
It was like a spell, but someone went...

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
and when I look at him now...
I don't feel anything.

129
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,159
-I wish it were that easy.
-Huh?

130
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,600
Nothing.

131
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,519
Just keep trying.
Carla will come around.

132
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,519
-Why?
-Because she still loves you.

133
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,759
Only someone who's madly in love with you
would try to hurt you so badly.

134
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,679
What did you do to make her so spiteful?

135
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,960
Me? Nothing, Mom. I just--

136
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,559
Regardless, nothing justifies
what she's done. I mean...

137
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,679
these are serious accusations.

138
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,120
Cayetana, isn't it? Or is that a lie, too?

139
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,399
-Begoña!
-Look,

140
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,200
love is an incurable illness.

141
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,480
No pill, therapy, or surgery
can put an end to it.

142
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,000
I could forgive a person in love
for almost anything,

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
but there's no excuse for what you did.

144
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,799
-Mom.
-It was a scam.

145
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,759
You can't afford to be seen
with someone like her.

146
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,159
No. We're together, OK?

147
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,600
She's sleeping over.

148
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,919
-If she wants to.
-I do.

149
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
Goodbye. Thank you.

150
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
Peace be upon you.

151
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,519
And peace be upon you.

152
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,440
May I see your backpack, please?

153
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,679
Is this an excuse to flirt with me?

154
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,799
-Do I look like I'm trying to flirt?
-Well, it's working.

155
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,240
Your backpack.

156
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,399
-I'm a Muslim, too. I don't steal.
-It can't hurt to check.

157
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Sure. How come
you didn't check that lady?

158
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
She wasn't suspicious.

159
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,120
Just like at the airport, right?

160
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,879
At security checkpoints,
they only search people like you.

161
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,919
Need to see more?

162
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,320
Have a nice day, sister.

163
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,120
Hello.

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,240
-Mom, we have to talk.
-A letter came.

165
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,639
Well, not a letter.

166
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,039
Here.

167
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,200
ASILAH

168
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,919
I have a job, a house...
I'm doing fucking great.

169
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,480
And it'll be even better
when you're back with us.

170
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,440
-I don't want to get my hopes up.
-But he's locked up, Nano.

171
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,519
The inspector told your brother
that when the bastard confesses,

172
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,240
you'll be able to come back.

173
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,559
Did she really say that? Is she that sure?

174
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,919
Is this really going to end well?

175
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, of course, honey.

176
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,559
It's going to end well.

177
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,159
It's not a lost cause.

178
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
-At the hearing tomorrow--
-No, Samuel.

179
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,799
Those people always land on their feet
and have nine lives, like cats.

180
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,279
And if they run out of them,
they can buy more.

181
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,320
He'll get what he deserves.

182
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,919
Honestly, honey,
it's like you were born yesterday.

183
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,679
I'm sick of this. All of it.

184
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,000
Your brother had the right idea.

185
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
He's gone somewhere
where nobody knows him,

186
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,399
nobody looks down on him.
Somewhere he can start over.

187
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,159
-What if we join him?
-What?

188
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,519
I'm fed up with struggling here.

189
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
-Obviously.
-What do we have to lose?

190
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,919
My spot at the best school
in the country.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
For fuck's sake, Samuel.

192
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,120
The same school that's made
your life hell from day one?

193
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Where they look down on you?

194
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,679
Would you really miss anyone there?

195
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,120
How are you, darling?

196
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,159
"Darling"?

197
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,080
So I'm no longer a "fucking lying brat"?

198
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,840
I'd like to erase what happened
these past two weeks more than anyone.

199
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,960
-But only you can do that.
-Get out before Mom sees you.

200
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,159
Don't do it for me. Do it for Polo.

201
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,399
You said yourself it was an accident.

202
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,559
He took a life,
but he did it while trying to save ours.

203
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,679
Does he deserve 30 years in prison
for that?

204
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,799
How considerate of you,
worrying about my ex.

205
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,159
And the police potentially finding out
about your shady business

206
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,559
has nothing to do with it?

207
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm worried about your mom.

208
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,679
-She's got nothing to do with this.
-Not yet.

209
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,159
But if you don't retract your statement,
if the investigation continues

210
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
and they find me out,

211
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,480
I'll have to give the police
a bigger fish to fry.

212
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,519
If I talk and they look
into the winery's accounts--

213
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,399
-Those are your accounts.
-With her signature.

214
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,679
Your mom will lose everything.

215
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,919
She'll only have her name,
and it'll be worthless.

216
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,039
Why don't we both keep quiet?

217
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,559
Things could go back to normal.

218
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
Carla, I'm asking you to do 
whatever it takes to save this family.

219
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,759
Nobody is accusing you.
We're going to talk to everyone.

220
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,279
I heard the glass shatter,
and I ran over.

221
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
But I didn't push him.

222
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,960
It seems that nobody pushed him.

223
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,799
According to witnesses,
the glass was broken.

224
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
He lost his balance, and...

225
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,279
If it was an accident,
what are we doing here?

226
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,119
He lost his balance 
because someone stabbed him in the chest.

227
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,279
It's in the hands
of that fucking brat again.

228
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,160
I say we go to court tomorrow
in case she gets any funny ideas.

229
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,559
We'll see if he has the balls to lie then.

230
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,279
-Can we change the subject?
-No. Today, we talk.

231
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,039
College representatives are coming
in two days.

232
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,400
Someone from Oxford will be there.
Remember?

233
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,440
Marina wanted to study there.

234
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,240
She was a rebel,
but she busted her ass to go

235
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,000
to one of the most expensive universities
in England.

236
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,920
We used to make fun of her.

237
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,599
That was taken from her, too.

238
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,279
Who she was and who she could've been.

239
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,920
That's what
the murderer deserves: nothing.

240
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
It's called justice.

241
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,759
It's your word against hers.

242
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,200
What if there's someone else?

243
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,640
Who?

244
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,519
They can't find Christian.

245
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,880
Ander.

246
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
MEDICAL RECORD

247
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,279
I NEED TO SEE YOU. IT'S REALLY URGENT.

248
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,720
When did you notice it?

249
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,599
Yesterday.

250
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
Have you had any of these symptoms lately?

251
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,000
Fatigue, dizziness, bleeding nose or gums?

252
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,319
I don't know.

253
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,799
-What could it be?
-Anything or nothing.

254
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,319
-Are your parents with you?
-No.

255
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
-I'm 18 years old.
-OK.

256
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,160
When the results arrive,

257
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,839
we'll send you a message
so you can come get them.

258
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,720
We should have them tomorrow.

259
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,240
ALL COOL. WILL KNOW SOON,
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK BAD.

260
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,039
Waiter!

261
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,839
Are you talking to me?

262
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,319
I need a dose of your finest beverage.

263
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,759
Champagne. The usual.

264
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,440
-What are you celebrating, Mr. Chile?
-That you're here.

265
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,599
You don't have a friend in the world.

266
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,480
Do you think someone who buys
a bottle of champagne can be alone?

267
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,400
I'll have friends any second now.

268
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
Declined.

269
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,119
Well, that's easy to fix.

270
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
This is worth seven bottles. Your call.

271
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,119
You've seen too many movies.

272
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,799
I'll say it again. You don't have a friend
in the world, right?

273
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,559
What about you?
Are you ordering a drink?

274
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,359
I'm more into fucking.

275
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,799
-I guess we should stop. Huh, champ?
-First time it's happened.

276
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,839
Yeah, and I'm a virgin
and a cloistered nun.

277
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,200
With all the drugs you take,
it's a wonder you can fuck at all.

278
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,039
-That's what the blue pills are for.
-Oh, sure.

279
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,119
There's no problem chemistry can't fix.

280
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,640
Chill.

281
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,039
I was trying to get over one guy
by getting under another.

282
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,960
But that would've required
you being a bit harder.

283
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,039
How can I make it up to you?

284
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,000
I'd be happy sleeping
in each other's arms

285
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,640
and being all romantic.

286
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,519
Or you fingering me
and getting me off.

287
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,079
-Do you have a place we can go?
-No. I'm sleeping in my car.

288
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,519
Like it?

289
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,880
I stole it in London.

290
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,559
Sorry. I know it hurts
to be judged by the color of your skin

291
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,599
-or for your clothes.
-No worries.

292
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,400
It gave you an excuse
to flirt with me, right?

293
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
OK, another rich kid.

294
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,119
-You all think you're irresistible.
-Weren't you apologizing?

295
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,880
I was finished.

296
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
-So this is your flirting face.
-I don't have one.

297
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,200
-What's your name?
-Malick.

298
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,400
-I'm Nadia.
-I know.

299
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Tomorrow, university officials
are coming to talk to you.

300
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
They don't have time for all of you,
so write down your first choice.

301
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,200
Hopefully, they'll interview you.
We'll collect your forms in a minute.

302
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,440
Polo, for fuck's sake, stop calling me.

303
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:18,319
-Why does he insist on talking to Ander?
-He's scared because--

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,119
Ander could say Polo confessed
and corroborate Carla's story.

305
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,640
-Convince Ander to testify.
-Me?

306
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
-He's your best friend.
-He's a filthy rat.

307
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,480
I won't beg him for help.

308
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,519
If the hearing doesn't go well,
they'll close the case.

309
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,799
It'll be fine, Samu.

310
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,519
You may have fucked her,
but you don't know Carla like I do.

311
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,319
Go talk to Ander.

312
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,319
Carla!

313
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
-How are you?
-How am I?

314
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,400
Don't come near me

315
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,319
-because I swear I'll hit you--
-Listen.

316
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,960
I'm sorry I put you in this position,
but you can't back down now.

317
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,680
If I go forward, I'll lose my family,
the wineries, everything.

318
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,519
-What the hell will I have left?
-You'll have me.

319
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,200
I love you.

320
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,440
Only if I do as you say.
You'll toss me aside once I've done it.

321
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,599
No, it'll prove you're the person
I fell in love with.

322
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,200
Look, there's Sleeping Beauty.

323
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,680
In the car?

324
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,160
-What?
-What the fuck, Valerio!

325
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,799
You said I needed to save money.
Living in the car is cheaper

326
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
than paying for a hotel room.

327
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,279
Sure. That's why you're selling
your jewelry? Where's the ring?

328
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,200
Not yet at least.

329
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:55,119
I see you didn't leave
a single detail out, right?

330
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,119
Your limp dick.

331
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Damn!

332
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,279
You need help, dumbass.

333
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,079
With her?

334
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,039
Things are worse for you than I thought.

335
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,880
-No offense.
-That's a bit offensive, sweetheart.

336
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,960
-Do you mind?
-Sure.

337
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
-Thanks for your help.
-Don't mention it.

338
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,279
You're gonna sell the car, 
buy a ticket to Chile, and fly back.

339
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,839
Your mom
should deal with this divine retribution.

340
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,920
Bad news. She won't pick up the phone.

341
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,799
What happened?

342
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
I thought: "Christmas is a busy time.
She must be at the beach house."

343
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,880
But I called using a different phone,
and she answered.

344
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,400
I said: "Merry Christmas."

345
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,319
And she hung up.

346
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,920
I see.

347
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,200
Come and stay at home.

348
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,599
Dad will be traveling for a few days.

349
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,599
And then we'll see, OK?

350
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,680
Hey.

351
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,119
-Hi.
-I have something to say.

352
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,880
If you have any decency left,
you'll tell the judge--

353
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,920
I have to go.

354
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,160
-I'm talking to you, asshole.
-This isn't a good time.

355
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
Well, fuck you, then.

356
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,759
RESULTS AVAILABLE.
PLEASE COME TO THE CLINIC.

357
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Hello. Do you have to wait much longer?
How are you?

358
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
I'm sorry, Mom.

359
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,720
Darling...

360
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,079
all you've done is tell the truth.

361
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,640
Sometimes... that has a price.

362
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,920
We might have lost people along the way...

363
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,319
but whatever happens...
we'll always have each other.

364
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,599
Carla, I'll always be by your side.

365
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,400
Always.

366
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,640
-Ander hates me.
-What are you saying?

367
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,880
-What if he talks?
-He won't talk, OK?

368
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,240
Maybe not today.

369
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,119
What about tomorrow?

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,200
The day after? Next week?
Do I want to live like this,

371
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,319
wondering if I'll get caught?

372
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,759
Stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it.
Don't say that again.

373
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,599
What other choice is there, my love?

374
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,160
I could tell the truth.

375
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,279
Ander Muñoz?

376
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,519
You can come with me. I'm Julia.

377
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,599
Good afternoon. Let's begin.

378
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,039
Before the court clerk proceeds
to read your affidavits,

379
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,319
do you confirm
your versions of the events?

380
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,000
Anything to declare?

381
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:56,880
I...

382
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,319
-I wanted to say--
-I made it all up.

383
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,759
I was very angry at my father and my ex.

385
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,599
My father was always very strict with me.

386
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,799
I made it all up to hurt them.

387
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,039
But now I realize I've gone too far...

388
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,279
and I deeply regret it.

389
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,119
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused.

390
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,599
I hope you can forgive me.

391
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,200
I told you to speak to Ander.

392
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,799
Go to hell!
What about your girlfriend?

393
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,079
If she loved you, 
she wouldn't have stabbed you in the back.

394
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,279
Do you know what you've done?
What were you thinking?

395
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,599
About my future.

396
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,200
Let's go home, honey.

397
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,319
We'll talk later, OK?

398
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,319
I didn't talk to him all night.
We hadn't spoken in a long time.

399
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,920
What did you do after he fell?

400
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,240
I ran down to the dance floor.

401
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,519
That's all.

402
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Were you serious about leaving?

403
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
The sooner, the better.

404
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,880
Have you heard?

405
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,440
What should we do?

406
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,680
What do you mean? We forget it.

407
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,200
They let him go. It's over.

408
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,880
-So we let him get away with it?
-It's none of our business.

409
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,799
How so? Of course it's our business.
It's yours.

410
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,359
-Polo confessed to you.
-Omar,

411
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,000
I have my own problems.
I don't need anybody else's.

412
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,200
What's wrong?

413
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,759
Have you heard from the doctor? Ander...

414
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,720
He said it's nothing. Just a scare.

415
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,279
You scared me, you jerk.

416
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,680
Can we just lie on the sofa
and not talk?

417
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,160
OK. Want to play video games?

418
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,359
-Is it good?
-Delicious.

419
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,279
I'm glad you're home.

420
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,599
Thanks.

421
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,160
Dad will be back in three days.

422
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,000
We've got time to plan what to do.

423
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:08,800
He won't listen to me.
He'd listen to you if you told the truth.

424
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,639
I can't do that, Valerio.

425
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
Even if I wanted to.

426
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,599
I can't. I just can't.

427
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,079
Wasn't he away for three days?

428
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,880
-What's this scumbag doing here?
-Fucking hell.

429
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
-What's this-- Hey, answer me!
-Dad, chill.

430
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,760
Can we talk about this
in a civilized manner? Like...

431
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,039
Norwegians.

432
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,880
I appreciate you had the courtesy 
to sit at opposite ends of the table.

433
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,400
I only told him to come 
because his mom won't talk to him.

434
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,360
I don't care.
No more taking advantage of my daughter.

435
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,599
I'm your kid, too.

436
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,159
You're a degenerate
who sexually abused a minor.

437
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,679
I didn't want to get the police involved,
but enough's enough.

438
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,239
-Dad.
-It's a crime, and you will pay.

439
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,599
First with a restraining order.
And then, maybe, even with jail.

440
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Please.

441
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm being very civilized...
and very Norwegian, Lucrecia.

442
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,159
Anyone else would have killed him
for raping his daughter.

443
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,800
Valerio did not rape me.

444
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,360
OK?

445
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,679
-You are a child!
-So is he.

446
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,880
You're under his spell.
You don't know what you're saying.

447
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
I know perfectly well what I'm saying.

448
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,559
Nobody ever forced me
to do anything. Ever.

449
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,599
I fucked Valerio because I needed him.

450
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,559
I wanted him...
more than anything in the world.

451
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,239
Love isn't a crime...

452
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,880
and he's no criminal.

453
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,199
And I'm not the perfect daughter...

454
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,360
or the innocent child you think I am.

455
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,079
So you're an adult now.

456
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,400
You didn't want to see it,
and I was happy with that.

457
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,280
But I am.

458
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,039
Very well.

459
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,239
From now on, you'll live like one.

460
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
Legally, until you turn 18,

461
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,239
I have to provide you
with food and shelter, but that's it.

462
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,400
Forget about money, luxuries, outfits,
and expensive universities.

463
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,960
-What are you saying?
-You're an adult.

464
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
And when you turn 18,
I want you out of this house.

465
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:41,840
You're already 19, so I don't need
to spell it out for you. Go.

466
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,400
Hi.

467
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,719
How are you?

468
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,880
-I don't know what I'm doing here.
-Right.

469
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,039
Why didn't you answer 
my messages yesterday?

470
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,400
That's what you're worried about?

471
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,840
We need to get rid of the trophy,
then this will all be over.

472
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,159
It's safe with me.

473
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,199
-OK?
-What?

474
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,000
-Listen to me.
-No, Cayetana.

475
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,920
-Polo.
-No.

476
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,760
It's too risky
to try to get rid of it now.

477
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,119
And it's safe with me.

478
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,920
What do you mean?

479
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Polo.

480
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,280
Hey, Polo. Look at me.

481
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey... Don't worry. I'm on your side.

482
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm the only one on your side.

483
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,840
OK?

484
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,159
Your résumé is impressive, Nadia.

485
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,599
Thank you very much.

486
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,400
But... I'll be honest with you.

487
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't think
we'll grant you the scholarship.

488
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,719
Why not?

489
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,239
At our university,
we look at grades and hard work...

490
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,079
but also the student's life
outside the classroom.

491
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,679
Well, I have all sorts of interests.

492
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm very curious.

493
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,559
I work at my parents' shop.
I'd like to give them a better life.

494
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,719
I'm sure of that.

495
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,920
But we've heard about
a video going around.

496
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,519
That's not working in your favor.

497
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,360
For our scholarships,
we're looking for model students.

498
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,840
How'd it go?

499
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,679
-Would you rather tell me over coffee?
-What?

500
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,119
I'm a good Muslim.

501
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,480
-I'll introduce myself to your parents.
-I'm not a good Muslim.

502
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,639
Are you the only one who hasn't heard?

503
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,440
"The one who repents from sin 
is like one who did not sin."

504
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,360
Muhammad said that.
I wouldn't go against him.

505
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,159
-You know about the video?
-I've heard about it.

506
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,320
And you still want to buy me coffee?

507
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,679
What kind of Muslim are you?

508
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,079
One who lives in this century.
And I didn't say anything about buying.

509
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,719
-If the girl wants to pay...
-Sure. But aren't you loaded?

510
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
My father's loaded. 
Richest man in Senegal.

511
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,960
But here, I must be
the... third or fourth richest?

512
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,239
-Second, if I'm really lucky.
-Where have you been all this time?

513
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,119
What kind of university
would you like to attend?

514
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:11,199
I'm sorry, but I don't give two shits
about this.

515
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,039
It's not a good time for this.

516
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,280
I won't finish the school year here.
In fact, I might drop out today.

517
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,280
Look, sir. I just want to live well.

518
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,880
No cheating. All legit, you know?

519
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,599
But with my shitty grades...
Well, you tell me, mister.

520
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,239
Look, the cousin of a dear friend,
the best student in the class, by the way,

521
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,400
is very interested in finding out
about the whole scholarship thing,

522
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,400
in case she couldn't afford to pay
for her studies for some reason.

523
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,840
I can easily afford university,
but just in case...

524
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
I want to go
to the London College of Fashion,

525
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,159
but I also want to be with my boyfriend,
and he's not sure of his plans.

526
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,400
Whatever we do,
we'll do it together or in the same city.

527
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,119
He can't live without me.

528
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:02,159
So, Ander, where do you see yourself
in five years?

529
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,559
In ten years?

530
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,280
What do you want to do with your future?

531
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,360
Excuse me.

532
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
INFORMATION

533
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,360
It's over. Do you hear me?
I won't tolerate any more of this!

534
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,960
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for the school?

535
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,440
From now on, the slightest misconduct
or lack of discipline...

536
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,280
will mean immediate expulsion.

537
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,039
No excuses, no exceptions.

538
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,199
That means you won't graduate.

539
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,000
-That's unfair.
-Very well.

540
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,079
Let's talk about justice.

541
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:54,119
All charges have been dropped
against your classmate.

542
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,159
He's a murderer.

543
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,880
The person who accused him retracted
her statement.

544
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,199
It's gone on her permanent record.

545
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,559
She may even face legal consequences.

546
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,000
So to make things crystal clear...

547
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,480
if anyone so much as touches
a hair on his head,

548
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,280
I'll see to it
they don't finish the school year

549
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,400
and that it goes
on their permanent record.

550
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,400
Understood?

551
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,320
I can't leave.

552
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
Why should we leave
as if we've done something wrong?

553
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,880
Why should Nano have to stay in hiding?

554
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,760
No. I won't let them get away with it.

555
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,039
-We need to find a way--
-To do what? What are you going to do?

556
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,239
Fine.

557
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,840
I'll stay with you.

558
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,280
-I won't leave you here alone.
-No. Nano needs you more than I do.

559
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,079
And you need to get out of here.

560
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,400
I swear,
you both will be able to return soon.

561
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,280
Who'll take care of you?

562
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,719
Mom...

563
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,960
who takes care of whom in this house?

564
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,679
I don't know what to say.

565
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,599
It's OK. It's water under the bridge,
if you ask me.

566
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
All is forgiven.

567
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,599
I just want to leave all this behind us...

568
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,320
and start looking ahead.

569
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,880
We haven't found the murder weapon,
so... we're searching everybody.

570
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:54,440
Can I check your bag?

571
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,079
I would never hurt him.

572
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,239
Not him.

573
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,599
I loved him.

574
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,840
