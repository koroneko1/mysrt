1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,160
Mummy, look out!

2
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,880
No, no, no! No...

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,400
I love you.

4
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,040
I'm right behind you. Go, now!

5
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,680
Dad, would you like a...?

6
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
Do you mind turning it down?
It's a bit early.

7
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Is everything OK?
You getting ready for work?

8
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,320
Yeah.

9
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,800
How is work? It's fine. Same old.

10
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,640
What is it?

11
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,920
I think I might sit tomorrow out.

12
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,520
It all just seems
a bit much at the moment.

13
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
You're kidding me.

14
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,120
It's just that...
Yeah, it's her, isn't it?

15
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,840
Alice has nothing to do with it.
Yeah, well, it's funny that

16
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,840
every year we go and now she's
here, you suddenly don't want to.

17
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,160
That's not it.
What is it, then?

18
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,560
It's been 11 years.

19
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,960
It has to be OK to move on.

20
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,480
And I know this may be hard to hear,
but you need to try to move on, too.

21
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
It's what she would have wanted.
Don't talk to me about

22
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
what Mum would have wanted!

23
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
She'd be really disappointed
in you, by the way.

24
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
Jess?

25
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Jess. Hey.

26
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,320
Are you gonna help me or what?
Um, yeah. Give me a sec.

27
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,080
How is it you always
conveniently miss deliveries?

28
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Shh! Ooh, yeah. Wow. Stunning.

29
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,840
They're hideous.
I know. Put it on.

30
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
Absolutely not. Do it.

31
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Do it, do it!

32
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
OK...

33
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,440
Summer hon!

34
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Summer hon!

35
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,560
I swear, they're getting worse.

36
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,640
Uh, no, no! Delete it.
Why? You look stunning.

37
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,440
Don't post that, please.
Babe, I've already posted it.

38
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
No. No, no. Jess...
Give it here. Give it!

39
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,120
Give...
Oh, my God!

40
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,320
Get off me. Sorry.

41
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm sorry!

42
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,160
Jess? Oh!

43
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh, my God. What a weirdo!

44
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,520
He's actually quite fit, though.

45
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Yeah, I suppose.
Oh, he is.

46
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,120
I dare you. Really? Yes. Go on.

47
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,240
OK. Go! Off you go.

48
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,320
Hey, hey!

49
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,040
Hey, I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to...

50
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,920
I was just trying to see
if you guys were open. What?

51
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,160
You're interested
in novelty T-shirts?

52
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,680
Ha! No, no.
I'm looking for boat supplies.

53
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,440
You sure I couldn't tempt you
with a dream cat shirt?

54
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,840
Uh, maybe. Maybe.

55
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Actually, though,
I'm... I am really sorry.

56
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,800
I didn't mean to see you like that.
Don't worry about it.

57
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,520
So, tourist guy, do you
want to come to a party later?

58
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Potentially.
It will be nice.

59
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Just drinks, bonfire, music.

60
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,840
OK. OK, yeah. Why not?

61
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,280
It's on the beachfront, 9pm.

62
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,160
I'm Ben.

63
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Jess.

64
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll see you tonight.
Boat supplies over there.

65
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,160
Thank you.

66
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,560
You were right!
I told you.

67
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
All right. Here you go.

68
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,200
It's way too early. Babe, it's
never too early to do a shot.

69
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,040
To catch a tourist, my
favourite time of the year.

70
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,920
American as well.
American? Very nice.

71
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
Look, it's
probably not that serious.

72
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,800
Yeah, but it's not just that.

73
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
He got fired again.

74
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
Jesus Christ!

75
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
What's she like, then?
I don't know.

76
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,560
I just avoid them, really.

77
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,880
All they do is drink.

78
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,400
Not the same! No.

79
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,080
Look, I mean, if he's happy,
it's not that big a deal, right?

80
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,680
Yeah, I know.
But it's meant to be our thing.

81
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,520
Flowers and everything.

82
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll come with you.
If you want.

83
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,520
Honestly, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

84
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,240
Hm, probably be way
less hung over all the time.

85
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,800
Yeah, definitely that!

86
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
OK, I got beer or beer.

87
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,600
Beer. I'm gonna go for a beer.

88
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
A big beer!

89
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,440
You don't even like beer.
Why didn't you get anything else?

90
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Yeah, why didn't you get
anything else? Thank you!

91
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
Cos they didn't have anything
else in the shop. Here you go.

92
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Thank you! Here you go.
How you doing, Jess?

93
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,680
Yeah, I'm OK. Yeah.
Yeah, she's good.

94
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
Right? Yeah.

95
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,040
Hello. Hello.
Hello, boyfriend.

96
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,160
Where've you been?

97
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
Hmm. Building that.

98
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,040
Oh, did you make it?

99
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
Well, hello.

100
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,640
What's up? The sky?

101
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,040
Oh, that's a good one.

102
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,400
Why don't we have a dance? Tom...

103
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,880
You're not still
angry at me, are you?

104
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,560
Come on, we're good at this!
Come on.

105
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,520
OK. But just one dance.
Just one. Yup, just once. Yeah.

106
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

107
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,920
Jess. Look, I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

108
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,280
Huh? Hey. Why?

109
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
I said I've got to go.
My friend's here. Just stay.

110
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,520
Tom. Come on, wait a minute.
Tom! Come on. Just... Let go.

111
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
Just stay a bit. Tom, let go.

112
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
Off you go, then.

113
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,680
Hey, you came!
Hey, you OK?

114
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,840
Hey, mate. Yeah, it's
nothing I can't handle.

115
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,520
Who's this? He's my friend.
Let's go.

116
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,880
Where you going?
So she told you to leave her, man.

117
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,960
Oh, yeah...

118
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,560
What the fuck? Tom, what the fuck!

119
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Get off him! Tom! Hey!

120
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,040
Fucking... Oh, my God!
Are you OK? Emi, get him some ice.

121
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,400
- Yeah. Are you OK?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,800
Shit, I'm so sorry. It's not
your fault that he's an asshole.

123
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,160
Yeah, but I... invited you here.

124
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
That was a really warm welcome.

125
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,880
What's his problem anyway?

126
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,600
It's just those guys don't
take out-of-towners very well.

127
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,920
Yeah, well, he made his point.
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

128
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,520
Don't let this one get away!

129
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,440
For the pain?

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,040
Thank you.

131
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,200
Do you want to get out of here?

132
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, yeah. Please.

133
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
You guys have been fighting, huh?

134
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,520
Small town boys.
Absolute arseholes...

135
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,040
Which one's yours?
It's just right up here.

136
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,720
All right, here we are.

137
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding. Come on. Come on!

138
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,480
Fun neighbours? Yeah.

139
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,800
Yeah, they've been
partying since I got here.

140
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,880
This is your boat? Yeah.

141
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
It's a work in progress.

142
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,400
Wow!

143
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,200
Need a hand?

144
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,600
Welcome aboard!

145
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,280
This is kind of amazing.
Yeah, it's not bad.

146
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,560
Want the tour?

147
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Yeah.

148
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,880
All right. Come on. Let's go.

149
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,600
Watch your step!

150
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Turn around, turn around.

151
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Like a ladder, yeah.
Oh, like a ladder?

152
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,920
What?
Welcome to my home.

153
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,040
It's... actually pretty nice.

154
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,240
Hey, don't sound so surprised.

155
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Yeah, I'm not much of
a photographer, I know.

156
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm impressed.

157
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,040
So, are you gonna offer me another
drink or... Oh, right, yeah!

158
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,720
Do you want more vodka?
I could make you a gin and tonic?

159
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,960
Sure. All right.

160
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,480
OK... How strong you want it?

161
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,800
However you're having it,
I'll have it.

162
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,120
What's this?
That is a comms sat.

163
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,560
Lets us know where we are
and lets us communicate

164
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,120
with the outside world. Yeah, this
is the dolphin translator, yeah.

165
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,360
You can talk
to them through this!

166
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,240
And this is my
tracking bracelet.

167
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,000
It shows me where
the boat is at all times.

168
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,000
Cool. Yeah, you don't wanna be
overboard without this.

169
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,920
You all right? Yeah.

170
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,440
Um, just a bit seasick, maybe.

171
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,080
Now, let me see if I have
something for that. Hold on.

172
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,040
You know, you're
surprisingly organised.

173
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
I try my best.

174
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,680
Mm.

175
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,400
What? Nothing.

176
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
You j... You look nice, is all.

177
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,960
What? Like, I look
like a nice person?

178
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
You know what I mean!

179
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,880
So, why do you live on a boat?

180
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,560
Oh, I guess I've always just
been obsessed with the ocean.

181
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
Yeah.

182
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,960
And what do you think
of our little town?

183
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's not bad. Not bad at all.

184
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,560
Were you born here? Mm.
Yeah, I've lived here my whole life.

185
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,240
Wow. Yup, but I'm getting out
as soon as I can.

186
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,080
What's stopping you?
It's just me and my dad.

187
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
Divorced parents?

188
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,920
Uh, no, my mum died.
A while back.

189
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm sorry.

190
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,000
I lost my dad, too. To cancer.

191
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
I don't meant to take
away from you or anything.

192
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
I just... I wanted to say I get it.

193
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,360
How long have you
been away from home?

194
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
Oh, about two years.
That's a long time!

195
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,880
My, uh... mom kind of
lost it after my dad died.

196
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,600
After a while, I just realised

197
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,080
I couldn't be responsible
for her any more.

198
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,640
So, I got this boat and
I haven't looked back since.

199
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,240
You know, it's a beautiful night.
You want to take these up?

200
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
Uh, yeah, all right.
All right.

201
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
Here you go.

202
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,440
How are you feeling? Mm!

203
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,040
Kind of great, actually.
Good!

204
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,720
Mm.

205
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,440
It was quite a night.
Yeah, it was.

206
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,560
Thanks for inviting me.
Yeah, sure.

207
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,240
Mum!

208
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Morning!

209
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,880
God, you scared the shit out of me!
I'm sorry.

210
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Where are we?

211
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,080
On the ocean.
I can see that.

212
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,840
I, I just thought it'd be
fun to have breakfast up here.

213
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
And we're not that far out. OK, but
last night we were in the harbour

214
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,120
and now we're in
the middle of nowhere.

215
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,720
Shit, yeah, yeah. Uh, it
was meant to be a nice thing.

216
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,240
I didn't mean to freak you out.
You should have asked.

217
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,280
Yeah, you're right.

218
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,040
I... I messed up.
I'll take you back.

219
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,320
Wait.

220
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,720
I just... I need a minute.

221
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
No, no. I got it wrong.
I, I just got up early.

222
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,600
I thought it'd be nice
to have you up here. No, it's OK.

223
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,280
It's OK.

224
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,080
Just a bit of a shock.
I get it, yeah.

225
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,680
Uh, I'll take you back.
No, it's fine. Really.

226
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,320
Shit, I was meant to meet my dad!

227
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,720
Yeah, there's no service out here.

228
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,600
You know what?
He can just deal with it.

229
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,320
Sure? Yeah, I'm sure.

230
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,800
Forget it.

231
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
This... Well, this looks lovely.

232
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,640
Oh, come on.
You don't have to say that.

233
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,960
No, it is, really.

234
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
Gonna join me?

235
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,480
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Freshly caught?
Of course.

237
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,480
It's from the fridge.

238
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,440
How you doing?

239
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,960
You OK?
Yeah, I'm all right.

240
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,160
I don't normally
come out on the water.

241
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,560
Why not? Not much of a swimmer.

242
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,640
Really?

243
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

244
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,320
Come on, help me.

245
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,760
All right, we're going to hoist it.

246
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,320
OK... Take this.
Pull on the slack, OK?

247
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,680
Yeah. All right, here we go.

248
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
Got it? Yeah!

249
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,200
There you go. Look at that.
All right, here we go!

250
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,680
All right, you got it?
Yeah. Hand me this. OK.

251
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,400
There, we're gonna tie it off
and you're gonna do this

252
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,080
two more times, OK?
OK, how do I do the...?

253
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Two times around the top.
Got it? Got it.

254
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,560
All right, you got this!
OK. There you go.

255
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,040
Look at you go!

256
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,800
Where are we going?
You'll see soon enough.

257
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,960
- Gotta get a picture of you!
- You're beautiful.

258
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,480
Oh, come on! Having a good time.

259
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,760
There you go.

260
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,120
Amazing. One more, together.

261
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,720
Both of us?
All right, ready? Yeah.

262
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Whoa...

263
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Shit!

264
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Oh!

265
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,520
That was really close.

266
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,800
Shit!

267
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Is there a problem?
Um...

268
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Uh, it's just my dad
wondering where I am.

269
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,680
Don't worry. I'll get
you back by this evening.

270
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,200
He just really worries.

271
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Let him.

272
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,280
You need to learn to be a little
more selfish sometimes, OK?

273
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,320
Hey, come on.
I wanna show you something.

274
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,720
Come on!

275
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
Wow!

276
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,920
Where are we?
You can only get here by boat.

277
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,120
So, it's all ours.

278
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,720
Let's go!

279
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Come on!

280
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,640
Come on, let's go.

281
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,000
The water's great.
You're gonna love it.

282
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Come on!

283
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,360
Here you go, way to go.
Come on!

284
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,120
Look, you got it. Go! OK...

285
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,600
Ah!
There you go!

286
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,040
What's wrong?

287
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,920
Hey, hey, hey. You OK? You OK? Hey!

288
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,920
Can you swim? Can you swim?
Can you swim? Are you OK?

289
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, yeah. OK...

290
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,240
Better?
Yeah.

291
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,920
I know you said you're
not a fan of the sea,

292
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,680
but you swam from
all the way over there.

293
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,320
I can swim.

294
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
You OK?

295
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
It's... It's my mum.

296
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,400
She drowned.

297
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,760
Today is the anniversary.

298
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,480
It was an accident. A drunk driver
swerved and we went in the water.

299
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,960
We?
I got out, but...

300
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,120
Yeah.

301
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
I think she'd be
pretty proud of you today.

302
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,800
You know, you're actually
kind of all right.

303
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,640
Come on! Just all right?

304
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,480
Come on!

305
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,080
Come on. Faster, faster.

306
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,720
We should think about
heading back. Hmm.

307
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,720
I know.
I don't really want to.

308
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,280
Don't know what to do any more.

309
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,520
Spent my whole life
looking after my dad,

310
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,000
and now he's just
got this new girlfriend.

311
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,720
He's moved on from my mum and
he just expects me to do the same.

312
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,000
Come with me. For the summer.

313
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,080
We'll see how it goes.

314
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,400
I mean we'll go work when we
need the cash, live on the boat.

315
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,640
I know it sounds absolutely crazy,

316
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,320
but if you ever don't like it,
I can just bring you back.

317
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,880
You're mad. I'm not!
I'm absolutely serious.

318
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,520
Come with me.

319
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,680
What the fuck?

320
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.

321
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,840
What do we, what do we do?
Hey! Hey.

322
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,000
She's unconscious. Get a rope.

323
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,280
She's bleeding. Here, come here.
OK, tie it off, tie it off.

324
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,520
You got it? Yeah.
OK, you're gonna help me.

325
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,240
Come on. All right?
You ready? OK, yeah, yeah.

326
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,760
You got her? Yeah.

327
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,400
You got her? Yeah.
There you go. Careful, careful.

328
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
OK. OK.

329
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,120
You got her.

330
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,520
Go get her some water.
OK...

331
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,760
All right, you OK? Hey!

332
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,400
You OK? Hey, OK, yeah...

333
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,840
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

334
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,160
Don't try to talk. OK?

335
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Here. You're all right. You're safe,
you're safe, you're safe.

336
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,200
OK. Relax, all right?
You're in shock.

337
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,600
Drink some water.

338
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,520
Snap!
Yeah, it's a great look, right?

339
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,920
Stings like a bitch.
Yeah, it will.

340
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,120
You still look good, though.

341
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,320
Coffee?

342
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,480
Yeah, thanks.

343
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
There you go.

344
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,920
Best fucking coffee I've ever had!

345
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm Ben. This is Jess.

346
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Lexi.

347
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,640
Welcome aboard.
Cheers.

348
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,960
Do you have any idea
what happened to you?

349
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,440
Um... No, I don't know, really.

350
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,560
I was supposed to meet
some friends for a boat party.

351
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,480
Uh, they weren't where
they said they were gonna be.

352
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,800
So, I started the engine.

353
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,120
But there must have been some
kind of blockage or something,

354
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,360
cos I got thrown
forward and hit my head.

355
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Blacked out.

356
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,720
You're lucky you didn't fall in.
I know!

357
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,160
Thank God you guys found me.

358
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,480
Well, you're gonna be fine.

359
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,560
Uh, sorry. Sorry, I think maybe
I'm just a bit, um, jumpy still.

360
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,760
Sure, sure. Sorry.

361
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,880
Actually, you wouldn't happen to
have anything stronger, would you?

362
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,120
Yeah. Yeah, I could use one myself.

363
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,520
Jess? Um, maybe we should think
about getting back to shore?

364
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
I'm sure Lexi probably
needs to get checked out.

365
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,360
One can't hurt.

366
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,440
All right.

367
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,960
To Lexi. No, to you guys!

368
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,680
Agh!

369
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,800
Thanks. Another?

370
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,000
Uh, uh, no, actually, would it be
all right if I just took a shower?

371
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,400
Yeah, uh, it's just
right here on the left.

372
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
OK.

373
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,760
I'll leave a shirt in
the bedroom for you. Thanks.

374
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,600
Do you want me
to make anything to eat?

375
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,800
Uh, uh, sure. Sounds great.

376
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,640
I'll get the engine started.
Get us back to shore.

377
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
I've decided I'm gonna come with you.

378
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I will.

379
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,160
That is awesome!
We're gonna have so much fun.

380
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,880
I just need to get my things
and break the news to my dad.

381
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,760
OK, we're doing this.

382
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,800
Hey.
Hey!

383
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,320
He's meticulous, isn't he?

384
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,480
Yeah, I suppose.

385
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,200
Uh, another drink?
Sure.

386
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,720
Thank you. Cheers.

387
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,640
Are you feeling all right?
Uh, yeah, yeah.

388
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,640
Should we take this up?
Sure.

389
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,360
So, how long have
you and, uh...? Ben.

390
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,080
Ben, yep. Um, how long have
the two of you been together?

391
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Uh, since yesterday.

392
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,200
What?

393
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, it all happened really fast.

394
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,800
I went to a party and then,
we came back to the boat

395
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,320
and when I woke up,
we were out here.

396
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,320
What, he just... He sailed out
to sea whilst you were asleep?

397
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,240
Yeah, but it wasn't
like that, you know.

398
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,320
He made breakfast
and everything.

399
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,680
It was actually kind of cool.

400
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,800
Romantic. I think so.

401
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,240
How old are you?
22.

402
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,360
What?

403
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,400
You want the
good news or the bad news?

404
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,160
So, the engine won't start. But the
good news is, we still have beer.

405
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,520
What does that mean?
Well, we can still sail.

406
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,960
We're just gonna have to
wait until the wind picks up.

407
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,880
And the engine? I've been having
a problem with it overheating.

408
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,920
I think it just burnt out.
My dad's gonna kill me.

409
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,680
Look, why don't I
just raise the sails up?

410
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,440
And as soon as the wind comes back,
we'll be on our way in, OK?

411
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Surely there must be
some kind of way

412
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,920
to call the coast guard
or something?

413
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,080
Nah, the comms sat's down, too.
What? So you're saying there's no way

414
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,720
of anyone contacting us at all?
It's kind of great, right?

415
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm mean, how often do we
really get to be unreachable?

416
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,960
Yeah! Look, let's
just make the most of it.

417
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
I like this girl!

418
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,640
Look, why don't we just say,
this is like the first part

419
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,840
of our little adventure, OK?

420
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,840
OK. Give me one of them.

421
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,000
There we go.

422
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,160
Cheers. Cheers.

423
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,240
You see?

424
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,480
Wind!
I was just worried.

425
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
Ah, you're really
cute when you worry.

426
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
OK, more shots!

427
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,080
Shots, shots, shots...

428
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,000
OK. Here you go.

429
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,560
Ready? Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.

430
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,240
Mm! Ugh!

431
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,880
You OK? Yeah.

432
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,320
OK, so explain this little
bond you guys have got going on.

433
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,600
I want to hear all the details.

434
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,760
Well, uh...

435
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,160
We're both members
of the dead parents club.

436
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,080
Oh. I'm... I'm really
sorry to hear that.

437
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,680
Mum or dad?
Dad. Mum.

438
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
How long ago?

439
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,920
About two years.

440
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,760
How did he die?
Heart attack.

441
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,200
I thought it was cancer.

442
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,360
Yeah, it was.

443
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,920
He had a heart attack when
he was going through chemo.

444
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,480
His body just kind of broke down.

445
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,600
Sounds kind of like
a blessing in disguise.

446
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,280
Yeah.

447
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,160
Well, we really lowered
the tone, didn't we?

448
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,560
Yeah, fuck that.
Uh, let's play a game.

449
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I love a game.
Hm, bet you do.

450
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,320
Do you have a coin?
Oh, yeah.

451
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,000
OK, game on.

452
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,640
Flip, sip, strip.

453
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,960
Never heard of it.

454
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,400
I flip the coin,
you call heads or tails.

455
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,560
If you're right,
you're in the clear.

456
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,680
But if you're wrong,
you either have to

457
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,800
take a sip of your drink or
take off an item of clothing.

458
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,520
Who gets to decide?
The other two of us, I guess?

459
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,000
All right. Yeah?
Yeah, OK. Flip it.

460
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,520
Wait, who goes first?

461
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,760
Jess?

462
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
OK.

463
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,520
Heads.

464
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,840
Correct.

465
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,120
OK, Ben. Your turn.

466
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,760
Heads.
LEXI, JESS: Oh!

467
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,440
What are we gonna make him do?

468
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Strip, obviously.
Oh, OK. All right.

469
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,520
This is fun.
For who?

470
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,280
OK. Uh, tails.

471
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,000
Nope.
You're lying.

472
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm not.
Yes, you obviously are.

473
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,680
Strip.

474
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,880
Strip.

475
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,800
OK...

476
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,040
OK, uh...

477
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,880
Tails.
Wrong again!

478
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,840
Fuck!

479
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,280
How about we change it
up a little bit?

480
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,960
OK, how so?
Instead of just sip and strip, kiss.

481
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,560
Fine.
Oh, no, no, no. Not me.

482
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,640
You two.

483
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,200
They're not the rules. What, am I
not hot enough for you or something?

484
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,480
Is that it?

485
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,560
You're hilarious!

486
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,920
You know, as long
as we're raising the stakes...

487
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,000
...how about we each
take one of these?

488
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,360
What are they?
Yeah, all right.

489
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,560
Jess? I don't know.

490
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,800
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

491
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,840
I'm already having fun!
Come on. Don't be so boring!

492
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,360
Yeah.

493
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,120
There you go.

494
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,440
Bottoms up.

495
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,480
Oh! It tastes horrible.

496
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,320
There you go. All right, go.

497
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,520
Ben?

498
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,680
Jess, I...
I've been looking for you.

499
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,960
What happened to you?
Um...

500
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,760
Ben! Oh, my God. Ben...
Just stay calm. I can explain.

501
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,520
Ben, can you hear me? He's fine,
I've already... Get off me.

502
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,160
Ben? Ben? Can you hear me?
Listen... Ben?

503
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,280
Get off me! Listen to me...

504
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,120
Thank you.

505
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,200
Look, he, he... he attacked me.

506
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,640
What? I, I came in
to check on the engine.

507
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,400
I just flipped that switch
there and it just turned on.

508
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,800
They're not broken, Jess.
He was lying to us.

509
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,360
Why, why,
why would he attack you?

510
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,040
I don't know. I mean, he
smashed my head into that thing.

511
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,360
Look, we, we need
to move him, OK?

512
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,360
We need to, we need to tie him up
or something, before he wakes up.

513
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,720
Why were you looking
at the engines anyway?

514
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,960
Because I didn't
trust they were broken.

515
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,200
He drugged you, Jess.

516
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,560
Ben wouldn't do something like that.

517
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,640
I saw it, Jess.
You were... You were passed out.

518
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,040
But we all took that stuff together.
I didn't.

519
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,120
What do you remember?

520
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,320
After taking it?

521
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,240
It doesn't, doesn't make any sense.

522
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,560
Why not? Hm?

523
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,000
You don't know him, Jess.
Neither do you.

524
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,520
I need your help.

525
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,720
To move him. No.

526
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,080
He threatened me, Jess!

527
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,440
He said he was gonna kill me.

528
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,680
He obviously wants us
out here alone.

529
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,040
Just help me move him. Please.

530
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,160
Come on, quickly!

531
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,320
Do it!

532
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,040
Before he wakes up.

533
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,480
Oh, my God!
Come on, you piece of shit.

534
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,840
Jess, his legs!

535
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,080
Ah!

536
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,040
Fuck!

537
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,400
What the fuck is going on?

538
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,360
Did you tie me up?

539
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,760
Are you OK? She said...
You attacked me.

540
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,600
What are you talking about?
You knew I'd caught you out!

541
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,560
Jess, listen to me.
You can't trust her, OK?

542
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,760
You can't trust her.
Shut... Don't. Don't!

543
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Shut up!

544
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,840
He, he's bleeding.
He'll survive.

545
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,760
Something I need you to see.

546
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,920
Just watch him.

547
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,920
OK...

548
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,720
Jess, what the fuck is going on?

549
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,480
She says you attacked her.
She attacked me!

550
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,680
Ow! The last thing I remember,
I was working on the engine.

551
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,800
And the next thing, I come to,

552
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,320
and I'm tied up with my
fucking head bashed in.

553
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,280
OK...

554
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,240
There's an emergency panel inside
the cockpit on the starboard side.

555
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,240
Inside, there's a flare gun.

556
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,000
Get it, all right?
We have to get out of here.

557
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,040
OK. OK, you have to stop her. I will.

558
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,040
I thought you'd might
like to see these.

559
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,880
I've already seen these.

560
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,360
Look at the women in the pictures.

561
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,520
They're all young women, Jess.

562
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,720
OK. This is his thing.

563
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,760
He gets women onto this
boat and he drugs them!

564
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,520
Get off him! Don't you, huh?
I know what you did.

565
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,600
Don't! Stop.

566
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,760
Just come outside with me
for a minute, OK?

567
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,560
I know this is a lot.

568
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,000
But he's not a good guy, Jess.

569
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,240
You're just another
one of his conquests.

570
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,320
Look at this.

571
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,160
That's me.

572
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,280
I've been on this boat before.

573
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,440
I came back here, so I could try
and figure out what happened to me.

574
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,200
I can't tell if this is you.
He drugged me, Jess!

575
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,840
Just like he drugged
you last night.

576
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,200
You planned this?

577
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,360
Look, we can figure...

578
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,400
Whatever.
I'm gonna go get us moving.

579
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,920
Is this her?

580
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,760
What? No, that could
have been anyone.

581
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,840
Fuck.
Why else would she do this?

582
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,800
I don't know, cos
she's a fucking psychopath!

583
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,400
Some guy screwed with her head.
She's taking it out on me.

584
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,160
I don't fucking know, Jess.
That's not even fucking her

585
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,520
in that photograph.
For fuck's sake!

586
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,080
Take off my tracking bracelet.
Tell me what direction we're going.

587
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,360
Please, just do it. It's important.

588
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,080
Oh, shit!

589
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,360
Shore is to the east.

590
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,320
She's taking us the wrong way.
She's not taking you home, Jess.

591
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,720
Look at me. Look at me.

592
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,200
I've never touched her.
I have no idea who she is.

593
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,920
She's dangerous!

594
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,520
Why is the gag off?

595
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,840
Did he finally tell
you everything?

596
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,160
I told her that you're
a fucking psychopath.

597
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,480
And you believe him?

598
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,120
No.

599
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,600
You're right.

600
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,800
He's full of shit.

601
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,520
How long till we
get back to shore?

602
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,800
A couple of hours.

603
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,000
I need a drink. You want one?

604
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
All right.
Yeah, just make it quick.

605
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,680
Look what I found.

606
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,160
You said you love a game.
Fuck you!

607
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,320
Let's play yours now.

608
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,800
How about we start with two?

609
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,000
Open!

610
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,240
Fucking swallow it!

611
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,240
How many did you
make me take, Ben?

612
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,160
Swallow!

613
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,080
How about number fucking three?

614
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,200
Swallow!

615
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,400
Now! Quit fucking around!

616
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,800
Good. Open, show me.

617
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,120
Good boy!

618
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,320
Where's your fucking girlfriend?

619
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,800
What's taking you so long?

620
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,000
With that drink?

621
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,200
All right. Let's focus...
Ah!

622
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,560
She's out.

623
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,280
I hit her with a bottle.

624
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,280
I didn't know what else to do.

625
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,360
When she wakes up, she's
going to come after you.

626
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,960
So, just undo my tape and
I'll take care of this, OK?

627
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,760
I have to turn this boat around. So,
can you go lower the sail for me?

628
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,320
What's that for?

629
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,560
We have to tie her up if we're
gonna get you back to shore.

630
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,000
No, just... The sail.

631
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,240
Do you remember how to do that?
Yeah, I can do that.

632
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,200
Please.

633
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,120
What are you doing?

634
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,520
You're gonna kill her!

635
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,840
She was already dead.

636
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,360
No, she can't... She can't be.
You hit her too hard.

637
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,440
I don't know what
else I should do, Jess.

638
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,400
Look. No-one else knows
that she's on this boat.

639
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,440
And no-one has to. OK?

640
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,200
No. Hey, hey.

641
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,800
I care about you, Jess.

642
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,520
I don't wanna see your
life ruined over this.

643
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,400
So, just... Just think
about it, all right?

644
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,800
Ben, don't, don't.

645
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,040
Fuck!

646
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,240
Ah, fuck.

647
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,720
No!

648
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,840
You fucking hit me.
You weren't taking us back to shore.

649
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,960
You would have let him kill me!

650
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,440
You fucking bitch!

651
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,040
I love you...

652
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,840
You're my brave girl. Go, now!

653
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,160
Oh, hi.

654
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,600
Water.

655
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,920
What was that?

656
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,680
Water.

657
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,960
Sorry, my, um... My hearing
isn't quite what it used to be

658
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,440
after you smacked my head in.

659
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,240
Water.

660
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,280
Please?

661
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,720
Please.

662
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,760
Open...

663
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,840
Fucking deranged bitch!

664
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
Fuck you.

665
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,680
Where's Jess?

666
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,640
She...

667
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,640
Did you kill her?

668
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,920
It was an accident.

669
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,120
What do you want?

670
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,360
We both know this isn't the first
time I've been on this boat.

671
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,600
I didn't do anything!

672
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,520
I don't remember you.

673
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,200
Now, I have...

674
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,240
I've never drugged anyone!
You're lying.

675
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,080
You killed Jess! I told you,
it was a fucking accident.

676
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,640
OK, what do you want?
You want, uh... You want money?

677
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,240
Money? My dad's loaded.

678
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,240
I can get you as much as you want,
before you even get to shore.

679
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,960
See, I thought your dad was dead.

680
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,200
That's not the point.

681
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,640
What else have you lied about, Ben?

682
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,640
How much? Just name your price.

683
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,160
Do you think I want to
live off your guilt money?

684
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,960
All I want is for you to
tell me what you did to me.

685
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,520
I wanna hear you say it!

686
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,320
You still don't know.

687
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,920
Yes, I fucking do.

688
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,200
I was on this boat.

689
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,040
You fucking drugged me and raped me.
I know you fucking did.

690
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,360
Yeah, I cannot remember you.
I want to hear you say it.

691
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,120
Stop fucking laughing,
you're sick in the head!

692
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,720
I, I...

693
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,040
I told you already.

694
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,440
I don't even remember who you are.

695
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,160
How many other women
have you done this to?

696
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,880
I didn't do anything.

697
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,840
Shut the fuck up!

698
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,920
I need to drop anchor.

699
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,960
Oh, my God.

700
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,240
Oh, you fucking genius!

701
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,440
Come on, quickly.

702
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Quickly!

703
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,880
Come on.

704
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,840
Who is it?

705
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,040
I don't know.
It's Lexi.

706
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,520
That's not her.
Look at her wrist.

707
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,400
Her tattoo.

708
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,920
Did you take any of me?

709
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,560
I, I can't believe you think
I would do something like that.

710
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,480
I would never hurt you, Jess.
I promise.

711
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,280
So, just let me out and we can...
We can what?

712
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,480
You drugged me!

713
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,080
It doesn't matter
what the fuck you think.

714
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:16,280
She's not going to let you off
this boat alive and you know that.

715
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,400
That depends.

716
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,600
I'll take you back, Jess.

717
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,840
But no-one can ever know what
happened here. Can I trust you?

718
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,080
You fucking what?!

719
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,800
You can't trust her! Look,
I never meant to hurt you, Jess.

720
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,520
I didn't even know you
were gonna be on the boat.

721
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,720
I had to know what he did to me
and he's gonna keep doing it

722
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,880
unless someone stops him.

723
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,480
You were right.

724
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,520
Oh, fuck!

725
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,240
You'll fucking regret this, Jess.

726
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,360
Jess, you need to go now..

727
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,640
We have to take him back to shore.
I can't do that.

728
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,760
You know I can't do that.

729
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,920
Lexi!

730
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,200
Stop! Let her, let her go!

731
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,920
Let, let go of her! Let her go!

732
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,200
She's gonna blow up this boat.
She's gonna kill us both.

733
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,400
Don't be fucking stupid!

734
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,040
Please, please, please.
Don't, don't! Don't.

735
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,680
Shut the fuck up.

736
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,320
Ben, Ben, Ben, you don't
want to do this, please.

737
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,640
Please!

738
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,200
Please! Please.

739
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,440
Jess.

740
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,320
Jess, Jess, I'm not
gonna hurt you, Jess.

741
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,960
OK? Because I, I need you
to help me here.

742
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,040
All right?

743
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,600
We can work this out, OK?

744
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,360
This could just be our little thing.
So, you just have to...

745
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,600
Just come here.

746
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,120
Promise me that
you're gonna help me.

747
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,520
Come here.
Fuck you!

748
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,560
Promise me!

749
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,320
Jess, open the door.

750
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,400
Open the fucking door!

751
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,520
That's what you fucking want to do?

752
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,320
I wouldn't do that.

753
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,320
Ugh!

754
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,760
Come on!

755
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,040
Lexi?

756
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,120
Lexi?

757
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,520
Oh, my God!

758
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,800
Lexi!

759
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,760
Lexi!

760
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,560
You OK?

761
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,840
Let's go.

762
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
