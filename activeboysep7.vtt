00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.380
Declare! Why do you follow me?

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.190

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.080

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.140
I will release after you have talked about this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.820
Hurry up, why do you follow me?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.940

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.140
Hurry up...

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.720
I like you...

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.760
Why do you like me suddenly?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.260
Because... I just like

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.410
We haven't met before, and you like me?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.590
Me...

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.950
I've got a thunder love with you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.020
since the first time we met in the park

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.150
Weren't you died by the thunder?

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.740
Bullshit

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.890
But

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.360
I know you've got a boyfriend already

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.840
Who tells you that?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.250
I saw it myself

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.090
In a coffee shop

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.130
You and Lam

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.850
Coffee shop... Lam?

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.130
Introduce to Khoi, this is Thao's boyfriend

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.070
A girl going out this time has to take her boyfriend along. Is it right, Oppa?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.190
Because you always message to me

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.400
It's too annoying

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.510
So that I take my boyfriend here today to tell you that

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.220
I've got a lover already

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.050
He's my younger brother!

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.910
I only wanna cut down with that boy, so I get Lam to disguise as my boyfriend

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.800
So I still have a chance?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.250
What is chance?

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.220
But, you know Lam?

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.090
Yes

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.490
He's in music club. And I'm Long, in basketball club.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.000
Basketball?

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.750
It turns out you are one in bad guys that my brother have told me

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.140
Not bad guy at all

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.370
There's no good thing. So you're only in grade 12?

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.090
Yes

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.990
Hey, do you wanna "fly a plane"? It's not easy

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.480
Let's dream about it, I only like a mature man for me to lean on

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.320
I don't need one more brother, it's enough with only one in my house

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.570
Come here

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.280
Huh?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.140
Don't you know that flying the plane is a hot trend now?

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.030
What is hot trend? Terrified!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.660
Bye little boy, I go to do adult's works

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.490
Learning well, boy, little boy...

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.730
No following!

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.360
Got it?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.200
Wait and see. I will prove you

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.580
How am I mature!

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.890
Very good at trying! But you can't win us

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.810
Stupid!

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.970
Don't be arrogant! Then when you lose, don't have any ways to hide

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.970
Let me see, what faith are you leaning on to win us.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.310
But now, get out

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.310
How can you chase us?

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.930
Today you guys don't have any practice plans

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.290
I like, so I chase

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.120
This' my game, my rights

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.120
Do you wanna go by yourselves or wait for me chasing?

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.530
Damn it, keep your mouth!

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.150
What do you think this place is?

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.610
Intend to stir up this place? Let's recede all

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.170
Minh Lâm

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.420
Go out and talk to me a while

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.990
Be careful from me

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.050
Because of your teamate

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.630
I'll use my own money to return to music club

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.820
please stop here

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.030
Why? There's no reason for you to do like that!

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.630
What are you doing?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.930
If we fight together, your team will lose seriously!

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.660
Don't perenoia, we won't give up!

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.980
Wait and see

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.330
Mom

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.980
How are you?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.920
Your leg occurs again periodically?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.590
I'm ok. Only a bit hurt after a long time I didn't activate

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.480
If it's not ok, you can stop, i'll give you some money

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.610
Don't play for those prizes anymore, I think...

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.540
Mom

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.830
Why do you keep talking about that thing? I've told to that I'm Ok

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.670
Who wants to use mom's money to hold on their club?

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.890
I only talk, in fact, I don't have money for you to hold on you club

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.040
God! What do you tell me for?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.910
For funny

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.480
I go to take a shower

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.200
Where?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.790
Shower!

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.470
Who allows you?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.170
I'm dirty, I'm outside all day

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.240
I will bath for you, don't bath yourself

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.140
I'm mature now, how can you bath for me?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.460
No matter at how you're mature, you're still my son, the soap will spicy your eyes

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.130
I heard that you've got sickness, I bought you some foods and medicines

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.690
Come in

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.380
Yes

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.180
Teacher, Let's eat this then take some drugs, it's still hot!

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.510
Thank you.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.240
Yes

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.260
Let me help you type the marks

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
you have to eat and take drugs

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.130
Khoi, don't leave me

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.340
Alo

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.950
