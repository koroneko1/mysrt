1
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,023
Good morning, sir!

2
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,210
Dicky Chow!

3
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,049
Just look at yourself.
You're covered in dirt.

4
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,426
-I just--
-Don't move!

5
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,220
And don't give me the usual routine.

6
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,139
Why are you always so untidy?

7
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,892
What's the matter, Mr. Cao?

8
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,060
Explain yourself!

9
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,312
Let me talk to him.

10
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,276
Where did the dirt come from, Dicky?

11
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,655
Well, on my way to school,
I slipped and fell over.

12
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,741
Don't your mom or dad
bring you to school?

13
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,952
Mom died a long time ago
and Dad's very busy.

14
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,455
What does your dad do?

15
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,956
He's a coolie.

16
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,134
I'd like to meet him one day.
Would that be possible?

17
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,679
I don't think he has the time.

18
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,266
When he's available, then.
Will you let me know?

19
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,519
Go clean up before class starts.

20
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,521
Thanks, Miss Yuen.

21
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,362
I want to be a superstar.

22
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,115
-Like who?
-Nicole Kidman.

23
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,493
She gets $20 million for a movie.

24
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,787
I wouldn't mind being her either.

25
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,289
I want to be an entrepreneur.

26
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,874
What kind of business?

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,336
Any kind, as long as it's really big.

28
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,797
Big business always pays out.

29
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,216
Why not?

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,476
I want to be a poor person.

31
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,733
Stop!

32
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,362
My dad says
if you have integrity...

33
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,741
...don't lie, don't fight,
and study really hard...

34
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,035
...then people will respect you
even if you're poor.

35
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,553
Don't....

36
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,849
Don't come over here!

37
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,352
Put it down!

38
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,940
Go back to your seat!

39
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,864
The name of this amazing dog is CJ1.

40
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,035
It was developed jointly by U.S.,
French and German scientists.

41
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,788
Imagine! Jointly developed!

42
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,624
-Do you want a go?
-Yes, please.

43
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,710
Back off, loser!

44
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,298
There are only two in the world.

45
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,677
The U.S. president's daughter
has the other one.

46
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,805
-What are you doing?
-Eating noodles.

47
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Stand up!

48
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,813
No matter how much you eat,
you are doomed to be a dwarf.

49
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,648
Now get lost!

50
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,486
The quality of the students
in this place gets worse every day.

51
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,908
What have we here, another alien?

52
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,911
-What are you doing?
-Eating rice.

53
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,205
You're just like a huge tub of lard.

54
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,708
Maybe you should
go see the doctor.

55
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,503
You eat so much.
It's horrible!

56
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,091
Someone call the police
to shoot this monster!

57
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,053
Eat to death! Giant monster!

58
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,346
What are you doing?

59
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,482
Bullies! Heroes don't hit women.

60
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,026
Not you again!

61
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,611
Ignore him.

62
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,907
Go away, poor boy.
We don't want you around.

63
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
Go away, poor boy.

64
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,259
Hi.

65
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,803
Hi.

66
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,974
You've been sent off the field too?

67
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,059
Yes.

68
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
Did you forget your sneakers?

69
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,566
I brought them,
but I didn't wear them on purpose.

70
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,985
Why?

71
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,070
Because I wanted to be with you.

72
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,581
Are all your shoes like that?

73
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,586
Yes, they are.
My dad gets them from the dump.

74
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
Your dad's so nice.

75
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,340
He is, actually.

76
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,845
But I so much want a new pair...

77
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,180
...because I really love sports.

78
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,559
I'd like you to keep the old ones.

79
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,935
Why?

80
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,272
Then we'd be punished together,
forever.

81
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,960
Get that panel up there.

82
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,295
Quickly!

83
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,214
You. Hurry up.

84
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,314
You're no longer needed. Go home.

85
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,316
Hey, boss?

86
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,071
With it being so hot right now,
my son can't sleep.

87
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,989
I need to buy an electric fan.

88
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,491
Can't you keep me on?

89
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,702
You should be
paying me back instead.

90
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,623
I paid all the bills
when your wife got sick and died.

91
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,459
Look at yourself.
You'll die before your debts are repaid.

92
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,629
You're starving yourself so your son
can go to that fancy school.

93
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,382
If my son can go to public school,
why can't yours?

94
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,594
Well, I want him
to have opportunities.

95
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,554
I don't want him to end up like me.

96
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,932
But you have to have capability.

97
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,475
He's highly capable.

98
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,102
I'm talking about you, not him.

99
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,939
All you have is a casual job
with no prospects.

100
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,440
How are you going to cope?

101
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,068
-I can manage.
-You can't manage!

102
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,363
-I can.
-You can't!

103
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,825
I can manage.

104
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,495
Very well. Block B. Foundations.

105
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,122
Thanks.

106
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,458
If you want to die, I can't stop you.
Shame on you.

107
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,055
You're back.

108
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,016
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

109
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,434
Just step back a bit.

110
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,940
-What's going on?
-Turn round.

111
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,536
Come here.

112
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,663
What?

113
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,790
An electric fan!

114
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,418
That's so great! Is it real?

115
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,295
We finally have a fan!

116
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,381
-Now sit down and let me turn it.
-Quickly, Dad!

117
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,265
Dad, did you find this
in the garbage?

118
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,142
No, I bought it.

119
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,228
It cost a lot of money.

120
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,728
You were ripped off!

121
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,815
No, it was fine when I bought it.

122
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,360
So how come it's not working now?

123
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,780
Dumbass.
Use your head next time.

124
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,949
"Dumbass"?
Where did you get that from?

125
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,367
A guy in my class.

126
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,494
Oh, really? Well, let me tell you...

127
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,163
...we may be poor,
but we don't use bad language.

128
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,124
We don't steal. We don't rob.

129
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,586
We don't take things
that don't belong to us.

130
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,632
You must concentrate
on your studies.

131
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:44,138
I didn't study at all when I was young
and look where it's gotten me.

132
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,249
We're having an apple today?

133
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,667
Yes, we are.

134
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,253
But put it down now.

135
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,965
Finish your dinner first.

136
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,719
Hey, Dad, my sneakers
are worn out again.

137
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,178
Will you buy me some more?

138
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,432
I need you to get me a better pair,
or I'll be sent off the field again.

139
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,476
Got it. Don't worry.

140
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,694
You're still eating!
Lay off the cockroach.

141
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,447
You can get it after you've finished.

142
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,694
Nice. You've improved.

143
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,785
Not bad.

144
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:07,198
There have been many sightings lately
of UFOs, Unidentified Flying Objects.

145
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,450
What happened to the cartoons?

146
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,910
They'll be back in a minute.

147
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,540
Could you please tell us
what happened?

148
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,291
I saw a flying object.

149
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,545
It flew from here to there
with a "whew" sound.

150
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,632
Can you describe the object
in more detail?

151
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,509
That object could really fly!

152
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,553
Though it wobbled a bit.

153
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,179
I suspect it had crashed before.

154
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,347
Crashed?

155
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,267
Yes, like a car crash.
It might have been broken.

156
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,310
I took a picture of it.

157
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,195
What kind of camera did you use?

158
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,324
It was expensive,
but I can't possibly tell you the make.

159
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,994
Did this particular flying object
make a sound?

160
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,039
It made some "whew" sounds like I just
told you. "Whew." Do you hear me?

161
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
Unbelievable.

162
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,690
Don't run off like that.

163
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,860
Dad, this is called a CJ1.

164
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,362
Everyone at school has one.
They're great!

165
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,530
Really?

166
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,867
Let's go home. Put it back.

167
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,340
What's the matter?

168
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,425
Why can't I have it?

169
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,719
We'll buy it
after I get paid next month.

170
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,054
Now, put it down.

171
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,189
Let go!

172
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,821
Didn't you hear me?
I have no money.

173
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,994
If you buy me this,
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

174
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,704
I beg you.

175
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,751
What about this one?
What features does it have?

176
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
Let go.

177
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,676
Let go!

178
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,932
Let go!

179
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,770
Let go!

180
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,690
Come back!

181
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,694
Sir? Do you wish to buy that?

182
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,295
Come on, Dicky. Don't cry.

183
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,422
Stop crying now.

184
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,089
Good boy, stop crying.

185
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,466
Dicky.

186
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,635
Are you Mr. Chow?

187
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,471
I'm Miss Yuen, Dicky's teacher.
Good to meet you.

188
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,057
Miss Yuen. Good to meet you too.

189
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,768
Is Dicky well-behaved at school?

190
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,021
Yes, he's quite good.

191
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,231
He's in a really bad mood right now.

192
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,026
I know.
Kids just want every toy they see.

193
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,193
True.

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,281
Just happens I didn't bring
any money today, so....

195
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,700
Dicky, go to your dad.

196
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,285
Come here.

197
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,497
-I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
-Don't worry. He's like that.

198
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,542
In fact, I'd like to do a home visit.

199
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,587
He did tell me,
but I'm very busy at work....

200
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,007
I believe that a good education
doesn't just rely on the teacher.

201
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,509
That's why I'd like to involve you.

202
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,261
It'll be good for him.

203
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,305
Ah, yes. I see.

204
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,682
Dicky, I need to go now.

205
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,854
Don't be so grumpy.
And listen to your dad, okay?

206
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,231
Okay?

207
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,194
-I must go.
-Okay.

208
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,945
-Bye, now.
-Bye, now.

209
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,269
Dicky.

210
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,021
Look at me.

211
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,860
I have something
way better than CJ1.

212
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,487
Do you want to see it?

213
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,497
Are you sure?

214
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,503
In that case, I'll throw it away
and get back to work.

215
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,215
Goodbye, sir.

216
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,466
Goodbye.

217
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,761
Fanny.

218
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,557
Where's this amazing toy, then?

219
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,017
Look!

220
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,441
What's so great about that?

221
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,902
It's fun. Look!

222
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,239
It doesn't look that fun to me.

223
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,532
What do you think?

224
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,619
Actually, I agree. It's no fun.

225
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,123
Never mind. See you tomorrow.

226
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,962
What's that thing you're holding?

227
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
Nothing.

228
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,965
It looks like rubbish.

229
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,469
Says who?

230
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,056
This is way better than CJ1.

231
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,516
So, what's it called?

232
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,521
It's called CJ7.

233
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,815
Pathetic piece of crap.

234
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,653
Your dad found it in the garbage.

235
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,530
Don't talk about my dad like that!
I'm going to beat you up.

236
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,783
Oh, yeah?

237
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,465
Hello.

238
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,505
How many times
do I have to tell you?

239
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,718
We might be poor,
but we don't fight.

240
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,720
You really disappoint me.

241
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,181
Look at this.
Your uniform's all torn.

242
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,225
What was the fight about?

243
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,395
They were laughing at me.

244
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,063
What about?

245
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,113
Well?

246
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,707
Fine.

247
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,335
If you're not going to tell me...

248
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,925
...then I have no choice
in the matter.

249
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,065
Last chance!

250
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,655
It's moving!

251
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,436
There are ghosts.

252
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,938
Ghosts? Where?

253
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,023
There. In the ball.

254
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,151
Don't change the subject!

255
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:56,614
You think you can run rings around me,
but you're not as clever as you think.

256
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,786
Your uniform's a mess. What will
you wear for school tomorrow?

257
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,499
Do I have to
go hunt for another one?

258
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,876
I'll deal with you later.

259
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,562
There's a ghost!
Hanging over there!

260
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,857
Help! Ghost! It's horrible!

261
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,359
There's a red ghost hanging there!

262
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,780
Hanging! Too horrible!

263
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,365
Calm down!

264
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,909
It's a broken lamp. Can't you see?

265
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,920
Not again!

266
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,589
You're a ghost too.

267
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:58,427
Stop shouting! I'll send you outside
if you don't stop! Understand?

268
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,552
Are you on drugs or something?

269
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,724
What are you doing?

270
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,602
Please don't lock me in!

271
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,897
There's a ghost.
You have to believe me.

272
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,191
Let me out!

273
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:59,696
Please let me out!

274
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,128
Help me, Lord.

275
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,490
-Learned your lesson now?
-Yes, Dad.

276
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,949
Will you behave yourself now?

277
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,826
I will. I really will.

278
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,537
I have to get back to work.

279
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,582
Okay! Off you go. Bye!

280
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,206
Are you from outer space?

281
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,003
Have you come to invade Earth?

282
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:45,505
I think you might be
an alien toy dog.

283
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,655
My name is Dicky.

284
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,033
Can I call you CJ7?

285
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,912
If you wag your tail,
it means you like it!

286
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,830
CJ7!

287
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,429
The apples in our house
are always rotten.

288
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,348
So how come this one's not?

289
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,933
You know magic?

290
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,191
Wow! It's so sweet.
You really do know magic.

291
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,777
I'm going to be rich!

292
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,048
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

293
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,636
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

294
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,846
Go!

295
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,166
Oh, my God!

296
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,774
I have a test today and I've been
playing with you instead of studying.

297
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,277
But I really want to get 100.
Can you help me?

298
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,298
What's that you're making?

299
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,181
Dicky Chow.

300
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,644
Why are you
wearing those glasses?

301
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,771
My eyes hurt.
Do you want to take a look?

302
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,108
No, I don't. Sit down.

303
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,197
Begin writing now!

304
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,860
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

305
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,029
A fly?

306
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,035
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

307
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,382
I now have the results
of today's test.

308
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,385
And for the first time,
Dicky Chow got 100.

309
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,061
-Thank you, sir!
-Hold on a minute.

310
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,065
I want to see those glasses.

311
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,753
Those super-glasses were fantastic!

312
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,507
It's P.E. next,
so I'll need super-sneakers!

313
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,102
This is so exciting.

314
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,111
Excellence at the high jump...

315
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,946
...requires talent, hard work...

316
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,448
...training, a good night's sleep...

317
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,576
...and finally,
respect for your teacher.

318
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,411
This is my personal record.

319
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,038
So far no one has bettered it.

320
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,133
I have new sneakers today, sir.

321
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,597
Sir! He just broke your record.

322
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:03,151
Dicky, it doesn't ring true
that a kid can jump that high.

323
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,987
Be a good boy and do it again.

324
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,571
Dicky Chow.
What are those shoes you're wearing?

325
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,198
It's none of your business!

326
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,741
This is too much.

327
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,827
You drove me to this.

328
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,036
Come down!

329
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,395
-Dicky! Are you out of your mind?
-I....

330
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,106
Over here. Catch him!

331
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,859
Come to your senses, Dicky.

332
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,947
Miss Yuen, bitterness, like the sea,
is boundless.

333
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,951
Dicky!

334
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,246
Dicky Chow! How can you jump
so high? Come down this minute!

335
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,577
How on earth
can you sleep like that?

336
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,455
Wake up. It's nearly time for school.

337
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,503
What do I have to do
to get you up in the morning?

338
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,172
It was all a dream?

339
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,429
You're real.

340
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,932
I'm getting ready right now!

341
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,854
Dad, I'm going to get 100
on the exam today.

342
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,189
What?

343
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,816
I'm going to get 100!

344
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,025
Really?

345
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:35,488
Yes! All on my own! 100!

346
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,200
That's great.

347
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:55,632
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

348
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,054
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

349
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,305
Go!

350
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,914
Run!

351
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,731
So, what happened back there?

352
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,279
You're supposed to be
the superdog from space.

353
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,615
Don't tell me
you were just pretending.

354
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,534
Seriously.

355
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,287
I have to get 100 on the exam.

356
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,458
I need you
to work your magic for me.

357
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,629
Come on, now. Please!
I'm not joking.

358
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,634
You have to give me
magic weapons.

359
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,035
Time's up.

360
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,955
What?
But I haven't started yet.

361
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,376
What's with the turd?

362
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,337
Turd? It's not that!

363
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,381
Shows how much you know!

364
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,227
You set me up!

365
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm going to kill you!

366
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,073
Give me the magic weapons now!

367
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,045
Why, you....

368
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,217
You....

369
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,238
Please, sir. Can I say something?

370
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,907
No, you can't.

371
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,118
You are a poor student.

372
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,954
You are always dirty,
and you are very wicked.

373
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,582
You discredit the school.

374
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,584
There's nothing more to say.

375
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,628
Now clean him up!

376
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,599
CJ7?

377
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,976
Please come out.

378
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,647
Why would I be mad at you?

379
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,149
We're good friends.

380
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,820
The turd wasn't important.

381
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,280
I've seen it all before.

382
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,993
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Okay?

383
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:37,623
In fact, I love you very much.
Do you know that?

384
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,837
CJ7? Come here.

385
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,340
Closer!

386
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,978
I'm going to stab you to death!

387
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,655
Rubbish dog from space.
You're low-tech and boring.

388
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:13,701
I got blamed and laughed at.
And all because of you.

389
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,997
If you're just an animal, then say so!
Don't pretend you have magic powers!

390
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,376
But did it ever say that?

391
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,546
Did I get it wrong?

392
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,510
Have I made a mistake?

393
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,804
I know I've made a mistake!

394
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,653
Wait!

395
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,157
Hey! Wait!

396
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,743
Wait!

397
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,757
Dicky! What's happened?

398
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,092
CJ7 has disappeared.

399
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,849
Look.

400
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,439
CJ7?

401
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,276
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.

402
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,363
I thought I'd never see you again.

403
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,035
And you're not angry with me.

404
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,625
You two already met?

405
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,296
Is it a toy?

406
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,631
Yes, it is.

407
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,051
And it can walk and move its eyes?

408
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,554
Where did you get it?

409
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,389
Someone at school lent it to me.

410
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,977
Where's the cover?

411
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,312
Where do the batteries go?

412
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,232
It doesn't need them. It's high-tech.

413
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,152
I've never seen
anything like it before.

414
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,534
Did you see that?

415
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:19,743
Yes, I did.

416
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,870
It's all bendy.

417
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,748
Don't! I have to give it back soon.

418
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,166
It's fine.

419
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,877
-What are you doing, Dad?
-Nothing!

420
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,185
See, I told you it'd be fine.
It gets its shape back. Look!

421
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,729
This is fun.

422
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,190
No more squeezing it!
That's enough!

423
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,027
Everything is high-tech nowadays.

424
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:57,781
Basically there's no future
for uneducated people like us.

425
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,203
Dad, I don't want
to lie to you, so...

426
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,540
...CJ7 came out of the ball
you gave me.

427
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,043
It came from outer space.

428
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,713
How many times
do I have to tell you?

429
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,717
We might be poor, but we don't lie...

430
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,636
...we don't fight...

431
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,056
...and we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

432
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:26,477
Study hard and be a useful person
in the future.

433
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,949
It's so hot.

434
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,275
Well, I'll be.... The hottest night
and it starts to work. Lucky, or what?

435
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,486
I'm off to school now.

436
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,613
-Have you got your lunch box?
-Yes, I have.

437
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,199
Hey. How was the exam?

438
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,582
How come your head's gone red?

439
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,959
You don't look so good today.

440
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,629
Didn't you sleep last night?

441
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,635
Get inside and go to sleep.

442
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,429
You! Stop!

443
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,389
What's that thing inside your bag?

444
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,891
Nothing.

445
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,268
I need to check your schoolbag!

446
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,230
What for?

447
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,607
I don't have to tell you that.

448
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,280
Let go!

449
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,330
What's that?

450
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,166
Let me see.

451
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,252
Give it to me! Let me see first!

452
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,588
Give it to me! Don't pull!

453
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,593
Get it!

454
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,114
What is this weird thing?

455
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,283
Don't touch it!
Give it back to me!

456
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,909
Get the tool box!

457
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,706
Open it up and look inside.

458
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:16,957
Here.

459
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,794
Let him go!

460
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,921
Can't do it.

461
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,590
Try this.

462
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,720
No! Don't do that!

463
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,221
It's not working.

464
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,806
How is that possible?

465
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,614
You won't do that to my thing!

466
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,157
So what? Going to hit me?

467
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,659
You won't know what's hit you!

468
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,171
Let him go!

469
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,014
You let him go.

470
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,974
You let me go first.

471
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,480
I don't want a fight.

472
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,752
Don't force me to do this!

473
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,696
Are you okay?

474
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,282
I'm fine. Thank you.

475
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,908
You're welcome.

476
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,534
What's going on here?

477
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,290
Why were you fighting? Tell me!

478
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,461
You're going to stand here
until you tell me!

479
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,842
CJ7!

480
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,056
I knew you'd be okay!

481
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,766
Stop. Don't.

482
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:21,933
Good boy.

483
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,436
What is that thing?

484
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,438
Look! CJ7, sit!

485
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,067
That's cool.

486
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,985
What else does it do?

487
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,570
CJ7, happy face!

488
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,781
Angry face!

489
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,699
Sad face!

490
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,787
Saw a pretty lady!

491
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,082
Your apartment's on fire.

492
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,376
But you just won the lottery!

493
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,296
Oops! The whole family is dead.

494
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,841
You've got 100 on the exam!

495
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,346
Wicked.

496
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,555
Look!

497
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,356
Wow, fireworks!

498
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,692
Where did you get it?

499
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,528
I want one too.

500
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,029
I can't tell you that.

501
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,366
But I want to thank you
for not telling Mr. Cao about this.

502
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,575
Of course not!

503
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:23,203
We don't discuss
our business with adults.

504
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,704
-You have my word!
-You have my word!

505
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,752
Hey, you're amazing.
Do you want to be on our judo team?

506
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,879
They'd all make fun of me.

507
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,756
They wouldn't dare.

508
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,716
Would you make fun of her?

509
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,614
Look at this.
My son got 100 on his exam.

510
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,907
That's a great kid!

511
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,284
Yes!

512
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,288
-Look!
-Get away!

513
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,248
He got 100.

514
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,795
Boss.
My kid got 100 on his exam.

515
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,047
So he cheated.

516
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,303
What makes you say that?

517
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,431
My son's really smart, but even
he can't pass without cheating.

518
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:27,434
So how can your son get 100?
Hard to believe, dickhead.

519
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,477
You're not serious.

520
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:36,443
Look at the ink. He got zero
and changed it to 100. He's a liar.

521
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,281
But he's not like that.
I know him better.

522
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,741
Your son cheated.

523
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,826
-I can't let you say that.
-He cheated!

524
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,786
I'll hit you if you say that again.

525
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,914
Your son cheated.

526
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,625
You hit me? Just you try!

527
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,639
Your son cheated!
You hit me?

528
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,766
You're fired!

529
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,684
Your son cheated!

530
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,834
Quick!

531
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,503
Get inside.

532
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,677
Tell the truth.
Did you cheat on your exam?

533
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,011
No, I didn't.

534
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:49,391
I think you got zero,
then altered it to 100. Is that right?

535
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,144
Yes.

536
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,357
But that's not the same as cheating.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

537
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,025
What's wrong with you?

538
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,195
It's so tough
to send you to that school.

539
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,864
I'm sorry, Dad.

540
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,867
I'll say it again.
Even though we're poor--

541
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,411
Okay! I know!

542
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,706
You're so annoying.
Can you stop going on about it?

543
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,711
I changed it. So what?

544
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,940
If there's nothing else,
I'm leaving.

545
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:46,197
What are you doing?

546
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,741
Why are you taking my things?

547
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,910
If you can't work hard,
then you don't get to play.

548
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,787
-Give it back to me!
-No.

549
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,622
Why are you taking my stuff?

550
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,959
Why? Because I'm your father!
And I can!

551
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,129
You're bullying me.
I don't have a dad like you!

552
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,757
You always get zeros.
I don't have a son like you.

553
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,633
Leave me alone!

554
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,093
Say it again!

555
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,596
Leave me alone forever!

556
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,139
Okay!

557
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,643
If you can use your own brains
to get over 60...

558
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,562
...then I'll leave you alone forever!

559
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,272
-It's a deal!
-It's a deal!

560
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,233
I'm going to get that grade.
Just watch me!

561
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,653
We'll see about that, Zero Hero!

562
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,115
That's not fair! I'll show you!

563
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,743
Don't bother me anymore!

564
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,124
What are you looking at?

565
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,137
-Mr. Chow.
-Miss Yuen.

566
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,473
-Is something wrong? Please come in.
-I won't, thanks.

567
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,768
But Dicky forgot his lunch box today.
Could you see that he gets it?

568
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,145
Sure. Let me ask someone
to open the gate.

569
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:03,358
No, please don't. If his classmates
see me, he'll never live it down.

570
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,526
How come?

571
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,319
-I have to go.
-Wait.

572
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,156
Dicky told me everything.

573
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,450
He was just being temperamental.

574
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,787
If you'd allow it, he could
come to my house after school.

575
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,831
We can talk about what happened.

576
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,042
And there's another exam tomorrow,
so I can help him to review.

577
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,460
What do you think?

578
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,087
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

579
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,257
-You're welcome. It's nothing at all.
-I appreciate this so much.

580
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,218
-It's just a small thing. Nothing, really.
-It's not nothing.

581
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:31,553
The thing is....

582
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,390
I can't give him very much myself,
and that makes me feel very guilty.

583
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:39,727
But if you were to help him study,
I could never repay you.

584
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,022
You really don't have to.
It's the least I can do.

585
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,692
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

586
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,902
Sure. You just leave Dicky to me.

587
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:50,864
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

588
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,901
How's the boss feeling today?

589
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,444
You dare to come back?

590
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,112
I have to. I need to eat.

591
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:56,763
I know I have a big mouth,
but I think we understand each other.

592
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,972
What?

593
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,976
I shouldn't have said that
about your son. Let's forget it. Here.

594
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,562
Well....

595
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,315
-But he really did cheat.
-Who doesn't, sometimes?

596
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:10,109
The kid is very smart.
I know he'll be successful.

597
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,487
I pray to God that you're right.

598
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,614
So take it and buy him some candy.

599
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,115
Hey! This is far too much.

600
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,786
Use it for books, then. Or school fees.
But now get back to work.

601
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,835
Today must be my lucky day.

602
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,094
I thought you'd never pass.

603
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:03,723
Good.

604
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,558
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

605
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,435
What's happening?

606
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,562
Where's your safety belt?

607
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,805
What's going on here?

608
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,810
Help!

609
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,146
Give me your hand!

610
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:56,275
Reach out! Give me your hand!

611
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,616
Why haven't these been moved?

612
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,411
What was that? Hey! Be careful!

613
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,341
I'm so sorry.

614
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,095
Dicky, you have to come with me.

615
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,715
Is this your house, Dicky?

616
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,680
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat?

617
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:05,738
Dicky, I'm going
to tell you something.

618
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:18,251
There was a terrible accident,
and your dad passed away.

619
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,569
There are some things
we can't control. Do you understand?

620
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,281
Don't talk anymore, miss.
I want to sleep.

621
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,157
Please leave me.

622
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,786
Dicky, open the door.

623
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,162
I'm sorry.

624
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,664
Miss Yuen...

625
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,626
...I'm very tired.

626
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:06,132
I need to sleep.

627
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,136
Dicky.

628
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:15,182
My dad won't leave me alone.

629
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:21,689
He'll be home when I wake up.

630
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,318
I need to sleep now.

631
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,448
Dicky.

632
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,713
Dad.

633
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,306
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

634
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,488
Hey. What's up?

635
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:02,368
Dad, don't ever leave me.

636
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,458
I'll listen to you...

637
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,544
...I'll study hard...

638
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,962
...I won't lie...

639
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,588
...I won't fight...

640
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:18,300
...and one day
I'll be a really useful person.

641
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,178
That's good.

642
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,241
CJ7!

643
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:45,411
How are you?

644
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,793
What's that noise?

645
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,795
Yeah, what is it?

646
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:57,672
Why are you so tired, CJ7?

647
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,604
What's happened to him, Dad?

648
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,606
Maybe the batteries have run out.

649
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,691
It wouldn't look like that!

650
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,693
But it's very high-tech.

651
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,707
The new term starts soon...

652
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:39,585
...and we have a picnic
before going back.

653
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,920
Everybody's very happy.

654
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,548
Storm Dragon
doesn't fight anymore...

655
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,092
...because he's fallen in love.

656
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,062
Maggie likes me best...

657
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,448
...but my love is Fanny.

658
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,327
And she loves me very much too!

659
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,377
Johnny always takes what's mine.

660
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,713
Maybe he'll stop
when I tell the teacher about him.

661
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:30,052
Every pupil has his own true love.

662
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,221
And so has my dad.

663
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:50,406
It's just amazing. When we saw you in
the hospital you appeared to be quite--

664
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,743
Dead, yes. But now I'm right as rain.
Not even the doctors can explain it.

665
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,162
And how have you been since then?

666
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,164
Well, I do have a bit of a problem.

667
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,833
What kind of problem?

668
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,043
I'm far too handsome.

669
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,881
Very funny.

670
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,260
I mean it.

671
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,849
It's not easy to win a girl over...

672
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,184
...especially if you're not that funny.

673
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,978
But Dad won't give up.
He's my hero.

674
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:25,691
You don't think I'm handsome,
Miss Yuen? You can't be serious.

675
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,407
I'm so lucky
that I still have you, CJ7.

676
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,451
Every day, while you sleep...

677
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,287
...I close my eyes
and count to three...

678
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:42,040
...hoping when I look again,
you'll wake.

679
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,211
I want you back so much.
Where are you, CJ7?

680
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:53,010
One, two, three....
