1
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,439
MOMMY- COME HOME
GUZMÁN- WHERE ARE YOU?

2
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,679
Excuse me.

3
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,920
Darling.

4
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,799
Everything is going to be fine. All right?

5
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,439
All three heads
of the construction company are accused

6
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,239
of alleged embezzlement of public funds,

7
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,120
bribery, and criminal negligence.

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,120
Shit, poor people.

9
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,959
That's us. At least I stole to eat,
unlike these rich people.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
I meant their families.

11
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,599
But, of course,

12
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,480
you wouldn't understand that, huh?

13
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,920
Always a mean comment.

14
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,879
-Have you talked to Marina?
-No.

15
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
You should talk to her.
She must be having a terrible time.

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Poor girl.

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

18
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,439
-Don't worry, man.
-Really, don't.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
It's OK.

20
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,039
It's pre-trial detention.
We pay bail, and he's out.

21
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,919
-And how much is it?
-Three hundred thousand.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,439
-We'll pay this afternoon.
-And the trial?

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,479
It doesn't matter. They have nothing.

24
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,639
-Then why did they accuse him?
-I don't know, Ander. Shit, I don't know!

25
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,599
Some judge wanted to be on the news,
no fucking idea!

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
They have nothing against him, OK?
They have no proof.

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
That's what your dad says, Carla.

28
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,879
Come on, we come in peace, Christian.

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,319
Yeah, being called a thief
makes me feel awesome.

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
We're saying that
if it was you who took the watches,

31
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,000
we really don't care.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Return them, and we forget about it.

33
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,159
How can I forget
what I know nothing about?

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
How are you?

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,759
Not well, I'm not gonna lie to you.
Samuel, I don't want to talk now.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Christian, we only care about one watch.
The one with a red leather strap.

37
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,879
It was my grandfather's.
He died last Christmas.

38
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,400
-My father is very attached to it.
-Can you listen?

39
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,599
Yes.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,159
Sorry. Um...

41
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
-Want to talk later?
-Whenever you want.

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
If it shows up tomorrow in my desk,
we'll forget about it.

43
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Enough already. Why me?

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,000
-Am I the only one who's been there?
-You're the only one--

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,639
Who is penniless, right?

46
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,919
-And that makes me a thief!
-I didn't say that.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,960
-We all know rich people don't steal.
-Christian, when did I say that?

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,759
Carla, are you all right?

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,639
What is it?

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,439
-Your grandfather isn't dead.
-How much did you hear?

51
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,480
All of it.
Except why that watch is so important.

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,600
It's a pen drive, with documents.

53
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,680
Don't tell your brother, OK?

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,800
Papers from the business my father
and yours have.

55
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,480
If they were to fall
into the wrong hands right now...

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
-Stay calm, Carla--
-No.

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,639
DON'T GIVE THEM THE WATCH
WITH THE RED LEATHER STRAP

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
What are you doing?

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,959
Reading comments.

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,199
Babe, that's the first thing
you should stop doing. OK?

61
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,079
Hey.

62
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,439
What's up with you?

63
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,839
Does your religion not allow you
to console your friends?

64
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,199
Or maybe you can't forgive him
for sleeping with me again.

65
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,040
Really!

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,920
I don't care about what you two have.

67
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,279
My dear...
Now that you've taken the veil off,

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,680
you should consider removing
that blindfold.

69
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,000
-Guzmán and I--
-Let's see if you get it.

70
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,680
The only man
I'm interested in right now...

71
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,399
is called Dostoevsky.

72
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,480
But, of course, every time there's a man,
even if he's been dead for a century,

73
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,920
you can't help getting in the middle, huh?

74
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,439
He died in 1881. He's been dead 137 years.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
You've convinced me.

76
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,600
It's obvious
you don't give a shit about Guzmán.

77
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,439
OMAR, CAN YOU COME TO THE SCHOOL?

78
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,720
Give me a moment, man.

79
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,079
Hey! What are you doing here?

80
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,279
Are you stupid?

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,720
-Hi, by the way.
-You know who Marina's brother is?

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,839
You know what he might do if he finds out?

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,120
-I don't care, I need the money.
-Omar.

84
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,839
What for? What do you want?

85
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,879
-What do you care?
-I care about you, idiot!

86
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,360
I don't want you to...

87
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,720
To end up in jail or worse
for a pair of sneakers, or a motorbike.

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,759
I already live in a fucking jail.

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,959
This! This dough will set me free.

90
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,959
I need it to leave home.

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Do you understand now?

92
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,079
-Omar.
-Let go.

93
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,319
Omar!

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Marina.

95
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,120
I wanted to talk to you.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,199
-Sure.
-How are you?

97
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,959
Fine. Well, better.

98
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,079
I'm glad.

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
I wanted to tell you that we are here
for anything you need.

100
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
-Are you OK?
-Mm-hmm.

101
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,199
Now it's exam time,
we'll do everything we can--

102
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,279
Oh, dear!

103
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,879
-Do you have a tissue?
-No!

104
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,720
Open your locker, Marina.

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,800
-I'll have to talk to your mother.
-No. She can't deal with another problem.

106
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,040
I don't know, we've all fucked up
at some point, right?

107
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,800
It would be a shame that for one mistake,
no matter how big,

108
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,560
everything went to hell, right, Martín?

109
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's see,
Marina is an exemplary student, Azucena.

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,279
And we should consider the circumstances,
right?

111
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,879
This could stay between us.
But, it can't happen again.

112
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,600
OK, but to ensure that,
we need to nip it in the bud.

113
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Who sold it?

114
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,120
-What?
-Your dealer.

115
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,279
The one who didn't hesitate
to sell drugs to a minor at school.

116
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,879
I don't know. He never mentioned his name.

117
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,759
You have his number in your cell.
Didn't you text him to meet?

118
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Your phone.

119
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,200
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO THEM

120
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
-No.
-Marina, this is serious.

121
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,440
I only need a name.

122
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,519
Marina, give me the phone! Marina!

123
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,799
-I can't.
-Give it to me!

124
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,039
I'll give you a name,
but don't report him.

125
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,360
Give me the phone.

126
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Omar!

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,919
His name is Omar. He's Nadia's brother.

128
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,360
I think this is all getting
a bit out of control.

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,759
I can't have a student blackmailing me
whenever she pleases.

130
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,559
I can't jeopardize my job.

131
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,919
-I can't, I'm sorry.
-Of course. What a pity.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Too late. The stork is on its way!

133
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,399
Of course, you're worried about Marina.

134
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,480
Don't worry, she will not talk.

135
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,840
If she does,
let me remind you that you and I

136
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,519
are on this boat together,
and would go down... together.

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Besides, do you think I'll let her talk?

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,679
You have everything
you could wish to be happy.

139
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,320
Why get into this mess for a shitty trophy
and a scholarship you don't need?

140
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,279
I don't get you.

141
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,840
Martín, do you know why I am thin?

142
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,879
Excuse me?

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,879
Because I always see myself fat.

144
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,679
Do you know why I'm the best?
Because I'm never satisfied.

145
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,240
You should learn to be content
with what you have to be happy.

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
Are you happy earning €1,000 a month?

147
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,759
Repeating the same shit
in class every day?

148
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,120
Besides, who wants to be happy nowadays?

149
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,639
When they can be the best.

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
Right? Have a good day!

151
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,759
You couldn't wait to tell me
whatever it is at home?

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,919
No.

153
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,799
Who sold you the marijuana in your room?
Was it Omar?

154
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
No.

155
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,200
It was a girl.

156
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,919
Blonde, bleached hair. And fat.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
I mean, overweight.

158
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,600
I only saw her once.

159
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,519
Why? Is something wrong?

160
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
We caught Marina with marijuana
that this Omar sold her.

161
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,000
He's Nadia's brother.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,679
-No idea.
-Anyway, I'll have to talk to the parents.

163
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,080
I NEED IT, IT'S IMPORTANT

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,480
WHY? WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT?

165
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,399
Fuck, Nano.

166
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,039
What's going on with that watch?

167
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,639
Thank you!

168
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,240
Sorry I got you mixed up in this!

169
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,919
No problem.

170
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:04,080
It's no sweat off my dick
if those snobs think I'm a thief!

171
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,360
What matters is you're out of debt.
It's over!

172
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,279
Now you can begin to enjoy life.

173
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,240
Working 40 hours and sweating like a pig

174
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,159
for a shitty salary
that doesn't even cover rent.

175
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
To enjoying life!

176
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,679
No, Nano,
you and I are going to strike gold.

177
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,960
-Really? How?
-Yes.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
-Hello.
-Hi.

179
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,320
Christian, can you leave us alone?

180
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,360
Sure,
want me to make you a sandwich?

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,519
No, please leave.

182
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,960
-Here.
-Thanks.

183
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,399
Are you OK?

184
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
Yes, but I'm a bit dizzy. It's OK.

185
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,440
We have to figure out
how to return the watch.

186
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,799
If it's so important,
how much would they pay for it?

187
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
What?

188
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,600
If their lives depend on that watch,
how much would they pay?

189
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,759
That's blackmail.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,120
-Yes.
-Have you lost your mind?

191
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,919
No, I'm using it! This can be my chance
to escape this shit.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Or to go back to prison.

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,720
-It's going to work.
-Sure.

194
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,279
-Your plans never fail.
-So help.

195
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,120
I have the balls, you the brains.
We go 50/50.

196
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,080
We tell them if they don't pay,
we go to the press.

197
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Do you know what would happen
if those papers got published?

198
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
To those rich people?

199
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,159
-Why worry about them?
-I worry about Marina.

200
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
Me, too.

201
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,919
She's your girlfriend.
I don't want anything to happen to her.

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,080
And we aren't giving
that watch to anybody.

203
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,279
We bluff so they pay up.

204
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,440
-Marina Nunier?
-Yes.

205
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Are you a relative?

206
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,639
-Yes, I'm her boyfriend.
-Then you need to hear this.

207
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,559
The tests say you are pregnant.
About four weeks.

208
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,480
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

209
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,440
It's OK, no problem.

210
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,120
We were not together four weeks ago.
It's OK.

211
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,399
Whose is it?

212
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,320
Huh?

213
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,159
Don't worry, you can tell me.
Whose is it?

214
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,600
No, I can't, Samuel.

215
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,399
I have to get out of here.

216
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Hey.

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Shit, he's not answering. He's super mad.

218
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,480
Polo, it can't be Christian.
He wouldn't risk what he has with us

219
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,279
for watches
when he doesn't know their value.

220
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,559
OK, so now what? Do we apologize?

221
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,000
It's better if you go.

222
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,879
-He's mad at me over the photo shoot.
-And if we get him another one?

223
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,440
-This time for real, no nonsense.
-Carla, really...

224
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
Polo, we owe it to him.

225
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,360
And you owe him.

226
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,279
Now more than ever.

227
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
How are you?

228
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600
-How are you, man?
-Fine.

229
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,279
Glad to see you.

230
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,200
I came to see if there's anything
I can do for you.

231
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,759
-Do you have 300,000 bucks?
-Guzmán.

232
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,000
Please.

233
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,879
-Hi.
-Hello.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,919
We don't have the money.

235
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,200
Not for the bail,
not for the lawyers, nothing.

236
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,519
Our accounts are empty.

237
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,159
We are penniless.
Dad left us with nothing.

238
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,039
So I guess he's going to spend
the next 20 years in fucking jail.

239
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,200
-And she's so calm, I don't get it.
-That's enough.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,600
-Why don't you ask for help at a bank?
-Nobody wants to be linked to us now.

241
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,720
What about a friend with money?

242
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,600
Nobody wants to call us.
Not even Carla's father.

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,080
And he's Dad's partner. My godfather.

244
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,720
And our consultant.

245
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,399
-That's how toxic we are, Mom.
-Maybe we should call them.

246
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,360
Marina betraying your boyfriend
can't have been nice for you.

247
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,279
I hated her a lot for that.

248
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,639
Because of her...

249
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
Because of her, Omar and I...

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,559
It's about Omar.

251
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,200
I need you to say you got mixed up,

252
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,720
that it wasn't him who sold you the pot.
I need you to talk to my mother.

253
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,559
Ander, you know she won't buy it.

254
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
-I'm really sorry.
-Yes, but--

255
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,480
You don't know his father.

256
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,159
-I'm sorry.
-Marina!

257
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
What are you doing? Let me go.

258
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Do you want your mother to hear
about this morning?

259
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,639
And do you want my brother to hear
why you've come this afternoon?

260
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,240
Let go!

261
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,759
Nadia, help us. There's a lot of work.

262
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm coming. I have to study.

263
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,519
Right.

264
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,559
Don't argue.

265
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,359
I'M REALLY SORRY. I TRIED.

266
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Hello.

267
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,880
Yes, Principal.

268
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Yes, of course.

269
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,759
My husband can go tomorrow.

270
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,079
What is it about?

271
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,359
I see.

272
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,039
Better in person.

273
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,160
All right. Goodbye.

274
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,720
What is it this time?

275
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,599
-Did you skip class again?
-No.

276
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,240
-Then why do I have to go tomorrow?
-Yusef.

277
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,519
That was the principal of Nadia's school.

278
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,119
I am as surprised as you.

279
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,640
First the hijab.
Let's see what they come up with now.

280
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,559
Forgive me, son.

281
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,519
I know you are changing, maturing.

282
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,359
I also know you are going
to make me proud.

283
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,480
Aren't you?

284
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
What are you listening to?

285
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, baby, you look terrible!

286
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,480
I know.

287
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,480
Let me help you.

288
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,880
I have a great product for those dreadful
dark circles under your eyes.

289
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
-Leave it.
-Look at me.

290
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,160
You know you can count on me, right?

291
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,319
And I will not breathe a word.

292
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Really. I won't go around gossiping.
As it should be.

293
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,119
Lu, save your breath
and ask me straight up.

294
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,920
I told you about Martín
and my blackmail in confidence.

295
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,799
And friends do not betray each other.

296
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,319
We are not friends.

297
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,200
It's in your best interest to be mine.

298
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,160
Ready.

299
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,359
You look better.

300
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,480
You look prettier when you don't talk.

301
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,000
Do you think after what he's done
I will visit him in jail?

302
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,519
I don't know.

303
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,400
He deserves a chance, doesn't he?
To explain himself.

304
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,680
And he's your father.

305
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,599
He's a thief.

306
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,440
He even stole from his family,
so he doesn't deserve anything.

307
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,319
What he deserves,
that's for a judge to decide.

308
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,759
Your family should always be your support.

309
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,279
-What is it good for, if not?
-You really think I should go?

310
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,960
I think it's what he would do for you.

311
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,000
Come on, Christian.

312
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,720
It would be a photo shoot this afternoon,
same place. Polo will be with you.

313
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,599
Of course,
to make sure I don't steal any socks.

314
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,480
To make sure this time
there are no problems with the list.

315
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,839
Do you forgive us?

316
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,400
Well, let's see...

317
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,599
when I hold the magazine,

318
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,200
hot off the presses
and with my photo on it...

319
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,160
maybe.

320
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,079
-Beautiful.
-Forgive us.

321
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
-It's OK.
-All good?

322
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,799
Yeah.

323
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,319
Are you OK?

324
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,759
Yes, I think I'm going to be sick.

325
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,319
What's up with the hippie now?

326
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,440
No idea. She doesn't tell me anything now.
Our friendship lasted about five minutes.

327
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,839
What a coincidence.
Just when the watches went missing.

328
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,519
What are you saying?
Why would Marina rob us?

329
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,160
Come on, Carla.
As if her family had no criminal history.

330
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,680
You're just miffed
about the thing with Martín.

331
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,640
Dear, that only confirms
that this girl is not to be trusted.

332
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,640
If I were you, I'd keep an eye on her.

333
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,039
What can you tell me about these messages?

334
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,880
I wanted to know
if she knew about the theft.

335
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
There's no record
of your dad reporting it.

336
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,799
It wasn't such a big deal.

337
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,000
They were valued at over €100,000.

338
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,319
And judging by how insistent you were
with Marina, it seemed like a big deal.

339
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Most of all, when you asked
about the one with the red leather strap.

340
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,519
Yes, well, it's just that...

341
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,400
I wanted to help my father.

342
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,119
That watch had sentimental value to him.

343
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,240
It belonged to a friend of his
who passed not long ago.

344
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,880
-This is the girls' room!
-I'll be quick.

345
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,079
What?

346
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,079
Are you all right?

347
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,839
-Is that what you want to know?
-We weren't together.

348
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,799
It doesn't matter.

349
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,799
But please,
tell me if it's somebody I know.

350
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,960
If you don't care, why keep asking?

351
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,960
And if I don't care about the answer,
why don't you just tell me?

352
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,359
Do you really want to know?

353
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,079
Samuel, let's drop it.

354
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,400
It was a mistake. Period.

355
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,119
-At least there's a solution.
-You're getting an abortion?

356
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,200
Samuel.

357
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,799
-What?
-This is the girls' locker room.

358
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,640
Samuel, go, please.

359
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
Shit.

360
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,240
Do your parents know?

361
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,000
No, it's not really
the best moment to tell them.

362
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,480
-Can I borrow your cell phone?
-Yes, of course.

363
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,039
This is the number...

364
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
for a clinic.

365
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,400
Many Muslim girls use it.

366
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,839
They don't ask for authorization.
Even if you're a minor.

367
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,200
-But, Nadia, do you approve of me--
-No.

368
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,559
But if you are going to do it,
I'd rather a doctor helps you.

369
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,000
-An underground doctor.
-It's safe.

370
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:14,880
Believe me.

371
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,480
It worked for my sister.

372
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
She asked me to go with her.

373
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,720
I held her hand
all the way there on the bus.

374
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,720
I tried to talk her out of it.

375
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,920
But I think...

376
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,759
I only made her feel worse.

377
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,599
Feel like a murderer.

378
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,759
After that,
she never... confided in me again.

379
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,880
If you're going through with it,

380
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,759
you need someone to hold your hand.

381
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,960
Thank you, Nadia.

382
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,119
And...

383
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
And... forgive me for not saying anything
to you yesterday.

384
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,759
I was busy with the exam, and...
Marina, that's very important to me.

385
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,759
I need that scholarship.

386
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,480
Nadia... I am truly sorry.

387
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,200
That scholarship is granted,
and not to you.

388
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,319
No. How?

389
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
-Marina.
-Guzmán,

390
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,880
this is the girls' locker room,
and I'm fine.

391
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,519
I'm going to Soto del Real this afternoon.
Mom made it clear she's not going.

392
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,640
Are you?

393
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,599
OK. Tell Dad I said to go to hell.

394
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
You and Mom both.

395
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,480
If you want, I can go with you.

396
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,839
Hi, Dad.

397
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
And your mother?

398
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,839
-And your sister, how are they?
-They are thinking of you.

399
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,680
Mostly after seeing your bank accounts.

400
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,279
Guzmán.

401
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,920
We needed the cash.
We had problems with the company.

402
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,599
But we'll make it all back,
and more.

403
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,920
Do you understand?

404
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,880
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

405
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,759
Are you sure
you haven't spent it all on coke?

406
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
Shit.

407
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,880
Don't worry.

408
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,119
It's going to be all right.

409
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,759
Is it mine?

410
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,839
Is it mine?

411
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,160
Marina, wait.

412
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,559
-What do you want to do?
-I don't know.

413
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,680
What do you need me to do?

414
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,839
Maybe I need somebody to hold my hand.

415
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,599
-Will it hurt?
-No way.

416
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,079
It's going to be fine.

417
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,359
Don't say that.
I hate it when people say that.

418
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,480
-Hey, it was you who wanted to come.
-What else can I do?

419
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,880
-Give me one reason not to do it.
-I could give you plenty to do it.

420
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,839
You are too young.
You'll have time to have children.

421
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,319
And where would you--
Where would we go with a child?

422
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,119
It's the most sensible thing to do, but...

423
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,960
But what?

424
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,440
But nothing.

425
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,680
-Tell me.
-Nothing.

426
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,680
-Nano, tell me, really.
-It's nothing.

427
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,799
Nothing.

428
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
What is it, Nano?

429
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,799
-I'm leaving this shitty town.
-What does that have to do with me?

430
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,839
You and I?

431
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,680
Nano, I am a minor,
and you just got out of jail.

432
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,039
-Not to mention the HIV.
-You are undetectable, Marina.

433
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,240
The chances of the child being infected
are less than one percent.

434
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,319
I don't have a master's on this,
I googled it.

435
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,160
We could go someplace where we could
make a fresh start...

436
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,119
-where you can continue treatment.
-Where?

437
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,039
Far. The farthest the money I'll get
for that watch will take us.

438
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,839
Nano, if I were to leave with you,

439
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
it would never be
by extorting my family and their friends.

440
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,759
-Is that how you want to start a new life?
-No, I want a fresh start, with you.

441
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,640
I want to go where nobody knows us.

442
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,480
Where nobody knows about our screwups.

443
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,359
-Or what we've done to Samuel, Marina.
-I won't tell Samuel the truth.

444
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,720
-That would only hurt him more.
-If you come with me, he'll find out.

445
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,680
-Nano, this is crazy.
-I know.

446
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,039
I'm not stupid,
I know how the world works.

447
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,599
But I also know that...
this, the worst that could happen to us,

448
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,920
may be the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

449
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm not asking you to say yes now.

450
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,240
But think about it
for longer than five minutes.

451
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,559
And... if--

452
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,880
This is not a yes, OK?

453
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,200
You still have four minutes.

454
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,640
-Look at all this glamour!
-Carlos, how are you?

455
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,359
-Shall I change over here?
-Yes, right here.

456
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,759
Mary, let's start
with the color block outfit.

457
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,920
How about we celebrate
when you are done here?

458
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,680
We have a math exam tomorrow.

459
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,160
It's not like you'll pass.

460
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,759
That's also true, no arguments here.

461
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,240
-I'll let Carla know.
-OK.

462
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,000
Hi, hon. Everything's good here.

463
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,400
But we are really tired
and we have to study.

464
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,720
Better if we celebrate some other day, OK?

465
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,519
Love you, bye.

466
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,759
Are you OK?

467
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,680
Better.

468
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,279
Thanks to you.

469
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,759
It's no big deal.

470
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,079
It is, we have an exam tomorrow.

471
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,640
And you risk getting a measly nine for me.

472
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,559
Seems like you do care for me a bit, huh?

473
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,319
Don't get excited, we are just friends.

474
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,599
I know.

475
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,839
I don't...

476
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,559
I don't want to be your friend.

477
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,799
Well, you'll have to get used
to not getting everything you want.

478
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,359
That's too bad.

479
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,200
Because I've never wanted something
so much.

480
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,880
I bet I'm not the first girl
you've said that to.

481
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,319
No.

482
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
But you are the first one
with whom I mean it.

483
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,160
Yes.

484
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,039
See you in class.

485
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,400
Look.

486
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
They are great, man!

487
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,559
Amazing photos!

488
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,000
That one I don't like.

489
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,680
I overdid the intensity.
I look cross-eyed.

490
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,000
-So, shall we go out and party?
-Somewhere else?

491
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,119
We can stay here as long as we want.
And there's free beer.

492
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,160
And the marchioness?

493
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,519
She texted.

494
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,960
She can't come, has to study.

495
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,279
Come on, so do I!

496
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,880
What would you do that for?
You're going to be a supermodel.

497
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Quit joking, man. Don't mess with me.

498
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,039
Christian, I mean it.
You've taken the first step.

499
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,319
What's left is the hard part,
getting the cover.

500
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,200
And how do we get the cover?

501
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,799
We talk to the publisher.

502
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,000
-And what a coincidence, she's my mother.
-Imagine that, what a coincidence.

503
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,920
Don't worry, and listen to me.

504
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
It won't be easy, let me tell you.

505
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,880
But I think you have what it takes.

506
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
Yeah? I don't have abs,
but I can start going to the gym.

507
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,519
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

508
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:43,200
-Here's what I think.
-Damn, don't think that much, OK?

509
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,319
And see if we can get
the magazine cover.

510
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,440
-Hey!
-That's up to you.

511
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,239
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

512
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
-What?
-Son of a bitch! My dick.

513
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,159
OPEN

514
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,079
Dad?

515
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,880
Why is the store closed? It's not ten yet.

516
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,920
Hello?

517
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,960
-What's the matter?
-Did you know?

518
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,639
-Huh?
-Did you know what your brother sold?

519
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,840
Don't lie to me, Nadia! Not you!

520
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,519
We've had too many lies in this house!

521
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,599
How many things haven't you told me?
And where have you been? It's late.

522
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,679
I was with Guzmán.

523
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,239
Wasn't it enough to have him
at home the other day?

524
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,239
What did I tell you
about seeing that boy again?

525
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,000
Forbidden.

526
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,559
It's my fault.

527
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,480
It's my fault!

528
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,960
Too much freedom!

529
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,719
But it's over!

530
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
Go!

531
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,480
Nadia, I think you deserve
to know the truth.

532
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,119
Lu has done Martín a huge favor,

533
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,639
and that's why the scholarship
will go to her.

534
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,039
Can you read what you replied
that same night?

535
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,480
You have ruined my brother's life...

536
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,920
and mine.

537
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,599
Why are you still up?

538
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,719
I can't stop thinking about something.

539
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,199
Who the father of Marina's baby is.

540
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,079
And when I think of it,
only one person comes to mind.

541
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,840
You.

542
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,760
She helped you with the theft.

543
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,679
So you've been talking.

544
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,079
-Maybe even seeing each other.
-You think I'd do that to you?

545
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,599
Is that your answer?

546
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,000
No, it isn't.

547
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,360
My answer is this. Fuck you!

548
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,119
Forgive me, man. I'm losing my mind.

549
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,639
I don't know what to think anymore.

550
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,280
-And? Have you talked to your mom?
-About what?

551
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,280
Sorry, I don't speak English.
About the cover!

552
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,719
Do you know what that is?

553
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,039
-They don't give covers to just anybody.
-I'm not just anybody.

554
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,079
Right?

555
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,639
Um, look...

556
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,159
She's right that it's complicated.
I told you that.

557
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,119
What are you saying?

558
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,440
To class.

559
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,679
Christian.

560
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,679
Christian, please.

561
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,599
-I told you I'd try.
-My ass!

562
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,559
I didn't accept last night so you'd try.
Don't fuck with me, I'm not an idiot!

563
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,559
What does last night have to do
with the cover?

564
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,920
-I think there's been a misunderstanding.
-I think you are a son of a bitch.

565
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,320
You thought I offered you the cover
in exchange for sucking my dick?

566
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,559
And you accepted.

567
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,840
Well, I don't know what that makes me,
but do you know what it makes you?

568
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
What?

569
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
-A wh--
-A what?

570
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,440
-A wh--
-Son of a bitch!

571
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,880
Good morning.

572
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,199
Um...

573
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,360
I've called the agency
and canceled the adoption.

574
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
What did your wife say?

575
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,119
-She agrees. What else could she say?
-I see.

576
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:24,000
What values would we be teaching our child
if we got it by cheating?

577
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,199
What kind of parents would we have been?

578
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,039
I think we'll never know.

579
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,239
Hey.

580
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,559
Shouldn't you be studying?

581
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,960
We were at his mother's studio,
and he starts kissing me on the neck,

582
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,760
unbuttons my shirt,
takes my belt off, and grabs my dick.

583
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,559
-Really?
-Sure.

584
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,519
Omar told me.

585
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,679
Marina got caught,
and then gave him away, yes.

586
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,039
I guess to save herself.

587
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,920
-She hasn't told you either?
-Me?

588
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,599
She's driving me crazy.

589
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,159
-She's made me doubt even my brother.
-What? But why?

590
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,480
I'll tell you later.

591
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,079
-How do you feel about the exam?
-What does it matter?

592
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,400
What do you mean? And the scholarship?

593
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,280
They can't give it to me
if I don't go to this school.

594
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,960
It was hard enough to get my dad
to let me finish the school year.

595
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,679
Nadia, what happened?

596
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,519
Hello, everybody.

597
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,639
So, the day is finally here.

598
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,920
Only pens on your desks, please.

599
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,679
-Done.
-Finished?

600
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
-Sure?
-Yes.

601
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,400
Guys, keep working in silence.
Nobody move, please!

602
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,480
Marina!

603
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,639
Marina, what is it?

604
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,639
Nothing.

605
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,559
-Not nothing. What's this?
-Nothing. I don't know it.

606
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,960
Samuel, what are you doing?

607
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,920
I want to assure you
there won't be any favoritism.

608
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,400
Is it about our issue?

609
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,920
Martín, I just want to go home.

610
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,679
I want to settle this problem, OK?

611
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,039
What?

612
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
-Son of a bitch.
-Have you told him?

613
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,679
-Bastard.
-What are you doing?

614
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,400
-Calm down!
-What's happening?

615
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,519
He took advantage of his student
and got her pregnant!

616
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,639
-What?
-What?

617
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:26,079
-Martín?
-Azucena, do you think I'd do that?

618
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,760
And accepting a bribe, that you would do?

619
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,639
My office.

620
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,960
Fuck!

621
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,880
Bribe him, me? Please!

622
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,840
-How can she invent such a fantasy?
-It was you who told me.

623
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,280
Really,
she's crazier than she already was.

624
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,559
It's her word against mine.

625
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,199
-Please, with this girl's history...
-Marina's telling the truth.

626
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,480
Excuse me?

627
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
We made a deal,
but today I told Lucrecia that--

628
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,719
You're fired, Martín.

629
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,480
Don't make it any harder.
We'll send your belongings home.

630
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:12,960
Fine.

631
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,239
It's very clear that I had
nothing to do with this, right? That...

632
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,639
That I didn't do anything.

633
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,480
Denying it only insults my intelligence.

634
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,719
And earns you two months of suspension
instead of one.

635
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,079
We are in the middle of exams.

636
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,000
You will sit your exams in September.

637
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,960
-How did you do on the exam?
-Well.

638
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,639
We changed plans at the last minute.

639
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,880
I didn't want to bother you
while you studied.

640
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,000
Thanks for not telling me you were
fucking another so I'd stay focused.

641
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,119
Hey, you fucked him too, OK?

642
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,199
OK, I'm sorry.

643
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:15,679
Always with you.
That was the deal. To share everything.

644
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,719
Carla, really, it was nothing.

645
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,360
It was nothing!

646
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,880
Come, give me a hug.

647
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,239
-Carla, I didn't even like it.
-This...

648
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,039
was something we did to avoid infidelity,
lies.

649
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,119
To revive a relationship that was dead.

650
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,679
But given all this,
it's better if it remains buried.

651
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,440
-Hello.
-Hi.

652
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,039
-Let's go.
-No.

653
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:02,119
One fifty, please.

654
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,079
I need change.

655
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,880
-Why don't you answer my texts?
-I no longer have a cell.

656
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,960
-And when can we meet?
-I'll be behind this counter for 2 years.

657
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,440
-Omar.
-What are you doing?

658
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Thanks.

659
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:45,559
Omar, please.

660
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,920
Please.

661
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,880
I can't.

662
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,159
Have a good day.

663
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:57,960
Bye.

664
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,480
Do you want to know whose it is?

665
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,960
-Do you really need to know?
-No. Marina.

666
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,039
Enough.

667
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,320
I'm tired.

668
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,360
I'm tired of chasing after you.

669
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,920
-Maybe--
-Listen to me! Please.

670
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,199
I'm tired of trying all the time
to convince you about us.

671
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,119
But most of all,
I'm tired of waiting for you to find...

672
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,840
the fucking courage to break up with me!

673
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,639
Samuel.

674
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,280
How would you have reacted
if she had decided to end it with you?

675
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,079
I don't know, because that never happened.

676
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I have never seen this message.

677
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,840
She wrote it.

678
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,639
She never hit the send button.

679
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,559
Read it, please.

680
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,039
"Nano,

681
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,400
forgive me,

682
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,000
but I can't do this.

683
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,559
I can't leave, I'm sorry."

684
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,639
Why didn't she tell you in person?

685
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,639
Was she afraid you might react violently?

686
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,840
Still thinking about the blackmail idea?

687
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,159
I'm not sure.

688
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,320
What are you thinking?

689
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,440
Let's go get them.

690
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,480
