WEBVTT

00:40.583 --> 00:42.751
Come on, Gus-Gus. Faster!

00:42.835 --> 00:46.004
What's the hurry, Jaq-Jaq?
What's the hurry?

00:46.088 --> 00:47.505
Fairy Godmother's here.

00:47.590 --> 00:50.050
She's gonna read us
the Cinderelly story.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.594
Pom-Pom.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.459
Come on, Gus!

01:26.295 --> 01:31.549
"Cinderella and the Prince
lived happily ever after.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.095
"The end."

01:36.681 --> 01:37.889
We missed it?

01:39.475 --> 01:43.019
-Maybe you could read another one.
-I'm sorry, Gus,

01:43.104 --> 01:45.981
but that's the only
Cinderella book there is.

01:46.065 --> 01:50.819
Yeah, Gus-Gus. You heard her.
The end. That's all.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.446
Maybe we could make another book.

01:53.531 --> 01:56.324
-We can tell the stories.
-And make the drawings!

01:56.409 --> 01:57.701
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

01:57.785 --> 02:00.662
What an excellent idea.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.664
No, no, wait a minute.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.375
Who'd wanna read a book
made by mice?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.544
Cinderella would read it.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.548
And if you made it,
I know that she'd love it.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.800
But we don't know how to make a book.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.721
Don't worry, dear. I think I can help.

02:21.559 --> 02:25.437
Salagadoola mechicka boola
ibbbbdb-bobbbdb-boo

02:25.521 --> 02:27.731
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.357
ibbbbdb-bobbbdb-boo

02:44.874 --> 02:46.124
Now, what do we need?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.542
-A pencil, indeed.
-And crayons.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.918
-And glitter.
-And glue.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.338
We'll sew up the book
with a thread and a hook.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.173
ibbbbdb-bobbbdb-boo

02:53.799 --> 02:57.844
Very nice. Well done, little mice.
But something is missing, it's true.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.055
Look there. The pages are bare.

03:00.139 --> 03:03.600
-We need a story from you.
-Who, us?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.227
No, no, we don't know any good stories.

03:06.312 --> 03:10.815
Wait, wait!
How's about "First Day in Castle"?

03:10.900 --> 03:13.902
Oh, yeah. That is a good one.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.614
I'd love to hear all about it.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.750
It was right after
Cinderelly and the Prince married.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.669
Mice-mice moved to the big castIe.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.797
We had it all to ourselves,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.050
and we were having
the time of our lives.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.810
Cinderelly's back!

03:46.894 --> 03:49.646
-Oh, dear, they're back!
-They're back!

03:53.067 --> 03:54.442
-They're back!
-They're back!

04:02.785 --> 04:05.703
-We're back!
-Welcome home.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.623
I still can't believe
I'm going to live in a castle.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.292
Are you sure this isn't just a dream?

04:11.377 --> 04:13.211
You're a princess now.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.880
Princess Cinderella.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.260
She won't even know the first thing
about being a princess.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.346
She just got back from her honeymoon.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.349
It's going to be your duty
to prepare the girl.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.269
Your Majesty, I am honoured.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.021
Not you, ninny. Prudence!

04:32.106 --> 04:33.565
Of course not you.

04:33.649 --> 04:37.110
He wants the job done right
the first time.

04:37.194 --> 04:41.573
The royal banquet
will be Cinderella's responsibility now.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.075
The royal banquet?

04:44.160 --> 04:46.786
You'll teach her everything
she needs to know.

04:46.871 --> 04:51.958
But, sire, she won't know anything
about planning a royal banquet.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.170
I don't know anything about
planning a royal banquet.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.547
Oh, well.
At least I can stay past midnight.

04:58.174 --> 05:01.050
Perfect! And I'll be right by your side.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.761
I have to go? Now?

05:04.388 --> 05:06.973
Father, I can't just
abandon my princess!

05:07.057 --> 05:09.934
Not with the royal banquet
only two days away.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.730
Nonsense! We have important
matters of state to attend to.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.065
Important matters of state!

05:16.150 --> 05:17.984
Father...

05:18.068 --> 05:20.195
She hasn't had time to prepare.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.405
She's never been a princess before.

05:22.490 --> 05:28.036
I dare say, Majesty,
you do like your banquets just so, eh?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.955
It's a great deal to ask of the poor girl.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.457
Nonsense!

05:32.541 --> 05:37.962
Your Majesty, I can take care
of the preparations as I always do.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.548
Just show her what to do!

05:40.633 --> 05:45.053
We have a princess now.
It's her duty to plan the banquet.

05:45.137 --> 05:49.390
And the King's duty to endure it.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.143
Yes, Your Majesty.

05:52.228 --> 05:55.230
Now off we go!

05:55.731 --> 05:58.650
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry I have to rush off.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.860
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.322
I know you're gonna surprise us
with an incredible feast.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.991
I just hope you're not too surprised.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.440
Cinderelly!

06:40.776 --> 06:44.904
Jaq! Gus! Mary! Hello, old friends.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.949
Bruno!

06:49.285 --> 06:53.621
Look-look.
Big chair for Princess Cinderelly!

06:55.624 --> 06:56.916
Oh, my.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.921
Big castle, too.

07:02.006 --> 07:06.217
Don't worry, Cinderelly.
Us mice here to help.

07:06.302 --> 07:10.221
Why, thank you, Jaq. We've got
a big day ahead of us tomorrow.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.644
This way, fellas.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.585
Good morning, Your Highness.

07:43.339 --> 07:44.714
Your Highness!

07:49.470 --> 07:53.348
Ready for breakfast?
How does a cheese omelette sound?

07:54.475 --> 07:56.517
The Princess is missing!

07:58.312 --> 08:01.898
You! You, girl!
Have you seen the Princess?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.941
Good morning, Prudence.

08:04.026 --> 08:08.988
Oh, I thought you...
But those awful clothes!

08:09.073 --> 08:13.242
Well, I didn't recognise you,
Your Highness.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.995
Allow me to introduce
your ladies-in-waiting.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.332
-Beatrice and Daphne.
-Pleased to meet you.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.417
You're just in time for breakfast.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.962
Breakfast? With toast and jam?

08:26.840 --> 08:31.260
Your Highness, a princess
never prepares her own meals.

08:31.345 --> 08:35.139
That is not how things are done.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.350
There are rules about breakfast?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.812
Of course there are rules,
Your Highness.

08:40.895 --> 08:45.358
But it's not your fault that you
don't know the traditions of the castle.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.237
That's what the King
expects me to teach you.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.906
I'm sure I can learn it in no time.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.659
Come along.
There's no time to dally.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.912
Just do as I say,
and everything will be fine.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.335
The King would be horrified

09:04.420 --> 09:09.590
to find the hostess of the royal banquet
dressed like a scullery maid!

09:09.675 --> 09:13.136
A princess must be attired like royalty.

09:14.430 --> 09:17.181
Do I have to wear this all the time?

09:17.266 --> 09:19.434
Oh, of course not, Your Highness.

09:19.518 --> 09:22.103
You'll need something
much more formal for dinner.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.940
Couldn't I just wear
one of my own dresses?

09:27.651 --> 09:32.113
Very amusing, Your Highness,
but it simply isn't done.

09:43.959 --> 09:47.920
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we open the curtains?

09:48.005 --> 09:51.507
No, no, no!
These curtains are never opened.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.970
And certainly not by a princess.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.307
It most definitely isn't done.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.271
Dukes and viscounts
sit nearest the King

10:05.355 --> 10:07.482
unless there is a marquis present.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.568
Wouldn't it be nice
if people could sit where they like?

10:10.652 --> 10:16.491
No. You must never seat a duke
above a marquis or below a baron.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.577
Which colour is correct, Your Highness?

10:19.661 --> 10:21.954
Cream or ecru?

10:22.873 --> 10:24.248
Ecru?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.626
Goodness, no. Cream.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.711
But there isn't any difference.

10:28.796 --> 10:32.799
Oh, my. So much to learn. So little time.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.762
At the banquet, as always,

10:37.846 --> 10:41.224
the royal menu shall consist
of the rarest roast beef,

10:41.308 --> 10:45.186
French onion soup, tarragon mashed
potatoes, freshly baked baguettes,

10:45.270 --> 10:49.357
the finest truffles in the kingdom
and, for dessert,

10:50.025 --> 10:52.568
Norwegian stewed prunes.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.239
Prunes? For dessert?

10:56.323 --> 11:00.284
The King expects it.
It is a tradition that is never broken.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.371
Besides, I like them.

11:07.543 --> 11:11.587
Your Highness shall pause here
to greet her noble guests.

11:11.672 --> 11:15.800
Remember.
Curtsy to royalty, wave to nobility.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.594
I know I can do this right.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.389
-Cinderella!
-Cinderella! Hi!

11:21.473 --> 11:24.642
My friends! Hello! Hello!

11:24.726 --> 11:28.563
How nice to see you. Wait just a minute.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.482
-Open the gate!
-No, no, no!

11:31.567 --> 11:34.694
These gates are only opened
for royal visitors.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.407
You must remember the rules.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.244
Commoners are never allowed
in the palace.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.121
It simply isn't done.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.584
Bye-bye!

12:15.569 --> 12:18.779
At the very least,
one must learn to dance

12:18.864 --> 12:21.073
with poise and grace.

12:21.158 --> 12:25.536
I'm trying, I just need more practise.

12:27.122 --> 12:31.876
It must be perfect.
It is the King's favourite dance.

12:38.467 --> 12:43.346
No, no, no, Your Highness.
It must be slower and more formal.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.015
Your Highness, eggshell or bone?

12:46.099 --> 12:47.725
-Eggshell?
-Bone.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.394
Now, who sits next to the count?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.772
-The duke?
-The marquis.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.607
-Gold or silver?
-For what?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.151
-Baron or viscount?
-Who?

12:57.235 --> 12:59.779
-Pekoe or Darjeeling?
-I don't know!

12:59.863 --> 13:01.572
Braised or broiled?

13:01.657 --> 13:03.574
-Fish or fowl?
-Stand or sit?

13:03.659 --> 13:05.743
-Mind the music!
-Hair up or down?

13:05.827 --> 13:07.328
-Left or right?
-One or two?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.372
-Watch the chair!
-Your Highness!

13:17.381 --> 13:22.176
Your Highness, the dance
is best performed on one's feet.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.198
This is a disaster.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.510
Poor Cinderelly. Please don't cry.

14:04.594 --> 14:08.889
Cinderelly not happy,
mice-mice not happy.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.184
Jaq, what am I going to do?

14:12.269 --> 14:15.396
I'm a complete failure as a princess.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.236
Why can't I learn to do this right?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.450
Look at me.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.702
Cinderelly not look like Cinderelly.

14:29.786 --> 14:34.373
It's true. Something's just not right here.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.585
Like stewed prunes?

14:37.669 --> 14:42.173
Exactly, Gus. And why do they
have to keep the palace so dark?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.341
And that awful dance.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.303
And those boring colours
that all look the same.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.763
And stewed prunes!

14:48.847 --> 14:52.600
Especially those rules about
keeping commoners out of the palace!

14:52.684 --> 14:55.352
Why, I was a dish maid
when the Prince married me.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.606
And he loves me because I'm me.

14:58.690 --> 15:03.027
I've been trying to obey someone else's
rules about who I should be

15:03.111 --> 15:05.029
and how I should dress.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.825
This hair!

15:12.204 --> 15:16.123
I know I can do this. I just have to
stop trying to be someone else.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.542
What'll she do, Jaq-Jaq?

15:18.627 --> 15:22.922
Gus, I'm going to plan
this banquet my way.

15:23.715 --> 15:27.968
Who's to say the ruIes
must stay the same forevermore?

15:28.053 --> 15:30.221
Open the gates!

15:30.305 --> 15:36.936
Whoever made them had to change
the rules that came before

15:37.020 --> 15:39.230
So make your own way

15:39.314 --> 15:42.274
Show the beauty within

15:42.359 --> 15:48.322
When you foIIow your heart
there's no heart you can't win

15:49.491 --> 15:51.826
Why, thank you!

15:54.496 --> 15:57.289
Your Highness,
the King would not approve.

15:57.374 --> 16:01.127
You're supposed to be inviting dukes
and counts and other aristocrats.

16:01.211 --> 16:05.506
I am inviting them, along with
all my friends here in the village.

16:06.049 --> 16:10.427
Your Highness,
I strongly advise against it.

16:10.512 --> 16:14.473
It's simply not the way things are done.

16:15.392 --> 16:19.228
Perhaps the time has come
to try something new.

16:19.312 --> 16:23.732
So reach for the sky
it's not high as it seems

16:23.817 --> 16:30.072
Just foIIow your heart
go as far as your dreams

16:30.157 --> 16:34.201
This party needs help,
starting with dessert.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.495
No prunes. Yuck!

16:37.247 --> 16:39.957
Jaq-Jaq love chocolate.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.718
Chocolate pudding!
Now that sounds good.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.147
We never get to dance like this.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.904
Dance if you want to
don't fear you'II faII

17:14.075 --> 17:20.915
Take a chance, 'cause it's better
than never to chance it at all

17:21.750 --> 17:26.628
It simply isn't done. It simply isn't done!

17:28.590 --> 17:31.675
It simply isn't done!

17:31.760 --> 17:37.264
It simply isn't done,
it simply isn't done, it simply isn't done.

17:39.935 --> 17:43.979
There's a world fuII of changing
and you've just begun

17:44.105 --> 17:47.650
Don't Iet them teII you
it's simpIy not done

17:47.734 --> 17:54.657
When you foIIow your heart
you'II shine bright as the sun

17:56.868 --> 18:01.413
-Your Highness, sand or buff?
-Which colour do you like?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.624
Pink!

18:04.626 --> 18:05.918
Perfect.

18:07.879 --> 18:11.048
Something's still missing.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.428
Now, that's more like it.

18:18.974 --> 18:22.518
-What will the King say?
-I know this is a big change.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.561
But I have to try this my way.

18:25.313 --> 18:30.609
Well, then, I certainly hope
you know what you're doing.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.495
They're here, Cinderelly! They're here!

18:45.417 --> 18:48.168
Well, it's too late to turn back now.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.772
Now, this dance is more like it.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.533
This dance is horrifying!

19:44.976 --> 19:47.561
The King has arrived.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.070
Pudding!

20:00.742 --> 20:03.660
What in blazes is going on here?

20:03.745 --> 20:05.204
Your Majesty!

20:07.332 --> 20:11.543
-Who opened those curtains?
-This is all Princess Cinderella's doing!

20:12.420 --> 20:14.880
What a lovely moon.

20:14.964 --> 20:19.343
-I tried to teach her, sire.
-Commoners in the palace?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.804
She simply refused to listen.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.557
-Oh, hello, Giuseppe!
-It's a scandal!

20:25.642 --> 20:28.352
Your Majesty, I can explain.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.479
What is this?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.481
Your dessert, sire.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.984
No prunes for dessert?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.362
An absolute outrage!

20:40.615 --> 20:42.866
Chocolate. My favourite!

20:46.955 --> 20:51.041
What happened to the music?
Everybody dance!

21:07.809 --> 21:11.019
I always said we needed
some new traditions around here.

21:11.980 --> 21:15.149
Go on, now, Prudence.
You're missing all the fun.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.744
-Did I miss something?
-Surprise!

21:29.622 --> 21:31.915
Splendid job. Splendid!

21:32.000 --> 21:36.170
It is the Princess
who deserves your praise, sire.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.216
And I am honoured to be
at Her Highness's service.

21:41.301 --> 21:44.178
I think we're going to be great friends.

22:03.323 --> 22:06.450
I told my son he had chosen well.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.911
You're a natural.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.331
Hooray! Hooray!

22:12.415 --> 22:14.124
Another dance!

22:15.084 --> 22:17.461
I'm glad you do things your own way.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.130
Someday I'll get
this princess thing right.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.257
I think that day is today.

22:31.226 --> 22:35.979
Well, Cinderella certainly
turned things around, didn't she?

22:36.064 --> 22:38.148
Yeah, no more big hair.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.900
Or prunes.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.077
Can't get it.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.205
Let me help with that.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.044
Watch it. I don't like that magic stuff.

22:59.128 --> 23:04.383
-Remember what happened last time.
-Oh, now there's a story we should tell.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.718
Yeah, that's a good one!

23:08.721 --> 23:12.182
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Very, very boring story.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.518
We don't want to hear that one.

23:14.602 --> 23:18.689
-But, Jaq, it's my favourite.
-Okay, let's hear it.

23:18.773 --> 23:22.693
Well, it certainly was
an unusual wish, Jaq, dear.

23:22.777 --> 23:27.364
iut things didn't turn out
quite the way you had pIanned.

23:27.448 --> 23:30.867
What are we doing
in the garden, Jaq-Jaq?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.161
Gus-Gus not had breakfast yet.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.374
Gus-Gus, we're going to pick flowers
for Cinderelly.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.875
What for?

23:38.960 --> 23:41.378
We never get to do anything
for Cinderelly now.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.505
Sure we do.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.342
-Like what?
-Well, let's see.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.927
See?

23:50.179 --> 23:54.891
Cinderelly don't need mice-mice.
She got lots of people to help her.

23:54.976 --> 23:58.145
Well, I want to bring her
a big bunch of flowers.

24:21.836 --> 24:25.380
-That's enough!
-You've got to think big, Gus-Gus.

24:27.508 --> 24:28.842
Pom-Pom!

24:53.451 --> 24:56.453
-Your flowers, Highness.
-Well, thank you.

24:56.537 --> 25:00.374
Oh, these are even prettier
than yesterday's.

25:00.875 --> 25:05.212
Here's the list of remaining preparations
for the festival tomorrow.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.050
We sure throw a lot of parties
around here, don't we?

25:10.134 --> 25:12.469
This is no mere party, Highness.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.097
This is the Spring Festival!

25:21.229 --> 25:24.481
Oh, good morning, fellas.
What do you have there?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.110
For you. But they're too small.

25:30.738 --> 25:34.991
They're beautiful!
How very sweet. Thank you.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.619
Your Highness, the festival committee

25:37.704 --> 25:39.287
is assembled in the library

25:39.372 --> 25:41.873
awaiting your instructions.

25:41.958 --> 25:45.877
And the bath is in the pantry
awaiting you.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.754
I'll see you later, boys.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.590
Good morning, Jaq.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.969
Hello, Mary. Pretty coat!

25:54.762 --> 25:56.430
I made it for you.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.726
Want to try it on?

26:00.810 --> 26:03.103
Oh, very nice.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.814
Cinderelly forgot party list!

26:07.775 --> 26:10.444
Jaq can help. Take list to Cinderelly!

26:18.619 --> 26:22.247
I got it! No problem.

26:23.291 --> 26:24.583
I'll be right back.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.007
The Prince and I will
cut the ribbon to begin the festival.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.592
Any other suggestions?

26:33.676 --> 26:38.096
I propose we move
the Spring Festival to summer.

26:38.181 --> 26:42.225
Genius!
I wish I had thought of it myself.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.729
It wouldn't be
a Spring Festival any more.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.147
Yes, yes, quite so.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.941
Of course not,
I dare say, Your Highness.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.067
Yummy.

26:51.152 --> 26:54.237
Perhaps we should
not invite the children.

26:54.322 --> 26:59.075
-Can't open.
-No children. A brilliant idea.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.203
The festival is for children.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.789
An even more brilliant rebuttal!

27:03.873 --> 27:08.752
Oh, I suppose.
But the lines are so long.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.755
No problem.
We'll add more rides.

27:16.677 --> 27:21.389
Help! I can't stand mice!
Oh, no! Disgusting!

27:33.069 --> 27:35.111
Jaq, are you all right?

27:35.196 --> 27:39.324
No help to Cinderelly.
Just make a big mess.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.285
I'm sorry, Jaq. Tell you what.

27:42.370 --> 27:45.789
I'm about to go out to the fairgrounds.
Why don't you come?

27:45.873 --> 27:49.668
-I could really use your help.
-Help? Zug-zug!

27:49.752 --> 27:52.462
Meet me at the stables in ten minutes.

27:52.547 --> 27:53.880
No problem.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.717
Here we are. There, Charger.

28:13.234 --> 28:17.237
Wow. Not sure Cinderelly
can find me down here.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.586
Jaq?

28:34.088 --> 28:36.923
-Jaq?
-Hey, Cind...

28:40.511 --> 28:41.553
Jaq?

28:41.637 --> 28:44.639
Your Highness,
your escort is waiting outside.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.933
Thank you. Jaq?

28:47.310 --> 28:48.518
Cinderelly!

28:49.437 --> 28:51.938
Oh, well. I guess he couldn't come.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.274
Oh, no!

28:56.611 --> 28:58.778
Cinderelly, wait!

29:10.499 --> 29:12.125
Cinderelly!

29:14.795 --> 29:17.005
Hey!

29:17.632 --> 29:19.132
Hey.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.391
Cinderelly?

29:30.937 --> 29:35.065
I never get to do anything any more.
I never get to help.

29:35.149 --> 29:38.109
Get left behind sitting in the dirt.
Used to help a lot.

29:38.194 --> 29:41.613
Now I'm too small to do this,
too small to do that,

29:41.697 --> 29:43.657
too small to help Cinderelly.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.325
No good to anybody!

29:46.327 --> 29:47.577
Castle not like old house.

29:47.662 --> 29:50.455
Castle for big people.
No place for mice!

29:50.539 --> 29:53.500
Everything's bigger than me.
Even flowers bigger!

29:54.168 --> 29:57.003
Don't like being small.
Don't like being a mouse.

29:57.088 --> 29:58.463
I wish I was big!

30:12.520 --> 30:14.145
There, there, dear.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.065
Tell me all...

30:17.149 --> 30:19.150
Jaq? Jaq?

30:21.946 --> 30:24.572
Oh, there you are, dear.

30:25.533 --> 30:29.911
I heard your wish, Jaq.
Aren't you happy the way you are?

30:29.996 --> 30:33.039
Only big people help Cinderelly.
I want to be big!

30:33.124 --> 30:35.792
No, I want to be human.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.128
Human? Oh, good heavens!

30:38.212 --> 30:43.550
But, Jaq, you've always helped
Cinderella just the way you are.

30:43.634 --> 30:47.345
Cinderelly's a princess now.
No time for mice.

30:47.430 --> 30:49.097
Nobody likes mice anyway.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.182
So that's what you think.

30:51.892 --> 30:56.604
I get beat up by cat and horse
and big, scary lady!

30:58.691 --> 31:01.401
Humans are bigger. Bigger better.

31:02.069 --> 31:05.071
If you really feel that way

31:06.532 --> 31:10.910
perhaps it would be for the best
to grant your wish.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.582
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

31:27.261 --> 31:30.972
The sun's up shining, siIver Iining

31:31.057 --> 31:33.183
It's gonna be a beautifuI day

31:33.267 --> 31:36.811
Jaq. The human Jaq. How do you do?

31:36.896 --> 31:40.648
Church bells ringing, birds all singing

31:40.733 --> 31:43.443
Everything's going my way

31:43.527 --> 31:46.529
Zug-zug. I really am human.

31:48.449 --> 31:52.035
Climb the trees, smell the breeze

31:52.119 --> 31:55.789
Laugh with aII your might

31:55.873 --> 32:01.461
iIue skies showing
everything's going right

32:03.631 --> 32:06.966
You'II never stop the raining
by sitting and compIaining

32:07.051 --> 32:11.054
It aII comes down to you

32:11.138 --> 32:14.724
You'II smiIe again, it happens when

32:14.809 --> 32:17.227
You change your point of view

32:17.311 --> 32:21.231
I love the view from up here!

32:21.315 --> 32:24.234
When you're smaII, one-inch taII

32:24.318 --> 32:27.904
And then you're 6'2"

32:27.988 --> 32:33.451
You've hit the big time now
and the world is Iooking up to you

32:33.536 --> 32:35.995
There she is. What am I going to say?

32:37.540 --> 32:40.166
Princess Cinderelly, it's me, Jaq!

32:40.251 --> 32:43.628
Look, I'm human now.
I'm human now, too!

32:43.712 --> 32:47.382
When you're smaII, one-inch taII

32:47.466 --> 32:50.760
And then you're 6'2"

32:50.845 --> 32:52.637
You've hit the big time now

32:52.721 --> 32:54.013
Cinderelly! It's me!

32:54.098 --> 32:56.266
The world is Iooking up to you

32:56.350 --> 32:57.892
Yeah, you

32:57.977 --> 33:00.061
-My dear sir.
-Oh, you poor man!

33:00.146 --> 33:01.938
-Sir...
-I'm...

33:02.022 --> 33:03.857
Sir Hugh, is it?

33:03.941 --> 33:08.278
-Well, then. Pleased to know you.
-I knows to please you, too!

33:08.362 --> 33:10.989
-Are you all right, Sir Hugh?
-Yes, yes, I...

33:11.073 --> 33:14.701
-Hugh, eh? Would that be Belgian?
-What? Eh, no, no.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.870
No, no, no, of course not. No accent.

33:16.954 --> 33:20.790
I'm so sorry about the mess.
Here, let me help you.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.127
No, no, that's why I'm here.
To help you. I'm...

33:24.211 --> 33:26.254
The committee sent you!

33:26.338 --> 33:28.965
You're here to help
with the Spring Festival?

33:29.049 --> 33:31.968
-You're Dutch!
-No. I mean yes. But I'm...

33:33.470 --> 33:37.390
Late! Your Highness, it is late.
We're expected back at the palace.

33:37.474 --> 33:42.145
-Shall we ride back together?
-Ride? On horses?

33:43.314 --> 33:45.565
-Nice horsie!
-Sir Hugh?

33:47.401 --> 33:48.985
Have you ridden before?

33:51.572 --> 33:55.783
Sir Hugh? Sir Hugh? There you are.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.830
Peach blossoms.

34:00.915 --> 34:03.750
Aren't you sweet?
They're beautiful. Thank you.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.963
Highness, there you are.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.841
The tailor is in a dither.
The cook is having a crisis.

34:11.926 --> 34:15.678
The animal trainer is flummoxed!
And they're all asking for you.

34:15.763 --> 34:19.766
Could you please find a vase for these?
I'll be right back.

34:19.850 --> 34:22.351
Thank you, Sir Hugh. You're a big help.

34:26.774 --> 34:30.109
Perfect.
Helping Cinderelly with flowers.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.085
Pom-Pom!

34:54.134 --> 34:55.969
I shouldn't be afraid of cat!

34:58.931 --> 35:01.599
I am human now. Bigger than cat.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.560
But I am still afraid of cat!

35:11.694 --> 35:13.695
Oh, good. You found a vase.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.574
Happy to help. What I want to...

35:18.659 --> 35:21.869
The Countess Legrande
is awaiting you in the dining hall.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.955
Think you could keep
her company till I get there?

35:30.796 --> 35:32.005
A mouse!

35:35.259 --> 35:37.760
What am I doing? I'm a man now.

35:37.845 --> 35:41.723
-A big, fat mouse!
-Oh, no. Gus-Gus!

35:43.183 --> 35:44.434
Get away!

35:54.028 --> 35:57.572
My hero. Oh, you saved me.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.534
Well, I think we just found the couple
to lead the first dance.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.291
We better go get ready.
I'll send a valet for you, Sir Hugh.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.335
See you at the festival.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.808
Hey, Mary, where's Jaq-Jaq?

36:25.893 --> 36:29.896
I don't know, Gus.
I'm worried about him.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.064
Here I am.

36:33.275 --> 36:34.817
Wait!

36:37.321 --> 36:39.572
It's me.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.867
Jaq, is everything all right, dear?

36:42.951 --> 36:46.037
Yes. Great. No problem.

36:46.747 --> 36:50.500
Well, I think you gave your friends
a bit of a fright.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.339
They ran away from me. Even Mary.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.759
Now surely you don't miss
being a mouse.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.512
No, I guess not.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.931
Aren't you happy being human?

37:05.015 --> 37:08.726
Yeah. Sure not as easy as I thought.

37:11.814 --> 37:13.940
But I know I'll get it.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.195
Cinderella is asking for you.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.739
The evening's festivities are upon us.

37:24.952 --> 37:28.287
-Zug-zug!
-Jaq?

37:28.372 --> 37:32.917
Zug-zug, eh? I don't believe
I'm familiar with that expression.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.129
It means... It's French.

37:36.213 --> 37:39.841
French, is it?
Well, that explains everything.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.724
Ladies and gentlemen,
let the Spring Festival begin.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.482
-I'll race you to the Ferris wheel!
-Look there.

38:02.823 --> 38:04.991
Hi, kids!

38:09.246 --> 38:13.124
An elephant! Come on!
I just love elephants!

38:13.208 --> 38:15.877
-Your Majesty...
-Let's go!

38:16.795 --> 38:19.297
Around the world!

38:19.381 --> 38:24.260
Up and down. Up and down.
Around like a Ferris wheel.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.013
Are you sure Jaq-Jaq's here, Mary?

38:27.097 --> 38:29.765
He must be, Gus. Let's find him.

38:32.895 --> 38:35.438
Sir Hugh, are you enjoying yourself?

38:35.522 --> 38:38.608
Well, there's something...

38:38.692 --> 38:42.612
You're not whispering
about me, are you?

38:42.696 --> 38:45.406
I believe I promised you two
the first dance.

38:52.331 --> 38:55.750
What a lovely dancer. Oh, my!

39:08.222 --> 39:09.472
Sir Hugh!

39:09.556 --> 39:11.682
Is that your kitty?

39:12.809 --> 39:14.852
Isn't she precious?

39:20.317 --> 39:22.401
Ready for the next dance?

39:50.597 --> 39:51.764
Nice kitty.

40:06.989 --> 40:09.031
I hate elephants!

40:16.582 --> 40:20.418
This is all my fault!
Wish Fairy Godmother was here.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.048
Jaq, this is your chance to help.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.717
What can I do?

40:28.468 --> 40:32.597
An elephant.
What do you think could stop him?

40:33.181 --> 40:35.558
-Stop in the name of the King!
-Don't know.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.185
Perhaps a mouse?

40:39.813 --> 40:42.898
Aren't all elephants afraid of mice?

40:44.651 --> 40:47.778
Are you a man or a mouse?

40:52.534 --> 40:54.994
I'm a mouse!

41:01.501 --> 41:02.585
Oh, dear, now!

41:04.588 --> 41:06.255
How does it go again?

41:10.010 --> 41:11.552
Oh, yes!

41:12.095 --> 41:14.221
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

41:18.018 --> 41:19.310
Help!

41:23.398 --> 41:26.484
I can see my castle!

41:34.076 --> 41:37.328
I guess there are some things
only a mouse can do.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.330
I'm a mouse!

41:41.750 --> 41:43.209
Yes! I'm a mouse!

41:44.920 --> 41:47.088
I'm a mouse! I'm so glad I'm a mouse!

41:47.172 --> 41:50.675
I'm a mouse! Jaq is back!
I'm a mouse! A mouse!

41:50.759 --> 41:53.511
M-O-U-S-E. I'm a mousie mousie!

41:53.595 --> 41:57.181
Sir Hugh's kitty!

41:58.392 --> 42:02.645
Come, sweetums.
Let's go find your master.

42:02.729 --> 42:06.857
Aren't you just the sweetest,
little, most precious baby?

42:10.070 --> 42:12.822
Jaq, that was so brave!

42:12.906 --> 42:15.408
Mary, I really missed you.

42:15.492 --> 42:17.493
You're a hero!

42:17.577 --> 42:21.747
Jaq, you saved the day!
I can always count on you.

42:21.832 --> 42:24.166
-You're right there when I need you.
-I am?

42:24.251 --> 42:26.252
Yes, you are.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.214
I'm so glad you're back!

42:33.593 --> 42:34.927
Me, too!

42:56.616 --> 43:00.119
-Thank goodness that's over.
-Yeah.

43:00.203 --> 43:03.080
No more magic for Jaq-Jaq!

43:03.165 --> 43:05.541
-Not even a little?
-Whoa!

43:13.967 --> 43:16.635
Hey, magic make this go a lot faster!

43:23.435 --> 43:25.102
Let's go to work.

43:42.579 --> 43:45.164
-Good gracious!
-Oh, no!

43:46.208 --> 43:48.751
-I'm trying to sew.
-I'm splattered!

43:48.835 --> 43:51.420
-How awful!
-It's tragic!

43:51.505 --> 43:54.089
-I feel a bit pale.
-Watch out! That's my tail!

43:54.174 --> 43:56.509
I think we've had quite enough magic.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.892
-What a mess!
-It's a mess, all right.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.143
A big, stinky mess.

44:06.228 --> 44:08.354
-We've seen worse!
-Yeah.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.523
Remember when Anastasia fell in love?

44:10.607 --> 44:12.107
I sure do.

44:12.192 --> 44:15.444
Cinderella's stepsister?
That Anastasia?

44:15.529 --> 44:18.364
-Yeah!
-Now that's a messy story.

44:18.448 --> 44:21.200
No. It's a love story.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.975
Lucifer!

44:51.731 --> 44:53.732
Stop hogging the mirror!

44:55.861 --> 44:58.112
-That's mine!
-No! It's mine!

44:58.196 --> 45:01.115
-No! Mine!
-Hey! That's mine!

45:03.076 --> 45:05.244
Oh, you're right.

45:05.328 --> 45:08.873
-It is yours.
-You did that on purpose!

45:08.957 --> 45:10.583
-Did not!
-Did too!

45:10.667 --> 45:11.709
-Did not!
-Did too.

45:11.793 --> 45:15.838
Girls, stop all this bickering at once!

45:15.922 --> 45:19.758
Cinderella's ball is tomorrow night,
so pay attention!

45:20.385 --> 45:23.345
Every noble bachelor
in the kingdom will be there.

45:23.430 --> 45:28.642
If you want to find a husband, you have
to make the most of this opportunity.

45:28.727 --> 45:31.937
I won't let you fail me, again.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.732
-Yes, Mother.
-Yes, Mother.

45:34.816 --> 45:37.359
Drizella, pin back those curls.

45:37.444 --> 45:41.071
Anastasia, put more colour
in your cheeks!

45:41.156 --> 45:45.910
A perfect appearance is the only way
to attract a proper gentleman.

45:45.994 --> 45:49.872
We shall find you
men of wealth and nobility.

45:50.373 --> 45:52.750
-Maybe a count.
-Or a duke.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.752
Precisely.

45:54.836 --> 45:57.796
Come along now.
We need new gowns for the both of you.

45:58.340 --> 46:01.425
-With new shoes.
-And jewellery.

46:01.509 --> 46:04.970
The fancier the better. Lucifer, come.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.641
Lucifer!

46:21.655 --> 46:24.615
Morning, Cinderelly!
Why you dressed like that?

46:24.699 --> 46:27.952
I'm going to the market in disguise
so no one will recognise me.

46:28.036 --> 46:31.455
I want to surprise the Prince
with a garland of flowers.

46:31.539 --> 46:34.667
-Want to come along?
-Oh, yeah. Let's go!

46:34.751 --> 46:36.251
Gus-Gus come along.

47:01.194 --> 47:02.987
Remember the tradition.

47:04.114 --> 47:08.117
Give these to each other at the ball,
and you'll always be together.

47:09.703 --> 47:12.454
Don't you need
a garland of roses for the ball?

47:16.292 --> 47:18.460
Guaranteed to win you his heart.

47:18.545 --> 47:20.963
Anastasia, what are you doing?

47:21.047 --> 47:23.716
Nothing. Coming.

48:01.921 --> 48:05.340
Everything smells so good.

48:05.425 --> 48:08.886
Would you like one?
Be careful. They're hot.

48:10.597 --> 48:13.682
Anastasia, I think not.

48:13.767 --> 48:18.228
Everything in this shop is inferior.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.774
You can build a house
out of these bricks.

48:21.858 --> 48:23.901
Come along, Anastasia.

48:27.655 --> 48:32.034
You're not to say a word
to that shopkeeper.

48:32.118 --> 48:34.912
-I forbid it!
-Yes, Mother.

48:37.207 --> 48:38.540
He's got that look,

48:40.001 --> 48:42.044
and I know that look.

48:42.128 --> 48:43.128
Seasick?

48:45.548 --> 48:49.426
Oh, very funny. I think they're in love.

48:49.511 --> 48:53.222
Anastasia's in love?
That's crazy, Cinderelly!

48:53.306 --> 48:56.642
Come on, you two.
Anyone can fall in love.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.311
Anyone but Anastasia.

48:59.979 --> 49:04.149
-Maybe she just needs some help.
-Yeah, lots of help.

49:04.234 --> 49:07.319
Well, I had lots of help, too, remember?

49:08.738 --> 49:12.407
We have to figure out
how to get them together again.

49:12.492 --> 49:17.830
I know! We'll lure them into the square,
and here's how we'll do it.

49:17.914 --> 49:19.248
The birds will get her hat.

49:19.332 --> 49:21.750
Get the baker's attention.
Bring Anastasia here.

49:21.835 --> 49:24.920
Get the baker outside.
They'll meet in front of the shop.

49:26.506 --> 49:29.508
That's right, Gus.
They'll never know what hit them.

49:37.642 --> 49:40.227
-Hey.
-Okay, fellas...

49:40.311 --> 49:43.063
Get his attention, and remember,
keep it simple.

50:09.549 --> 50:11.675
Mice in my baguettes!

50:20.435 --> 50:21.476
Lucifey!

50:29.027 --> 50:33.113
Come back here!
Filthy creatures!

50:53.134 --> 50:54.426
Are you okay?

50:55.887 --> 50:58.347
Oh, no!

51:19.118 --> 51:20.452
Anastasia?

51:22.288 --> 51:25.707
What are you doing here
dressed like that?

51:25.792 --> 51:28.168
You look like a laundry maid.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.505
I'm not the one with egg on my face.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.720
I saw you in the baker's shop.

51:39.639 --> 51:41.139
He must think I'm...

51:43.393 --> 51:47.604
He saw it was an accident.
Don't give up so fast.

51:47.689 --> 51:51.400
What would you know?
You're beautiful.

51:51.484 --> 51:53.777
It's always been easy for you.

51:53.861 --> 51:57.239
Easy? That's not how I remember it.

51:57.323 --> 52:00.951
Look, Anastasia, you just need
a little help, that's all.

52:01.035 --> 52:03.745
If I weren't so clumsy and plain...

52:03.830 --> 52:06.123
Listen, why don't you
come back to the castle?

52:06.791 --> 52:09.418
We'll clean you up
and then we'll get you two together.

52:10.211 --> 52:14.089
But Mother forbids it!
She thinks he's beneath me.

52:14.173 --> 52:17.592
And I think she's wrong.
The baker's terrific.

52:17.677 --> 52:19.344
And he cooks, too.

53:40.551 --> 53:43.845
Lucifey like Pom-Pom, yes?

53:43.930 --> 53:49.017
Mice can help if Lucifey promise
to stop chasing mice!

53:49.102 --> 53:50.143
Deal?

54:01.614 --> 54:04.699
-There. Good as new.
-Don't stop now!

54:04.784 --> 54:07.494
Mother says that looks
count for everything.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.705
Well, of course you want to
look your best,

54:10.790 --> 54:12.707
but that's not the most important thing.

54:12.792 --> 54:16.002
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What I need is a whole new look.

54:17.338 --> 54:19.673
Make me Iook good
make me look swell

54:19.757 --> 54:21.758
Make me look fine

54:23.428 --> 54:25.804
We're pourin' it on, you just sit back

54:25.888 --> 54:29.099
'Cause, baby, you're mine

54:29.183 --> 54:32.352
You send me into a spin

54:32.437 --> 54:35.355
Make a spIash when you waIk in

54:35.440 --> 54:39.401
Those eyes so rare, the Iips, the hair

54:39.485 --> 54:41.528
You're a breath of fresh air

54:44.365 --> 54:46.450
irushing the fur, comb the hair out

54:46.534 --> 54:48.535
Trim up the toes

54:49.954 --> 54:51.955
Give me the dress and the shoes

54:52.039 --> 54:55.625
And the jeweIIery and cIothes

54:55.710 --> 54:58.628
You can judge your books
from how the cover looks

54:58.713 --> 55:02.090
Wear makeup by the ounce

55:02.175 --> 55:07.345
iut didn't they teII you
it's what's inside that counts?

55:08.055 --> 55:10.307
Make me a star, make me Iook great

55:10.391 --> 55:13.477
Make me Iook grand

55:13.561 --> 55:16.646
I've got styIe and grace
but it's a painted-up face

55:16.731 --> 55:19.316
Gets you a man

55:20.193 --> 55:22.444
Snip, cut, when we are through

55:22.528 --> 55:25.405
You're gonna Iook so good, it's true

55:25.490 --> 55:28.658
The fur, the bows, the chin, the nose

55:31.829 --> 55:37.292
Looks won't hide
it's what's inside that counts

55:37.376 --> 55:43.381
You wanna be a bride
it's what's inside that counts

55:43.925 --> 55:45.800
What about a necklace?

55:49.847 --> 55:51.848
-Lucifer!
-Stupid cat.

55:54.185 --> 55:58.647
Remember, you'll catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

55:58.731 --> 56:01.816
What does that mean?
Who'd want to catch flies?

56:01.901 --> 56:06.738
I mean the best way to impress
the baker is just to be nice to him.

56:06.822 --> 56:11.409
-How do I do that?
-You could start with a smile.

56:11.494 --> 56:13.828
Better get me a bigger necklace.

56:17.250 --> 56:18.500
Come on.

56:40.147 --> 56:43.525
-I make babies cry, too.
-Here.

56:47.446 --> 56:49.698
He'll never be able to resist.

56:49.782 --> 56:51.283
You think so?

56:52.368 --> 56:54.536
But what if Mother catches me?

56:54.620 --> 56:57.789
She told me never to speak
to the baker again!

56:57.873 --> 57:00.542
It's time to stop following
someone else's orders

57:00.626 --> 57:03.378
and start following your heart.

57:04.380 --> 57:06.881
It's late! I have to go!

57:06.966 --> 57:08.967
But what about the baker?

57:11.012 --> 57:13.638
I could walk you to his shop.

57:13.723 --> 57:16.933
Meet you in the market
at noon tomorrow?

57:17.018 --> 57:18.685
I can hardly wait!

58:31.592 --> 58:35.387
Mother, I have to run to town.
We're out of bread.

58:36.347 --> 58:37.389
Hey!

58:38.766 --> 58:40.392
Excuse me. Can I borrow this? Thanks!

59:18.264 --> 59:19.931
I'll wait for you by the apple cart.

59:27.606 --> 59:32.318
-Do you think she'll like them?
-They're beautiful! She'll love them!

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.680
What? What happened?

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:05.894
Anastasia!

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.063
Run for it!

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:58.298
The deal is off!

01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:55.813
Don't look at me! I look horrible!

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:58.232
Wait! Please!

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:20.838
Anastasia!

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:24.467
How dare you defy me?

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:27.011
You were forbidden
to speak to this man!

01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:30.765
Look at her! It's a disaster!

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.851
We'll be the laughingstock
of the entire town.

quite enough with this foolishness.

your best interests at heart.
