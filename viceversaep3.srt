They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,400
You’re not Tun, are you?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,121
You know.

6
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,302
I’m like you.

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,419
I died and traveled between universes too.

8
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,020
Are you sure your system works?

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,956
I don’t feel like we match at all.

10
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:31,798
I don’t think it works.

11
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:34,480
The rule sounds too much like fantasy.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,958
We traveled between universes.

13
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,531
Isn't that a fantasy at all?

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,343
Congratulations!

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,463
Okay.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,597
Bye.

17
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,530
Som and Prae called.

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,085
They matched each other, didn’t they?

19
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,456
Yes.

20
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:01,098
They talked and felt like they clicked.

21
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,615
Ah!

22
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:07,169
And don’t you two click at all?

23
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,400
‘Click’ isn’t the right word right now. ‘Kick’ sounds more like it.

24
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:14,008
I just want to kick his ass.

25
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,798
Well, well. Mr. Nice Guy.

26
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,625
I don’t want to kick you at all.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,485
What should we do now?

28
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,350
Does it mean the matching system isn’t reliable?

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,187
Calm down.

30
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:34,161
The matching system was only built to help us find probability.

31
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,613
Nothing can guarantee.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,389
Honestly, it’s like finding a soulmate.

33
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:48,197
We must keep finding and finding until we found the one, right?

34
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,445
Yes.

35
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:54,000
The best advice I have for you right now is

36
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:57,309
follow your heart.

37
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:17,206
I'm starting to lose hope of ever finding the portkey.

38
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:18,740
Why?

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,626
Think about it.

40
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:23,847
It's extremely difficult to match someone.

41
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,562
And we don’t know if that’s the right one until we dream.

42
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:28,379
So many conditions that I’m discouraged.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,809
Can I just not go back?

44
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:31,852
Relax.

45
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,172
Just do what Dol said.

46
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,840
Follow your heart.

47
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,305
Easier said than done.

48
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,642
What is ‘follow your heart’ anyway?

49
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:44,908
It’s like…

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
live your life to the fullest in the meantime.

51
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,294
When it comes,

52
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,432
it comes.

53
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,340
Why do I feel like you’re letting it go?

54
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,685
That’s no point to get obsessed.

55
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:05,318
I should focus on studying and helping you with the movie.

56
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,814
But I will keep on looking.

57
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,517
Don’t tell me after spending time together,

58
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:16,758
we turn out to be each other’s portkey.

59
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:19,836
That’s not a problem.

60
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:21,892
If it’s you,

61
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:23,494
I’m okay.

62
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:32,539
I’m okay too.

63
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:34,934
Then…

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,445
let’s live the best life we can in this universe.

65
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,520
Deal.

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,824
I’ve arrived.

67
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,997
You, bastard. You took forever.

68
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:24,000
Sorry. I got up late.

69
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,135
Don’t tell me you just left your house when I called.

70
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,376
No.

71
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,320
I just woke up when you called.

72
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:32,792
Asshole.

73
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,675
You’re allowed to lie sometimes.

74
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,548
What do you want my help with today?

75
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,682
Help me find the location.

76
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:44,260
I’m searching for the regular café where the main characters hang out.

77
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,733
I want to see several places.

78
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,702
Hop on.

79
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:49,719
We’re late.

80
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,438
You’re late. Not me.

81
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,652
We’re both late.

82
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:55,389
Come on.

83
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:00,991
You can wear it on the bike.

84
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,197
So slow.

85
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,713
I’m leaving.

86
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:06,049
Hey! Wait up.

87
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:07,811
Ready.

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,792
Whoa!

89
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,790
I don’t like pink.

90
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,000
You should see the pants you’re wearing today.

91
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:28,963
These are Tess’s.

92
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,000
Not mine.

93
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,961
Will it be good?

94
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:36,000
Come on.

95
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,673
Don’t judge the book by its cover.

96
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,264
Try it first.

97
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,562
Here.

98
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:44,201
What?

99
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:45,939
No.

100
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:51,050
Open your mouth willingly or I make you open it?

101
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,763
Quickly.

102
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:05,289
Wow! The strawberries are rich.

103
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,268
I want more.

104
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,183
Do you think this place is nice?

105
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:22,839
Good enough to be the characters’ favorite café?

106
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,106
Actually,

107
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,214
it is okay.

108
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,269
It just doesn’t really wow me.

109
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,854
You can take photos just in case.

110
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,402
Yeah.

111
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,108
Hey! What are you doing?

112
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:49,984
No.

113
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:52,515
What?

114
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,634
It’s just taking photos.

115
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,280
What’s the big deal?

116
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,571
I’m tired of striking a pose.

117
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:00,833
When I was modeling,

118
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:02,640
I took photos all day long it was exhausting.

119
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,823
So you’re an actor and a model.

120
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,748
I just narrowed down the scope of who you are.

121
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,823
Most actors started out as models.

122
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,298
Now that we’re talking about this,

123
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,550
can I guess what you look like?

124
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:30,679
Go ahead.

125
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,970
Draw me if you’re good enough.

126
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,518
I think

127
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,640
you’re mixed race.

128
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:44,587
Wrong.

129
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,690
A little snub-nosed?

130
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:50,203
Wrong again.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Eyebrows?

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,833
Thick.

133
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,192
Straight hair?

134
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,021
I’ve had so many hairstyles.

135
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,159
Your natural hair.

136
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,979
Were you born with straight hair?

137
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:05,793
Yeah.

138
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,496
Ah!

139
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:11,927
So I am right.

140
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:17,302
You should look something like this.

141
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:23,252
Wait a minute.

142
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,104
Are you trying to bug me?

143
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:29,642
No.

144
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:31,614
I’m serious.

145
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:32,900
Serious?

146
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,126
This is cute.

147
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,776
Cute, my foot.

148
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,825
It’s hideous.

149
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,413
It looks like you.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,807
Hold on.

151
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,000
Aou is calling.

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,202
Hey. What’s up?

153
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:59,089
Script meeting?

154
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:01,097
Okay. I’ll be right there.

155
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:05,169
I forgot I had a meeting.

156
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:05,959
Let’s go.

157
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,097
Wait.

158
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,829
Why do I need to go?

159
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
You’re in charge of this project.

160
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,430
Besides,

161
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,566
you know I’m not good at screenwriting.

162
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,872
It’s for the best if you come.

163
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:18,489
What?

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,666
Come on.

165
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,947
Quickly.

166
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:24,755
The bread.

167
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,310
Leave it. Let’s go.

168
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:32,064
We have two opinions here.

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,649
Tun and I think we should have a happy ending.

170
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,415
You and Tess want a sad ending.

171
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,933
What now?

172
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,540
Why do you want a sad ending, Tess?

173
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,323
Right.

174
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,388
I’m not into love.

175
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:48,465
Come on.

176
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,962
This movie is made for people to be into it.

177
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:52,928
Not for you.

178
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,303
Let’s Rock Paper Scissors.

179
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,398
Get it over with.

180
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,312
No way.

181
00:10:57,312 --> 00:10:58,475
That’s too sloppy.

182
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,373
How about this?

183
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,230
We meet halfway.

184
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:07,647
They part for so long and meet once again.

185
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,802
What do you think?

186
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:11,735
Is that happy or unhappy?

187
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,720
Open ending.

188
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:14,767
Tess,

189
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,576
I like that ending.

190
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,673
I’ll go with it.

191
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,842
Let’s do it.

192
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:21,796
Our job is done.

193
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:22,934
Relieved.

194
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,429
I’ll go pee now.

195
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,314
I’m coming too.

196
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,185
Sure.

197
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,951
I just talked to my dad.

198
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:34,453
This Friday, we’ll present him with the film treatment.

199
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:35,572
Awesome.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Go home and handle our own section of the presentation.

201
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,299
Huh? What presentation?

202
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:42,616
Why are you confused?

203
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,110
Our responsibility.

204
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,946
You normally take care of the synopsis and tagline.

205
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:49,400
Then you collect files from us and put together a presentation.

206
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,800
But I’m not…

207
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,540
You’re not what?

208
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,400
He’s not feeling well.

209
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:57,887
Right, Tun?

210
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:00,918
Yes.

211
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,946
I’m having the flu.

212
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,794
Oh!

213
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:10,520
He’s burning up.

214
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,367
Tun.

215
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:14,720
You’re a workaholic.

216
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,047
There was one time you had a 39°C fever.

217
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,380
But we were still working like it’s nothing.

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,678
You’re right.

219
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,000
Fine. I’ll do it.

220
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,570
See?

221
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,189
I know someone like you will never ditch work.

222
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:29,915
Right?

223
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,018
Do you even know how to create a tagline?

224
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:36,813
Of course.

225
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,253
Of course, not!

226
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,160
I don’t even know what a tagline is.

227
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,002
What?

228
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:44,733
It’s a caption.

229
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,740
A short sentence that makes movies more appealing.

230
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,085
I can’t even rhyme words in poems.

231
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:52,648
Let alone the tagline.

232
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:54,811
Can you even handle this?

233
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,896
Let me help.

234
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,270
I can.

235
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,892
I will come up with something eventually.

236
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,719
5 DAYS LATER

237
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,965
He hasn’t arrived yet?

238
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,594
Am I a joke to you, Tess?

239
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,628
No, Dad.

240
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,978
Has he picked up yet?

241
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:16,168
No.

242
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,551
I called his mom. She said she had no idea.

243
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,444
Hey!

244
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,160
He’s calling!

245
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:33,503
Hello, Tun.

246
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:34,700
Where are you?

247
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:37,291
Huh?

248
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,361
Police station?

249
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,189
Your friend was arrested for drunk driving at the checkpoint.

250
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,960
So I brought him here.

251
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:49,736
Hey!

252
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:52,238
You’re here to pick me up, T.L?

253
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,296
I think it stands for Talay.

254
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,547
My name is Talay.

255
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,440
No. Not Talay.

256
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,225
T.L. is Teelak (darling).

257
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
You came for me, darling?

258
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:09,630
I’m sorry.

259
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,003
My friend is drunk.

260
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,269
May you please excuse me?

261
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:18,780
Tun.

262
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,353
This is not funny.

263
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,892
Not trying to be.

264
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,494
Pull yourself together.

265
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:27,670
Tess.

266
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,138
Your dad canceled the presentation.

267
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,145
He’s angry that we didn’t come prepared.

268
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,504
Shit.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,161
What should we do?

270
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,296
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,918
We’ve worked so hard.

272
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,974
You decided to ruin it on the presentation day?

273
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:49,702
Hey.

274
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,640
I didn’t mean to.

275
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:58,909
Who would know this guy is such a lightweight?

276
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,062
What the heck are you talking about?

277
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:06,204
Never mind.

278
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,054
Guys.

279
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,490
Look on the bright side.

280
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,186
We have more time to prepare the new presentation.

281
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:13,881
Right?

282
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:16,603
And…

283
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,552
Tess will talk to his dad for us.

284
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,344
Where is your work file?

285
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,557
Work file?

286
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,515
Ah!

287
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:30,400
In my thumb drive.

288
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,519
I have it with me. Let me find it.

289
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:56,254
It’s gone.

290
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,280
Tun.

291
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,457
I have a serious question.

292
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,951
The promise we made,

293
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,767
did you forget all about it?

294
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,110
Huh?

295
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,092
What promise are you talking about?

296
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,522
You’re not the same Tun I used to know.

297
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:23,495
Hey.

298
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,050
Hey!

299
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,423
Where are you guys going?

300
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,861
It’s only a missing thumb drive.

301
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,991
I’ll buy you a new one.

302
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,355
Why are they frustrated?

303
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:38,972
Right, darling?

304
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:47,665
We’re in their bodies. We should live their lives wisely.

305
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,942
Will you not be sad if Pakorn ruins yours?

306
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:27,514
This universe is so damn cool.

307
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,365
They even have crispy pork on sticks.

308
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,003
Freakin’ yummy.

309
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:31,966
Want some?

310
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,109
Tun, it’s not funny.

311
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:37,922
What’s wrong?

312
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:39,202
What’s bothering you?

313
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,823
Nothing is.

314
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,573
I’m just living my life to the fullest as you suggested.

315
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:46,561
What?

316
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:54,147
When I was an actor, I barely had time for myself.

317
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:57,833
Now that I’m here, I get enough sleep.

318
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,758
I eat anything I want.

319
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:02,796
I can go out and get drunk all I want.

320
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,003
Tun.

321
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:09,643
What I meant was to live the life of the body owner to the fullest.

322
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,773
Not spoiling yourself like this.

323
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:16,520
Yeah?

324
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,939
Hell yeah.

325
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,561
Phuwadol warned you.

326
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,586
We’re in their bodies.

327
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,014
We should live their lives wisely.

328
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:31,736
Will you not be sad if Pakorn ruins yours?

329
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,843
That’s true.

330
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:42,908
I didn’t realize that.

331
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,845
I’m sorry.

332
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:50,008
Don’t apologize to me.

333
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,147
The ones you should say sorry to are Up and Aou.

334
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,052
[Aou]

335
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,434
Here you are.

336
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:03,034
(I started working hard on this screenplay in grade 12.)

337
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,356
(A year has passed and it was done.)

338
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,109
(I decided to offer it to 26 Pictures.)

339
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,196
(I was damn nervous.)

340
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,058
Aou!

341
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,376
Pakorn.

342
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,627
You’re here for the screenplay pitch too?

343
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:24,723
Yes.

344
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,556
Been working on it since high school.

345
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:27,793
Dang!

346
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,535
I came to sell mine too.

347
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:30,040
Seriously?

348
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,901
What a coincidence!

349
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,511
Not just the two of us.

350
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,067
Hello.

351
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,520
Up!

352
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,067
You’re here too?

353
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Why didn’t you tell me about this?

354
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,809
You never asked.

355
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:44,997
Guys.

356
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,909
If you want to sell a comedy, I’m right here.

357
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,046
Because mine is hilarious.

358
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,521
Stop right there.

359
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,319
You make me want to spit.

360
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,615
Social satire is a hit in this era.

361
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:57,874
Comedy isn’t gonna sell. Trust me.

362
00:20:57,874 --> 00:20:59,552
Social satire is too serious.

363
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,943
What works is romantic movies.

364
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:02,904
Yuck!

365
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,205
Hello.

366
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:08,518
You’re still here?

367
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,507
About the screenplay, right?

368
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,542
Let me discuss this with my team.

369
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,559
If we like it, we will reach out. Okay?

370
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,218
Hey,

371
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,891
let’s go for a coffee.

372
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:19,121
Urgent meeting coming up.

373
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,870
What?

374
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:39,408
They’re gone?

375
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:43,174
Hey.

376
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:47,747
Those first-year students selling their screenplays were so unqualified.

377
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:48,713
Exactly.

378
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,543
I almost fell asleep listening to their screenplay pitch.

379
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,769
Seriously, it’s like herding behavior.

380
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,998
Offering their scripts to directors so that they can brag about it with friends.

381
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:01,705
See this. The comedy play by Up-Pree.

382
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:03,220
It’s not even funny.

383
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,848
Such a sloppy job he did.

384
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:07,785
Hey! Why do you still keep a screenplay like this?

385
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,154
Throw it away.

386
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:11,096
I will when I go to the toilet.

387
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,641
Why wait until then?

388
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,984
That’s a trash bin.

389
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,721
Come here.

390
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,052
But before we dump it, let’s give them blessings.

391
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,216
Agree.

392
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:24,190
To the dream of the first-year students.

393
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,855
Yuck!

394
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,942
What the heck are you doing?

395
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:31,389
You can say my work is crappy all you want.

396
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:33,745
But you can’t say my friend’s work is sloppy.

397
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:37,486
He stayed up all night writing this to sell to you.

398
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,387
He didn’t pull an all-nighter just to hear your shitty criticism.

399
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:41,120
Calm down.

400
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,267
Apologize to his work.

401
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:43,947
Go away!

402
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:44,718
Do it!

403
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:45,531
Go away!

404
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,943
You guys have no future here!

405
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,065
You will regret this!

406
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:07,448
I’m mad he bad-mouthed us.

407
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:10,769
But I think our scripts aren’t good yet.

408
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,476
Take Aou’s for example.

409
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,602
His prologue lasts forever before he tells the core story.

410
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,168
But you tell it too early, Up.

411
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:20,234
It’s like you force the comedy too much.

412
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,784
Your comedy is okay.

413
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:29,002
But the characters’ backgrounds are too weak. Too light.

414
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,355
Your characters’ backgrounds are so strong.

415
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:34,324
But there are so many loopholes in your script.

416
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,275
Shit!

417
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,828
Why didn’t I do this from the beginning?

418
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,827
We have our own strengths.

419
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,387
You have your strength. I have mine.

420
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:48,126
We can help seal each other’s leakage.

421
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:52,375
What if we write screenplays together?

422
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,682
How great will it be?

423
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:56,849
Dang!

424
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:58,468
He’s right.

425
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:00,549
We’ve had classes together for the whole semester.

426
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,068
Why can’t I think about it?

427
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,475
We will join forces.

428
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:06,267
Write our best script.

429
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,482
And sell it to all film companies.

430
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,041
26 Pictures will be so jealous.

431
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,061
I think the opposite.

432
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:17,814
We will write it and sell it to 26 Pictures.

433
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:21,492
They will regret saying no to us today.

434
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:22,274
Right!

435
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,376
Argh!!

436
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,660
Cheers!

437
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,465
It’s just water but cheers!

438
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:51,715
Hey.

439
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:53,008
You’re here?

440
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:57,587
Found it.

441
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:00,495
Can you guide me through the presentation making?

442
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:03,223
Sure.

443
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,467
Are you…okay?

444
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:08,848
Yes.

445
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,547
I’m okay.

446
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:12,600
Don’t lie to me. I can tell.

447
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:15,176
You’re normally more upbeat.

448
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:16,322
Yeah.

449
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,595
Just take a look at the files.

450
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,443
Not right now.

451
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:23,960
Can you take me to a place first?

452
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,782
Why did you ask me to take you here?

453
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:40,776
Because you frown so much.

454
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:45,396
I thought a cool breeze at the riverside should help.

455
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:49,550
It’s okay.

456
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,896
Just get to work.

457
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:51,800
There.

458
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,747
You do have something on your mind.

459
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:58,635
I’m going to make you smile.

460
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:08,727
What are you doing?

461
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,053
I’m not ticklish.

462
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:11,452
What?

463
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,920
How about this?

464
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,456
It kind of worked.

465
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,147
I laughed because you tried so hard to make me laugh.

466
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:37,763
At least your mood is lifted.

467
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:42,373
Will you tell me now what’s bothering you?

468
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,023
It’s about Up and Aou.

469
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,045
They don’t pick up my calls.

470
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,470
They don’t respond to my messages.

471
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:02,791
I don’t know what to do.

472
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,697
I feel sorry for what I did to them.

473
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:12,080
I can’t talk to them for you

474
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:13,560
but

475
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,757
I have some advice.

476
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:17,890
What?

477
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,907
Sincerely apologize for everything.

478
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:39,788
Say goodbye to the misbehave Tun

479
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:43,514
and start over.

480
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:52,131
Don’t get stressed out.

481
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:58,082
Dang it!

482
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,515
The synopsis isn’t easy to do.

483
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,444
It goes to 10 pages no matter how I summarize it.

484
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,117
Tun could’ve done it in one page.

485
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,271
Stop talking about him.

486
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,187
The old Tun has died.

487
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,900
(Guys, I know I was a real asshole.)

488
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:49,836
(But can you give me a chance to make it right?)

489
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,253
Hey, guys.

490
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,598
All files are in here.

491
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:27,326
We’ll make 26 Pictures say sorry for bad-mouthing us.

492
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,182
(Let’s go eat.)

493
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,003
(You’re paying!)

494
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:57,835
Life is full of intense situations.

495
00:30:58,074 --> 00:30:59,552
We need to work.

496
00:30:59,878 --> 00:31:00,980
To follow our dreams.

497
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,371
Have you ever imagined the day you’re in love by choice?

498
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:37,542
Hello.

499
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:39,126
Where are you?

500
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:42,309
Don’t tell me you just woke up.

501
00:31:43,296 --> 00:31:44,380
I’m right here.

502
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:56,673
Gosh!

503
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:59,315
What an unusual day.

504
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,315
You’re early.

505
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,912
I told you I’d better myself.

506
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,635
Back then when I was an actor, I was always early.

507
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:13,760
You asked me to meet you here. Why?

508
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:15,213
Ah!

509
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,005
I just finished the synopsis for the presentation.

510
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,795
I needed your help looking at it.

511
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,477
I don’t expertise in romance.

512
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:25,715
Use your dating experiences.

513
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,360
Haven’t you been in a relationship before?

514
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:32,970
Never.

515
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:39,903
Have you?

516
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:45,159
Never either.

517
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:48,326
I’m single by choice.

518
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:56,718
Have you ever imagined the day you’re in love by choice?

519
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,337
I have.

520
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:06,486
A long time ago.

521
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,037
Think about it.

522
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,089
Life is full of intense situations.

523
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:13,756
We need to work,

524
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:15,206
to follow our dreams.

525
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,286
They consume all my energy.

526
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:24,702
You and I are…

527
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:27,275
so bad when it comes to love.

528
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:33,795
Will we be able to make a romantic movie?

529
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,255
Is it necessary?

530
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:39,601
Of course.

531
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:44,262
You have to know what people in love do each day.

532
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:52,995
Hey!

533
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,353
Study from that couple.

534
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,061
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:02,195
Don’t interfere with other people’s business.

536
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:05,715
Besides, how do you know they’re a couple?

537
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,548
They definitely are.

538
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:10,715
I don’t think they are.

539
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:13,197
Wanna bet?

540
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,114
I think they’re in a relationship.

541
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,861
The winner can make the loser do anything.

542
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:20,131
No.

543
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:27,315
To find out,

544
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:29,303
we must follow them.

545
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,303
Come on. They’re gone.

546
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:37,686
You asked me to help with work. You haven’t started working.

547
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,520
We have.

548
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,621
That’s our work.

549
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:44,891
Look.

550
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,867
The smiles they’re exchanging.

551
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,245
So sweet.

552
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:50,715
Of course, they’re dating.

553
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,262
No freaking way.

554
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:53,755
Look at his outfit.

555
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,414
He’s too chilled.

556
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:57,294
They’re definitely not dating.

557
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,130
Come on.

558
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,492
The girl is wearing pretty makeup.

559
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:02,741
They’re surely on a date.

560
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:13,648
There! That’s it.

561
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,122
They are a couple. The guy is paying.

562
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:19,698
He might advance it and the girl pays him back later.

563
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:21,359
Modern age.

564
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:28,560
They’re moving.

565
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,379
Let’s go.

566
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,077
Follow them?

567
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:30,804
Yes.

568
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:44,907
See?

569
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,246
They’re not holding hands.

570
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,262
They aren’t a couple.

571
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,189
Lots of couples don’t hold hands.

572
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,963
Wait.

573
00:35:54,557 --> 00:35:55,703
How do you know?

574
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,009
You said you’d never been in a relationship.

575
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,103
I observed people around me.

576
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,328
What now?

577
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,170
Do you need to ask?

578
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,023
Buy the tickets and follow them inside.

579
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,214
They’re eating from the same bucket.

580
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,843
They’re a couple for sure.

581
00:36:50,716 --> 00:36:52,716
Friends can share that.

582
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:56,467
You and I are eating from the same bucket too.

583
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:00,245
Just friends?

584
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,889
We might be boyfriends.

585
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:05,715
Boyfriends, my ass!

586
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:07,112
Shut up and eat.

587
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,816
Holy shit!

588
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:28,402
He kissed her cheek.

589
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:29,383
Is it clear now?

590
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,344
I won.

591
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:34,499
We got the answer.

592
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,099
Let’s get back to work.

593
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,266
Wait.

594
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,295
Sit back down.

595
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:41,955
We paid for the tickets after all.

596
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,756
Finish the movie first.

597
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,195
Sleepy?

598
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,577
Who’s sleepy?

599
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,650
No.

600
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:24,735
Oh.

601
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:26,923
The movie has ended?

602
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,715
How could you sleep on it?

603
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:32,272
The movie was superb.

604
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:37,138
I told you I’m not into love.

605
00:38:38,894 --> 00:38:43,024
The scene where the male lead confessed to the female lead was fantastic.

606
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:44,500
Really?

607
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,033
What did he say?

608
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,310
From the moment we met

609
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,781
I’ve been falling head over heels in love with you.

610
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:19,704
What are you doing?

611
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,718
You asked me what he said.

612
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:25,715
I’m just repeating it.

613
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:32,122
You don’t need to poke your face so close.

614
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:49,394
Crap!!

615
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,117
It’s 8 already.

616
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:52,915
Let’s get back to work.

617
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:53,902
Hey.

618
00:39:58,114 --> 00:39:59,001
I’m hungry.

619
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,585
Let’s go eat first.

620
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:02,310
Why do I have to go?

621
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,222
Have you forgotten?

622
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,876
I won the bet. Those two were together.

623
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,715
I’m using the winner’s privilege to make you have dinner with me.

624
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:23,092
Thank you.

625
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:33,194
Wow! I didn’t think this fried chicken existed here.

626
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,591
Right.

627
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:39,682
I thought they had a different name and I couldn’t find it.

628
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:42,635
Lucky us.

629
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:48,882
Look at you.

630
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:50,595
You want it too, right?

631
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:56,708
If I ask to get one piece of it,

632
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:59,271
will you say I’m spoiling myself?

633
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:02,114
Come on. Just eat.

634
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:03,866
I’ll even let you pick.

635
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,135
You want a drumstick or a wing?

636
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:11,082
Tick tock. Tick tock.

637
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:12,335
They are hot.

638
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,180
The drumstick.

639
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,715
There you go.

640
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:23,812
They say people who love to eat drumsticks are smart but lazy.

641
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,874
What about those who eat wings?

642
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:31,678
Enthusiastic and determined.

643
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:32,933
Ew!

644
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:35,475
‘They’ is you, isn’t it?

645
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:37,181
I read it somewhere.

646
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:40,630
Hey!

647
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:43,805
Can I have the wing then?

648
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:45,795
I want to be a determined guy.

649
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:47,169
Nope.

650
00:41:47,684 --> 00:41:49,684
I’m the determined one.

651
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,629
We both want to be determined.

652
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:55,758
I guess we need to share the wing.

653
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:01,544
Hey.

654
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:04,266
What?

655
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,283
Fine.

656
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:07,727
Let me find a new wing.

657
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:09,171
Come on.

658
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,530
Here.

659
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:14,603
Eat this.

660
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,858
Hey!! Feed me.

661
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,332
Here. I love this.

662
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:33,956
No.

663
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,368
I want it.

664
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,515
You want some lotus, brothers?

665
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:48,014
No.

666
00:42:48,286 --> 00:42:49,696
I’m not worshiping Buddha images tonight.

667
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:51,418
What are you talking about?

668
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:55,075
These are for your lover.

669
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:58,455
No way. You’re lying.

670
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,239
I’m not buying those.

671
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:10,906
You’re making him sad.

672
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:12,261
Why didn’t you buy some?

673
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,349
Why didn’t you?

674
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:16,396
I’m eating.

675
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,916
Would you like some lotus for your girlfriend?

676
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:19,811
20 baht each.

677
00:43:21,676 --> 00:43:22,735
Shit!

678
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,958
They give lotus instead of roses in this universe.

679
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,281
Unbelievable.

680
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,715
The whole day with you, no work has been done.

681
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:37,675
What a waste of time.

682
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,138
Who told you?

683
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:44,009
I’ve got so much work done.

684
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,179
[Lovers eating together.]
[Long-distance relationship(?) ]
[Two people who love each other have to part.]

685
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,015
[“Single by choice”]
[“Follow a couple into a cinema.”]
[“Head over heels…”]

686
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:06,595
Stunned, huh?

687
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:10,243
When I get serious, my work is done.

688
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:17,625
Good.

689
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,715
Go back and finish it.

690
00:44:22,948 --> 00:44:23,795
No.

691
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:28,562
There’s still a lot you need to look at.

692
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,621
I think I’ll finish it tonight.

693
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:33,443
And?

694
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:39,103
I’m going to work at your place tonight.

695
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:48,590
Chop-chop.

696
00:44:48,591 --> 00:44:50,294
It’s going to be a long night.

697
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:51,326
Come.

698
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:54,361
Don’t get stunned. Move.

699
00:45:00,512 --> 00:45:02,512
I’m so lucky to have you.

700
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:06,440
I promise I will live Tun’s life to the fullest.

701
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:07,621
To the best.

702
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,613
With you.

703
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:43,129
What if I play with words like this?

704
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:50,877
“A romantic film about people who are single by choice and the mysterious challenge to check how much they cherish their love.”

705
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:53,026
Damn!

706
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,051
I like it.

707
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:59,819
You borrowed the word I said.

708
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:01,540
Of course.

709
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,230
I’m so lucky to have you.

710
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:05,682
Thank you.

711
00:46:11,027 --> 00:46:12,726
You’re done. Go home.

712
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:15,075
I’ll take a shower and go to bed.

713
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:16,448
I’m not done.

714
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,432
I still need to do the presentation.

715
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,519
I’d like you to look at the layout.

716
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:22,836
Do it then.

717
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,859
I’ll go take a shower.

718
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:28,738
Okay.

719
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:56,690
Talay.

720
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:01,318
Talay.

721
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,141
What the heck?

722
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:15,678
Why are you in here?

723
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:18,493
I’ve called you a million times.

724
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:19,978
You slept on me.

725
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:22,154
The work is all done.

726
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,411
Then go home.

727
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:26,524
What are you still here for?

728
00:47:26,725 --> 00:47:28,721
It’s too late to go home.

729
00:47:30,301 --> 00:47:31,874
I’ll take a bath and crash here tonight.

730
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,788
Wait until I’m finished.

731
00:47:36,914 --> 00:47:37,652
No.

732
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:40,721
Close your eyes.

733
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,291
I said close your eyes.

734
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:05,244
Why backing off?

735
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:07,512
Are you shy?

736
00:48:08,615 --> 00:48:10,088
I’m not.

737
00:48:11,423 --> 00:48:13,122
I just like to take a bath alone.

738
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:15,712
Don’t you know?

739
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:17,636
Privacy.

740
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:27,211
I think you must forget all about privacy for now.

741
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,570
And seek togetherness.

742
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,393
You might be able to write a better romantic film script.

743
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,114
That’s a screenwriter’s job.

744
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:37,963
Not mine.

745
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:43,396
You’re right.

746
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:46,057
Move.

747
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,522
Your bathtub is huge.

748
00:48:54,553 --> 00:48:57,432
No wonder why you fell asleep.

749
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:24,047
Ouch!

750
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:27,721
What are you doing?

751
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,255
Are you getting back at me?

752
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:32,857
I was just going to clean your face.

753
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,361
Why?

754
00:49:40,537 --> 00:49:41,917
I’m not wearing any makeup.

755
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:46,089
I’m wiping away the dust.

756
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,332
To deeply clean your face.

757
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:53,408
This universe is as dusty as the other universe.

758
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:09,610
Why are you looking at me?

759
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:12,088
What do you want?

760
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:17,349
Give me a cotton pad.

761
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,095
I’ll clean yours.

762
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,270
I already cleaned it.

763
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,471
Look.

764
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,688
Just give it.

765
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:54,706
If this can be used to wipe away dust,

766
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,781
I should use it with your heart.

767
00:50:58,585 --> 00:50:59,654
I think...

768
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,983
your heart hasn’t been used in a long time.

769
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:05,594
It must be so dusty.

770
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:39,201
Now that it’s clean,

771
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,517
I hope you can now put your heart into romantic movies,

772
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:48,527
Talay.

773
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:01,654
After that, the male lead and the female lead see each other again

774
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:03,795
in the coffee shop where they met for the first time.

775
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:05,945
And they exchange their smiles.

776
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,572
It’s an open ending, Dad.

777
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:20,654
All right.

778
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:23,591
I will take it into consideration.

779
00:52:28,138 --> 00:52:30,138
I’ll have someone reach out later.

780
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:35,537
The middle is a little prolonged.

781
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,090
And there are many loopholes.

782
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,243
But I like the idea of the movie.

783
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:44,280
It’s fresh and honest.

784
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,411
Go back and improve the script.

785
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:52,847
Once it is better,

786
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:55,411
prepare for the casting.

787
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,739
Thank you, Dad.

788
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:01,629
Thank you so much.

789
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:06,102
Guys!

790
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:14,383
The script is approved!

791
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,605
Woo-hoo!

792
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:40,079
I’ve stopped for a while. When are you gonna get off?

793
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:42,076
Let me store my things first.

794
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:44,724
Done!

795
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,302
Thank you.

796
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,767
I should be thanking you.

797
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:54,585
For what?

798
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:57,614
For everything.

799
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,088
All the insanity that happened,

800
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,824
I’m so lucky to have you.

801
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,662
I am also glad I have you.

802
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:22,181
But now I can’t take this helmet off.

803
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:25,974
Do it for me.

804
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:28,752
No.

805
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:33,024
You will get stuck with it all night.

806
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:35,248
Because I glued it.

807
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,369
Bastard!

808
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,685
You just love to get on my nerves.

809
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,811
Go up to your room wearing it.

810
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:48,177
Okay.

811
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:50,320
Safe ride home.

812
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:53,072
Bye.

813
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:56,901
Talay.

814
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:02,051
What?

815
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:09,423
I promise I will put my best effort into writing this movie’s script.

816
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,039
Like we talked about.

817
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,871
And I’ll live Tun’s life to the fullest.

818
00:55:17,363 --> 00:55:18,610
To the best.

819
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:20,411
With you.

820
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:31,710
Deal.

821
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:39,126
Your thumb too.

822
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:45,134
Bye now.

823
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:48,688
See you.

824
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:51,025
See you.

825
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:43,355
[The one wearing this is cute.]

826
00:56:50,684 --> 00:56:52,885
You’re not the only one who does things secretly.

827
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,309
I’ve stopped for a while. When are you gonna get off?

828
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:13,588
Let me store my things first.

829
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,873
[You’re so great.]

830
00:57:46,522 --> 00:57:50,983
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

831
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:14,217
The one who got the bouquet,

832
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:15,791
are you already taken?

833
00:58:16,402 --> 00:58:17,623
Actually
[Talay.]

834
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:18,725
I’m hitting on someone.

835
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:21,333
But he’s playing hard to get.

836
00:58:21,609 --> 00:58:23,107
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

837
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:27,385
What if in order to go back, you must love someone?

838
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:28,232
What will you do?

839
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:31,091
Well, it depends on who that person is.

840
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:33,974
What if it’s me?
