&lrm;[Marinette] Here I am, milady.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.140
&lrm;Glad to see you, Cat Noir.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.220
&lrm;Of course you are, I'm the cat's meow.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.060
&lrm;[she chuckles]

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620
&lrm;- He shouldn't say that.
&lrm;- No?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.220
&lrm;[cough]

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.820
&lrm;This is no time to goof around, Cat Noir.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.860
&lrm;We've gotta capture
&lrm;the baddies' Akumas before...

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.100
&lrm;Actually, what do the baddies want?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.620
&lrm;We want to win.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.540
&lrm;Yeah, but win what?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.980
&lrm;I dunno. What do they usually want?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
&lrm;Depends...

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.860
&lrm;Lady Wi-Fi wanted to reveal
&lrm;Ladybug's identity.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.220
&lrm;Evillustrator wanted revenge
&lrm;on a girl for mocking him.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.980
&lrm;Then, there was Rogercop...

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.980
&lrm;But the evil Hawk Moth
&lrm;who makes them bad

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.940
&lrm;wants to take Ladybug's
&lrm;and Cat Noir's jewels,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.620
&lrm;their Miraculouses.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.580
&lrm;And what would happen
&lrm;if he did take them?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.820
&lrm;The bad guys... would win.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.220
&lrm;I know.
&lrm;I know what the bad guys want.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.980
&lrm;We want the Miraculous,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.220
&lrm;then we'll win, forever and ever!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.780
&lrm;I'm gonna get your Miraculous,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.020
&lrm;You... you..
&lrm;goodie-two-shoeses!

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.380
&lrm;You'll be super-duper sorry.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.900
&lrm;[giggling]

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.180
&lrm;You won't get our Miraculouses.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.420
&lrm;Yeah?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.900
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir have won again!

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.900
&lrm;No fair. You always win.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.260
&lrm;[she cries]

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.620
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir always win.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.980
&lrm;And the bad guys always lose.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.660
&lrm;But you never let me play
&lrm;with Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.460
&lrm;Don't cry.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.220
&lrm;Of course you can play with them.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.700
&lrm;I'll even let you borrow one of them.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.500
&lrm;[Mrs. Chamack] I'm back.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.860
&lrm;Have you been good?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.660
&lrm;[sobbing]
&lrm;Mommy! Marinette didn't let me win.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.580
&lrm;She didn't play fair and square.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.020
&lrm;Manon, you can't always expect to win.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.100
&lrm;Yes you can.
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir always win.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
&lrm;Well, you're right there
&lrm;but they're superheroes.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.500
&lrm;You'll win next time, Manon.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780
&lrm;Now give the doll back to Marinette.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.220
&lrm;[angrily] No! I wanna keep her!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.100
&lrm;I told her she could borrow it.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.940
&lrm;That's sweet of you,
&lrm;but she already has so many toys

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.220
&lrm;I wouldn't know where to put it.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.500
&lrm;[she gasps] No!

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.980
&lrm;Look what you've done.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.460
&lrm;Give it to me.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.220
&lrm;[Manon sobs]

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.900
&lrm;[mother sighs] I'm sorry, Marinette.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.260
&lrm;It's nothing. I can sew it up again.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.820
&lrm;It's no problem.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.140
&lrm;Thank goodness.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.380
&lrm;Come on, Manon, say goodbye.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.540
&lrm;I... want... that... doll!

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.380
&lrm;No. You can play with it here, next time.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.220
&lrm;Come on, Manon,
&lrm;be a good girl and say goodbye.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.860
&lrm;[sobbing]

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.220
&lrm;[sulkily] Goodbye.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.300
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.580
&lrm;Hi, Alec.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.260
&lrm;Didn't I leave it for you
&lrm;on my desk at the station?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.420
&lrm;I left my bag up there, Mommy.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.780
&lrm;Go quickly.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.300
&lrm;It's not there?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.940
&lrm;I think our heroes are in need
&lrm;of a little TLC.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.540
&lrm;[gasping]

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.700
&lrm;Manon, what...?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.340
&lrm;I left my bag.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.620
&lrm;Can I have Ladybug?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.220
&lrm;[she sighs] You heard what your mom said.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.020
&lrm;She won't know if I hide it.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.180
&lrm;Sorry, but I have to sew her up.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.740
&lrm;Pretty please.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.860
&lrm;Please, please, not the baby-doll eyes.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.380
&lrm;[she whimpers]

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.780
&lrm;[sighing] Ok, you can borrow Lady Wi-Fi.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.980
&lrm;Can I have the Ladybug doll?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.500
&lrm;Hold on, Alec.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.620
&lrm;Hurry, Manon!

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.140
&lrm;[mother] We have to stop by the station!

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.300
&lrm;Coming, Mommy!

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
&lrm;She sure had you wrapped
&lrm;around her little finger.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.820
&lrm;What? No she...

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.100
&lrm;[she groans]

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.740
&lrm;You know, Tikki,
&lrm;I can't say no to those...

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.700
&lrm;[Tikki] Baby-doll eyes?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.860
&lrm;Just be glad no baddies have them.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.180
&lrm;You'd be rendered powerless.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.940
&lrm;[Manon] Here I am, baddy.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.300
&lrm;[pretend fighting]

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.740
&lrm;[triumphantly] I saved Paris again!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.180
&lrm;No! No fair!

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.020
&lrm;You always win!

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.860
&lrm;Sorry, Alec, it must be in the studio.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.140
&lrm;No sweat.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.820
&lrm;Can you watch Manon?

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.060
&lrm;I won't be lon...

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.620
&lrm;Where are you hiding,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.460
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.540
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.780
&lrm;This is one of Marinette's dolls.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.860
&lrm;You took it, after I specifically
&lrm;told you not to.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.660
&lrm;But, but Marinette wanted me to have it.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.900
&lrm;You disobeyed me.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.180
&lrm;I told you they were to stay there.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.940
&lrm;You won't need it anymore.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.420
&lrm;No, Mommy, please don't.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.380
&lrm;I'm not happy about this.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.260
&lrm;Wait for me here.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.620
&lrm;[frustrated sigh]

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.980
&lrm;[she huffs]

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.100
&lrm;I didn't steal that doll!

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.380
&lrm;I... want... that... doll!

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.540
&lrm;[satisfied sigh]

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.620
&lrm;What could be more pure
&lrm;than an innocent child's emotions,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.740
&lrm;especially anger?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.500
&lrm;I love it.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.940
&lrm;Fly away, evil Akuma,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.020
&lrm;and commiserate
&lrm;with this frustrated child.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.300
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.500
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.820
&lrm;[panting]

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.580
&lrm;The movie starts soon.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.300
&lrm;Or we can buy your book
&lrm;and go to the next one.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.460
&lrm;Either way.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.820
&lrm;[she gasps] Marinette, 9 o'clock.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.220
&lrm;There isn't one at 9.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.500
&lrm;Not that 9 o'clock, this 9 o'clock.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.460
&lrm;Adrien.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.260
&lrm;Come on!

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.500
&lrm;[she squeals]

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.340
&lrm;[giggling]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.740
&lrm;[Marinette] Sorry.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.180
&lrm;[fluttering]

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.860
&lrm;[sobbing]

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.900
&lrm;[evil voice] Puppeteer, I'm Hawk Moth.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.980
&lrm;From now on, you can control anyone.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.260
&lrm;Even Ladybug and Cat Noir?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.100
&lrm;Yes, as long as you possess their dolls.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.180
&lrm;And I can win?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.140
&lrm;Yes, you will be able to win.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.860
&lrm;But in return,
&lrm;you must do something for me.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.740
&lrm;Bring you their Miraculouses.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.820
&lrm;I know!

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.380
&lrm;What a smart little girl you are.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.340
&lrm;[gasping]

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.380
&lrm;Wanna play a game?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.020
&lrm;Help!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.300
&lrm;I gotta get
&lrm;those Ladybug and Cat Noir dolls.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.940
&lrm;I... want... those... dolls!

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.380
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.580
&lrm;I'm sure I left it here.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.940
&lrm;Where is it?

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.980
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.940
&lrm;Here it is.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.260
&lrm;Sorry, Alec.
&lrm;Here's the file you need.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.820
&lrm;[cackling]

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.860
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.980
&lrm;I wonder where he gets off.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.620
&lrm;Maybe he's going to the same movie.
&lrm;How cool would that be?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.820
&lrm;But wait!

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.380
&lrm;Then he might think
&lrm;we're following him, like stalkers.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.380
&lrm;Me? A stalker?
&lrm;Although I would follow him.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.580
&lrm;I wouldn't really stalk him.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.060
&lrm;[groaning] Who am I kidding?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.180
&lrm;[Alya giggles] Who are you talking to?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.660
&lrm;He's waving.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.420
&lrm;Oh no, now what are we gonna do?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.660
&lrm;Wave back.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.460
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.620
&lrm;OK, Lady Wi-Fi,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.220
&lrm;come to life!

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.060
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.500
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.380
&lrm;What's going on?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.220
&lrm;Alya!

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.300
&lrm;[lively music]

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.380
&lrm;Marinette,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.060
&lrm;gimme those Ladybug and Cat Noir dolls!

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.580
&lrm;Lady Wi-Fi?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.900
&lrm;No! I'm Puppeteer.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.100
&lrm;And I want... those... dolls, now!

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.380
&lrm;Puppeteer? The dolls?

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.940
&lrm;I don't have them, they're at home.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.140
&lrm;Why do you want them, Puppeteer?

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.220
&lrm;Because you said I could have them.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.020
&lrm;Then mommy said "No!"

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.740
&lrm;So giv'em to me now!

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.060
&lrm;Or you'll be super-duper sorry.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.900
&lrm;Manon.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.660
&lrm;I want Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.220
&lrm;To win... forever and ever.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.700
&lrm;Manon, this isn't a game!

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.460
&lrm;Excuse me, Sir.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.740
&lrm;There's a... a cat loose on the train.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.460
&lrm;What? Thanks kiddo.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.300
&lrm;[Plagg] Cat?

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.500
&lrm;Plagg, We have to transform.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.060
&lrm;Just when we'd lost your bodyguard.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.420
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.460
&lrm;What about the movie?
&lrm;The buttery popcorn!

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.780
&lrm;Tikki, I have to transform.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.020
&lrm;That was Lady Wi-Fi.
&lrm;Did she say anything?

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.780
&lrm;I'm not sure,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.740
&lrm;but... her voice belonged to
&lrm;a girl I babysit.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.060
&lrm;It's as if she was controlling my friend,
&lrm;Alya,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.460
&lrm;I mean Lady Wi-Fi, from a distance.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.820
&lrm;This is so weird.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.660
&lrm;What was all that about dolls?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.420
&lrm;I've got some dolls
&lrm;she likes to play with.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.940
&lrm;Your dolls? OK, where do you live?

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.500
&lrm;- 12, rue Gotlib.
&lrm;- I'll take care of it.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.420
&lrm;I don't like the idea of Cat Noir
&lrm;rummaging around in my room.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.220
&lrm;Just say the words.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.380
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.060
&lrm;[panting]

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.380
&lrm;[Ladybug] Hey, kitty!

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.660
&lrm;Up here!

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.340
&lrm;[panting]

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.020
&lrm;[Ladybug] Puppeteer! Such a shame.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.100
&lrm;It's really not nice to steal
&lrm;from your babysitter.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.060
&lrm;Breaking and entering are grounds
&lrm;for a time out.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.020
&lrm;I'll get your Miraculouses,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.740
&lrm;you goodie-two-shoeses.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.220
&lrm;There's only one goodie-two-shoes here,

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.780
&lrm;and I'm not her.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.060
&lrm;Freeze!

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.700
&lrm;Remember how
&lrm;we defeated her last time?

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.220
&lrm;Take out the Wi-Fi.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.460
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Gotcha.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.700
&lrm;[she yells]

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.900
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Nice move, Puppeteer.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.380
&lrm;Good girl.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.540
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Now take her Miraculous!

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.460
&lrm;Cataclysm!

&lrm;[she gasps and groans]

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.060
&lrm;Looks like you've lost your signal, Wi-Fi

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.060
&lrm;Where's the Akuma?

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.740
&lrm;I want those dolls, Lady Wi-Fi!

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.140

&lrm;[she groans]

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.420
&lrm;- Did you get her Akuma?
&lrm;- She didn't have one.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.300
&lrm;How come?

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.500
&lrm;She's controlled by Puppeteer,
&lrm;she must have it.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.780
&lrm;Right. Lady Wi-Fi's just a puppet.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.900
&lrm;Tell me you got my doll.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.540
&lrm;Sorry... only this one.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.020
&lrm;We better find her
&lrm;before she takes control of me.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.540
&lrm;Your ring.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.180
&lrm;You're about to turn back.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.500
&lrm;Don't let her make me her puppet.
&lrm;I like to be in command.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.620
&lrm;You mean second in command.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.940
&lrm;Call me when you're back in business.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.220
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.460
&lrm;Yes? What? Ladybug?

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.620
&lrm;Where are you?

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.180
&lrm;At the TV station.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.420
&lrm;Is Manon there?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.140
&lrm;Yes, she's playing downstairs.

&lrm;Yes, just don't move.
&lrm;I'll be right there.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.300
&lrm;I'm gonna use these dolls
&lrm;to beat Ladybug fair and square.

&lrm;[Plagg] What? I'm savouring my cheese.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.340
&lrm;Can you savour it faster?

&lrm;She's still here.

&lrm;I need you all outside.

&lrm;No, I want to find my daughter.

&lrm;I'll bring her back, Mrs. Chamack.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.460
&lrm;It'll help me more if I know you're safe.

&lrm;I'm OK. I'm not a puppet.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.100
&lrm;Let's find the Akuma
&lrm;before that changes.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.180
&lrm;Sorry.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.860

&lrm;Cat Noir, no!

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.620
&lrm;Use Cat Noir to seize Ladybug's doll.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.260
&lrm;Then you'll have won everything
&lrm;and Ladybug will be defeated.

&lrm;Not so fast, rug rat.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.940
&lrm;The Akuma must be in there.

&lrm;One against five.
&lrm;That's not very fair and square.

&lrm;This is the moment I've been waiting for.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.260
&lrm;Your time is up, Ladybug.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.100
&lrm;You're doomed!

&lrm;Is this what you want? Say pretty please.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.740
&lrm;The doll. She got away with it.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.100
&lrm;[child screams]

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.700
&lrm;I'll get you Ladybug.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.620
&lrm;You'll be super-duper sorry.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.380
&lrm;Now you're alone...

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.540
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.260
&lrm;Where is she?

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.140
&lrm;Now I'm the winner.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.180
&lrm;Drop that doll, Manon!

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.020
&lrm;I'm not Manon, I'm Puppeteer.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.060
&lrm;Luck charm!

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.940
&lrm;A power strip?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.060
&lrm;[Puppeteer] You've lost, Ladybug!

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.020
&lrm;There may be 4 of you,
&lrm;but I'm twice as dangerous.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.860
&lrm;[he roars]

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.780
&lrm;[he yells]

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.540
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.020
&lrm;[Rogercop groans]

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.460
&lrm;Ladybug...

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.300
&lrm;Freeze!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.380
&lrm;Come to li...

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.740
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.500
&lrm;[whistling]

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.340
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.100
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.380
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.540
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.820
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.220
&lrm;[gasps]

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.020
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.340
&lrm;What happened?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.260
&lrm;You were a puppet
&lrm;but you didn't do anything foolish.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.980
&lrm;Good, and Ladybug,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.140
&lrm;FYI, you can pull
&lrm;my heart strings any day.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.540
&lrm;I liked you better
&lrm;when you sounded like a 5-year-old.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.140
&lrm;[angrily] No!

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.780
&lrm;This cannot be happening!

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.380
&lrm;[he groans angrily]

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.300
&lrm;[gasping] Manon!

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.780
&lrm;[giggling]

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.860
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug. Thank you.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.140
&lrm;It's time I bug out.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.780
&lrm;[Marinette] I'm sorry about what happened,
&lrm;Mrs. Chamack.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.420
&lrm;I shouldn't have given her
&lrm;the doll after you said no.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.740
&lrm;Manon can be pretty persuasive.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.260
&lrm;Yeah, with her...

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.180
&lrm;Baby-doll eyes? Yes, I know.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.340
&lrm;See you later, then. Kiss, Manon.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.020
&lrm;[chuckling]

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.380
&lrm;Bye, mommy.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.500
&lrm;See you later, Mrs. Chamack.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.860
&lrm;Bye-bye.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.820
&lrm;I wanna play with Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.500
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.580
&lrm;I've a better idea.
&lrm;Why don't we go to the zoo?

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.780
&lrm;But I want to play with the dolls.
&lrm;Pretty please.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.700
&lrm;Don't even try it, Manon.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.540
&lrm;I love the zoo.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.940
&lrm;I'm ready.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.340
