1
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,919
Try Oishi Honey Lemon.

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,599
Made with Hyakka Mitsu honey.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,320
You've solved this before.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,039
Find the solution of the equation.

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,120
- How?
- How do you solve this?

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,879
I taught you before.

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,039
I don't remember.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,079
This is the formula we used before.

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,440
Remember?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,000
Find mol 2 times 6.757

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,359
and divided by 1 mol.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,679
How?

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,600
This is the formula we used before.

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,799
See?

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,439
Find mol 2 times 6.757

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,719
and divided by 1 mol.

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,759
Then you get the result.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
This is the answer.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
Now it's your turn to solve it.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
What?

21
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,520
Come on. It's your turn.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,920
I can't do it.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,359
Don't write nonsense.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,040
Mm.

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,519
- Mm.
- How's that?

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,519
- Is it correct?
- No.

27
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,120
Come on. Focus.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,599
- What?
- Focus.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,280
The result is probably

30
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,239
two...

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll do it.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,599
Oh.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I'll do it for you.

34
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,840
Thanks.

35
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,240
Do this part in the meantime.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,159
- Okay.
- I'll find some math problems for you.

37
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,759
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,240
That's right.

39
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,680
We have to study this next.

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,240
Why is there so much to study?

41
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,199
Why is there so much?

42
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,439
- Well. Who told you to be stupid.
- Oh.

43
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,439
I've got to get you good at this.

44
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,919
Is it so wrong to be born stupid?

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes, it's wrong.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,199
- You want to study engineering, right?
- What?

47
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,759
- Give me a second.
- Sure.

48
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,599
Come here, Mom. I'll give you a massage.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,759
Thank you.

50
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,560
- How does that feel?
- Good.

51
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,479
(Patient Room 1206,
Utumpon Noppanaradon)

52
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,759
The patient's condition is stable.

53
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,360
Her blood pressure is normal.

54
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,479
Okay.

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,919
Are there any complications?

56
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,280
We haven't found any complications.

57
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,360
When is her next check-up?

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,080
In the afternoon

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,759
you will be informed by a nurse.

60
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,599
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

61
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,479
- I'll leave now.
- Okay.

62
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,479
How are you doing?

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm good.

64
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
Good. We're almost there.

65
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,840
- I'm getting better.
- You'll get better in no time.

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
You'll be out and about soon.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,639
All right. I'll repeat it to you.

68
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,439
The rules for solving
one-variable linear inequalities.

69
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,519
First,

70
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,639
move the variable to one side.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,279
Second, get rid of the brackets, if any.

72
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,279
Third, get rid of the fractions, if any,

73
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,680
by multiplying by the
least common multiple.

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
- All right.
- But be careful

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
when multiplying or dividing
with negative numbers,

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
you must reverse the direction
of the inequality symbol.

77
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,199
For example, switch greater than sign
to less than sign.

78
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,319
- All right.
- Okay.

79
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,800
Now that you got it.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,730
Try to solve this one.

81
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,360
Here.

82
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,680
It's correct.

83
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,720
- Are you serious?
- I am.

84
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,839
- For real?
- Yes.

85
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,560
Good job. You did a good job.

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm telling you. My brain is good.

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm happy for you.

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,720
Hi, Mom.

89
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm tutoring my friend.

90
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I know that tutoring your friend
also helps you review your lessons.

91
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,240
But you have to prepare for
medical entrance exam too.

92
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
All right.

93
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,920
I will manage my time accordingly.

94
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,240
Well. Mom,

95
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,680
- my friend's mother has...
- I know.

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Don't worry about your friend's mother.

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Our hospital takes good care
of all its patients.

98
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,399

My mom wanted me to give this to you.

And she wants you

118
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
to tutor me tomorrow.

119
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,120
Got it?

120
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,080
Itt has a tutoring session with Pai.

121
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,639
I guess he can't make it.

122
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,080
Then we're short of a player
and can't play the game.

123
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,240
Hey. Why don't we ask Waan to join us?

124
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,080
We can play three-on-three.

125
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,240
No. He's awful.

126
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,799
Besides, he's in Bishop Club.
I don't like him.

127
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,200
Waan!

128
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,000
Me?

129
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,639
Yes, you.

130
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,279
Come play with us.
We're one player short.

131
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,679
Waan, move.

132
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,919
Behind you, Pure.

133
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,159
Sorry.

134
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,320
Sorry, man.

135
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,159
Go!

136
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
Go for it. I'm giving it to you.

137
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,799
Yes!

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,039
Why did you suddenly ask me
to join a game?

139
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,559
You unexpectedly took
the blame for me.

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,120
So why can't I
suddenly ask you to join me?

141
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,919
But right now

142
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,879
it's time for you to leave.

143
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,080
What's up with you?

144
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,840
There is a certain jerk

145
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,320
being territorial about the club room.

146
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,919
So I had to switch to this room.

147
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,080
So,

148
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,200
8x minus 16 ninth equals 64,

149
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
x...

150
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,159
Hi, Mom.

151
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,120
You have a lot of patients to see, right?

152
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,879
Yes, it's fine. I can have dinner alone.

153
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
All right.

154
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Can I ask you something?

155
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,679
Is the hospital where my mother is staying

156
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,360
owned by your father?

157
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes.

158
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,759
And your mother is a doctor?

159
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,519
My father is one too.

160
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Man.

161
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,840
That's definitely a family business.

162
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,000
Does this mean you will be a doctor?

163
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,799
I guess so.

164
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,480
Otherwise, who will
take over the hospital?

165
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,679
You say that like you don't want to it.

166
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't know.

167
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
I still have no idea what I want to be.

168
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
But if I don't become a doctor,

169
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,799
who will look after the family business?

170
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
What about you?

171
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,200
A national athlete?

172
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,320
No.

173
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,159
I want to be an engineer.

174
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,639
You didn't expect that, did you?

175
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,799
I didn't expect it either.

176
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,559
I can't even pass a math exam.

177
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,320
How could I build a house for anyone?

178
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
You can.

179
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,080
If you set your mind to it,
you can be an engineer.

180
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,840
It's true.

181
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,879
You're not stupid
like you think you are.

182
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,399
Are you selling me dreams?

183
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,279
I'm getting my hopes up now.

184
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm Itt, a freshman
from the faculty of engineering.

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,039
Your goal is clear.

186
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,639
It's much clearer than mine.

187
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,879
I have a new goal now.

188
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,440
What is it?

189
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,240
Wonton Noodle Soup.

190
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,799
Wonton Noodle Soup?

191
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,519
Come look at this.

192
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,000
Have you seen this guy?
He's so handsome.

193
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,119
Oh yes, super handsome.

194
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,170
His facial features are perfect.
Eyebrows, eyes, nose.

195
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,960
Even his ears are handsome.

196
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,680
You're exaggerating.

197
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,319
Is there someone more handsome than me?

198
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,200
Where did you get such confidence?

199
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,319
I think that

200
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,599
you should go and see him for yourself.

201
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,650
He's over there.

202
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,200
Seriously?

203
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,440
If you don't believe us,
go check him out.

204
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,519
Let's go.

205
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,519
Stop here.

206
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,480
He's so cute.

207
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,079
He's so handsome.

208
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,440
He really is.

209
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,000
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

210
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,039
I hope not.

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,279
Is this what you call handsome?

212
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,000
He's more handsome than you.

213
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,279
So cute.

214
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,920
His friend is coming.

215
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,359
What?

216
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,079
Did you see that?

217
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,839
Oh my!

218
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,839
Maybe they're just friends?

219
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,079
What a waste.

220
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,319
You were going to have dinner alone.

221
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken you out.

222
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,319
Don't tell anyone that I brought you here.

223
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,359
Why?

224
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,759
Any stall that receives
a lot of good reviews

225
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,170
is always full of customers.

226
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,519
Everything here is delicious.

227
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,279
You'll have more that one bowl for sure.

228
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,890
I need to stop here for a second.

229
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,960
The color for that pair is off.

230
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,680
Only one of the earrings is off too.

231
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,240
Would you prefer the white gown ones?

232
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,799
You don't like it?

233
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,680
I do.

234
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,319
Then why are you being indecisive?

235
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,279
You don't seem to want to let it go.

236
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,200
He said that the color was off.

237
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,799
That doesn't matter.

238
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
What matters is if you like it or not.

239
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,799
I'll take this pair.

240
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Do you want to wear it now?

241
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,200
My ears aren't pierced.

242
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,279
Then get it done.

243
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,759
But

244
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,410
- my parents don't...
- It's just piercing your ear.

245
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,720
This is your life.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
Live it the way you want.

247
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,240
Do what you want.

248
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,170
Can you pierce my ear?

249
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,000
That's right.

250
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,720
Thank you.

251
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,039
Thank you.

252
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,759
For what?

253
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,650
For bringing me here.

254
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,559
It's really delicious.

255
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,720
Don't give a good review.

256
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
Otherwise, this place will be packed.

257
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,599
The noodles are soft.

258
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,519
The meatballs are firm.

259
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,960
Very good.

260
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,279
Here.

261
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,759
It must be seven or something.

262
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,920
Dad. Mom.

263
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
- Hello.
- Pai.

264
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,880
You finished tutoring very late today.

265
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes. I'm going to take a shower now.

266
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,640
Hold on.

267
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,920
Did you get your ear pierced?

268
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,279
Did you?

269
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Let me see.

270
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Let me see.

271
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,119
Since when?

272
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,200
Tell me.

273
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
If you don't like it,
I'll take it off.

274
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,599
It would be a waste then.

275
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,039
Pai.

276
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,640
It's not that we don't like it.

277
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,559
We just want to know why
you decided to do it all of a sudden?

278
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,039
Okay. It's already done anyway.

279
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
You look different lately.

280
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,559
If there's something on your mind,

281
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,599
you can talk to us about it.
You know that, right?

282
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,319
Okay.

283
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,759
Go take a shower.

284
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,920
Okay.

285
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,839
You don't like it?

286
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,799
I do.

287
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,319
Then why are you being indecisive?

288
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
You don't seem to want to let it go.

289
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,079
He said that the color was off.

290
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,759
That doesn't matter.

291
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
What matters is if you like it or not.

292
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,480
It's just piercing your ear.
This is your life.

293
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,079
Live it the way you want.

294
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,839
Do what you want.

295
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
I'm sorry. I want my mom to rest today.

296
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,799
That's why I asked you
to come here instead.

297
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay.

298
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,680
We can do it here.

299
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,400
It's good actually because
I have something to tell you.

300
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
What?

301
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,279
Don't tell me that you're going to
stop tutoring me.

302
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,880
You can't do that.

303
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,039
My mom is already dreaming of
me being an engineer.

304
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
By the way, the earing
looks good on you.

305
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,759
Yes.

306
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,319
Thank you for making me
more courageous.

307
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,480
Sure. You're grown up now.

308
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,920
Be courageous and do things.

309
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,799
Itt.

310
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Yes?

311
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,039
I...

312
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,720
like...

313
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,240
Itt, have you been waiting long?

314
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,319
I'm sorry for being late.

315
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,200
Not long. We've just arrived.

316
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,440
Are you Pai?

317
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,839
I've heard a lot about you.

318
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,440
Can you tutor me next time too?

319
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,400
Pai.

320
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
This is Pang, my girlfriend.

321
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
I forgot to tell you that I asked her
to come here too.

322
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,200
We're watching a movie after this.

323
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,759
Itt,

324
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,599
I already booked the tickets. Here.

325
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,839
Why did you book them already?

326
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,319
Well, I wanted honeymoon seats.

327
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,880
So that I can snuggle up to you
while I'm watching.

328
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Isn't that good?

329
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,279
- It's a good idea, right?
- Yes.

330
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,759
This movie is great.
It's very interesting.

331
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,160
Are you sure about that?
We haven't watched it yet.

332
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
- I'll send the trailer to you.
- Itt.

333
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I'll be back.

334
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,799
Okay.

335
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,200
You have to watch it.

336
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,279
Don't fall asleep.

337
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,359
Isn't it too early?

338
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,160
No, it's not. We'll go there
after you finished here.

339
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,880
How cute.

340
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,680
Look.

341
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,240
It's so nice.

342
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,440
What's wrong?

343
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
Nothing.

344
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,519
Let's hurry up. You're going to
the movies with her, aren't you?

345
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,799
Yes.

346
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,559
Try and solve this one.

347
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,480
You already had me do this one.

348
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
Then do this one.

349
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,640
What?

350
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,480
You haven't taught me this one yet.

351
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,640
I can't do it.

352
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,319
I'm sorry. I got the wrong book.

353
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Well, do this one then.

354
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,920
You can ask me if there are parts
you don't know.

355
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,759
Okay.

356
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,759
Here.

357
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,200
A11 and B11. Can you see it?

358
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,839
- Yes.
- All right.

359
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,880
Find the value.

360
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,079
Move this log

361
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,599
to this side.

362
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
Here?

363
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
What about here?

364
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,039
I don't get it.

365
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,359
That's not it.

366
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,359
Pure's been dating me first.

367
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
What matters is whom he will choose.

368
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,119
Pure.

369
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,559
- Choose me.
- Choose me, Pure. Please.

370
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,799
There you go.

371
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,079
That's what you get for being a player.

372
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,759
Gosh. Hold on.

373
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,599
- Choose me.
- Please choose me.

374
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Enough!

375
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,599
That's enough.

376
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,720
I never said I would choose anyone of you.

377
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,519
I see that height doesn't matter
when you're lying down.

378
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,359
Being too handsome is problematic.

379
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,079
Pure, you jerk.

380
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,759
Pure!

381
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
Why are you being like that?

382
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
Like what?

383
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,759

384
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,640
Darn it.

385
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,000
Get lost.

386
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,039
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just a bit.

387
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,960
- Did you order yet?
- No.

388
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,359
- What would you like to eat then?
- And you?

389
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,039
Hello?
