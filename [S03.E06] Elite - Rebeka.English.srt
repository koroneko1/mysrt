1
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,200
-You're still in bed? Are you all right?
-Yes.

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,679
My head hurts a little...
but I'm starting to feel better.

3
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,399
-Your room looks like a pigsty.
-I'll clean it up.

4
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,960
No, come and have breakfast.
I'll send in Mirella later.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,879
-Is everything OK?
-Of course.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,359
If you're not going to try to hide it,
at least tell me the truth.

7
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm feeling great, Samuel. Is that better?

8
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,479
Is there anyone sitting here? No?

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,879
Well, there is now. Me.

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,319
It's important that you tell us
everything you saw.

11
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,800
Anything you think could be useful.

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,639
Everything. Any detail could be key.

13
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,919
I don't know any of this shit.

14
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,759
Wake up.

15
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,520
I have a question. 
One of the problems is poorly formulated.

16
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,680
Look. You can't do the ionic bonding
between sodium and chlorine

17
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,199
because sodium's atomic number
is incorrect.

18
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,560
Hey. You owe me an A.

19
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,879
I don't want a standing ovation,
but you could thank me.

20
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,039
Thank you,
but you shouldn't have risked it.

21
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,879
You're not OK.

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,800
I have an MA in interpreting
passive-aggressive behavior.

23
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,199
Look, you're crying out for help.

24
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,960
Can you tell me what's going on?

25
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,759
Guess who finally got themselves 
a big house...

26
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,639
fit for a party to celebrate
the end of finals? Who?

27
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,439
-And you'll be in charge of it all, baby.
-Why me?

28
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,279
The house is for the two of us
to enjoy this summer.

29
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,720
The sooner it feels like yours,
the better.

30
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,519
Lucky me.

31
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,759
-Are you being sarcastic?
-She's being herself, darling.

32
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Meet the worst version of Carla.

33
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,160
You should love and accept her
as she is.

34
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,639
Good luck.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,879
Call me.

36
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't know.

37
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,600
Any girl would kill to have...
everything I'm offering you,

38
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,959
and you don't seem very excited.

39
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,759
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,879
It's just that...
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,079
-I see.
-But everything is fine.

42
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,160
You worry too much.

43
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,639
What do you want?

44
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,240
Look, I won't pretend
I'm not to blame here.

45
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,600
Like that's possible.

46
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,560
Malick being into men and cheating...
is something I can't control.

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,680
But the fact that he cheated with you...
Did you consider how I'd feel?

48
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Do you have any respect for me?

49
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,959
I obviously didn't think about you
when I did it.

50
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,399
Or about Ander or anybody else.
I needed to do it, and I did it.

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,839
Fine.

52
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,000
-Fantastic.
-Yes, Nadia.

53
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I make mistakes, I trip up,
I lie, and I disappoint people.

54
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,680
Just like everyone else.

55
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,839
-Even you.
-What?

56
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,079
You haven't told Mom and Dad
Malick likes guys, have you?

57
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,360
You're not thinking about them.

58
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,120
You're thinking about New York
and yourself.

59
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,439
There you go. We all have our faults.

60
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,680
Gay, a cheater...

61
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,000
and involved with my brother.

62
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,279
What a catch!

63
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,160
God, I can't wait for this year to be over
so I can leave Las Encinas.

64
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,680
You'll achieve
whatever you put your mind to.

65
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,839
You'll get out of here for sure.
And I'll miss you so much.

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
-Don't go near her again.
-Why?

67
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,079
She's not OK! Can't you tell?

68
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,199
Easy. I'm taking care of her happiness.
I'm giving her a good price.

69
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
-Let go.
-You got Rebeka into this.

70
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,399
-You won't do it to Carla, too.
-Did they ask for your help?

71
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,120
As far as I know, those two girls
want you to stay away from them.

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
I want you out of my house this afternoon.

73
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,040
COLUMBIA PROGRAM GRANT RECIPIENT
SOON

74
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,759
YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR POOL PARTY!

75
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,839
Oh, my God.

76
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,720
Happy? Out of everyone
who didn't deserve to win...

77
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,320
you... are the only one
I'm not ashamed to lose to.

78
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,200
Well played. Congratulations.

79
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,720
Nadia!

80
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
It'll be OK. You'll see.

81
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,679
-Isn't it my job to be cheering you up?
-You had nightmares all night.

82
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't say it'll be OK. It's bad luck.

83
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll shut up.

84
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,440
My therapist said it was best
to always imagine the worst.

85
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,799
Then you see
that the worst is not that bad.

86
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,320
That was when the worst wasn't croaking,
right?

87
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah... when I got anxious about grades.

88
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,279
Oh, my God.

89
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,799
What's the worst that could happen?

90
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,000
If the doctor looks at your file,
and he says, "Almost."

91
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,399
"How wonderful, Ander.

92
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,799
All those families waiting for
an organ donor are gonna be so happy."

93
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,000
"You're cured, Ramón.
Sorry, this isn't your file."

94
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Enough now, OK?

95
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,080
Ander, the doctor will see you now.

96
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,039
It'll be OK.

97
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,919
Fuck you.

98
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,399
I don't have good news.

99
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,039
The results of your bone marrow biopsy
and the CT scan

100
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,840
are not what we were expecting.

101
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,440
The ratio of lymphoblasts
is still much higher than 30%.

102
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,360
What does that mean?

103
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,200
For the time being,
we'll have to continue with chemo

104
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,840
and increase the intensity.

105
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,279
-For how long?
-We can't determine that yet.

106
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,879
Until we get results.

107
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,360
What if we don't?

108
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,320
Let's not imagine the worst.

109
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
You decide to trash school property
on the last day of finals?

110
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,919
-Well done.
-What can they do?

111
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,879
Expel you
three days before graduation, loser.

112
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,840
I don't give a shit!

113
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,440
What?

114
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Just what you need. A good party.

115
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Among other things,
but we'll start with that...

116
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,519
-I'm not going.
-What do you mean?

117
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,240
-No excuses or anything?
-I don't need an excuse.

118
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,799
I don't owe you shit.
You and I are not friends.

119
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,840
-What are we, then?
-We were accomplices.

120
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,720
A shitty excuse for accomplices.

121
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,519
We tried to make his life hell,
and that asshole is as happy as can be.

122
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,320
I mean, he can't kick you out
just because he wants to.

123
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,559
-You can sue him. It's illegal.
-I could if I had a contract.

124
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,960
-Why did he do it?
-Roommate issues.

125
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,039
He saw us together.

126
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,399
-When?
-At the blackout party.

127
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,440
He knows I care about you.

128
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,159
-That's why he wants to hurt you.
-I don't want to live with him.

129
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
Yeah, OK. So where will you go?

130
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll think of something.
It's not my first rodeo.

131
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,320
Amazing. We turned his living room
into a drug depot,

132
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,279
and he didn't complain.
But if you sell to the chick he likes,

133
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
-he blows a fuse.
-I'm going to stop.

134
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,720
Stop what?

135
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,519
-I don't want to do this anymore.
-No way.

136
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
You didn't see him.

137
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Samuel could rat me out.
He'd screw me over for the year.

138
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,440
And for the first time ever,
I'm doing well.

139
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,159
-He won't tell.
-I hate it. I want to go to London.

140
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,279
I have really good things going on.

141
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,840
What is it that everyone sees
in Little Miss Marchioness?

142
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,639
She's a viper.
If she bit her own tongue, she'd die.

143
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
Fuck.

144
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,360
But somehow, she has everyone
eating out of the palm of her damn hand.

145
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,799
But suckers like me...

146
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,000
all we get is a slap in the face.

147
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,440
It's not happening.

148
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,639
We're not closing the business.
We're going all out.

149
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,679
More than ever. 

150
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,960
We'll make a killing
at Yeray's pool party.

151
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,080
I'll pass.

152
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,039
Don't you need money to go to London?

153
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,080
Leave me alone.

154
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,440
What happened isn't Valerio's fault.

155
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,639
He shouldn't pay for what I did.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,360
Let him live at your house
until he finds someplace else.

157
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,559
And why would I?

158
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Because I could tell Azucena
you almost smashed a student's face in.

159
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,320
You'd get expelled

160
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,879
and have to repeat the grade.
How would you like that?

161
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,399
Then I'd tell her
why I almost smashed his face in.

162
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,399
Because he's a fucking drug pusher
who's dealing at school.

163
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
He'd get expelled too.

164
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,480
But he'd repeat the grade
in fucking prison.

165
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,919
That's not true.

166
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,799
Didn't you know he's selling to Carla?
So, you haven't noticed

167
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,399
that she's been walking around
like a zombie for weeks?

168
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,759
I'm guessing she needs that shit
to get through the day.

169
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,519
-What the hell?
-I don't need that stuff.

170
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
My hatred for you is enough.
I have so many reasons to hate you.

171
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,759
One of them is you'll be leaving

172
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,080
without giving a shit
about all the pain you've caused.

173
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,559
Get out of here.

174
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,759
I'm off. I'm meeting up with Yeray.

175
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,159
-Is everything all right?
-Just perfect.

176
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

177
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,240
I'm very proud of you.
Of how your attitude's improved,

178
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,120
how you're listening to us,
and how you've grown up.

179
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
You're a woman now.

180
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,360
No, a lady.

181
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,720
A marchioness.

182
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,240
Gorgeous.

183
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,799
Have fun.

184
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Fuck, you're so annoying.
Drop it already, please!

185
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,600
Just say...

186
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,720
"Mom, I haven't quit the business
because I like living the good life,

187
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,840
and I shouldn't have trusted Samuel."
Say it, and I'll shut up.

188
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
See how easy it is? That's better.

189
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,440
Anyway, so tell me,
what did you do with him?

190
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,279
What do you think? I got rid of him.

191
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,039
What?

192
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,639
I broke up with him, Mom.
I'm not like you.

193
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
OK, babe. With that attitude of yours

194
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,320
and your willingness
to take over the business...

195
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,159
you're actually becoming a bit like me.

196
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,360
You were right after all.
I'm turning into her.

197
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
I need her to send someone to scare Polo.

198
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,440
-Excuse me?
-Scare the living shit out of him.

199
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,960
Literally scare him to death.

200
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,440
-Rebeka!
-I said no.

201
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,360
Do I need to spell it out for you?
I'm never going to send anyone

202
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,120
-to scare Polo.
-But your mom took care of that kid.

203
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,639
I'm not like my mom.

204
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,000
Get that through your fucking head!

205
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,960
Hey, baby, we're back!
Come in, you've already been here.

206
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,559
Let's see what room we put you in.
There are so many.

207
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
If you show me the way,
I'll leave a trail of breadcrumbs

208
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,440
so I can find my way to your room
and... have some fun.

209
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, you look so handsome.

210
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,799
Did you talk to them?

211
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,960
-Did they say no?
-I wanted to talk to Valerio first.

212
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,839
How did you get the tuition money?

213
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,200
-I told you.
-I know what you told us.

214
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,119
But now I'd like to hear the truth.

215
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,039
It's no big deal.

216
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,880
Is that why you didn't tell us?

217
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,720
-Tell us what?
-He's a fucking dealer.

218
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,799
It's a temporary thing.
But yes, that's how I'm making a living.

219
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
Dealing drugs?

220
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
-Yes.
-And you're selling to Carla?

221
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Her money's as good as anyone else's.
Why?

222
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,119
She's not just anyone! She's Carla!

223
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,480
She's never taken drugs.

224
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,599
She's afraid of getting hooked.
That's just the way she is.

225
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,680
She gets hooked on a perfume,
a purse, or a boy, and can't let go.

226
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,079
People change, Polo.

227
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,680
It's been a long time
since you were with Carla.

228
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,359
-You have no idea what she's like.
-Guys, stop.

229
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,799
She or any of your buyers.

230
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
You don't know if they can handle it,
because you don't care.

231
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,079
You can save
your moral superiority speech.

232
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,680
You think you're better than me?

233
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,240
You're right. 
I'm no better than you. I'm worse.

234
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,319
I'm probably worse.

235
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,079
The fraudster,
the murderer, and the dealer.

236
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,759
Sounds like a joke, 
but it's not fucking funny!

237
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
-What’s wrong with you?
-What's wrong?

238
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,720
I just woke up, Cayetana,

239
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,759
and I don't like what I see
one fucking bit!

240
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,119
Get out.

241
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,640
Both of you, out.

242
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,680
Leave me alone.

243
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,720
Shush.

244
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,319
MALICK: HOW DID IT GO?

245
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,920
I have to go to work.

246
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,720
There.

247
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,720
They mentioned a "rust effect"
or something like that.

248
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,680
No idea. But I paid a premium for it
like Cristiano Ronaldo.

249
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,079
The house looks great.

250
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,160
Oh, God.

251
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Does this mean that you like it?

252
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,359
It means that I want to get
in the pool right now, with you.

253
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,559
Come.

254
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,799
Now?

255
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,440
Yes.

256
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,000
Undress now,
or I'll pull you in fully clothed.

257
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,119
It's so nice.

258
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,839
It's a saltwater pool,
but I don't think it's really all that.

259
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
-Don't you like that I'm enjoying it?
-Yes.

260
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,359
I love it.

261
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,160
We’re going to throw an epic party.

262
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,519
It's like being in jail,
about to finish serving your sentence,

263
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,359
and when the day comes... Boom!

264
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,039
They say no.

265
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,200
That you're going to remain behind bars
for maybe a month, a year, ten years...

266
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,720
or forever.

267
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,720
-You aren't in prison.
-What?

268
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,160
You can leave whenever you want.

269
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
-What are you talking about?
-You can leave him, Omar.

270
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,759
I can't do that.

271
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,039
-You can't or you don't dare?
-Are you lecturing me about bravery?

272
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
QUR'AN

273
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,440
-Thank you.
-In the name of Allah.

274
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,359
One of my daughters at university,
in America...

275
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,759
What's going on?

276
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,279
-Malick and I were thinking...
-Malick and you?

277
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,400
Listen to him.

278
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,400
Malick and I think it would be best 
if you went to America...

279
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,880
engaged to be married.

280
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,480
Did you know what these two were planning?

281
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,559
You want that, right?

282
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,960
Just a second. Come.

283
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,519
-Was this your idea?
-No.

284
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,119
It was your father's suggestion.
It'd be good for us.

285
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
Your family will leave you alone.

286
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,640
And I'll give my family what they expect,
at least on the surface.

287
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,519
If I get married now,
I'm guaranteed my freedom forever.

288
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,000
-It's a mere formality.
-No, it isn't.

289
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,039
You've seen my parents.

290
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,240
For us,
it's a serious lifelong commitment.

291
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,680
-Do you really not care about anything?
-It's not that.

292
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,680
I just put my own happiness first.

293
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,119
And you should do the same.

294
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
Do you think your parents
have your best interests in mind?

295
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,680
No. They're thinking
about their happiness, their honor,

296
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,839
what people will say.

297
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,519
Wake up.

298
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,480
Either we keep pretending...
or you can forget about New York.

299
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,759
I don't need a pep talk to cheer me up.

300
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,640
I didn't call you here to cheer you up.
Nadia turned down the scholarship.

301
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,200
She says she won't change her mind.
And since you came in second...

302
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,079
Nadia.

303
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,799
You're nuts if you think
I'll settle for your scraps.

304
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
I don't want to live a lie, Lu.

305
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,880
So you don't want to live a lie?
Well, grow some fucking ovaries

306
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,720
and tell your father you're accepting
and going alone.

307
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Because you don't need a man
or anyone else, Nadia.

308
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,920
Be the woman who managed to beat me.
The one that I admire, damn it!

309
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,039
The one I can't stand.

310
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,599
I meant, "the one I can't stand."
Because I can't stand you.

311
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,759
OK?

312
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,519
People are staring.

313
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,400
Hey, guys, gals, and everyone else.

314
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
No more suffering.

315
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,160
The exams are over! 

316
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,119
No more uniforms!

317
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,960
Fuck.

318
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,240
People are going wild.

319
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,759
Really? That's great.

320
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,160
-Are you coming?
-In a minute.

321
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,359
Let me help you.

322
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,599
-You don't need to do this.
-Get this end.

323
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,319
You'll be better off downstairs.

324
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,799
Omar and I will take turns sleeping
with you in case you need anything.

325
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,799
COMING TO THE PARTY? I WANT TO SEE YOU.
IT'LL BE NICE TO GET OUT OF PRISON.

326
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,480
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK, OMAR.
YOU CAN LEAVE HIM.

327
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,880
-What do you want?
-I want to drag you to that party.

328
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,319
No fucking way.
I have nothing to celebrate.

329
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,880
Finals are over,
and we're alive. Is that not enough?

330
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,039
Ander is sick. Really sick.

331
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,480
Chemo could kill him before cancer.

332
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,160
-You forgave Polo because of Ander?
-I didn't forgive him.

333
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,039
-You've gotten over it.
-Never.

334
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,680
Have fun at the party with him.
I'm not going.

335
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,519
Listen, Samu.
I used to think about him day and night.

336
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,279
And you know what I realized?

337
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,240
If I can't put him behind bars,
I don't want him in my fucking head.

338
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,799
He doesn't deserve to be that important.

339
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,880
Think about it.

340
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,519
What's wrong, honey?

341
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,480
Malick and I are not together.

342
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,920
What?

343
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,160
But we weren't together...
the last two years either,

344
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,920
and, as you know, I passed...

345
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
with the best grades.

346
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,440
I didn't need him... or anyone else.

347
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,119
Just me and my own hard work.
I want to go to New York.

348
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,519
No, sorry.

349
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
I am going to New York.

350
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,359
-No.
-Dad!

351
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,400
Listen to me.

352
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,039
Just this once. Please.

353
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,599
I'm not the little girl you want me to be.

354
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,160
I haven't been for a long time.

355
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,200
If only I were...

356
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,400
everything would be easier...

357
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and I would continue to believe
that you do everything to protect me.

358
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,200
And not because you are afraid
of losing me,

359
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,279
like you lost Omar... or May.

360
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
I swear to you...

361
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,680
that if I go to New York,
I will always come back.

362
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,680
You will always have me.

363
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,359
But... if you stand in my way...

364
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,119
Thank God you're here.

365
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,960
-I've run out.
-Of what?

366
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,400
-I didn't bring any with me.
-OK, fine.

367
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,200
You're here to make a killing.
Do you think I'm dumb?

368
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,359
-Drink champagne. It's better for you.
-No, thanks.

369
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,440
-OK.
-Wait.

370
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,799
What do you want? More money?

371
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,079
How much?

372
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,440
I know those cravings well.
I'm sorry, but I won't sell to you.

373
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,200
I should have never sold it to you.

374
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Carla. Carla, darling.

375
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,039
Today is your lucky day.

376
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,000
-Is it?
-Yes.

377
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Two grams for 90. Just for you.

378
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,160
In the palm of your hand,
just like everyone here.

379
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,480
-The offer ends in ten, nine, eight...
-I thought you didn't deal.

380
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,720
Don't think so much, honey.

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,119
There you go. Enjoy.

382
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Carla, what are you doing?

383
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,960
What's that?

384
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,559
Molly. Want some?

385
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,359
-Now you're doing Molly?
-Didn't you want to live large?

386
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,920
This is the full experience.

387
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,960
Full experience?
Don't treat me like an idiot.

388
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,680
I know how that makes you feel.
It's great until you come down.

389
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,839
You get depressed.
It takes you ages to be yourself again.

390
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,119
You sound like a Health Department PSA.

391
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,480
I get enough of that from my father.

392
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
You should listen to me.

393
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,599
-Come on, you'll get totally loved up.
-What? Loved--

394
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,440
Sorry.

395
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,359
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
Don't ruin my party, please.

397
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,640
All I wanted was to be
the coolest girlfriend.

398
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,599
Isn't that what you wanted?

399
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,000
So, Lu, how is your first day
as a loser going?

400
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,240
Fucking awesome. I'm actually doing great.

401
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,119
I don't need that scholarship.

402
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,519
I mean, I only applied for it out of...

403
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,920
Well, for the competition. And my résumé.

404
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,920
I can go to any university I want.

405
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,840
And my father will pay for it.
Thanks, I'll order another one soon.

406
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,599
Why is that your fifth gin and tonic?

407
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,559
Are you trying to forget
how little you care about losing?

408
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,920
Cheers.

409
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,679
Yeah, sure. Cheers.

410
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,400
Hi.

411
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,679
-Nadia!
-Hi.

412
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
You take the concept of the burkini
to the next level.

413
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm in a hurry, Lu.

414
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,480
I need you to sign this so I can take it
to the school office before it's closed.

415
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,119
What is it?

416
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,000
Azucena will let us share the scholarship.

417
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,119
But the budget remains the same.

418
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,400
So we will each have to get by with half
the money for food, accommodation...

419
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
I'm used to scraping by, but you...

420
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,679
Do you think I'm going
to let you laugh in my face?

421
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,280
Come on, stop being so you and sign it.

422
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:28,960
Thank you.

423
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,880
My pleasure.

424
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,760
People are staring.

425
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,880
Nadia.

426
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,320
I've dreamt so many times
about running away with you.

427
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,920
And now you're going with some other guy.
And with Lu.

428
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,800
-I'm not going with Malick.
-Seriously?

429
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,480
You're not together?

430
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,159
-Where does that leave us?
-You're here, and I'm leaving.

431
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,800
Can I give you a hug?

432
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,639
Sure.

433
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,800
-You're late.
-Are you leaving already?

434
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,360
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

435
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,920
You look like you could use a drink.
A drink and a buddy.

436
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah. Let's go.

437
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,679
Tell me you're not angry.
Tell me you're as happy as I am.

438
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,360
Holy shit, Yeray.

439
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,440
I wish you could feel
what I'm feeling right now.

440
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,920
It's as if electricity was flowing 
through every cell in my body.

441
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Let's take a selfie. You like that.

442
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,840
Fuck, what a long face.

443
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,480
Another one. Smile.

444
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,639
I don't need chemicals to be happy.

445
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,480
You are enough for me.
Shame you can't say the same.

446
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,280
Come on... it doesn't matter.

447
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,119
Some of us need a bit of help 
to let our hair down.

448
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,559
What's wrong with that?

449
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,280
Your life is perfect.
I don't get why you need to take anything.

450
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,719
Oh, darling...
You're kind of a pain in the ass.

451
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,679
Maybe I need to get high
just to put up with you.

452
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,480
With me?

453
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,239
Yes, you, your scheduled life,
and the five-year sentence I'll be serving

454
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,840
because of that contract
you're signing with my father.

455
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,960
But I accept that you're locking me up
in this palace with a pool.

456
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,639
That contract is just business.
It has nothing to do with you and me.

457
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,519
Each plan you make with me
feels like another nail in my coffin.

458
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,679
Malick.

459
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,119
We need to talk.

460
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,880
OK. Let me dry off a little.

461
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,639
No, it has to be now.

462
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Do you love him?

463
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,519
How many times have you fucked?

464
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,440
Once.

465
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,239
Three. Or four.
It depends on what counts as fucking.

466
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,000
Was it just sex?

467
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,960
No, it's not just sex.

468
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you in love with him?

469
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,360
I don't know.

470
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,760
-You are or you aren't.
-I don't know what being in love is.

471
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,400
I just know I'm crazy about him.

472
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,960
And how does he feel about you?

473
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,000
Good, I suppose.

474
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Because being at your place,
by your side...

475
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,639
it's hard.

476
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
Don't tell him about this, OK?

477
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,880
The only swimsuit I have
with no holes in it is here.

478
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,159
OK. You forgot how to sew?

479
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,119
Don't do this to me, Polo.

480
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:49,960
Don't do this.

481
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,639
We have a good thing here.

482
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
Something worthwhile.

483
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,280
Are we really going to throw it all away?

484
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,280
Just like that?

485
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,840
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

487
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,480
-My problem is with Valerio.
-What he did was wrong, OK?

488
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,320
Whatever happened
to "everyone deserves a second chance"?

489
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,719
Where the fuck were you?

490
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
You could at least reply
to my fucking messages.

491
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,079
We need to talk.

492
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,119
So?

493
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,559
I've been seeing Alexis.

494
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,239
I'm with him. I have been for a while.

495
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,079
What?

496
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,280
I should have told you weeks ago.

497
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,039
But with the tests and all that...

498
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,639
Now it doesn't matter.

499
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,519
Omar, I don't have time to waste.
I want to end this.

500
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,480
Are you kidding me?

501
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,599
He gets me.

502
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,760
We speak the same language.
The fucking language of cancer.

503
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,960
And you don't.

504
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
No. It's not true. No way.

505
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,119
Why do you think I told you
to hook up with other guys?

506
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,280
I felt guilty about cheating on you.

507
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,440
So, you do fuck him?

508
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,920
Cheating is not just about fucking.

509
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,239
It's about wanting to be with him
and talk to him...

510
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,719
I'm sorry.

511
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,400
So what do I do now?

512
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,719
I don't know.

513
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm not going to lie to you.
The sooner you go, the better.

514
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,079
Samuel will let you stay at his place,
right?

515
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,840
We can talk about it tomorrow. I'm tired.

516
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,639
So, that's it?

517
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,360
You son of a bitch.

518
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,360
-Have you seen Valerio?
-I haven't seen him in a while.

519
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,079
Shit.

520
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:35,760
Help! Grab her, please!

521
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,559
Grab her. Get her out!

522
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,480
Carla!

523
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,960
Carla!

524
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,079
Hey, Carla!
Carla, hey! Call a fucking ambulance!

525
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,519
Hey! Call an ambulance!

526
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,159
Carla!

527
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,000
Hi, hey... We need an amb--

528
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,039
Rebeka, wake up!

529
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:14,679
-Law? Really?
-I want to be a lawyer.

530
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,280
Make sure no more assholes
get off the hook.

531
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,400
Become a judge, then you'll make sure.

532
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,599
-What about you?
-Business.

533
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,880
But putting assholes in jail
sounds pretty good too.

534
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,800
-I could do a dual degree.
-I'd like to have a friend in class.

535
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,440
I'm not going to a public school.

536
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,400
-A few nights out, and I'll convince you.
-No fucking way.

537
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,519
Good morning, my narco queen.

538
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,519
Here's what's left. I'm done, OK?

539
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,039
I'm done too.

540
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,719
Flush it down the toilet,
I want nothing to do with this shit.

541
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,679
-Easy. What's going on with you?
-What did you give Carla?

542
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:56,360
-What the fuck did you give her?
-Let go of him. He didn't do it!

543
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,159
-OK? No!
-Samu!

544
00:46:58,239 --> 00:46:59,639
Stop! Calm down!

545
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,280
Samu, stop!

546
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,239
Samuel, fucking stop it!

547
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,440
Samu! Guzmán, grab him!

548
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,000
Fuck.

549
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,840
I know you hated Polo.

550
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,559
Yes, ma'am.

551
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,079
But I'm sure you know
I wasn't the only one.

552
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,599
But I can tell you that...

553
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:44,920
I saw who went in the restroom
after him.

554
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,679
It was Samu.

555
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,800
