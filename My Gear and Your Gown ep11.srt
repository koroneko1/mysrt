5
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,160
Pure...

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,520
Is it okay if I don't allow you
to pursue Beau anymore?

8
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,440
I mean,
I don't want us vying for the same girl.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm serious about this one.

10
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,770
Even if I don't get her,

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,641
I don't want to see her
being jerked around.

12
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,561
Besides,

13
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:23,921
you seem more serious about Folk.

14
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,320
I don't want her to get hurt.

15
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,201
I thought you'd never say it.

16
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,641
What?

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,960
-I don't like Beau that way.
-Oh...

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,721
I only wanted to give you a push.

19
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,520
-A push?
-Yes.

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, man!

21
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,281
I was so stressed.

22
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,400
Man.

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
Wasn't it worth it?

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,800
At least it made you realize
that there's someone out there...

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
who can make you break your own rules.

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,600
Then who is it...

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,361
that makes you break your own rules?

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,921
That hurts!

29
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:25,361
Why don't you worry about yourself
before minding people's business?

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,280
You will see.

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,921
Although I start out slow,

32
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,321
I'm going to outpace you.

33
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,611
Bring it on.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,400
-Just wait until my arm feels better.
-All right.

35
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,921
Waan, it's me. How are you doing?

36
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,720
Give it your best shot.

37
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:02,881
The coast is clear.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll get going.

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
-Later.
-Later.

40
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,321

Folk!

64

Are you not mad at me anymore?

65
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,141
Wake up already.

66
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,702
You have a class this morning.

Folk.

68
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,360
I...

69
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,561
Pure.

70
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,720
Pure?

71
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,960
I should leave soon.
My boyfriend is calling.

72
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,520
Let's exchange numbers,
so we can meet up again.

73
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,561
What time is it?

74
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:00,321
It's a little past seven.

75
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,400
Where are you rushing off to?

76
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,981
Wait. Hold on.

77
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,352
I want to apologize.

78
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,960
I didn't do that to you
because Pure told me to.

79
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,600
He's been different lately.

80
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,081
He doesn't go out much.

81
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,640
He doesn't take anyone home.

82
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,041
He doesn't even text me back.

83
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,801
So I assumed...

84
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,411
that you're his boy.

85
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,600
I didn't know...

86
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,120
that he was serious...

87
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,291
about you.

88
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,201
That's all I wanted to say.

89
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,171
Bye.

90
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
Be gentle.

91
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
Are you sure you're a doctor?

92
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm a dentist.

93
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,120
Why does it hurt now?

94
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,720
Didn't it hurt when you got into a fight?

95
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
It did hurt.

96
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
But it was more painful somewhere else.

97
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,291
Where was that?

98
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,960
Why didn't you answer my calls...

99
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,801
or read any of my texts?

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,441
No matter how many fights you get in,

101
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,720
even if you don't hand me off to anyone,

102
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
I don't want to be your sex buddy anymore.

103
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,161
I don't want to be that either.

104
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,921
Then...

105
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,640
let's go back to being friends.

106
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,880
No, not that.

107
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,521
What I mean is...

108
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,480
let's not be just friends.

109
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,240
But...

110
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,401
let's go out.

111
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,520
-Right.
-Ow!

112
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,740
Do you get rough when you're embarrassed?

113
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,041
I was just reminding you.

114
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,640
Would someone like you
be serious with me?

115
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,001
I did ask myself that when I was sober...

116
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,281
and when I wasn't.

117
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,041
I want you.

118
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Who did you sleep with last night?

119
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,281
I can smell their perfume.

120
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,201
Well...

121
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,960
I...

122
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,281
I'm sorry.

123
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,861
But from now on, I won't do it again.

124
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:30,941
I promise.

125
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't believe you.

126
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,640
Folk.

127
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,441
But I'll give you a chance.

128
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
I just came to realize...

129
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,760
that my life without you is awful.

130
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,360
If we are to start over...

131
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:04,880
can you promise me...

132
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,760
that I'll be your only one?

133
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,720
I promise.

134
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,120
You've been gone for days.

135
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,720
I figured you were sick,
so I brought you some congee.

136
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,601
Thanks.

137
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,581
It's all right.

138
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,141
You've helped me out a lot.

139
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,921
You don't need to refer to yourself
as Mr. 950 anymore.

140
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,841
Mr. 950?

141
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:59,201
Yes. Mr. 950

142
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,061
You sent me a lot of stuff.

143
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,421
Wasn't that you?

144
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
It's your room number after all.

145
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,640
It's not his room number.

146
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,561
It's the club room number.

147
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,401
(Bishop Club 950)

148
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,360
It's not Room 1061 anymore.

149
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,201
No, it isn't.

150
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:38,001
Remember the school's decision
to turn it into a recreation building?

151
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,321
When you had to share the club room?

152
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,121
When the construction is finished,
they assigned each room a new number.

153
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,501
This is the result.

154
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,860
Oh.

155
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,840
Well, does anyone else know?

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,081
Of course.

157
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,960
People who came back know about it.
It isn't a secret.

158
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,921
Well, did someone come back?

159
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,001
Sure.

160
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:02,561
It was Ittikorn.

161
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:05,841
He also asked me where you got admitted.

162
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,201
Did you see him yet?

163
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,401
I did.

164
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:13,880
That's good.

165
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,721
I thought the two of you were in a fight.

166
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:20,600
He asked me where you got admitted
and asked Witsanu to be his tutor.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,161
They looked so...

168
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,101
Well, it's Witsanu.

169
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,061
Anyway, how is it going
after meeting up with him?

170
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,840
Do you mean Witsanu?

171
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,561
-Wow.
-Sweet?

172
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
Salty.

173
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,800
You're kidding.
This is an import. It should taste sweet.

174
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,921
I'm just kidding.

175
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Beau...

176
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,640
just agree to be my girlfriend.

177
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,241
You're asking me that
when we just started dating?

178
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,641
Take it easy.

179
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,921
But I've had a crush on you
for a long time.

180
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,960
You should've told me sooner
if you know you couldn't wait.

181
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
That sounds so familiar.

182
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:06,601
It reminds me of someone.

183
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:07,840
Waan, I need to talk...

184
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm sorry.

185
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,121
I didn't know you're here.

186
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,680
Oh, it's fine.

187
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,000
-I should leave.
-Wait.

188
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,681
We're dating.

189
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,041
I don't keep secrets from you.

190
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,201
And that includes my friend.

191
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,120
Wait.

192
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,161
-Are you and Beau...?
-That's right.

193
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,640
We're dating.

194
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,480
Just like she told me,

195
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,621
in some cases,

196
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,780
if you don't tell it, people won't know.

197
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,041
And it means nothing.

198
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,161
I don't know...

199
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,681
if Itt will be mad at me
for telling you this.

200
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,801
But what I know for sure...

201
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,920
is that I will be mad at myself
if I didn't tell you.

202
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,251
Pai...

203
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,641
during high school,

204
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,761
Itt was never mad at you.

205
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,680
And everything he did,

206
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,880
he didn't do it to bully you.

207
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:44,411
♪It has been long since I last saw you
Do you miss me?♪

208
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:48,440
♪It's been a long time
I wonder if you miss me at all♪

209
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,281
Get on standby, Itt.

210
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,160
Okay.

211
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,920
The rabbit turns the turtle over,

212
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
and the turtle can continue walking.

213
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,400
Finally, both of them
reach the finish line together.

214
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,731
The moral of this story is...

215
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
The moral of this story is...

216
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,621
if we accept each other's differences,

217
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,781
and we are ready
to move forward together,

218
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:51,321
it doesn't matter
how far the finish line is.

219
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,001
Wow!

220
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,621
What a touching story.

221
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:01,961
We had given him specific words
and he came up with this story.

222
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,401
The given words were Rabbit,
Turtle, and Orion.

223
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:06,661
Well done.

224
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:09,801
He gave you both knowledge
and imagination.

225
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:13,601
Please put your hands together for Folk
from the Faculty of Dentistry.

226
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,800
In order to not waste any time,

227
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,171
let's see our next talent show.

228
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:29,251
Please welcome
the Faculty of Engineering's King.

229
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:35,681
Judging from the support
from the female fans,

230
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,481
he must be a shoo-in.

231
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,821
Well, I'm not feeling well.

232
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:56,901
I have to withdraw from the contest.

233
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,062
I'm sincerely sorry.

234
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,120
Everything is okay, everyone.

235
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,961
He must have an important reason.

236
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,021
Well, I think we should continue.

237
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,261
Please welcome
the Faculty of Medicine's King.

238
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:37,320
Today, Pai will show us
how he'll solve a mathematical equation...

239
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
which is as difficult as the Olympiad's.

240
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,761
I'd like to change my show.

241
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,401
I want to sing a song for someone...

242
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,640
who's very important to me to listen to.

243
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,600
♪The rain might stay for a while♪

244
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,160
♪The clouds might stay overnight♪

245
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,880
Do you like this song?

246
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,120
Yes.

247
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:52,880
♪But it's different with you
Who stayed just for a while♪

248
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,200

249
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,040

♪Everything that happened♪

♪As if it became part of my heart♪

252
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,081
Thank you.

253
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,241
Teenagers these days
come and go really fast.

254
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,120
Maybe he needs to go to the bathroom.

255
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,281
Now it's time for us
to watch all of the Queens!

256
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,240
Itt.

257
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,521
Itt.

258
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,161
You promised me
that you'd return my earring...

259
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,680
if I won.

260
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
How could you do that...

261
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,241
if you're not staying until the end?

262
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:08,961
Is that all you want?

263
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,160
Then I'll stay.

264
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,161
All right.

265
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,840
The final question for Pai is...

266
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,560
This is an interesting question.

267
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,180
What does the word promise mean to you?

268
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,761
The word promise...

269
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,041
used to mean nothing to me.

270
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,720
But now, I realize that...

271
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,640
promises are all about trust.

272
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,840
They give us motivation.

273
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,241
They inspire us.

274
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,281
It doesn't matter where you stand.

275
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,321
You have to keep your side of the promise.

276
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,440
What an excellent answer.

277
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,681
Like a singer once sang,
"A promise must be kept."

278
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,881
For anyone who has made a promise,
just keep it, all right?

279
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,441
And for all the Kings and Queens,

280
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,560
don't forget your promises
to contribute to society.

281
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,120
Thank you very much.

282
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,441
The next step is,
we will count the scores.

283
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:43,701
While we wait,

284
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:47,061
I'd like to announce the winner
for Popular Vote.

285
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:51,241
I have the result right here in my hand.

286
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,722
Are you guys excited?

287
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,600
Yes!

288
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:56,201
All right.

289
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,681
Like we mentioned before,

290
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,161
this year's contest rules
are very special.

291
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:04,760
All of our Kings and Queens are required
to do volunteer activities.

292
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,481
They can get the votes from two ways,

293
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,080
which are the ones from the crowd...

294
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,080
and the ones from donations
to the foundations...

295
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,760
where each King or Queen represents.

296
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm going to announce the winner.

297
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,200
The foundation that received
the most donations is...

298
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:27,681
the Children's Creativity Foundation,

299
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:31,561
with Mr. Ittikorn from the Faculty
of Engineering as its representative!

300
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:46,201
Even though he withdrew himself
from the talent show round,

301
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:51,400
his popularity
made him the winner of the popular vote.

302
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,920
Congratulations!
Let's give him a big round of applause!

303
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,241
You look even more handsome with the sash.

304
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,201
Well, thank you very much...

305
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,920
for all of your votes.

306
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,401
This year's university Queen

307
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:39,241
is from...

308
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,481
the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy!

309
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't forget your duty
as a volunteer this year, okay?

310
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,061
Here comes the moment
all the ladies have been waiting for.

311
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,701
That is, who is our new university King?

312
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,961
And this year, it goes to...

313
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,200
the Faculty of...

314
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,920
Medicine!

315
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Did someone force him
to participate in the contest?

316
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:42,781
All right.

317
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:47,561
And that's it
for this year's Star Contest.

318
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,341
Congratulations to all the winners.

319
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,641
Don't be sad if you didn't win.

320
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:55,141
All of you are Kings and Queens
in our hearts.

321
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:57,340
Thank you!

322
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,880
Congratulations.

323
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,640
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

324
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,720
(Photography club)

325
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,281
Here's your earring.

326
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:41,120
Won't you let me see
what the room looks like inside?

327
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,520
Yes.

328
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,481
I did it all.

329
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,701
But what's the point?

330
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:01,022
Because you left me anyway.

331
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,561
Now I know that you love me.

332
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,440
You are Mr. 950.

333
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,560
You've been taking care of me
this whole time, haven't you?

334
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,880
I feel his pain.

335
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,001
It's okay.

336
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:42,041
Itt, what happened?

337
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,200
I got cut from a metal object.

338
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,160
Pai, how about you dress his wound?

339
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,120
You'll feel relaxed with him.

340
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
Besides, he won't cry.

341
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,400
It won't scare the kids.

342
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,120
What are those?

343
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,721
Face masks and hand sanitizer.

344
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,680
This Mr. 950 of yours
sure has a creative mind.

345
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,321
I did it because I wanted to.

346
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:09,280
I won't regret it...

347
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,760
if you leave me.

348
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,521
You can't leave
because of a misunderstanding.

349
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,141
Did I just get caught?

350
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:27,391
How embarrassing.

351
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:32,720
I feel like I'm forcing you to love me.

352
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:38,521
Do you know...

353
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,850
why this brick-colored earring
is so important to me?

354
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,840
Because it eliminated your fear
of getting your ears pierced?

355
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,961
No.

356
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,410
The earring isn't the reason.

357
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,800
It's you.

358
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,041
You were with me when I bought it.

359
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,240
And your nickname means brick.

360
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,370
It represents you.

361
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:18,481
Yes.

362
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:20,720
I love you.

363
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,481
Did you do all of this

364
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:29,280
because you feel guilty...

365
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,521
for causing a misunderstanding?

366
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,200
A gear is a symbol
of the Faculty of Engineering.

367
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,521
I bought it because I wanted to get
into university at the same time as you.

368
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,850
I changed its color to white...

369
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,280
and I've always kept it with me...

370
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,561
because Pai means the color white.

371
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:13,521
Pai,

372
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,181
even though I'm a dumb person,

373
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,301
I'm not dumb when it comes to this.

374
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,001
All along, I've never felt guilty.

375
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,001
Loving you...

376
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,280
is the smartest thing I've ever done.

377
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,960
Here.

378
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,370
What?

379
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,370
Let's exchange them.

380
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,961
I'll take your doctor gown shaped earring,

381
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,141
and you take my gear.

382
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,542
It's a promise.

383
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,481
A promise?

384
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,320
Whoever has the gear owns my heart.

385
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,160
It belongs to you now.

386
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,840
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you before.

387
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,441
This gear is a promise...

388
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
that I'll stay by your side...

389
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,280
for as long as you want me to.

390
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,720
I promise you...

391
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,410
that I'll stay with you forever.

392
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:01,680
I love you.

393
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,410
I know that.

394
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,760
And you should know...

395
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,800
that I love you too.

396
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:20,921
We're not friends anymore.

397
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,120
You're my boyfriend now.

398
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,890
Yes.

399
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:45,441
Pai!

400
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,200
Mom!

402
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,521
We want to see your success,

403
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,061
not your problems.

404
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:20,661
Itt isn't a problem.

405
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,061
He's the reason I won the contest.

406
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:26,301
Pantoon Wongworawet?

407
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,821
He's dropped out of university.

408
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,640
We should break up.

409
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,741
I won't be here
to take care of you anymore.

410
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:39,211
Please take care of yourself.
