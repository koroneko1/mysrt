‎ ‎You're so talented!

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.980
‎How long have you been playing for?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.540
‎Since I was in diapers!

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.380
‎I get the feeling
‎Marinette likes Luka a lot!

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.420
‎At least she can have
‎a conversation with him

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.820
‎without getting all bla-bla-bla-bla!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.020
‎You mean not like when she's with Adrien?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.860
‎And at least Luka gets
‎to go out whenever he wants!

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.100
‎ ‎Thank you.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580
‎-They're so cute together!
‎-So true.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.820
‎-Sure are!
‎- ‎You think?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.180
‎I agree. They seem to get along very well.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.180
‎-Adrien? Kagami?
‎-Your father let you out?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.340
‎We're officially at fencing practice.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.220
‎But... Oh, no!
‎Kagami, isn't this the wrong address?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.420
‎Oh, dear! I think you're right!

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940
‎It's a good thing Adrien's found someone
‎he can get out of the house with, at last!

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.780
‎Hi, Adrien!
‎It's cool you couldn't come alone.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.180
‎I mean, you came with someone.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.100
‎Hey, Kakamoo, uh, Kamoogi... uh, Kagami!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260
‎Nice to see you too, Marinette.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.980
‎Have you come to watch
‎your boyfriend rehearse?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.260
‎ ‎I will not be your second choice!

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700
‎But you've always been my muse. Please.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.460
‎Kagami might be onto something, you know?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.140
‎Luka? You know he's just a friend.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.100
‎You know you were my first choice!

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.340
‎You are the only one, Nanarky!

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.620
‎-Nanarky?
‎- ‎You can't fool me, pirate!

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.660
‎I bet you threw your guitarist overboard!
‎Again!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.900
‎No, I swear I didn't!

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.100
‎She sailed away from me!
‎She left me in the lurch!

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.380
‎Look how perfect we were together.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.180
‎Come back and play with me, Nanarky!

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.580
‎Jagged and our Mom?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.180
‎We're not co-captains anymore!
‎I sail alone now, skipper!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.420
‎Marinette! You're here!

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.900
‎The awesome designer
‎of these rock'n'roll shades of mine!

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.820
‎I'm sure you can help me.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.980
‎I need a guitarist! Do you play guitar?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.500
‎Me? Guitar?

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.700
‎I can play a few notes on the flute
‎but, I don't think...

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.340
‎No, wait, Jagged!
‎I know the perfect musician!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.060
‎Really? You rock, Marinette!

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.260
‎I'm sure you know Adrien Agreste.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.660
‎He's the cutest, uh, the greatest model,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.300
‎-I mean, musician in the world!
‎- ‎Huh?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.340
‎Well, I know a few chords,
‎but I'm more of a pianist, actually!

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.140
‎Uh, OK. You sure?

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220
‎How about that young dude,
‎with the awesome T-shirt?

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.140
‎Don't you think
‎he's better equipped for the job?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.740
‎Of course! You're right, Jagged!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.700
‎Luka can let Adrien borrow his guitar!

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.820
‎Can't you, Luka?

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.820
‎If you like, Marinette.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.740
‎-Put it to good use, Adrien.
‎-Uh... I'll do my best! Thanks!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.620
‎Jagged Stone! You fire me

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.980
‎and now you want to replace me with what?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.340
‎A school kid?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.700
‎Vivica? Is that you?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.620
‎There ain't no more Vivica!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.900
‎There's only Desperada now!

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.660
‎If I can't be your guitarist any more,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.860
‎I'm gonna make sure nobody can.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.620
‎Aha! You ship rat!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.300
‎I knew you were lying!

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.540
‎Vivica didn't leave you.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.740
‎You dropped her, just like you dropped me!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.540
‎What? You were thinking
‎of replacing me with her?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.140
‎Hey! I'm a much better guitarist than you!

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.820
‎And I was his first choice!

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.060
‎In that case,
‎you'll be my first choice, too!

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.380
‎I never miss a musical note.
‎Vivica always hits her targets!

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.020
‎I never should have given
‎that guitar to Adrien.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.500
‎Why did I do that?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.260
‎You have a troubled heart, Marinette.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.100
‎‎ What is happening to me?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.300
‎ ‎Tikki, spots on!

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.020
‎Not there!
‎You'd be a sitting duck in that cabin!

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.500
‎Where are you running to, wannabe?

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.340
‎Stop it, Vivica!
‎You're giving rock'n'roll a bad name!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.860
‎Jagged! No!

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.220
‎I may not play a guitar,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.540
‎but I do play the yo-yo! Care for a duet?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.620
‎Solo!

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.500
‎-We'll be safe here!
‎-Thank you, Luka!

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.460
‎ ‎Perfect, Desperada!

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.500
‎Ladybug's Miraculous are within reach!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.660
‎I always keep my end of the deal,
‎Hawk Moth!

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.060
‎Where's Cat Noir?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.740
‎He might not make it here in time!

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.660
‎Then we must help Ladybug!

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.700
‎May I?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.180
‎Another new guitarist?

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.100
‎This way. Quick!

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.260
‎You won't get away for long!

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.300
‎You shouldn't have put yourself
‎in danger like that!

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.620
‎But thank you!

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.100
‎You can count on us
‎whenever you need help!

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.740
‎I appreciate it.
‎But when there's a supervillain,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.780
‎it's best if your partner has powers.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.900
‎Speaking of which...

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.340
<i>‎
<i>‎Cat got your tongue? Leave a message!</i></i>

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.980
‎OK.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.340
‎Lucky charm!

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.060
‎A gong? What are you gonna do with that?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.020
‎I have to leave, but I'll be back soon!

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.900
‎I'll find that brat guitarist
‎sooner or later, Ladybug!

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.980
‎I can handle this!
‎Could I borrow that, please?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.060
‎You know how to play?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.020
‎Let's say I have my own personal style!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.500
‎Meanwhile, find a place to hide!

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.780
‎Both of you!

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.060
‎You can hide in here!

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.740
‎It's a bit tight for the two of us.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.980
‎I'll go in another one!

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.220
‎OK, see you later!

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.740
‎How about a nap while we wait
‎for Ladybug to come back?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.660
‎No, it's time for Cat Noir
‎to make his entrance!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.380
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.140
‎Who is torturing that poor guitar?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.540
‎That's better!

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.020
‎ ‎Marinette Dupain-Cheng,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.580
‎you must pick an ally you can trust
‎to fight alongside you on this mission.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.420
‎Once the mission is over,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.140
‎you will take the Miraculous back
‎and return it to me.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.860
‎ ‎Desperada is relentless!

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.500
‎There's no room for error with her!

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.700
‎There'll be no second chance!

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
‎Or maybe this one.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.100
‎The snake's power is a very strong one,
‎Marinette.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.540
‎Whoever uses it must be wise enough

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.140
‎not to be tempted to manipulate time
‎for their own personal gain.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.140
‎I understand, Master Fu.
‎I know just the perfect person!

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.100
‎I can't believe
‎I didn't think of him before.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.300
‎A perfect match!

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.060
‎We must stop doing this!

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.100
‎Let's take care of this guitarist
‎and her seriously bad music!

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.340
‎Er... you looking for something, milady?

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.500
‎Phew! Yeah, I have to find Adrien Agreste!

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.420
‎You want to entrust him with a Miraculous?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.340
‎You're not supposed to know, but, yeah!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.980
‎He's the perfect guy for this mission.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.500
‎You know you can trust me
‎and my incredible nose!

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.220
‎If Adrien's down here,
‎I'll find him for ya.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.380
‎Adrien's in there!

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.100
‎Your incredible nose failed you this time!

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.140
‎Cat Noir? Ladybug?
‎Have you defeated Desperada yet?

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.260
‎Oh! Where's Adrien?

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.540
‎Uh, maybe he hid somewhere else.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.860
‎Let's split up and find him.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.660
‎Hide in there for the meantime!

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.380
‎Claws in!

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.380
‎Plagg, Ladybug needs me. She needs Adrien!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.580
‎If you ask me, this whole idea
‎is worse than cheese in a can!

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.220
‎She thinks I'm the perfect guy
‎for this mission!

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.460
‎You can't be Cat Noir
‎and another superhero at the same time!

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.260
‎Which means
‎you're not the perfect guy for this!

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.580
‎-The lucky charm told her I am!
‎-That's not how it works!

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.220
‎Why am I bothering?
‎You're not even listening.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.220
‎This is my chance to get her
‎to love me as myself, Adrien!

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.740
‎I don't care what costume comes with it,
‎I have to try!

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.180
‎Ladybug chose me!

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.180
‎ ‎Adrien?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.580
‎Adrien?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.780
‎Uh... Ladybug?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.660
‎Where were you? Is everything OK?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.900
‎Yeah!
‎I was just hiding a bit further down.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.500
‎I thought it'd be better if Desperada
‎couldn't find us in the same place.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.500
‎-I need you.
‎-Me?

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.060
‎Adrien Agreste,
‎here's the Miraculous of the Snake,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.180
‎which grants the power of Second Chance.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.980
‎You will use it for the greater good.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.020
‎Once we defeat the supervillain,
‎you will return the Miraculous to me.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.980
‎Can I love... uh, trust you?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.140
‎Yes, Ladybug.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.740
‎-Amazing!
‎-Greetings!

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.300
‎My name is Sass and I'll be your kwami!

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.140
‎But what am I supposed to do?

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.540
‎All you have to say is,
‎"Sass, scales slither!"

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.180
‎Sass, scales slither!

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.140
<i>‎</i>
<i>‎Cat got your tongue? Leave a message!</i>

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.620
‎Cat! I found Adrien.
‎We're gonna go after Desperada.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.300
‎-Meet us under Trocadéro!
‎-I hope I don't disappoint you.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.540
‎I know you won't. You're perfect.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.380
‎Uh... perfectly capable
‎of defeating Desperada.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.060
‎We need all odds in our favour.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.860
‎Desperada is a fearsome opponent!

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.420
‎Lucky charm!

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.940
‎I'd have preferred a horseshoe
‎for my first mission!

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.060
‎I love your sense of humor.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.660
‎Really? Thanks!

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.620
‎If anything goes wrong,
‎the Second Chance lets you go back

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.740
‎to the exact moment you activated it.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.340
‎Got it. Second chance!

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.180
‎We now have five minutes.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.300
‎Within this time range,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.420
‎you can go back in time
‎as often as you want.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.940
‎After that,
‎when the snake's head goes back in place,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.100
‎you'll detransform.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.260
‎Still no Cat.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.820
‎Come to think of it,
‎we're OK without him...

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.580
‎-Oh!
‎-..now that we have your power!

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.060
‎You and I are gonna make an awesome team!

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.620
‎Where is she?

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.740
‎Nobody can escape me from here!

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.220
‎ ‎Very nice, Desperada!

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.660
‎Once you've captured Cat Noir

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.460
‎and don't need your powers any more,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.460
‎the stickers will release the heroes,
‎and their Miraculous will be mine!

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.460
‎-Awesome team, all right!
‎-Give me some time!

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.260
‎-We now have five minutes...
‎-Before I transform back.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.340
‎Did we not make it?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.740
‎No, but I used my power of Second Chance!

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.940
‎No time to wait for Cat Noir!
‎We're fine without him!

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.580
‎We'll make an awesome team!
‎Aspik and Ladybug!

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.620
‎Aspik? Wow!
‎You've only just started being a superhero

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.300
‎and you have this all down!

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.300
‎Guess you made the right choice.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.540
‎Where is she?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.540
‎No, wait! The first time,
‎Desperada's fire came from there!

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.180
‎Here, as a thank you for choosing me.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.780
‎Oh... uh... thanks!

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.980
‎-Awesome team, all right!
‎-I just need more time!

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.220
‎To do what? Charm Ladybug
‎or defeat the villain?

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.860
‎ ‎Second chance!

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.300
‎-We now have five--
‎-Trust me!

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.700
‎-We've been through this before!
‎-Shouldn't we wait for Cat Noir?

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.460
‎Let's try a different exit!

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.180
‎So you've saved my life
‎several times already? I knew...

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.420
‎We'd make an awesome team?
‎I hope you're right!

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.540
‎He can read my mind, too!

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.700
‎-Seems OK here!
‎-Adrien, I mean, Snake...

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.660
‎Call me Aspik!

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.020
‎Aspik, you really are a super...

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.580
‎-Awesome team.
‎-I know!

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.380
‎Not again!

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.020
‎No! No!

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.460
‎You know, Ladybug?
‎I'm actually also Cat Noir

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.940
‎and I've been in love you
‎since our eyes first met.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.420
‎ ‎We now have five minutes.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.540
‎Within this time range,
‎you can go back in time

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.500
‎-as many times as you want.
‎-Sass, scales rest!

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.020
‎But...

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.060
‎It didn't work. I'm so sorry.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.380
‎I wasn't the right choice
‎for you after all.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.060
‎No! You have to be the right snake!

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.980
‎I guess I must have done something wrong.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.260
‎No, it's not you.
‎I just can't protect you.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.980
‎-I never managed to save you.
‎-We can try again!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.420
‎No! I can't bear seeing Desperada
‎capture you every time,

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.860
‎without ever being able to save you.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.300
‎How many times did you see me?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.260
‎I've been trying for months.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.500
‎It was the 25 913th time.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.060
‎I don't know what to do any more.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.580
‎But... who could possibly wear
‎this Miraculous, besides you?

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.260
‎Ladybug? Oh! I see you've found Adrien.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.340
‎I'm glad. I was worried!

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.260
‎Brave, determined, caring.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.100
‎Why don't you give him the Miraculous?

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.740
‎Thank you for saving my life
‎so many times, Adrien.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.220
‎I'll go and hide.
‎I'm sure you guys will succeed, Ladybug!

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.140
‎Did I miss something?

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.260
‎Luka Couphène,
‎here's the Miraculous of the Snake,

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.340
‎which grants the power of Second Chance.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.780
‎You will use it for the greater good,
‎if you're willing.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.780
‎Once we succeed,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.700
‎you must return the Miraculous to me.
‎Can I trust you?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.860
‎Desperada attacked my family
‎and my friends,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.820
‎so if I can help you in any way, I will!

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.140
‎Greetings!
‎My name is Sass and I'll be your kwami!

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.460
‎At last, you've come to your senses!

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.660
‎I'm not sure Ladybug will have
‎very fond memories of Adrien Agreste!

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.580
‎Then make up for it as Cat Noir!

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.020
‎You're right! Plagg, claws out!

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.780
‎All you have to say is,
‎"Sass, scales slither!"

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.020
‎Sass, scales slither!

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.900
‎Just in time!
‎Cat Noir, I'd like you to meet...

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.260
‎Viperion! Can't wait to work with you!

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.540
‎Perhaps you'd have preferred a horseshoe
‎for your first mission?

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.580
‎-Ugh! Cat!
‎-No need!

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.980
‎Ladybug brings enough luck for all of us!

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.220
‎Thanks! Desperada
‎is at the top of the Eiffel Tower!

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.940
‎Let's take her vantage point away!

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.620
‎We're gonna need your Cataclysm!

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.220
‎Our team would be lost without him!

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.420
‎At your service!

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.900
‎Here! Cataclysm!

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.300
‎ ‎Cataclysm!

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.660
‎All her weapons come from her guitar case.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.340
‎We have to prevent her from using them,
‎then destroy the case. Ready?

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.100
‎Second chance!

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.140
‎Second chance!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.940
‎Wait!

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.380
‎Second chance!

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.180
‎ ‎Second chance!

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.900
‎Second chance!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.940
‎Wait! This time, I know what to do!

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.820
‎No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.660
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.860
‎Gotcha!

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.820
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.740
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.060
‎What am I doing here?

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.260
‎ ‎Pound it!

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.980
‎History repeats itself, Ladybug,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.340
‎but rest assured,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.340
‎one day,
‎I will be the one who rewrites it!

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.860
‎-Thank you for trusting me.
‎-You were the right choice.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.140
‎I'm sure we'll see each other again soon.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.900
‎Bug out!

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.340
‎I know I wasn't very rock'n'roll to you,
‎Vivica.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.140
‎And even if you did eat my cereal
‎and drink Fang's milk,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.780
‎I should've never have fired you!
‎You can come back.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.620
‎-But get your own breakfast, OK?
‎-I promise, Jagged!

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.020
‎Besides, I get why Anarka
‎no longer wants to play with me,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.420
‎and I respect her decision.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.740
‎What's past is past.
‎Isn't that right, Nanarky?

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.660
‎I was wrong about you and Luka, wasn't I?

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.780
‎But you'd better hurry up and choose.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.020
‎You don't always get a second chance
‎in love.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.660
‎Well, Adrien and Luka
‎can choose too, right?

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.180
‎And they haven't made
‎their choice yet, either!
