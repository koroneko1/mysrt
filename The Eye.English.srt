1
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,375
They say this world has
a lot of evil things,

2
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:03,875
yet, it is beautiful at the same time.

3
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,583
I don't know if they are right…

4
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,458
but I'm about to get to know this world
all over again.

5
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,750
Wong Kar Mun,
I'm giving you a local anesthetic now.

6
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,541
The operation will take about two hours.
Are you ready?

7
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,000
Who's that?

8
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,458
Quiet! Do you want to alarm
all the nurses?

9
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,958
I'm in the bed next to yours.

10
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
I heard that you've just gone
through an eye operation.

11
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,333
I've had many operations here.

12
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,625
Everyone here is a good friend of mine.

13
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,750
How old are you?
Why did you need so many operations?

14
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,083
Eleven years old.
I should be in junior high by now,

15
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,875
but Mum said,
there's an extra black lump in my brain,

16
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,583
which affects my nervous system.

17
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,333
Which means I can simply pass out
at any given moment.

18
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,541
I need open surgery to remove the lump,

19
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
but it cannot be done in one go,

20
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,333
because it's very dangerous.

21
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,458
So, I skipped school last year
and have been here ever since.

22
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,541
You're so young, yet so brave!

23
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,333
Big Sister, once you can see again,
I'll take you out to play.

24
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,375
The world is a truly beautiful place.

25
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,291
Wong Kar Mun,
when I remove the bandages on your eyes,

26
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,541
it might hurt a little.

27
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,750
If it hurts too much, let me know.

28
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,708
We can always
remove the bandages tomorrow.

29
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, give it a try,

30
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,708
open your eyes slowly.

31
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,625
Mun, don't force yourself if it hurts.

32
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,375
It hurts!

33
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,666
Is it too much?

34
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,958
Dr. Lo, she must be in a lot of pain!

35
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,708
She's never cried out in pain
since she was a kid!

36
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,041
Easy, Granny, Dr. Lo knows what to do.

37
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,750
Please don't worry yourself.

38
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,208
In fact, very few patients
see immediate success.

39
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,166
It takes time for the eye and brain
to work together.

40
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,125
Here.

41
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,666
Ying Ying.

42
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,000
Ying Ying!

43
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,583
Big Sister, can you see now?

44
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,291
I'm Ying Ying.

45
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,333
Can you really see me?

46
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,958
It seems I can see now.

47
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,541
Fantastic! Big Sister can see!

48
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,041
Nurse, Big Sister can see!

49
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,291
Nurse, Big Sister's eyes
are able to see now!

50
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,333
She sees me! Come quickly…

51
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,791
Granny! The hospital called,
Mun can see again!

52
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,708
What?

53
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,041
Mun can see!

54
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,500
-Really?
-Go get changed, let's go see her now.

55
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,750
Are you going to discharge me now?

56
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,041
Not so soon.

57
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,375
Every cornea recipient
starts off shortsighted,

58
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,541
by as much as 1,000 degrees.

59
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,458
Only when your shortsightedness
falls to about 200 degrees,

60
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,666
will your eye muscles be able to adapt.

61
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,208
When will she have perfect eyesight then?

62
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,500
No one has perfect eyesight,

63
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,875
most people are shortsighted
by about 100 degrees.

64
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,458
That sounds troublesome.

65
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,625
Will she need glasses?

66
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,875
No need, madam.

67
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,416
All she needs is a pair of sunglasses
for the time being.

68
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,500
Mun, get some rest.

69
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,208
If everything goes well,
you can leave earlier.

70
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,375
You can take off your sunglasses now.
Try to get used to the light gradually.

71
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,833
If you feel pain,
or if your eyes start tearing up,

72
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,791
that means you should close your eyes
and let your eyes rest.

73
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,291
Here, I'll help you onto the bed.

74
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,541
Nurse.

75
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,375
Is there a mirror in every washroom?

76
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,916
I'll take you there.

77
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,291
Here.

78
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,458
Slowly.

79
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Take your time,
call me if you need anything.

80
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,875
Who's that?

81
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,666
Ying Ying, is that you?

82
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,125
Why are you so quiet?

83
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,125
Big Sister,
I'm having another operation tomorrow.

84
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,375
You made a promise
to take me out once I can see again.

85
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,000
So, hurry up with your operation,
then we can go out and have fun.

86
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,291
Did they say you can leave now?

87
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,875
Not yet.

88
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,041
But even when I do,
I can always drop by to visit you.

89
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,791
Sis, let's take a picture together.

90
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
-Let's do it outside!
-Okay!

91
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,291
-Let's go…
-Go where?

92
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,041
Here, let's take a picture here!

93
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,250
What's this?

94
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,291
-A camera.
-A camera?

95
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,666
Yes. Now, look this way.

96
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,625
Okay.

97
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,041
Ready? One, two, three!

98
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,333
Madam, are you all right?

99
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,333
Madam…

100
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,375
I'm freezing…

101
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,208
Send this one to Block C.

102
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,250
We have a full house
in the Block B Morgue.

103
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,916
Nurse?

104
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,208
Is the old lady dead?

105
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,208
It has been taken care of.

106
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,833
But last night…
I saw someone drop by to visit her.

107
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,875
They even went out together.

108
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,458
Are you sure?
We don't allow any visitors here at night.

109
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,166
Where's Ying Ying?

110
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,791
She went in for an operation this morning.

111
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Dr. Lo wanted you to stay
for two more days for observation,

112
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,666
but I'll be away on flight duty
for two weeks.

113
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,541
No one will be able to pick you up then.

114
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,250
It's easier to have you discharged now.

115
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,875
This way, you and Granny
can spend more time together.

116
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,625
My! It's already 3:00 p.m.!

117
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,333
I wonder if this place is easy to find.

118
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,666
Should have waited until I'd returned.
It's only a few more days after all.

119
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,041
After meeting the therapist,
I'll put you in a taxi.

120
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,625
Granny will meet you downstairs.

121
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,041
Wonder if we can still make it…

122
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:44,125
Our appointment was at 3:00 p.m.,
we're only ten minutes late.

123
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,500
I have to leave for work soon.

124
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,583
Excuse me, you've mistaken my words.

125
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,333
Dr. Lo saw that you hadn't arrived,
so he went out to buy something.

126
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,250
Okay.

127
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,333
Dr. Lo's back.

128
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,875
Where's my three o'clock?

129
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,166
That's her.

130
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,916
Mun, let's go.

131
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,708
Let me introduce you
to the nature of my work.

132
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,458
Starting from now,

133
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,916
I am Miss Wong Kar Mun's psychotherapist.

134
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Since Miss Wong
lost her sight at the age of two,

135
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,333
her visual vocabulary
is extremely limited,

136
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,916
and she has probably forgotten
most of even that.

137
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,125
For example,

138
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:25,916
Miss Wong, please remove your glasses
and let your eyes get used to the light.

139
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,875
Can you tell what's in my hand?

140
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,625
You'll recognize it's a stapler
once you touch it,

141
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,000
because all your previous knowledge
of objects

142
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,583
was based on touch, not on sight.

143
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,125
Yet, you are no longer blind.

144
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,458
My job is to help you re-establish

145
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,875
how to use your eyes
and understand what you see.

146
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,375
Actually, I'm not too worried
about that aspect.

147
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,291
What concerns me
is the patient's psychological state.

148
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:11,166
After regaining their sight, many patients
end up feeling alienated and fearful.

149
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,666
Dr. Lo, is the other Dr. Lo
a relative of yours?

150
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,833
You mean my uncle?

151
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,208
Yes, he's my father's younger brother.

152
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,500
So, what time do you finish work today?

153
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,416
Miss Wong is my last patient for the day.

154
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,333
Well, you see, I need to catch my flight,

155
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,125
so, can I trouble you to get
Mun home after this?

156
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,375
I see. Of course.

157
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,916
Besides, starting from today,

158
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,375
I need to take Miss Wong outdoors
for her training anyway.

159
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,291
Okay.

160
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,458
Sis, you can go ahead, I'm fine by myself,

161
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,375
I'm used to it.

162
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,583
This is you as a little girl.

163
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,791
Your father shot this a long time ago,
so that

164
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,541
you could look at it
once your eyes healed.

165
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,416
It was seven or eight years ago.

166
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,625
He stopped filming ever since
he divorced your mother.

167
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,541
Granny, is it true when Daddy comes back,

168
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,000
he'll take us to Vancouver?

169
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,625
I know you don't want to go,

170
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,250
but Vancouver's pace of life is slower,

171
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,416
it'll suit you better.

172
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,125
I can't even read Chinese,
how can I learn English?

173
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,833
Granny, I don't want to
rely on others forever.

174
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,333
I want to learn to write
and find a job in Hong Kong.

175
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,458
I want to be independent.

176
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,333
Your father might worry about
you going to work.

177
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,583
I have to do the dishes,
just take your time.

178
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,625
Hey, kid, what's up?

179
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,333
Sis, have you seen my report card?

180
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,083
No, I haven't.

181
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,875
Do you live upstairs?

182
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,458
Mun, who's that?

183
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,791
It's a little kid, Granny.

184
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,500
Did a report card
ever fall into our balcony?

185
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,666
That kid is poking fun at you.
Just ignore him!

186
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,041
VIGIL

187
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,125
Kid, what are you munching on?

188
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,916
I'm very hungry.

189
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,250
What is it? What's your problem?

190
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,250
Bravo!

191
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,000
We have two pieces
of good news today, everyone.

192
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,333
First…

193
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,041
Miss Tone Deaf had a successful operation!

194
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,708
And second,
for our Christmas charity concert,

195
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:03,666
we'll have the honor to perform
with Miss Vanessa-Mae!

196
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:36,083
Mr. Ching, why haven't
I received the practice schedule?

197
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,708
Mun, you know, after all,
we're an organization for the blind.

198
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,541
You're always welcome
to come and practice, but perhaps,

199
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,666
you should do something else
for the performance,

200
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,416
such as coordination,
or taking care of our members.

201
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,833
I can even arrange for you
to volunteer at the center.

202
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:03,500
Mr. Ching, I really want to
take part in this performance.

203
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:07,208
I've practiced so long for this concert.

204
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,666
I totally understand, however…

205
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,000
Excuse me, Mr. Ching,

206
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:18,250
Vanessa-Mae's agent wants us
to fax over our practice schedule.

207
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,916
I'll be with you right away.

208
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,208
Mun, Mun?

209
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,083
Let's finish our discussion later.

210
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,000
I need to go now. See you.

211
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,750
-Granny!
-Are you leaving?

212
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,916
Yes, to class.

213
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,416
Come back early for dinner.
I've prepared some special turnip soup.

214
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,916
Bye!

215
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:11,291
Sis, have you seen my report card?

216
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,791
Report card? Haven't you found it yet?

217
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,000
I really haven't seen it.

218
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,583
Perhaps, you should
ask someone else. Okay?

219
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,375
Ying Ying!

220
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,750
Excuse me, I'd like to talk to her.

221
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,791
Look what I've got you.

222
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:58,083
Sis, I've just gone through chemotherapy.

223
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,500
I'm not supposed to eat.
I'll throw up if I do.

224
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's all right,
we'll save it until you get better, okay?

225
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,583
If only we had believed him
just that once,

226
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,000
or given him a chance to explain…

227
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,833
he might still be here,
playing video games.

228
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,500
Who would have expected him
to jump off just like that?

229
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,375
Suicide is a dreadful sin.

230
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:01,166
The souls of those who commit suicide

231
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,833
are obliged to repeat
their painful deaths everyday.

232
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:09,500
To help him out
of this vicious cycle of pain,

233
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:13,416
we need to tackle
the cause of his suicide.

234
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,208
Only then can his soul
leave this world in peace.

235
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:23,125
Have you ever considered
he might be telling the truth?

236
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,625
Perhaps, he really did lose
his report card.

237
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:36,291
Sir, have you been teaching here long?

238
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,083
Yes, indeed. Many years.

239
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,166
This is calligraphy.
I'll teach you how to write.

240
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,125
Here, hold the brush and write.

241
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:48,500
Use your big thumb and index finger,
form a circle just like this.

242
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:53,708
Like this… and write. Here, try.

243
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:58,666
Very few want to learn
calligraphy, nowadays.

244
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,083
I used to teach three lessons a week,

245
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:08,458
now, I have only one lesson a week.

246
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,875
Now, try writing by yourself, okay?

247
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,500
Practice on your own.

248
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,083
Why did you take my seat?

249
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,458
Why did you take my seat?

250
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:30,250
What is this? What is going on?

251
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,125
What are you looking for? Are you okay?

252
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:45,541
How did this happen?

253
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,791
Are you not feeling well?

254
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,833
Is Dr. Lo here?

255
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,250
Miss Wong, you were here two days ago.

256
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,458
Your next appointment isn't till Friday.

257
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,416
He's out for a meeting,
he'll be back at 5:00 p.m.

258
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,625
Will he definitely be here at 5:00 p.m.?

259
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,708
Is it urgent? I can page him if you want.

260
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll be back at 5:00.

261
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,541
SANYANG CAFE

262
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,541
Can you see them, too?

263
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,708
They usually don't want you
to notice them.

264
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,041
Give it some time,
and you'll get used to it.

265
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,333
All the stores nearby have been bought up,

266
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,416
only my boss refuses to sell.

267
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,500
He seems to be expecting
his wife and child to visit.

268
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,166
Actually, he can't see them at all.

269
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,208
There's been a car accident over there…

270
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:40,750
Don't move him,
he may have some fractured bones.

271
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,250
Mun!

272
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,000
My secretary said you were asking for me.
What's the matter?

273
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,416
Will you help me?

274
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,958
Sure, of course I will. Do your eyes hurt?

275
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,291
-Will you believe me?
-Yes.

276
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,458
What is it?

277
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:59,333
That black figure,
he came to take the dead.

278
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:01,708
What black figure?

279
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,791
When I was at the hospital…

280
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,416
I saw a black figure.

281
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,833
He took an old lady with him.

282
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,750
The next morning, the old lady was dead.

283
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,916
My room keeps changing suddenly
into a different room.

284
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,416
I even saw a person
with the lower half of her body missing.

285
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,583
When they rushed over,
it was like an electric shock…

286
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,250
my whole body went numb…

287
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,375
Calm down. Tell me slowly.

288
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,541
When I was little…

289
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,416
Granny told me…

290
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,041
I was not an ordinary child…

291
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,458
God had given me some obstacles,

292
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:29,000
so that I would grow up
to be an extraordinary person.

293
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:36,250
Now, I finally understand
what it means to be extraordinary.

294
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:41,208
An extraordinary person
can see things other people can't see…

295
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,458
feel pain other people won't feel.

296
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:54,583
Maybe, I was never meant
to see this world.

297
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,833
I don't want to be confined
in my own world anymore,

298
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,083
terrified in bed every night…

299
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,833
then awakening to horrors every morning.

300
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:12,000
I just want to be an ordinary person.

301
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,500
Wah, can you help me?

302
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,125
Yes, yes.

303
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,458
One of my psychology professors
from the States

304
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,875
has just come to Hong Kong for a visit.

305
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:36,333
Let's meet him tomorrow,
maybe he can help you.

306
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:56,916
How can you help me without believing me?

307
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,291
Sis, what's going on?

308
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,666
Excuse me, I have to go.

309
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,208
Call me if you need anything.

310
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,333
Goodbye.

311
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,250
Who's that?

312
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:43,791
A friend.

313
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,041
He asked Yee to take something
to a friend in the States.

314
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,000
Yes, that's right.

315
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,833
You are home early.
Aren't you supposed to be back next week?

316
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,750
Well… a co-worker
switched her shift with mine,

317
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:56,791
so, I'm back early.

318
00:45:56,875 --> 00:46:00,000
You go home first, it's so smoky here.
Go on!

319
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,208
14TH FLOOR, UNIT-C

320
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:10,000
Sis, have you seen my report card?

321
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,541
Why keep asking me?
I already told you I haven't!

322
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:16,458
Sis, have you seen my report card?

323
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,208
15TH FLOOR, UNIT-C

324
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:48,958
Uncle, listen to me…

325
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,875
No way!

326
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,291
Only you can help us out!

327
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,208
I've already said no!

328
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:58,541
If you still respect me as your uncle,
and respect yourself as my nephew,

329
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,333
you should have
never approached me on this!

330
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,875
First of all,
you should know only too well

331
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:08,625
what medical ethics are,
regarding organ transplants.

332
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,208
And you should know better that

333
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,166
the identity of the cornea donor
is concealed from me.

334
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:15,666
What black figures?

335
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,291
One cornea transplant
and she starts seeing ghosts?

336
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,708
You actually believe that?

337
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:23,958
What if I do?

338
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,958
Then we have even less to talk about!

339
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,083
Uncle…

340
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:33,416
Don't tell me,
you're in love with your patient.

341
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:45,083
Hello?

342
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:49,250
Wah, is this you? Mun is in trouble!

343
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,791
Can you come over immediately?

344
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,416
Yes, right away.

345
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:04,208
Yes, I admit,
she's more than a patient to me.

346
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,375
Mun! Mun!

347
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,583
How long do you plan
on hiding in this little room?

348
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,500
Five years? Seven? Or 10?

349
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,416
You have to confront your problem
sooner or later.

350
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,125
You want to play violin?
Go play with the group!

351
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,666
I can accept you pretending to be blind.

352
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,791
But even when you were blind,
you didn't just stay here.

353
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,375
I just want to help.

354
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,625
-Mun.
-Mun!

355
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:17,000
-Mun.
-Mun!

356
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:38,708
Sister.

357
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,958
Ying Ying, what are you doing here?

358
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:57,000
Sister, I can leave the hospital now.

359
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,291
You can leave?

360
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Yes, I don't need any more operations,
I can go to school now.

361
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,041
Then…

362
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:12,041
Then once I am out of here …

363
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,166
we can go out and play together…

364
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,250
we can take pictures, we can even…

365
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,375
I'm so happy that you can see now…

366
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,208
because this world is really beautiful.

367
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,583
Ying Ying…

368
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:52,458
It's all right! Cheer up.

369
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:55,583
Stay strong and things will be all right.

370
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,833
Sis, I have to go now.

371
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,291
Ying Ying!

372
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,791
Wong Kar Mun, I want to tell you…

373
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,250
Ying Ying has already--

374
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:41,375
I know. I just saw her.

375
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,250
I know she's dead.

376
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,666
YUEN KIT YING

377
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,125
What are you looking at?

378
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,125
Ying Ying.

379
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,750
Can you see her?

380
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,500
It wasn't her.

381
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:04,208
Don't know why she didn't show up today.

382
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,375
Are you not afraid anymore?

383
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:19,458
I don't think I have a choice.

384
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,458
I have to see all these things anyway.

385
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:25,000
At least, I get to see the ones
I care about.

386
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,250
SIS MUN

387
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:40,541
What's this?

388
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,625
Ying Ying made this for you.

389
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:54,833
What's it say?

390
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,666
"Don't forget me."

391
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,541
DON'T FORGET ME

392
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,208
She put in the wrong photo, though.

393
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,541
Who's this?

394
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:13,166
That's you!
You still don't recognize yourself?

395
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,916
What is going on?

396
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,708
Who the hell are you?

397
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,500
Who the hell are you?

398
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:31,375
We believe that the last bit
of consciousness of a mortal

399
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,916
carries over to the afterlife.

400
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:37,083
That is, the very thought of a person
in their final moment,

401
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,375
would become the eternal consciousness
of their soul.

402
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,666
So, those who die a sudden death,

403
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:46,166
would have no recollection
of the instance of death.

404
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:50,125
Their souls remain in this world,
as if they're still alive.

405
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:53,000
But there are others
who refuse to leave intentionally,

406
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:56,250
mostly because of unsettled problems
in their lifetime.

407
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:59,791
These souls can't be consoled
if their problems persist.

408
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:03,416
There is only one way to help them out,

409
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,041
that is, to resolve
what they left unresolved.

410
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:10,375
The woman Miss Wong
keeps seeing after regaining her sight.

411
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:13,958
We have to resolve her problems
so that she can move on.

412
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,333
I hope I haven't done anything wrong.

413
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:42,000
Even if it's wrong, it'd be my fault,
but I won't regret it.

414
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,458
Were you reincarnated into the wrong body?

415
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,166
Why are you so different
from the rest of the family?

416
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,083
Be careful.

417
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,333
BANGKOK, THAILAND

418
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,166
Dr. Lo believed you in the end?

419
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:23,583
Let's take it that Dr. Lo is not involved.

420
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,958
He's a professional after all…

421
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,333
-you know what I mean?
-Yes.

422
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,583
How much further?

423
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,791
I'm not sure.

424
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,333
It says here, that her Chinese name
was Chiu Wai Ling,

425
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:39,125
a Thai-born Chinese, I suppose.

426
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:40,791
Here are her hospital records.

427
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:22,416
This is Siam Rach Hospital, Siam Rach.

428
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,500
"Si-am-la?"

429
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,208
Does "Si-am-la" mean "Siam"?

430
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,791
Let's get off to take a look.

431
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,458
SIAM RACH HOSPITAL

432
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:01,541
Hi.

433
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:06,416
Excuse me, is this hospital named
Siam Rach Lunteban?

434
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,166
-Yes.
-Yes?

435
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,291
I need to speak to a doctor here,
his name is Eak.

436
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,041
Please come and take care of this.

437
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:19,625
Can I help you?

438
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,041
Hi, I need to speak to a doctor
in this hospital,

439
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,791
his name is Eak.

440
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,333
Do you know him?

441
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:29,416
No?

442
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:32,833
But there is a doctor named Eak, right?

443
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,583
It says here,

444
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,083
this is the hospital, his name is Eak.

445
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,875
He's not here now.

446
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,708
He's not here now?

447
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,291
Wah!

448
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,541
Wah!

449
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,416
What is it?

450
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,041
-This is the place.
-What place?

451
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:20,416
The place I've been
having nightmares about.

452
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,791
Nightmares?

453
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:23,750
This has to be it!

454
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,916
-Doctor!
-What's the matter?

455
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:33,333
You have two visitors.

456
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:37,666
Mister, this is Dr. Eak.

457
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,500
-Are you Dr. Eak?
-Yes.

458
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,500
My name is Wah.

459
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,541
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

460
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:46,041
It's about her.
She's just had a cornea transplant.

461
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,875
So, we would like
to thank the donor's family.

462
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,958
We hope you can give us some details.

463
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:54,250
This is the information.

464
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,458
Are you two from Hong Kong?

465
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:06,041
You speak Mandarin?

466
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,666
Can you help us?

467
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:14,125
Sorry, I can't disclose
our hospital records,

468
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,083
not without the proper authorization.

469
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,583
Please understand.

470
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:22,416
Wait! We need to see
the donor's family urgently,

471
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:26,708
could you perhaps contact them,
and see if they are willing to meet us?

472
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:29,291
Her family will not be willing
to meet with you.

473
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,000
Who are you to Ling?

474
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,708
Please leave.

475
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,333
Wait!

476
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:40,708
After I got Ling's corneas,
I started to see things she used to see!

477
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,250
Ling was a sad girl,

478
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,958
everyone in the village
stayed away from her.

479
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,208
Why?

480
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,750
From time to time,
she would weep outside someone's door,

481
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,500
and afterwards,

482
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:07,875
a person in that house would pass away.

483
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:13,083
So, everyone took her to be a devil
and always chased her away on sight.

484
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,916
The children treated her like a monster.

485
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:21,416
I, too, threw stones at her
when I was a kid…

486
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:26,291
Because none of you could believe
that she foresaw death?

487
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:29,166
Maybe it was because of fear.

488
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,375
So, do you believe it now?

489
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,833
This is it.

490
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,375
Mrs. Chui, these two friends
are from Hong Kong.

491
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,166
Nobody welcomed Ling…

492
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:17,333
so, she hardly ever set foot
in the village.

493
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,083
Yet, on the night of the big fire,

494
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:26,291
many saw her running around
and shouting hysterically,

495
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:27,708
as if talking to herself.

496
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,375
Since everyone detested Ling,

497
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:34,041
no one paid any attention to her.

498
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:38,791
I only heard,
some villagers threw water on her

499
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:40,291
to drive her away.

500
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:45,625
Around midnight, a big fire erupted

501
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,125
and kept burning till noon the next day.

502
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,041
Among the deceased,
300 were burned beyond recognition.

503
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,208
-How exactly did Ling die?
-She hanged herself.

504
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:06,750
Ling killed herself
the day after the big fire.

505
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:16,791
Is Mrs. Chui all right?

506
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,625
She's fine.

507
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,791
So, you too believed
that she wasn't insane,

508
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,625
that she only saw things
no one else could.

509
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:30,458
She foresaw a big disaster
and tried to warn everyone,

510
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,791
but no one listened to her.

511
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,416
I don't understand
any of this spiritual stuff.

512
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:40,458
I just want you two to know
that Ling was a very kind person…

513
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,791
and she had a tough life.

514
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,916
Can I take a look at Ling's room?

515
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,291
Tonight… I want to stay here.

516
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:16,291
I'll take you to Ling's grave
tomorrow morning.

517
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:20,208
You've been very kind to us, thank you.

518
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:22,250
You should go to bed now.

519
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:29,000
All right, I'm staying next door,
shout out if anything happens.

520
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,541
I know you've wanted me
to come here all this time.

521
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:45,375
Here I am now.
What do you want to tell me?

522
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:18,458
…ill-fated!

523
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:22,208
Hurry! Take her to the hospital!

524
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:25,500
You are disaster!

525
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:31,458
Everything you speak is evil!
Shut up, for God's sake!

526
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:35,125
You jinx! It's all because of you!

527
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:45,916
Told you not to come here!

528
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:52,125
She's evil! Don't ever play with her!

529
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:02,541
Go save him! Save my boy…

530
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,083
Help him… Make him breathe!

531
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:11,375
For God's sake…

532
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:17,916
She's evil!

533
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,166
It's all your fault!

534
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,875
Mrs. Chui, I know how to help Ling.

535
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:25,791
Let's go upstairs to see her.

536
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,000
Her most painful time was not in the past,
it's right now!

537
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,875
Since she killed herself,
she's been trapped

538
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:33,708
in a time warp,
constantly repeating her suicide.

539
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:38,166
She's already dead, how can she die again?

540
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,750
Mrs. Chui, listen to me.

541
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,000
Your daughter will appear upstairs
very soon.

542
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:46,916
Let's go up to see her!

543
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:48,916
I won't see her!

544
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,916
I spent my whole life protecting her,

545
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,333
I never once gave up on her,

546
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,958
but she gave up on herself!

547
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,791
For that, I can never forgive her!

548
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:12,541
Just listen,
I'm sure you hear this sound every night.

549
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,958
Ling died at 3:00, didn't she?

550
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,541
Mrs. Chui, come with me
and you'll understand.

551
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,583
I'm not going anywhere!

552
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:28,250
Mama…

553
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,166
Help me…

554
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:38,750
Help me…

555
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,250
Ling?

556
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,583
Help me…

557
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,291
Help me!

558
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:28,833
Help me…

559
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,791
Is it Ling?

560
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:33,500
Is it really Ling?

561
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:39,708
Mama…

562
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:42,416
Help me…

563
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:45,291
Ling, you were the one who left me…

564
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:53,708
You were the one who left me…

565
01:22:54,125 --> 01:23:00,375
Mama, help me!

566
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,208
Ling, Mama's coming!

567
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,541
Ling! Ling!

568
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:23,000
Daughter, Ma's right here.

569
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,625
Don't be afraid…

570
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,333
no one can bully you anymore.

571
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,875
Mama, I'm so sorry,

572
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,500
I was wrong…

573
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,250
please forgive me!

574
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:48,541
I've already forgiven you.

575
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,250
Mun!

576
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,375
What happened?

577
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,083
Are you all right?

578
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:43,416
IN LOVING MEMORY OF BELOVED DAUGHTER
CHIU WAI LING

579
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,500
MAE CHAEM

580
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:46,875
Hurry! Pull him out!

581
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,958
Careful! Come on, keep pulling!

582
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:04,125
Over there! Move!

583
01:28:12,958 --> 01:28:15,958
Run for your life!

584
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:03,208
Go, go!

585
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:39,583
Something's happening, get out, quick!

586
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,041
Granny, leave your house now!

587
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,083
Leave your house now!

588
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:49,333
Brother, run for your life!

589
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,541
Run quickly! Run!

590
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:52,916
Please come out now! Run!

591
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,791
Run quickly! Run!

592
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:01,333
Please come out now! Run…

593
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:08,583
Pack and run! A disaster is coming!

594
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,125
Run now!

595
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,625
Run now!

596
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:32,916
What's she saying?

597
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,291
Run! Get out!

598
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:46,166
To your left. Move over!

599
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:51,041
Move over!

600
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:03,666
Mun!

601
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,291
Go! Move over!

602
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,791
Go! Move over!

603
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,583
Run now!

604
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,416
Mun…

605
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:09,583
Ling disappeared ever since that day.

606
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:12,500
I hold no resentment towards her,

607
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:16,375
as I saw and experienced
the same pain that she did.

608
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,791
But I've seen more.

609
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:23,125
I've seen pain, but I've also seen beauty.

610
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:26,916
Never again will I ask why am I blind

611
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:32,583
for I've seen the most beautiful things
in this world,

612
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,875
things I'll never forget.
