00:03.541 --> 00:06.375
OBI-WAN: A girl has been kidnapped.
I need to find her.

00:06.458 --> 00:07.625
STORMTROOPER: Out of the way.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.875
You're never gonna see her again.
Nobody leaves this place.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.125
JAYCO: There's a Jedi. He helps people.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.958
OBI-WAN: You're a rat who preys
on weakness.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.208
You'll help me find
this girl I'm looking for.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.291
Yeah, I'll do it.

00:22.083 --> 00:25.666
REVA: He'll reveal himself eventually,
and I will be waiting.

00:27.125 --> 00:28.125
(GRUNTING)

00:29.208 --> 00:30.208
Who are you?

00:30.750 --> 00:32.000
Your father sent me.

00:32.083 --> 00:35.166
GRAND INQUISITOR: You would kidnap
an Imperial Senator's child?

00:35.250 --> 00:36.958
I used the girl as bait.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.500
GRAND INQUISITOR: Stand down.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.583
I will take Kenobi in myself.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.375
OBI-WAN:
If anyone asks, you're my daughter.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.666
Granddaughter, maybe.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.083
-What?
-Nothing.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.583
LEIA: Since I met you,
I've been chased, shot at,

00:52.958 --> 00:54.666
I almost fell to my death,

00:55.541 --> 00:58.250
and now there are Inquisiting people
after us.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.541
Where is he?

01:03.333 --> 01:06.083
HAJA: Go to these coordinates.
They'll help you from there.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.291
You're not alone, Obi-Wan.

01:09.666 --> 01:10.916
REVA: You didn't know.

01:11.416 --> 01:12.541
(GRUNTS)

01:13.416 --> 01:17.583
Anakin Skywalker is alive.

01:19.583 --> 01:20.583
Anakin.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.666
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

02:24.000 --> 02:25.166
OBI-WAN: Master Qui-Gon.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.375
Master.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.416
Are you there, Master?

02:40.958 --> 02:42.166
REVA: You didn't know.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.000
He's alive, Obi-Wan.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.791
YODA: Only pain will you find.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.250
REVA: (IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Obi-Wan...

03:06.291 --> 03:10.083
QUI-GON: Obi-Wan, promise me
you will train the boy.

03:10.166 --> 03:13.083
ANAKIN: If you're not with me,
then you're my enemy.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.333
Don't make me kill you.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.416
I do not fear the dark side.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.208
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.416
OBI-WAN: Help me, Master Qui-Gon.
Give me strength.

03:32.875 --> 03:33.875
(WHIRRING)

03:36.083 --> 03:37.083
(BEEPS)

03:40.750 --> 03:44.708
REVA: Anakin Skywalker is alive.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.750
And he's been looking for you
for a long time.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.541
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:06.208 --> 04:07.833
OBI-WAN: He's coming, Master.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.708
DARTH VADER: Where is he?

04:31.791 --> 04:34.833
REVA: We have probes out.
We're tracking all possible exits.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.291
He will pay for the Grand Inquisitor's--

04:37.375 --> 04:40.083
The Grand Inquisitor means nothing.

04:40.166 --> 04:44.333
Kenobi is all that matters now.
Is that understood?

04:45.333 --> 04:46.625
Yes, my lord.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.416
I have been watching you, Third Sister.

04:54.666 --> 04:57.291
I know what it is you seek.

04:59.166 --> 05:05.750
Prove yourself, and the position
of Grand Inquisitor is yours.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.791
Fail me,
and you will not live to regret it.

05:19.833 --> 05:21.625
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

05:38.625 --> 05:40.083
LEIA: Are we almost there?

05:42.041 --> 05:44.291
Can't you make this thing go any faster?

05:44.375 --> 05:47.958
It's a trade route, Leia.
I'm not in control of it.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.875
Can't you use the Force on it
or something?

05:52.666 --> 05:54.166
That's not how it works.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.791
LEIA: How does it work?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.833
The Force.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.041
What does it feel like?

06:09.583 --> 06:11.583
Have you ever been afraid of the dark?

06:13.458 --> 06:15.750
How does it feel
when you turn on the light?

06:16.875 --> 06:18.125
I feel safe.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.083
Yes, it feels like that.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.458
Lola!

06:30.333 --> 06:31.625
You fixed her.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.541
(LOLA BEEPING)

06:35.916 --> 06:36.916
Thank you.

06:42.708 --> 06:43.791
(SHIP RUMBLING)

06:45.166 --> 06:48.166
We better get ready. We're on approach.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.750
(SOFTLY) Okay.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.375
STORMTROOPER: Let's go.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.458
Now.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.291
LEIA: What is this place?

08:08.916 --> 08:11.416
OBI-WAN: Mapuzo. It's a mining system.

08:14.333 --> 08:17.708
Coordinates say the meeting point
is further north.

08:17.791 --> 08:20.125
That is if our new friend
was telling the truth.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.958
-Why would he lie?
-People are not all good, Leia.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.750
Wasn't always like this here.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.625
There were fields and families.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.291
And then the Empire came in
and ravaged it all.

08:41.707 --> 08:44.125
Thought the Empire
was supposed to be helping us.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.041
Well, there are some,
like your dad, who are trying to.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.375
Seems like a losing battle these days.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.000
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

09:10.583 --> 09:11.583

09:13.208 --> 09:14.208

09:23.666 --> 09:24.666
Stay close.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

09:58.708 --> 10:00.875
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

10:20.541 --> 10:22.583
He's in one of the mining systems.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.541
-FIFTH BROTHER: You do not know that.
-He could be anywhere.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.583
I traced the manifest. We should send out
all remaining probes now.

10:29.666 --> 10:32.375
FIFTH BROTHER:
You are not in charge here.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.708
(GRUNTS)

10:35.166 --> 10:39.000
That seat is mine, not yours.

10:39.666 --> 10:42.375
I am the next in line.

10:43.541 --> 10:44.750
(GRUNTS)

10:49.833 --> 10:51.625
I just spoke with Lord Vader.

10:52.583 --> 10:56.125
You spoke to him yourself?

10:56.208 --> 10:57.958
He asked me to lead the hunt.

10:58.958 --> 11:02.125
Unless you feel
I should follow your orders instead.

11:02.625 --> 11:06.958
Send out the probes. Do it now.

11:11.791 --> 11:12.958
(GRUNTS)

11:13.583 --> 11:17.708
I will get what I deserve, Third Sister.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.708
And so will you.

11:25.416 --> 11:26.541
I hope so.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.625
I certainly hope so.

11:53.958 --> 11:54.958
(BEEPS)

12:01.458 --> 12:04.833
OBI-WAN: Now, remember, if anyone
asks, we're farmers from Tawl.

12:04.916 --> 12:07.250
You're my daughter, and you don't talk.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.750
LEIA: I can't talk,
or I don't like to talk?

12:09.833 --> 12:11.750
OBI-WAN: You don't talk.

12:11.833 --> 12:12.833
LEIA: Got it.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.750
OBI-WAN: This is it.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.416
This is where he told us to come to.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.375
Maybe they're just late?

12:23.458 --> 12:26.666
Maybe it was a lie. I knew it!
I never should've trusted him.

12:26.750 --> 12:30.000
-We don't know if maybe--
-No one is coming here, Leia.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.791
Well, if we're on our own,
we're gonna need some help.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.666
What are you doing?

12:42.750 --> 12:45.166
Maybe they can give us a ride
to the spaceport.

12:45.916 --> 12:46.958
But it's not safe.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.291
LEIA: He seems friendly.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.041
OBI-WAN: Leia.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.666
Well, keep your head down.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.791
And remember, you don't talk.

13:01.958 --> 13:05.041
Hi! I'm Luma.
This is my friend-- my father.

13:05.125 --> 13:08.583
This is my father, Orden.
We're farmers from Tawl.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.166
Hey, there. I'm Freck.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.583
Father, aren't you going to say hello?

13:15.083 --> 13:16.083
Hello.

13:17.291 --> 13:21.375
We were going on a trip,
and we got a little lost in this field.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.208
That's a weird story.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.208
We got a bit turned around.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.625
We're looking for the nearest port.
We need to get home.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.916
Well, I'm going that way. Jump in.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.583
Oh, no, that's all right. Thank you.
We just need directions.

13:34.666 --> 13:37.958
Come on, Father, we've walked long enough.

13:38.041 --> 13:39.041
Thanks, Freck.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.833
My pleasure. Hop in.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.791
FRECK: Don't worry.
I'll get to the port in no time.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.041
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

14:10.333 --> 14:12.791
Now, where'd you say you're from again?

14:13.333 --> 14:14.333
-Tawl.
-Tawl.

14:14.416 --> 14:19.208
Oh, good people out in Tawl.
They pay their way, listen to the Empire.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.333
Absolutely. We love the Empire.

14:22.416 --> 14:26.500
Nice to meet like-minded folk.
Nothing wrong with a little order, right?

FRECK: Well, hop in. Meet my new friends.

FRECK: This is Orden and Luma.
They're hitchin' a ride to the port.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.125
Where are you all comin' from?

15:04.875 --> 15:08.208
STORMTROOPER 2: They're movin' us
around, looking for a Jedi.

15:08.291 --> 15:12.250
FRECK: A Jedi? Out here?
I hope we're not in any danger.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.666
STORMTROOPER 3:
Ah, no, we'll find him. We always do.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.583
STORMTROOPER 2: You a miner?

15:40.083 --> 15:42.208
Farmer from, uh, Tawl.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.333
STORMTROOPER 2:
What are you doin' out here?

15:44.416 --> 15:46.000
That's a long story.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.166
STORMTROOPER 2: It's a long way.

15:50.291 --> 15:55.458
He brought me here to see the place
where he met my mother before she...

15:55.541 --> 15:57.250
She's not with us anymore.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.708
Been a very difficult time.

16:02.791 --> 16:06.458
STORMTROOPER 2: What about you?
You have any information about a Jedi?

16:06.541 --> 16:08.375
I wouldn't know one if I saw one.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.583
You haven't heard anything?

16:09.666 --> 16:12.416
Nothing. Are you sure
he's even on this planet?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.000
They know what they're doing, Leia.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.500
It's just, I'm--

16:16.583 --> 16:18.333
STORMTROOPER 2: You called her Leia.

16:18.416 --> 16:19.416
Just that I...

16:22.208 --> 16:24.208
I thought her name was Luma.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.000
That was her mother's name.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.500
I get confused.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.041
Like I said, it's not been easy.

16:34.666 --> 16:36.708
Sometimes when I look at Luma,

16:37.833 --> 16:39.500
I see her mother's face.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.666
We all miss her very much.

16:48.416 --> 16:51.208
STORMTROOPER 2:
Well, just keep your eyes open.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.916
Report it if you see anything.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.125
-Of course.
-Of course.

I'll check out that T-16.

What do they got you doing?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.040
(BOTH SIGH IN RELIEF)

17:20.750 --> 17:21.750
What?

17:22.625 --> 17:26.375
You knew her, my real mother, didn't you?

17:27.083 --> 17:28.290
It was just a story.

17:29.375 --> 17:32.541
The whole time I've known you,
you've been hiding something.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.250
-Lying to me.
-Leia.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.208
Are you my real father?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.416
I wish that I could say I was,

17:48.875 --> 17:50.083
but no, I'm not.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.416
Sometimes I try to imagine
what he was like.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.500
I know that feeling.

18:02.541 --> 18:05.875
As Jedi, we're taken from our families
when we're very young.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.708
I still have glimpses,

18:10.916 --> 18:16.000
flashes really, my mother's shawl,
my father's hands.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.083
-I remember a baby.
-A baby?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.958
Yes, I think I had a brother.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.750
Really don't remember him.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.166
I wished I did.

18:28.041 --> 18:31.625
Then I joined the Jedi,
and I got a new family just like you.

18:35.416 --> 18:36.416
Freck?

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

18:37.583 --> 18:39.833
Freck? Can we get off here?

18:39.916 --> 18:42.083
FRECK: Oh, it's a standard inspection.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.958
Don't worry, won't take long.
I know these fellas.

18:55.875 --> 18:56.916
STORMTROOPER: Good run today?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.666
FRECK: Not bad. Quarry's running dry.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.375
We're gonna have to dig again.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.625
STORMTROOPER: Who are they?

19:05.791 --> 19:10.333
A couple of strays I found.
Thought you might wanna check 'em out.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.208
STORMTROOPER: All right. Thanks, Freck.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.708
Not a lot of reasons
to be in the outpost today.

19:29.791 --> 19:30.791
Where are you headed?

19:31.208 --> 19:34.833
Uh, back to Tawl.
We have family here we were visiting.
