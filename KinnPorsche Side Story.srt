1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you certain, doctor?

2
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:08,998
Where is Kinn?

3
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,047
Porsche.

4
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:15,965
Where is Kinn?

5
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:20,611
Kinn is...

6
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:25,786
Mr. Tankhun.

7
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,069
Kinn is...

8
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:29,867
Shit.

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,641
How?

10
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:31,641
Kinn...

11
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:36,356
Mr. Tankhun, please lower your voice.

12
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:46,050
Kinn is out of the woods.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,050
Just not up yet.

14
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:49,218
What?

15
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,341
Why the hell are you teasing now?

16
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:52,065
Hey!

17
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:52,795
Porsche!

18
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:53,757
This is Mr. Tankhun.

19
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,757
Right.

20
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:55,881
Why can't I play?

21
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:57,884
Why is he being so moody?

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,648
And where is Kinn now?

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,100
There.

24
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:04,935
Which room?

25
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:06,422
Over there.

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
Where are you going?

27
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:10,425
He's not up yet.

28
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,524
Isn't he overreacting?

29
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,548
I'm Kinn's brother and I'm not overreacting.

30
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:31,286
How's Mr. Kinn doing?

31
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,428
Everything seems to be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

32
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:00,531
Oh.

33
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:02,574
Oh, hello, Porsche.

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,560
Kinn's not up yet?

35
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:14,825
Not yet.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
And these flowers are for Kinn?

37
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:21,823
Nope.

38
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,212
These are for you.

39
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:30,973
Yellow roses mean friendship and care.

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,610
And there's also another meaning.

41
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,153
Love.

42
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:40,653
That doesn't expect anything in return.

43
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:48,854
Well, I'm off now.

44
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,603
Oh, you're leaving?

45
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,563
If I stay,

46
00:02:57,563 --> 00:03:00,063
I might make Kinn uncomfortble.

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,430
So I'd better get going, Porsche.

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,489
Wait.

49
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,489
Take your flowers back too.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,980
I'm allergic to those.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,020
It might land on my bodyguard's skin.

52
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:40,546
Well, Iâ€™m outta here. I don't want to disturb you.

53
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:41,911
Where are you going?

54
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,572
Are you gonna let you boss sleep alone?

55
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:55,852
Why, can you not sleep alone?

56
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,236
I'm on my work leave now.

57
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,806
Are you really gonna go back alone?

58
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:06,194
This is one of the most haunted hospitals.

59
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:12,122
You think I'm afraid of that?

60
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,910
I'm not scared...

61
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,094
The A/C in my room is just too cold.

62
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,619
What made you come back then?

63
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,513
Have you ever done anything without a reason?

64
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,717
Yes.

65
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:05,056
Papa gave you 7 days to think...

66
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:07,846
So...

67
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:13,723
Are you coming back to be my bodyguard?

68
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:17,518
Well, I'm lying here.

69
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,911
Do you still need to ask that?

70
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,366
You wanna call your brother?

71
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:40,982
Of course.

72
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,909
Can I?

73
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,719
Hello, Chay.

74
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,323
Hello, bro.

75
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:17,726
Where are you?

76
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:19,654
I came back and I missed you.

77
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,654
Are you doing alright?

78
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:24,097
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

79
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,097
I miss you, bro, how are you?

80
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,020
I miss you so damn much.
Got to see you just a bit, hasn't eased me at all.

81
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,020
If you're free, come over to see me again, alright?

82
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:37,709
Sure.

83
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,599
I love you, Chay.

84
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:44,605
Take a good care of yourself.

85
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,614
I love you the most in the whole world, bro.

86
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,390
Thank you.

87
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,050
Are you still hurt?

88
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,756
The wound is quite far from the heart.

89
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,366
What a mouth!

90
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,866
That means you're still alright.
