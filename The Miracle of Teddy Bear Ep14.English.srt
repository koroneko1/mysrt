1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,039
Ask your mom

2
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,599
why your dad used to call you

3
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,840
a bastard.

4
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,919
Do you and Uncle Saen
still love each other?

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Am I really a bastard like Dad said?

6
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560
Don't say that.

7
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,520
Is anyone inside the house?
Come out this instant.

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,719
Did you see the way
they were looking at us?

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,280
Do you really think
they came here to get Tofu's memory back?

10
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,879
You should live in the present.

11
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,360
You should use the time to worry
about your loved ones' feelings.

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
You are confusing Tofu

13
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,400
by expressing countless concerns
toward your ex-boyfriend.

14
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,039
She said…

15
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm showing symptoms of Alzheimer's.

16
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,280
Since your mom is already sick,

17
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,000
why don't we find a way to help her?

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,159
I suspect there is still some evidence
remaining in the house.

19
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,319
Our forensics team even found the blood

20
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
that was wiped clean.

21
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you think
they could've missed something?

22
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,879
A bit of broken tile.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
How did it get there?

24
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,039
And how did you know?

25
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,879
I found a bit of broken tile
in a cactus at Tatarn's house.

26
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Could it be related to the case?

27
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,319
Do you mind checking it for me?

28
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,079
Lieutenant Kong.

29
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Can you find an old picture of the house,
so we can compare?

30
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,319
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,120
Hey.

32
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,879
Why did you come here?

33
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,600
I told you not to come here.

34
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,360
My employee said
the police went to Tatarn's house.

35
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,560
See? Those kids
are really causing us trouble.

36
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,120
You should've discussed with me
before letting them in.

37
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,279
You're too careless.

38
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
You're the careless one.

39
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,800
If you hadn't stepped in,
it would've been much easier.

40
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,079
I stepped in
because I was worried about you.

41
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,240
If you hadn't attacked him,
I wouldn't have to put myself in danger.

42
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,560
Are you threatening me?

43
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,920
I'm just trying to warn you.

44
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,879
Stop trying.

45
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,519
I won't back down.

46
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,399
What do you hope to gain?

47
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,079
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

48
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,439
It's not going to bring about any change.

49
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,439
Things might not change today,

50
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,240
but they will in the future.

51
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,560
Time is on our side.

52
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,240
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

53
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,720
Winning might take time,

54
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,439
but that day will come.

55
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,240
But power is on their side.

56
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,879
We have to get that power on our side.

57
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,040
The people should have the power,
so that problems can be solved.

58
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,639
Am I supposed to give up
and be a coward like you?

59
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,839
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

60
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,079
and behave immorally like you?

61
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,920
I can't do it.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,319
Mr. Saen…

63
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,560
hit your nephew's head.

64
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,560
Secretly keep an eye on him

65
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,800
and keep me posted.

66
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,199
I'm heading there now.

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,079
I stayed put like you told me to,

68
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,879
but trouble still found us.

69
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,759
Are you sure

70
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,199
that nobody was in the house
other than you and your men?

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,040
Why? Who do you suspect?

72
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Tofu.

73
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,439
He might actually know Tarn.

74
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,439
He could have been in the house that day
and has seen the whole thing.

75
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,160
That's why he moved
to the house next door,

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,600
and lied about his amnesia
in order to keep an eye on us.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,040
Did you see the way he looked at us?

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
It's as if he knows something.

79
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,480
Think about it.
He went to the house yesterday.

80
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,600
Today, the police went
there for something.

81
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,519
How did this happen?

82
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
We don't know for sure what the cause is.

83
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,079
According to studies,

84
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,319
there are multiple factors that can be
the cause of Alzheimer's disease.

85
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,800
It may be due to age,

86
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,480
genetics,

87
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,600
brain trauma,

88
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,279
or brain infections.

89
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,320
These can cause changes in brain cells.

90
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,159
As brain cells deteriorate,

91
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
the patients start losing memories.

92
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,840
This affects thinking

93
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,120
and decision-making.

94
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,840
They will be forgetful,

95
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,039
and won't be able to learn new things.

96
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,440
To be honest,

97
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,720
the chance of Alzheimer's disease

98
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,840
for someone
in their fifties like you is slim.

99
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,879
Especially for someone
who has had a mental illness,

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,840
the chance is incredibly slim.

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,200
But looking at your symptoms,

102
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,960
it's most likely

103
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,639
that it is Alzheimer's disease.

104
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,759
But we should still monitor the symptoms.

105
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,519
Why didn't you tell me about it last time?

106
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,039
I was afraid you would worry.

107
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
I thought I would tell you about it
after your trip.

108
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,200
I didn't expect that incident
in Chiang Mai.

109
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
It doesn't matter.

110
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Now that we know about it,

111
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,320
let's do our best
to look after her from now on.

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Exactly.

113
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,000
We can't cure Alzheimer's disease,

114
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,200
but if we find out and treat it early,
and take good care of ourselves,

115
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,279
it will slow down the disease progression.

116
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,639
We can also prevent the danger
of other complications.

117
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,840
To treat Alzheimer's disease,

118
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,399
you can use drugs and other methods.

119
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,480
These are the drugs I'm prescribing.

120
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,120
One is for temporarily reducing symptoms,

121
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,879
and the other is for suppressing
brain deteriorating chemicals.

122
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,120
The patient can lead
a relatively normal life.

123
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,960
You will feel bright,

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,759
which will be easier on the caretaker.

125
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,799
Where's Tofu?

126
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
Let's go, Mrs. Na.

127
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,399
Shoot.

128
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,480
But what's more important than drugs

129
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,159
is taking care of the brain,

130
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,639
along with caring
for your physical and mental health.

131
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,960
Research has found

132
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,799
that regular exercise

133
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,879
freshens up the brain

134
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,360
and extends the disease progression.

135
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,200
It is also important

136
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,639
for the patient to socialize
and meet up with people

137
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,840
apart from household members.

138
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,200
I noticed that your lights were still on.

139
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,600
I realized I hadn't unpacked.

140
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you need a hand?

141
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,279
I can put the suitcase away
for you tomorrow.

142
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Thanks.

143
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,000
Is Nut asleep?

144
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,679
Not yet.

145
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,440
He's rather enthusiastic.

146
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,559
He's reading Gen's book.

147
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,679
I have to thank you for taking care of us.

148
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,480
You don't have to thank me.

149
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,039
Both of you take good care of me too.

150
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,879
It's not the same.

151
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,120
I may be…

152
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
a little forgetful,

153
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,879
but… I know my son well.

154
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,919
Nut is a handful,

155
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,879
especially when he's upset.

156
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm really thankful to you

157
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,320
for accepting who he is and not giving up.

158
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,759
From now on, my condition…

159
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
will keep getting worse.

160
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,759
I won't be the same and…

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
I'll cause a lot more problems for him.

162
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,840
I would like to ask you

163
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,559
to stay calm

164
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,519
and…

165
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,120
forever remain so nice to our family.

166
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,120
Don't leave Nut.

167
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,360
I don't want him to lose another person
who he loves and loves him back.

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,279
I promise.

169
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
I'll stay and take care of you

170
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,600
and take care of Nut.

171
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,480
I'll never leave.

172
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,240
I'll take care of Nut forever.

173
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,559
It's not just my job,

174
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,240
but it's my life's vocation.

175
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
Thank you.

176
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,080
You're as focused
as when you were studying for exams.

177
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,840
Have you seen me studying for exams?

178
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,759
Who knows?

179
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,399
I might have seen you.

180
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,679
You just didn't care about me.

181
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,039
Come here, then.

182
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,799
So…

183
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,440
Read it to me.

184
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,159
Your voice might make me less sad.

185
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,039
"Your mother behaves
and speaks differently.

186
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,080
After a checkup,

187
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,759
Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed.

188
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,799
The patient can still speak normally.

189
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,759
Her memories remain.

190
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,960
This means
she's still in the early stages."

191
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,720
It says that…

192
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,919
Mom will keep losing her memory

193
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
and her ability to help herself.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,039
She'll forget how to chew.

195
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,759
She'll even forget how to breathe.

196
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,759
Don't be afraid.

197
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,799
No matter what happens,

198
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,600
we'll keep fighting.

199
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,720
Let's make the rest of your mom's memories

200
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,559
good memories.

201
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Thank you.

202
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,920
UNCLE SAEN

203
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
-Yes, Uncle Saen.
-Where are you?

204
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,519
I just got off work.
We barely talked yesterday.

205
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,119
I'll swing by to see you.

206
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,279
I'm already home.

207
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,160
Why so fast?

208
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,519
My mom is sick.

209
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,200
I took her to the hospital.

210
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,680
What happened?

211
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,240
She has Alzheimer's.

212
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,200
You don't have to worry.

213
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,640
I'll take care of her.

214
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
Be careful.

215
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,839
Kuenchai.

216
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,000
Gosh.

217
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,119
So noisy.

218
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,440
Who's that?

219
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,599
It's me.

220
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,880
It feels so nice to have a wash.

221
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,759
It was so stuffy in there.

222
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,519
Was it your voice I heard the other day?

223
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:57,759
I was the only one
who would wake up in that room.

224
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,960
Wait a minute.

225
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,880
Actually…

226
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,400
Does this mean

227
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
you've woken up before?

228
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,599
When was that?

229
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,960
I'm not sure.

230
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,559
I remember that there were

231
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
Mr. Sibmeun and Mrs. Na in the house.

232
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,160
Mrs. Na was still pregnant with Nut.

233
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,920
One day, they brought baby Nut home.

234
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,240
He kept crying

235
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,839
that Mr. Sibmeun and Mrs. Na
had to cradle him all night long.

236
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,480
What's next?

237
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,640
This house was filled
with happiness back then.

238
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,400
Both of them loved Nut so much.

239
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,640
Mrs. Na would tell him stories

240
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,119
even when he was so young.

241
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,799
Mr. Sib would buy him toys.

242
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,839
But as Nut grew up,

243
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,039
the two of them started to fight.

244
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,000
Nut is a normal boy like anyone else.

245
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,519
Can't you see how girly he is?

246
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,119
After that, they didn't use me as much.

247
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,359
It's probably because…

248
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,640
you're a keepsake from Mr. Saen,

249
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,440
so Mr. Sibmeun didn't want to see you.

250
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Mrs. Na put me in the closet.

251
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,839
I would fall asleep from time to time.

252
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,039
I remember a time
when I woke up because it was so hot.

253
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,440
Do you love him?

254
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,440
I almost died because of Mr. Sib.

255
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,599
Thank goodness Mrs. Na saved me.

256
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,119
After that day,
I was moved to the storage room,

257
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,319
and I've been sleeping since.

258
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,160
I saw it in the storage room,

260
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,519
so I washed it for you.

261
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,960
I'll put it back

262
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,599
once it's dry.

263
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,720
That's okay.

264
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,480
I don't use it anymore.

265
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,839
I'll take a look.

266
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,519
Hello, Uncle Saen.

267
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
Go ahead. Mom is inside.

268
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,039
Come here, Kuenchai.

269
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,519
What do you think Mr. Saen is like
when he's angry?

270
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,759
Why are you asking that?

271
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,599
I'm just wondering.

272
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,200
From what I know about him,

273
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,720
he always seems kind and considerate.

274
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
I can't imagine what it's like

275
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
when someone like him gets mad.

276
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,799
I don't see him that often,

277
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,000
but he usually takes care of Mom and me.

278
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,640
He really loves his family.

279
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
He even stepped back for Dad

280
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,359
when they fought over Mom.

281
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,000
He didn't get mad when Dad made trouble.

282
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,440
He's very calm.

283
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,799
I've never seen him mad
except when it comes to Jan.

284
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,079
I assume family members…

285
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,519
wouldn't hurt each other.

286
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,359
Are you worried about Jan?

287
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,400
I don't know about his family,

288
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
but I believe that…

289
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
he's not the same as my dad.

290
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,720
You seem livelier than I expected.

291
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
I have no reason to be sad.

292
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,759
Nut gets worried when I'm sad.

293
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,359
This disease has made me realize

294
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,279
that I don't have much time left
to live a life with memories.

295
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,680
So I would rather use
the rest of my memories

296
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,960
for good things

297
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,319
and happy things.

298
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,799
I'm sorry

299
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,599
for being one of the reasons
that you ended up this way.

300
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,119
Don't be.

301
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,400
I know you've done a lot of things for me

302
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
and helped relieve my sadness.

303
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,279
I'm sick from my own doings.

304
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,039
I blamed myself that my family suffered
because I chose the wrong husband.

305
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,559
I felt sorry for myself,

306
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,400
for Sibmeun,

307
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
for Nut,

308
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,079
and for you.

309
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,400
Those feelings didn't just…

310
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,920
weaken my heart,

311
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,960
they destroyed my body.

312
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,759
It's a shame

313
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
that I realized this too late.

314
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,240
Had I fixed it earlier,

315
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,880
I wouldn't have suffered

316
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,720
and I wouldn't have been sick
all this time.

317
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,519
I'll forget it soon enough.

318
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,319
You'll probably suffer more

319
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,240
since you remember all of it.

320
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,720
If you don't want
a twisted, tormented life like mine,

321
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
you'll have to live mindfully.

322
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,319
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

323
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,559
Don't neglect them
and drown in regret like I did.

324
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't want you to end up like me.

325
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,640
Thank you for visiting Mom.

326
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,759
I don't know if I can come again.

327
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,160
It will be even harder on you from now on,

328
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,200
having to take care of two sick people.

329
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,960
You can call me whenever you need to.

330
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,039
One person lost his memory.

331
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,720
Another person is losing hers.

332
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,960
Who knows?

333
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,599
I might remember something soon.

334
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,599
Actually,

335
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm starting to see more things.

336
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,039
I can't piece them together just yet,

337
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,119
but I think

338
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,720
I might remember everything soon.

339
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,559
When that time comes,

340
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,000
I might find out

341
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,559
what happened to Tatarn.

342
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,240
That would be great.

343
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,759
Tarn's case will finally progress.

344
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,759
I don't know

345
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,720
why Tatarn was attacked,

346
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,440
but nobody

347
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,640
should be harmed, should they?

348
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,960
Not everyone

349
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,880
is blessed with humanity.

350
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,359
People can hurt each other

351
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,119
over simple disagreements.

352
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,799
Conflicts of interest

353
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,400
can lead to murder.

354
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,079
When we disagree,

355
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,119
shouldn't we talk about it reasonably?

356
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Shouldn't we try to understand

357
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,119
rather than fight?

358
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,039
-A fractured skull and a hemorrhage?
-Excuse me, sir.

359
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,680
We found no fingerprints
on the vase or the broken pieces.

360
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,759
Here's the report.

361
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,960
They probably thought
that it was well planned.

362
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,039
They must have thought
that they destroyed all the evidence.

363
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,519
Unfortunately,

364
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,759
they dropped some evidence
in the cactus pot.

365
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
It doesn't weigh much.

366
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,400
Why was his injury so severe?

367
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,359
Or, is the weapon not the vase?

368
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,039
According to the report,

369
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,920
if the weapon is really
a blunt, hard object like you said,

370
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,039
and if it's the vase in this photo,

371
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,720
could it really cause
a fractured skull and a hemorrhage?

372
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,720
That's right.

373
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,279
The vase would break after one hit.

374
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,440
The injuries suggest multiple hits.

375
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:33,160
I confirm that I diagnosed
according to his symptoms.

376
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,160
A combination of things
could have caused the injuries,

377
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,839
not just the weapon's weight or shape,

378
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,960
It also depends on force

379
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,920
and other factors.

380
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,680
Unless

381
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,000
the weapon is not just this vase,

382
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,160
but another as well.

383
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,559
You'll have to live mindfully.

384
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,720
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

385
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,480
Don't neglect them
and drown in regret like I did.

386
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,960
Not everyone

387
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,039
is blessed with humanity.

388
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,519
People can hurt each other

389
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,079
over simple disagreements.

390
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,319
Conflicts of interest

391
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
can lead to murder.

392
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,640
Shouldn't we try to understand

393
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,599
rather than fight?

394
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,119
Yes.

395
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,680
I just got back. I'm at the parking lot.

396
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,440
I just found out

397
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,839
that you let people into that house.

398
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,400
The police called. I couldn't refuse.

399
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
The issue was dying down.

400
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,240
People were forgetting about it,
but you dug it back up.

401
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,039
You can't blame it all on me.

402
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,799
This whole thing happened
all because of you.

403
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,960
Get out! No more deforestation.

404
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,039
Get out! No more deforestation.

405
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,720
Get out! We don't want it. Is that right?

406
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,160
We don't want it. Get out!

407
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,079
Yes, Dad.

408
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,079
Don't worry.

409
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,960
I'll handle it as soon as possible.

410
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,240
Is the leader your wife's nephew?

411
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,640
-Yes. I warned him--
-Tell him to stop.

412
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,920
The board is getting upset.

413
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,480
You know how much we paid him
to settle this deal.

414
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,720
It cannot fail from these stupid ideals.

415
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
I'm not sure if he'll listen.
He's pretty stubborn.

416
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,920
I don't care what he is.

417
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,319
All I care about
is that we continue this project.

418
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,119
If he doesn't stop,

419
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,079
you'll have to.

420
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,839
You…

421
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,640
Your future at TRD depends on yourself.

422
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,000
You ordered me to do it.

423
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,759
I did, but you didn't succeed.

424
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,799
I had to clean up for you.

425
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,319
I kept him alive for your sake.

426
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
That's why this is all messed up.

427
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,960
Right now, my father, the board,

428
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,160
and the investors are all pressuring me.

429
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,079
And the police are snooping around.

430
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,039
I have to do something

431
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,000
before we're all ruined.

432
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,440
What will you do?

433
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:00,799
If your wife's nephew is such a nuisance,

434
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,480
I'll end it myself.

435
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,559
The book that Nut
was reading yesterday said that

436
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,079
this seemingly harmless disease

437
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,119
can eat up the patient

438
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,760
and spit out the empty shell

439
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,320
without the person's identity inside.

440
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
The movie Nut watched the other day

441
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,400
also said

442
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,119
that cancer is better than this.

443
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,960
It sounds terrifying,

444
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,559
but seeing her now…

445
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,679
You're awake.

446
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,679
Yes.

447
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,840
Nut went to bed late, so he isn't up yet.

448
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

449
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,039
I wake up early every day.

450
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:00,559
You and Nut are the only ones
who always wake up late.

451
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,400
-I was meaning to ask.
-Yes?

452
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,280
Do you like wood sorrels?

453
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,519
Well…

454
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
It's a flower that sticks in my memory.

455
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
I used to live in Soi Butterfly,

456
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,880
and that alley was lined
with wood sorrels.

457
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,119
That was what they called the alley.

458
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,719
When I first moved here,

459
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,280
I felt a little out of place,

460
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,800
so I planted these here.

461
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,760
These flowers made this place feel
warm and familiar like the old house.

462
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,159
I'm used to this house now, though.

463
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,159
And I…

464
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,719
love this house as much as the old one.

465
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,280
A house that is a home.

466
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,679
I like this house too.

467
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,119
I also like that you're cheerful.

468
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,239
I know Nut and you are worried about me.

469
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,519
But since my disease can't be cured,

470
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,400
don't worry about curing it.

471
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,960
The drugs are just slowing it down,

472
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,079
but my body worsens every day.

473
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,920
I think…

474
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,360
From now on, let's live.

475
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,559
Through both joy and sorrow…

476
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,880
until my memories fade away.

477
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,480
I read somewhere

478
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,199
that the thing that Alzheimer's
can't take away from us…

479
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,639
is love.

480
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,599
Sometimes, the sooner we accept the truth,

481
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,960
the sooner our wound heals.

482
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,519
THIS WAY TO THE BEDROOM

483
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,079
What's this?

484
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,199
I registered your information
at The Mirror Foundation,

485
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,159
and they gave us this wristband.

486
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,840
It's filled with all of your information.

487
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,960
In case you get lost
and someone finds you,

488
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,760
they'll know where to drop you off.

489
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,639
So…

490
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,360
you must wear it at all times.

491
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
Don't take it off.

492
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,800
Next.

493
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,719
-What's it?
-The number is…

494
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,119
-Sixty-two.
-Sixty-two.

495
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,679
-I have it.
-You do.

496
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,159
-I have it, too.
-I don't.

497
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
This one.

498
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,119
What's the number?

499
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,599
-Forty-six.
-Forty-six.

500
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,119
-I have it.
-What?

501
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,760
Why don't I have it?

502
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,800
Wait a minute.

503
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,039
-Kuenchai got bingo.
-What?

504
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,360
-Oh, wow. Great job.
-That's awesome.

505
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,039
Great job.

506
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,280
Give me your hand.

507
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,199
-Great job.
-Another one.

508
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,039
Since it can't be avoided,

509
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,639
we'll hold onto it.

510
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,239
We'll use this pain as an opportunity

511
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,039
to bring us even closer.

512
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,039
It smells so good.

513
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,960
What are you making today?

514
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,599
Tofu with tamarind sauce.

515
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,079
What?

516
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,480
-Mom.
-What?

517
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,599
You got Tofu all confused.

518
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,079
I only heard of eggs with tamarind sauce.

519
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,960
Well,

520
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,599
they're similar.

521
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,679
I changed the eggs to tofu.

522
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,280
I like the name of this dish.

523
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,719
So…

524
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,880
what are the ingredients?

525
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,440
There is

526
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,239
hard tofu.

527
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,920
There are also red onions,

528
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,079
dried chili,

529
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,920
and…

530
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,199
Here, Mom.

531
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,320
There's cilantro, tamarind,

532
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,880
and palm sugar.

533
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
Some recipes also add garlic and sesame.

534
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,800
-Mom.
-What?

535
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,199
Should we try new recipes someday?

536
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,679
There is a lot here.

537
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,039
Sounds good.

538
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,199
-Should I help?
-Sure.

539
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,840
What are there?

540
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Here.

541
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
The bread looks delicious.

542
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,440
The sweets look good.

543
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,679
What sweet?

544
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,920
What does it say?

545
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,039
Can we order it?

546
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,800
-Let's just bake it. It's much cheaper.
-Fine.

547
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,199
Here.

548
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,480
-I'll take a look.
-Okay.

549
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,360
-Hi, Prib.
-Hi.

550
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Long time no see. You're still handsome.

551
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,920
You, too.

552
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,079
I'm still pretty, right?

553
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,039
Do you want to come in?

554
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,800
I haven't seen Nut in weeks.

555
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,400
He barely goes to the office.

556
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,760
Even Uncle Juea is missing him.

557
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,239
He asked me to bring Nut the new project.

558
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,599
Is there a new project?

559
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,360
He hasn't finished the old one.

560
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
I can handle it.

561
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,559
It's better to have money.

562
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,840
In case we need it.

563
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,000
I won't get overworked.

564
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,639
You're taking care of me.

565
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,920
It must be harder on you,

566
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,239
having to take care of two people.

567
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,440
It's all right.

568
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,679
I'm happy to do it.

569
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,840
I better find Mrs. Na.

570
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,000
I feel invisible here.

571
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,199
-Hello.
-Hello.

572
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,519
You are…

573
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,440
It's Prib,

574
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,599
my coworker.

575
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,280
-Right. Prib.
-Yes.

576
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,519
I'm sorry. I couldn't remember your name.
Don't mind me.

577
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Don't worry.

578
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,480
I can introduce myself
every time you forget.

579
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,199
I'm a great talker.

580
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,960
Stay for dinner.

581
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,440
Definitely.

582
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,280
Please excuse me.
I have to fill Kuenchai's bowl.

583
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:16,960
Kuenchai already ate.

584
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,800
He won't be able to walk if he eats more.

585
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,360
Wait.

586
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,000
It smells like…

587
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,519
-It smells like--
-Hey!

588
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,000
Be careful, Nut.

589
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,280
Move aside.

590
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,800
Why didn't you turn it off?

591
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,719
I told you to be careful.

592
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,760
What would you do if you were alone?

593
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,000
I forgot.

594
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,760
It's all right, Mrs. Na.

596
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,360
How's it going, Nut? How's the script?

597
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,039
Nut.

598
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,920
You've been doing a great job.

599
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,280
Don't blame yourself.

600
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,360
You did great.

601
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,920
Thank you.

602
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,159
What for?

603
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,119
Everything.

604
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,039
Thank you for staying beside me

605
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
when I feel alone.

606
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,079
And I'm sorry

607
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:43,320
for bringing you into this

608
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,639
when you're suffering from memory loss.

609
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,719
I have to thank you too,

610
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,320
for letting me stay here

611
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,320
and always missing me,

612
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,840
even when you have a lot to think about.

613
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,719
And I'm sorry

614
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,480
that I can't help much.

615
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,000
This is more than enough.

616
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:19,719
With you hugging me like this,

617
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,360
I have enough strength to go on.

618
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,320
You can recharge anytime.

619
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,760
I'll be right here.

620
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,719
Eat this, Mrs. Na.

621
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:08,679
Eat up.

622
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,039
Thanks.

623
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,599
-Mom.
-What is it?

624
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,639
I want to host a party.

625
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,679
What party?

626
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,960
Is it for a birthday?

627
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,320
I don't recall anyone's birthday
around this time.

628
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,519
That's not it.

629
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,760
I want to host a party just because.

630
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,400
Just because?

631
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,800
Then please do.

632
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,519
I don't even know some of their faces.

633
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,639
Then we should just invite close friends.

634
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,440
I saw this album in the storage room.

635
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,119
Do you want to take a look?
We might find photos of your friends.

636
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,039
"All grown-ups

637
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,199
were children first,

638
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,880
but few of them remember it."

639
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:49,920
That's from The Little Prince.

640
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,599
Right.

641
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,519
I suddenly remembered it.

642
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,519
When I was a teacher,

643
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:01,599
I would stop the children when I see them

644
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:03,320
doing something strange.

645
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,280
But I had actually done

646
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,239
the same things when I was their age.

647
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,239
Being a grown-up
makes me forget the child in me.

648
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,159
I live in a world of benefits,

649
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,440
filled with numbers and competitions.

650
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,440
Just like how Dad used to ask me

651
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:33,880
where I was ranked

652
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,039
and how my grades were.

653
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:41,800
He never asked me
how my classes went, if I enjoyed it,

654
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,079
or if I liked it.

655
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Dad and I are sorry.

656
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,599
We lost our childhoods along the way.

657
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,320
Our childhood memories

658
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,239
shape who we are today.

659
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,800
But as we grow up,

660
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,760
we tend to forget those times.

661
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,920
We lose our own Little Prince

662
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,960
along with our imagination and dreams.

663
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:31,679
I just noticed
that we have no family photo.

664
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,039
I never thought it was a real family.

665
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,639
And I don't know who to show it to.

666
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,440
We don't really have visitors.

667
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,280
Also,

668
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,039
we rarely take photos together.

669
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,480
As I remember, the last time…

670
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,039
was probably on a trip.

671
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,159
I was around eight years old.

672
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,039
Shall we take a family photo?

673
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:05,360
We're about to host a party.
We can show it to them.

674
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,719
The party will be at the garden.

675
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,960
We can place it at the garden.

676
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,800
I think we should just frame

677
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,480
the ones we have.

678
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,320
Those photos were for fun.

679
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,159
I want a serious photo.

680
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,159
Whatever you say.

681
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,400
I'll take Mom to a photo studio.

682
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,679
No.

683
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,239
I want to take it in the house.

684
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,480
What?

685
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:32,679
The house…

686
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:34,360
Well,

687
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,719
this house is our memory.

688
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,360
Your mom said she likes this place.

689
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,920
I do too.

690
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,480
Let's take the photo here.

691
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,760
Here it is.

692
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:48,480
But…

693
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,000
we need some assistance.

694
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,840
Get closer.

695
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,840
Okay. Ready?

696
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,280
Oh, wow.

697
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,920
The models look so great.

698
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
You can blame me
if the photos don't turn out well.

699
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,119
All right.

700
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,920
One, two, three.

701
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,599
What's with you?

702
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,639
I want a photo shoot too.

703
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:37,400
What type of photo shoot?

704
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,559
Like this one.

705
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,639
A family photo shoot.

706
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,679
You better ask your dad.

707
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,920
If Dad agrees,

708
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,320
we have to dress up nicer than this.

709
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,119
Fine. Give me that.

710
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,239
Why the rush?

711
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,280
I have to go. I still have work to do.

712
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,519
Thank you, Prib.

713
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:16,880
-Let me know when you get there.
-Okay.

714
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,440
I'll get going, then.

715
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,480
Thank you, Gen.

716
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,440
You, too, Song.

717
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,119
Sure thing. I'll see you.

718
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,199
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

719
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:59,760
UNCLE JUEA

720
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,679
What is it, Uncle Juea?

721
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:08,239
How was Nut's photo shoot?

722
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:11,320
All good.

723
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,880
I'm heading back now.
I'll show you the photos.

724
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Once you see them,

725
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,519
you'll want them as film references.

726
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,280
Oh, wow. Are they that good?

727
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,079
They were like wedding photos.

728
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:26,199
Gen did an amazing job.

729
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:28,639
I see.

730
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,320
A boys' love fan like you
must be over the moon.

731
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,360
I would be if it was actually possible.

732
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,599
I wish they would legalize
same-sex marriage.

733
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:40,880
Shouldn't we all benefit from the law

734
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,760
when it's created for everyone?

735
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,039
Tofu.

736
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,960
It will take all night at this rate.

737
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:30,800
You look good today.

738
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,280
I want to see more of you in this outfit.

739
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:36,360
You look good too.

740
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,039
Just like in my dreams.

741
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,760
Have you dreamed of me?

742
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,320
A long time ago.

743
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:48,360
Well,

744
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,159
if you like it,

745
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:53,719
should we sleep in these outfits tonight

746
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,440
without showering?

747
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,679
What?

748
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,400
So you can take a good look.

749
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,320
Thank you

750
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,320
for letting me into your family.

751
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,400
Ouch. Nut!

752
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,000
Don't get too emotional.

753
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,000
Get in the shower.

754
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,079
I want to sleep.

755
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,320
All right.

756
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,400
Then…

757
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,760
can we keep the outfits

758
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,599
and wear them to the party?

759
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,440
It's a simple event.
We don't need to dress up.

760
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,840
Everyone there will be Mom's guests.

761
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,039
We're all friends.

762
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:07,079
I don't want you to look too good.

763
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,280
Mom's friends will faint.

764
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,760
Fine.

765
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,239
I'll only look good for you, then.

766
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,079
Nut.

767
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,599
Good boy.

768
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,679
I'll go take a shower.

769
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,960
Nut.

770
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,400
What's a party like?

771
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:44,239
Is it something with flashing lights,

772
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,960
people dancing,

773
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,519
and falling confetti?

774
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,239
Is it going to be fun like that?

775
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,960
-How are you?
-I'm good.

776
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:00,119
You're still so pretty.

777
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:01,480
-You look the same.
-Thanks.

778
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:04,039
-Su and Na are here.
-They are?

779
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:06,039
-It has been so long.
-It has been so long.

780
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,280
Let's head in.

781
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,519
-Hey, host.
-Pritr!

782
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,400
They're dancing.

783
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,280
How's this?

784
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,960
Aren't they having fun?

785
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,639
Just seeing your mom happy

786
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,320
makes me happy.

787
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,679
Oh…

788
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,599
be careful.

789
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,239
Hello.

790
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,920
-Hello.
-I'm sorry.

791
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,920
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

792
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,199
How could we miss it?

793
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,119
It's a rare occasion for this house
to host a party.

794
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,159
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

795
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,599
Tofu. Set the table for Chu and Nhong.

796
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:03,800
Okay.

797
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,960
I never thought I would see this house
with such atmosphere.

798
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:10,960
-Me neither.
-Right.

799
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:13,239
Is it Tofu's doing?

800
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,719
Yes.

801
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,599
I got to this point, thanks to Tofu.

802
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,760
-I should help Tofu.
-Go ahead.

803
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,559
You can grab the water.

804
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:30,519
I can't help but envy them.

805
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,320
We can't host such a party. We live alone.

806
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,880
We have no friends or family.
It's just the two of us.

807
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,039
Don't envy them.
It's nice to have a happy family.

808
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,519
We don't need a big family,

809
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,480
children,

810
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,039
or a marriage license.

811
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,880
It doesn't matter what people think.

812
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,079
It's up to the two of us, okay?

813
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,199
We are a family.

814
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,840
Like how Tofu is Nut's family, right?

815
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,639
Right.

816
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,400
He's more than family.

817
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,199
-Make yourself at home.
-Okay.

818
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,199
-Mom made this.
-Did she?

819
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,199
-Hello
-Hello.

820
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,320
-Thank you.
-It's great.

821
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,679
You haven't eaten yet.

822
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,039
Please excuse me.

823
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,880
Are you tired, Tofu?

824
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,280
Thank you for helping me with the guests.

825
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,840
No problem.

826
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,719
I've never done anything like this.

827
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,960
It's quite fun.

828
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:40,119
Na.

829
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,000
Saen.

830
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,079
I'm happy to see you happy and healthy.

831
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:48,639
How can she be healthy?

832
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,360
Alzheimer's destroys health.

833
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,639
Lucky you have a son.

834
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:54,840
Nut is behaving better.

835
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,519
He probably won't let you get sick
and burden people again.

836
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:02,400
It's probably hard on you,

837
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,440
suffering from two diseases back to back.

838
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,119
What kind of karma is this?

839
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,159
Jan.

840
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:10,400
If you can't speak nice, then don't.

841
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,599
I'm sorry.

842
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,559
Jan tends to say hurtful things.

843
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,280
Hurtful is different

844
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,079
from disrespectful.

845
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,199
As I recall,

846
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,719
I only invited Uncle Saen.

847
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,119
You came here uninvited.

848
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:34,079
If you can't behave,

849
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:35,440
then you should leave.

850
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,320
This event is for my mom.

851
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,199
I want her to be surrounded
by good people.

852
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,639
Calm down, Nut.

853
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,320
As long as she's here,

854
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,159
let's welcome her.

855
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,599
I don't mind it.

856
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,760
I understand that this is who you are.

857
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,480
Well,

858
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,800
you may think that…

859
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm selfish

860
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:05,719
and I'm being a burden to my son
because of my sickness.

861
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,599
Since we can't choose what disease we get,

862
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,079
all I can do is to accept it
and live the best I can.

863
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,800
It's good that you realize that,
so you can find peace.

864
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,039
Excuse me.

865
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,320
Sorry for interrupting.

866
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,679
It's time for the highlight.

867
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,280
Should we get ready?

868
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:34,599
Nut.

869
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,480
Take your mom.

870
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:39,280
Song is waiting.

871
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,199
Let's go, Mom.

872
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:49,000
Please enjoy.

873
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,719
Mrs. Na.

874
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,719
What song will you choose?

875
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,880
If you're staying,

876
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,119
I'll find you a table.

877
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,280
Follow me.

878
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,320
If you can't behave,

879
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,559
don't sit with me.

880
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:07,639
I'm embarrassed.

881
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:29,760
What is it?

882
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,760
Do I look more handsome?
You keep staring at me.

883
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,079
I guess.

884
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:37,440
I saw the photo of you in a suit.

885
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,119
You looked different.

886
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,719
Are you surprised?

887
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,840
There may be more surprises
coming your way.

888
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:47,000
Get ready for them.

889
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,519
I mean,

890
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,559
get ready for my handsomeness.

891
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:55,880
I'll look better every day.

892
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:00,880
We're starting soon.

893
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,360
Please excuse me.

894
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,320
Hello, everyone.

895
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,039
Hello.

896
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:28,039
You might wonder
why I suddenly invited you all here today

897
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,000
when I rarely ever did anything like this

898
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,119
the whole time we've known each other.

899
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,679
To tell you the truth,

900
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,719
I have Alzheimer's.

901
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,159
What?

902
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,880
I'm sorry if I've dampened the party,

903
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,760
but I've decided that it didn't matter

904
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,599
when I told you.

905
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:59,960
When I first found out,
my reaction was the same as yours now.

906
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:03,840
I was confused. I didn't know
what to say or what to do.

907
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,679
When I got a hold of myself,

908
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,280
I started preparing

909
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,639
and researched about the disease.

910
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,679
This disease
will strip me away of memories,

911
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,320
skills,

912
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:23,360
and my pride,

913
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,360
little by little.

914
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,320
Finally, I know that I'll start
to lose myself.

915
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,679
I'll turn into…

916
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:34,760
someone else.

917
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:40,599
All of this got me

918
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,039
to decide to stay in the present

919
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:45,400
and…

920
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,519
strengthen our family ties.

921
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,920
I know

922
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,719
that it will be harder on them
in the future.

923
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,239
From now on,

924
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,079
your mom may turn into
someone new every day.

925
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,960
I may turn into someone
who can't help myself.

926
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:18,760
I may be unreasonable,

927
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,640
clumsy,

928
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,920
and I may do things…

929
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,439
foolishly

930
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,840
or in a silly manner.

931
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,840
But I always know

932
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,600
that you'll never leave me.

933
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,479
You've always taken good care of me.

934
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,279
I want you to take care
of your own heart too.

935
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,880
This includes

936
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,760
everyone here.

937
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,119
In the end,

938
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,399
it may hurt

939
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,880
that I won't remember you.

940
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,960
You may be the only one who remembers me.

941
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,920
If that day comes,

942
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,920
I want all of you to know that…

943
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,720
even though you won't be in my memories,

944
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,079
I believe that you'll remain in my heart.

945
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:50,159
Thank you everyone for coming today.

946
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,079
I also

947
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,560
thank my son
for having the idea for this party.

948
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:58,960
I just want

949
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,920
to gather all the memories
and the love of everyone once again.

950
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,840
I may be sad, but let's have some fun.

951
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:15,800
I want my last memory with all of you

952
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,159
to be filled with happiness.

953
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:49,439
It doesn't matter who you were

954
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,119
You introduced me to a new world

955
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:58,840
I learned what love and compassion are

956
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:05,239
-When I someone I love
-Loves me back

957
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:09,439
You lifted my heart

958
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,000
This worn-out heart finally sees
Some wonderful days ever since

959
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:21,239
You became a part of my life

960
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:25,640
You're my breath

961
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,640
I can't live without you

962
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,439
I heard some patients found miracles.

963
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:35,119
I guess Alzheimer's is different.

964
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,159
Since the world isn't so nice to us,

965
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,159
let's try our best instead.

966
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,920
Nut and I will do our best
to take care of his mom,

967
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:48,159
rather than give up

968
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,720
and let the disease
erase her identity forever.

969
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,960
I'm sorry.

970
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,600
I never knew how much you suffered

971
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,439
after you got married.

972
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:11,039
I shouldn't have pushed him on you.

973
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,319
Don't worry about it.

974
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:18,960
It's all in the past.

975
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,720
You didn't do anything wrong.

976
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,079
I made my own decisions.

977
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:27,479
I still feel bad about it.

978
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,479
Back then, Sibmeun was perfect
in every way.

979
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,760
I thought you could trust him
with your life.

980
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,880
Who would have known

981
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,920
that one day,

982
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:45,640
that man would turn your life upside down.

983
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,840
Nobody knows what lies ahead of us.

984
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,199
At that time,

985
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,439
we both tried…

986
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,560
our very best.

987
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,640
We chose what was best for us
at that time.

988
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:06,880
I'm really sorry.

989
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,079
I lost touch with you.

990
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:14,840
I never knew you were hurt
both physically and mentally.

991
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,119
Pritr.

992
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,680
You really don't have to apologize.

993
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:22,680
I'm not suffering as much anymore. Okay?

994
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,960
I chose to stay in the present.

995
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,720
I'm going to live every day
as best as I physically can.

996
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,039
If there's anything I can help with,
you must let me know.

997
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,880
I'm happy to help.

998
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,199
Your visits will be more than enough.

999
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,960
I promise.

1000
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:54,760
-Mom.
-What is it?

1001
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,960
They're asking for you.

1002
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,800
Okay.

1003
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,720
-I'll see you outside.
-Okay.

1004
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,560
Peeranut.

1005
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:30,279
What is it?

1006
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:34,479
I'm sorry.

1007
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:39,720
What I did in the past

1008
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,399
must have scarred you.

1009
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,680
I just want you to understand

1010
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,720
that I did everything I did

1011
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:51,000
because your father asked me
to take care of you.

1012
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,039
At that time,

1013
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,560
I thought it was better for you.

1014
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,880
On that day,

1015
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,239
I intended to call your mother.

1016
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:12,399
Na was my junior

1017
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:14,600
who I genuinely adored and cared for.

1018
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,159
I didn't want it to become an issue.

1019
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,880
Unfortunately, your father picked up.

1020
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,760
It's too late to say it now,

1021
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,960
but I'm really sorry.

1022
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:40,159
Did you also tell Dad…

1023
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:42,640
about the exam?

1024
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,439
I did it

1025
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,159
because…

1026
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:50,520
You meant well.

1027
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:55,920
You studied sciences in school.

1028
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,640
Why would you pursue arts?

1029
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,920
Engineering has better advantages
than Communication Arts.

1030
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:06,600
I should have pursued the army
like your son.

1031
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:08,640
That would have been the best.

1032
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:11,439
I might have become a prime minister.

1033
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,239
Back then,

1034
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,680
that's what I thought.

1035
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,680
But now,

1036
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,279
I know that it's better
to study what you like.

1037
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,680
I can see that you're successful now

1038
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,840
because you got to study what you wanted.

1039
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:33,359
Even if I failed,

1040
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:35,079
it's okay.

1041
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:36,239
What kids choose

1042
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,800
is what they have to live with.

1043
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:41,279
Adults aren't joining their kids
in school.

1044
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:44,039
They don't experience what the kids have.

1045
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,199
Even if they fail,

1046
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:48,720
they'll get to learn

1047
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,600
and grow.

1048
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:57,600
That's true.

1049
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:02,239
I'm sorry, Peeranut.

1050
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:06,560
I know

1051
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,079
that the world is moving forward,

1052
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,960
and people my age may be moving backwards.

1053
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:15,720
I'm trying.

1054
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,119
I'm slowly learning new things.

1055
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,359
I might not understand everything now…

1056
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:26,359
I might…

1057
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,880
not agree with some things.

1058
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:36,479
You don't need to agree with everything.

1059
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,199
Just trying to understand

1060
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:42,680
and not hurting anyone

1061
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,439
is good enough.

1062
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:51,000
If we understand each other more,

1063
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,239
not just you and I,

1064
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:56,720
or in school,

1065
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:59,199
but within families,

1066
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,640
maybe we'll all understand each other…

1067
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,640
someday.

1068
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,760
Do you like this one?

1069
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,840
I'm trying.

1070
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,800
You should've invited your dad.

1071
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:29,199
I guess he's busy

1072
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,359
since he's working on Tatarn's case.

1073
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:37,560
Why are you surprised?

1074
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:39,079
Didn't you know

1075
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:41,239
that Song's father was Mr. Anik?

1076
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,920
We weren't all together in Chiang Mai,

1077
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,239
so I didn't tell you.

1078
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:52,000
Do you have to tell her who my dad is?

1079
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,000
That's silly. Who would want to know?

1080
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:57,119
Maybe someone does.

1081
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,399
I just want to show off

1082
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:03,199
that I know someone with a rank.

1083
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,880
My dad is just a normal police officer.

1084
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,439
If you want to show off some big names,

1085
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,520
you should pick Gen's father.

1086
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,479
He's a navy admiral.

1087
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:19,920
You know more people than I expected

1088
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,520
for an amnesiac who always stays home.

1089
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,119
Isn't it beneficial
to have good connections?

1090
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,399
They may be able to help
if something happens.

1091
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:36,119
What help did you expect from my dad?

1092
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,800
He can't even help you

1093
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,520
find your family.

1094
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,199
That, he can't help with.

1095
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,760
Maybe he can help with something else.

1096
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:52,319
Oh, wow.

1097
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:55,199
Speak of the devil. Right on queue.

1098
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,039
Hi, Dad.

1099
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,119
Yes. That's great.

1100
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,960
You can stay longer this time.

1101
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,079
Yes. I'll see you.

1102
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:09,479
What did he say?

1103
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,439
Don't tell me.

1104
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,800
Is he free to join us now?

1105
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,880
No.

1106
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,600
He said he'll come to Bangkok.

1107
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,600
Mr. Saen moved Tarn to Bangkok,

1108
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,640
so Dad will follow him.

1109
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,239
I moved Tatarn to Bangkok.

1110
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,439
Why is that?

1111
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,039
It's because of what you said.

1112
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:39,960
What I said?

1113
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,159
You told me

1114
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,279
to correct my mistakes while I still can.

1115
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:49,279
Not to neglect them and drown in regret.

1116
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,319
I realized that Tatarn's condition
hasn't improved.

1117
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:54,640
And it could be because

1118
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,720
I made the wrong decision
to leave him there.

1119
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,640
I think that it would be better
to get treated by good doctors in Bangkok.

1120
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,960
I'll be able to visit you more from now on

1121
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,159
since I have to follow up on Tatarn too.

1122
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,880
You can tell me if Nut is busy
when you have doctor's appointments.

1123
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,960
I'll take you.

1124
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:22,279
Thank you very much
for always taking care of Nut and me.

1125
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,760
We would get to meet a lot more
if you moved next door.

1126
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,920
Actually, Jan and I…

1127
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,800
split a while ago.

1128
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,159
It's not because of work.

1129
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,840
We decided not to be together anymore.

1130
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:46,880
We haven't divorced,

1131
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,199
but the love is gone.

1132
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,479
That's what I thought too.

1133
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,800
But since it has nothing to do with me,
I decided not to pry.

1134
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:02,800
I wanted you to know.

1135
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,680
I wanted you to know
that we ended up this way

1136
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:11,239
because of Jan and Sib's vicious plan.

1137
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,560
The two of them…

1138
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,439
I know.

1139
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,359
I've known it for a while.

1140
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,760
Sib said it when he was drunk.

1141
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,960
Aren't you angry?

1142
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:32,960
I'm angrier at myself

1143
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,760
for being indecisive.

1144
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:39,399
As I said before,

1145
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,720
I'm totally fine with the present.

1146
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:45,399
I know you might not be,

1147
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,760
but I believe you can get through it.

1148
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:53,520
We've all

1149
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:56,640
been through painful things.

1150
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:00,119
I want us to let go of the past.

1151
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:02,800
Let's forgive ourselves,

1152
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:05,960
and live the rest of our lives happily.

1153
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,319
-Thank you all.
-It was fun.

1154
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:23,760
-Get home safe.
-Bye.

1155
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,199
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

1156
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:29,039
-Your singing was great.
-Happy to hear that.

1157
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:30,960
Enough compliments.

1158
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,600
-Thanks for coming.
-You sing a lot too.

1159
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,880
-Mom.
-Yes?

1160
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,920
-I'll clean up.
-Go ahead.

1161
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:50,560
Thank you for coming.

1162
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,640
Take care of yourself.

1163
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:54,479
You too.

1164
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,079
Saen.

1165
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:04,359
What are you doing?

1166
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,279
Why did you get me in trouble?

1167
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,199
What's this about?

1168
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:09,640
About Tatarn.

1169
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,079
I know you moved him to Bangkok.

1170
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,760
Why did you do that?

1171
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,720
You should've left him there.

1172
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,000
Your boss will cover for you
even if he dies.

1173
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:20,600
Why the sudden humanity?

1174
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,359
I don't want him in a vegetative state.

1175
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,640
I may be a bad person,
but he's our nephew.

1176
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,119
I have no reason to want him dead.

1177
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:31,600
You're the one

1178
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,600
who lacks humanity.

1179
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,600
He's your nephew,
but you've never cared for him.

1180
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,880
You just leave him there,
waiting for his death.

1181
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,920
Everything I did was for you.

1182
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,239
You never appreciated me.

1183
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,600
You destroyed us to impress Na.

1184
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,920
I didn't do it
just because of what she said,

1185
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:50,640
but I'm sick of it!

1186
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:54,640
I'm sick of getting pressured by everyone,

1187
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:57,159
including Sib, Mr. Sakon,

1188
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,760
Ms. Ching, and you.

1189
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,960
I'm sick of this kind of life!

1190
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:03,960
I want to let go of the past.

1191
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,119
I want to be able to forgive myself.

1192
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:09,560
I want to live the rest of my life happily
like what Na said,

1193
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,119
but I don't see how it can be possible.

1194
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:38,279
I know all good things
must come to an end,

1195
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,560
but it is so sad

1196
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:43,079
to see that what's left

1197
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,359
is loneliness.

1198
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:47,880
What we can savor

1199
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,199
are happiness

1200
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:51,720
and memories.

1201
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:56,239
For Mrs. Na, though,

1202
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:58,720
the memory of today

1203
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,199
will be short-lived.

1204
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:03,760
Alzheimer's

1205
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,560
is taking her away from everyone.

1206
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,319
She's fading away,

1207
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,199
but not dying.

1208
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,199
She's fading away,

1209
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:24,159
but not dying.

1210
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,279
She's fading away

1211
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,720
because her memories are perishing away.

1212
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,960
When her memories slowly disappear,

1213
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,600
her belongings

1214
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,920
slowly fall into slumber.

1215
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:45,920
This means

1216
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:48,880
that each item is where the owners

1217
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,880
store their memories.

1218
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,479
Mr. Rocking Chair.

1219
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,239
Ms. Sofa.

1220
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,039
Ms. Phone.

1221
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,439
Mr. Right Slipper.

1222
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,680
All of them

1223
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,920
came to life with Mrs. Na's memories.

1224
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,760
Since she's slowly losing her memories,

1225
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,039
they are starting to fall asleep.

1226
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,640
Not just memories,

1227
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,039
but tears…

1228
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,520
also wake us up

1229
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:01,720
to comfort our sad owner like Nut.

1230
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:13,279
I came to life

1231
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:15,520
because of Tatarn's memories.

1232
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,399
Tatarn's love

1233
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:23,720
and his ties with Nut

1234
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,920
woke a teddy bear like me up.

1235
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,840
Those gave me a conscience,

1236
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,199
and let me think,

1237
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,239
move,

1238
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,960
and communicate.

1239
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,199
Tatarn may be unconscious,

1240
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,079
but his memories still thrive.

1241
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,279
That's why I'm alive.

1242
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:52,079
More than being alive,

1243
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,119
there's a miracle that occurred.

1244
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,359
It's a miracle that turned a teddy bear
into a human.

1245
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:03,720
When Dad gets back,

1246
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,520
I'll tell him about us.

1247
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:08,680
I have many good qualities.

1248
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:10,920
Do I still have to prove them?

1249
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:17,640
When I removed the pus,

1250
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,159
I found this splinter.

1251
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:27,000
The doctor suspects that it was likely
from the assault weapon.

1252
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:29,760
I reckon it's a vital piece of evidence

1253
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,720
that will help us identify
who the perpetrator is.

1254
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:46,680
