1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:13,125
FIVE STAR PRODUCTION PRESENTS

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,750
I'm sure everyone realizes
the present economic situation.

3
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,375
For the past year,

4
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,041
the executive board and I
have been trying everything we could

5
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,708
to maintain the situation of the company.

6
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:12,208
However, the day has come
that we have to face the fact.

7
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,708
I had to make a tough decision
which I didn't want to do.

8
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,750
Draw a number from
the Chi Chi Sticks and pass it on.

9
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,666
Come on, shake it and pass it on!

10
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,375
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,833
Three persons from each department
will be laid off today.

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,333
You all know that the company
treats everyone as a family member.

13
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,375
Like brothers, like sisters.

14
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,291
You all are like my relatives.

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,416
I can't bring myself to say
who should go or who should stay.

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,666
I just couldn't do that.

17
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,750
So I thought this is the fairest way.

18
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,416
NINE

19
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,000
Put it on the table, please.

20
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,791
Won't you draw a number too?

21
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,083
No, I won't.

22
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,291
I'm the boss.

23
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:21,750
The following three numbers
are the people to be laid off.

24
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:28,916
Seven.

25
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,250
Three.

26
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,541
No! How can that be?

27
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,458
This isn't fair.

28
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,041
How will I feed my family?

29
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,000
I still have mortgage to pay.

30
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,625
Nine.

31
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,958
Ms. Toom, allow me to help you.

32
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,208
Waiting for the elevator?

33
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

34
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,416
You might have to wait for a few days.

35
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,375
Why?

36
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,166
OUT OF ORDER

37
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,666
You're on the third floor, right?

38
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,750
Room 6?

39
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,291
How do you know that?

40
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,666
May I help?

41
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,500
Are you afraid that I'll hit on you?

42
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,041
No, I'm not.

43
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,791
Do you often get people
knocking on the wrong door?

44
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,583
Sometimes.

45
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,291
-Thanks.
-Sure.

46
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,208
Oh, that's all right.

47
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,375
No. Please wash it off. It'll be harder
to get it off when it's dry.

48
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,291
Thanks.

49
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,708
Go ahead. Don't bother.

50
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,541
The sink is over there.

51
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,375
Do you like soft rock?

52
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,083
I prefer hip-hop.

53
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,333
That's just the radio.

54
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,083
Do you live here?

55
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,166
No. My friend does.

56
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,291
What kind of bird is this?

57
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,250
It's a gift from a friend.

58
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,333
Which bank do you work for?

59
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,708
A finance company.

60
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,000
Finance?

61
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,000
Wow, you're lucky to still be employed.

62
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,666
All my friends in finance got laid off.

63
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,208
Yeah. Lucky me.

64
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,291
Thank you.

65
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,291
Thank you, Miss…

66
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,208
Toom.

67
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
Thank you, Ms. Toom.

68
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,458
That'll be 548.50 baht, ma'am.

69
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,875
Five hundred baht for this?

70
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,708
It's not 500. It's 548.50 baht, ma'am.

71
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,125
-I'll put these back.
-Don't worry, ma'am.

72
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,458
Leave them to our staff.

73
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,125
No, I'll put them back.

74
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,333
But do you know where…

75
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,208
Hello?

76
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,291
Have you ever had sex?

77
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,375
How big are your breasts?

78
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,250
I'll tell you something.

79
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,458
I talk to these aliens
more often than my own wife.

80
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,333
I have a doctoral degree in physics.

81
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,125
I'm working with…

82
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:30,333
MAMA MINCED PORK FLAVOR
INSTANT NOODLES

83
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,041
Hello?

84
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,541
Jim,

85
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,791
what would you do if you wake up
and find a box filled with a million baht,

86
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,041
sitting in front of your room?

87
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,666
Do I really have to answer this?

88
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,958
Yes, you do.

89
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,708
I'd just leave it alone.

90
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,375
Wouldn't you want it?

91
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,250
Over a million baht inside?

92
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,083
Has someone really left a box of money
in front of your room?

93
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,541
No, I mean it's hypothetical.

94
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
Wouldn't you want it?

95
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,166
If it's just a 500-baht note,
I certainly would take it.

96
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,291
But a box with a million baht
placed in front of your room…

97
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,375
is a bit fishy, don't you think?

98
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,666
Okay, that's all.

99
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,666
You called just to ask me this?

100
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,708
Yeah, I've got to go.

101
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,500
Hey, wait--

102
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,541
Can I help you?

103
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,833
Pardon me, madam…

104
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,708
Have you seen a "WAI WAI" brand
instant noodle box somewhere around here?

105
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,833
It's "MAMA" brand…
a minced pork flavor MAMA box.

106
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,500
WAI WAI!

107
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,583
MAMA!

108
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,750
Who told you?

109
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,000
We always use MAMA boxes to deliver stuff.

110
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,541
All right. It's MAMA then.

111
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,750
A minced pork flavor MAMA box.

112
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,833
Have you seen it?

113
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,708
No… I haven't.

114
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
Answer again!

115
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,375
I'll ask the question again.

116
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,750
Now this time,
you listen carefully, all right?

117
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:24,875
Have you seen
a minced pork flavor MAMA box

118
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
in front of your apartment?

119
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,833
No, I haven't.

120
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,666
Something is telling me that

121
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,833
you're not telling the truth.

122
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,208
But, if you say you haven't seen it,

123
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,041
I guess you haven't seen it.

124
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,458
Please pardon us…

125
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,500
for the inconvenience.

126
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,708
This is just an overture, young lady.

127
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,791
If I find the box in here,
someone will end up dead.

128
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
KANCHIT THAI BOXING

129
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,541
-Noi! Check the cabinet.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:16,958
Sure thing.

131
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,208
Hey, Noi!

132
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,750
Did you see something under the bed?

133
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,250
It's minced pork flavor.

134
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,583
It's here!

135
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,791
Be careful. We're here for the money only.

136
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,208
…to have enough potential and knowledge

137
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,041
so they don't end up selling their bodies.

138
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,583
Hey! What the hell is going on?

139
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,041
Stop wasting natural resources.

140
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:09,375
Strop ruining your residential areas.
Stop cutting down trees…

141
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,208
Do you want to fight me? Don't you dare!

142
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,041
You're so dead.

143
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,750
Hello?

144
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,250
Kanchit, this is Tong speaking.

145
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
What happened?

146
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,458
What do you mean?

147
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,958
You haven't gotten the money yet?

148
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,541
I haven't seen even a shadow of it.

149
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,250
But my boys brought it to you
this morning.

150
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,541
Are you sure they followed
the instructions correctly?

151
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,666
They followed what you told me,

152
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,583
to place the box in front of Room 9,
knock three times, and leave.

153
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,500
Same as usual, isn't it?

154
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,541
Are your boys in need of some cash?

155
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:30,583
Are you suggesting that
my boys stole the money?

156
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,458
I'm not suggesting anything.

157
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,500
But, it isn't impossible, correct?

158
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,416
That's very unlikely.

159
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,208
Especially Berm.

160
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,833
His family has been
with us for generations.

161
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:45,125
Since his grandfather, father--

162
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:49,458
The history of you and your underlings
is of minor interest to me.

163
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,541
What interests me is

164
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,583
where the fuck the money went!
I've been waiting since this morning.

165
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,125
I just don't understand

166
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:02,125
why you want the money
to be put in front of the room.

167
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,791
Why not in the room--

168
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:04,958
Mr. Kanchit!

169
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,833
Have I ever interfered
with how you do your business?

170
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:13,708
I don't care how you fix your fights.
Likewise, this is my business.

171
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,291
And I have my own way of doing things.

172
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,750
If your boys followed the instructions,
things shouldn't go sideways.

173
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,208
I'll tell you what,
I'lI give you until 10 p.m. tonight.

174
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,541
I expect the money to be here.

175
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,666
It'll be better if you bring it yourself.

176
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,250
I have some errands to run.

177
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,750
If the money isn't here by 10,
you don't want to know what will happen.

178
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,541
-Wiroj.
-Yes, sir.

179
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,333
Get me Some-arng and Suparp.

180
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,625
Yes, sir.

181
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,708
Quick!

182
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,416
Some-arng!

183
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,250
Some-arng! Boss wants to see you.

184
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,583
The deaf one too!

185
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,875
HEY DEAF, BOSS WANTS TO SEE US.

186
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,583
MAYBE HE WANTS TO GIVE US SOME MONEY.

187
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,333
You want some "Sugus"?

188
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,666
It's called "So-gas", Boss.

189
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,166
"So-gas" my ass.

190
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,958
Hey, Some-arng.

191
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,375
Suppose I want you to deliver
one million baht from a fixed fight

192
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,375
to a friend of mine,

193
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,125
would you dare steal it?

194
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,583
Come on, Boss!

195
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,708
I'd be just as bad
as a motherfucker to do that.

196
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,583
You're not answering the question.

197
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,083
The question is whether
you'll "dare" to steal the money.

198
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,333
Of course, not… I dare not, Boss.

199
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,500
What about you, Suparp?

200
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,583
What did he say?

201
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,625
He said he would be tempted.

202
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,375
What about Berm and Noi?

203
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,625
Do you think they would steal from me?

204
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,833
KANCHIT THAI-BOXING

205
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,250
Hello? This is 191.

206
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,333
Hello, this is 191.

207
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,750
Mister! We've been going around
in circles for hours.

208
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,666
You're wrong. Admit it!

209
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,875
No, I'm not. I had the right of way.

210
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,625
Not wrong? You drove like an asshole.
No wonder your face got injured.

211
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,416
-Please calm down, miss.
-I drove on the right side.

212
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,000
I can't calm down.

213
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,333
We've been going around in circles
and there's still no conclusion!

214
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:05,041
You wouldn't give any ticket
and we don't know who's responsible.

215
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,291
I can't go to the garage.
I can't go to work.

216
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,833
-And it's late already!
-I'm hurt. I'm really hurt.

217
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,083
Serves you right! Driving like an asshole.

218
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,125
-You saw him cut in front of me.
-My vehicle is smaller.

219
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,375
He hit my car so he's wrong!

220
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,250
If I hit his car,
I would admit it's my fault.

221
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,833
Is it true, what she said?

222
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,416
You deserve to look like this.

223
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,708
Please, Miss.
I have too many cases already.

224
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,708
Please calm down.

225
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,750
-Sir, I've been wasting my time for ages.
-Yes.

226
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:37,041
-You know he hit my car.
-All right.

227
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,416
Why don't you just fine him?

228
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Can we take the injured man
to the hospital first?

229
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,125
And what about the case?
What about my car?

230
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,833
I need to get it fixed.

231
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:47,541
All right. Draw me a diagram of
the accident to make sure--

232
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,041
I drew a diagram four times already!

233
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:53,083
It changes every time!
How can I make a judgment?

234
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,666
Of course! It's from different angles.

235
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,833
Take a look from that many angles
so you can make your call.

236
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,500
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

237
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,583
Toom!

238
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,666
What are you doing here?

239
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,291
Hey! I think I changed my mind.

240
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,041
About what?

241
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,625
The money.

242
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,625
If a box of money was left
in front of my room,

243
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,791
I think I'll take it.

244
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,916
However, once I take it,
I have to disappear.

245
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,875
Go to some remote provinces…

246
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,208
or even better, go abroad!

247
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,375
That way, no one can track me down.

248
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,583
And who knows?
I might find a foreign husband.

249
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,250
Mister! No giblets, please.

250
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,458
Just give me some blood.

251
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,750
Lots of blood, please.

252
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:34,083
Speaking about a husband,
have you met my new boyfriend?

253
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,916
Not yet.

254
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,875
Oh! He is so gorgeous. He's just my type.

255
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:42,875
Tor! Come here.

256
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,750
Toom, this is Tor. Tor, this is Toom.

257
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,250
Hi.

258
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,458
Isn't he gorgeous?

259
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:00,541
You know, my store survives
to this day because of him.

260
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,291
Teenage floozies like to come to my shop
and flirt with him.

261
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,000
They pretend to be shopping.

262
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,666
And while they're looking around,
they flirt with him.

263
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,625
And you know, Tor is so shy and polite.

264
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,375
Those horny sluts just go crazy.

265
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,083
Lots of them?

266
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,375
Lots of what?

267
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,875
Horny teenagers.

268
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,041
Lots and lots!

269
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,375
The worse the economy is,
the hornier people get, you know?

270
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:27,416
Don't you think, Tor?

271
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,833
-When are you two getting married?
-Married?

272
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,625
No way! Who would do that these days?

273
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:38,166
If a couple is in love,
then they're in love, okay?

274
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,625
If they're no longer in love,

275
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:43,291
how can a piece of paper
glue them together?

276
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,958
Every fortune teller I've been to
all agree on one thing.

277
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,916
That we are true soulmates.

278
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,375
And not only in this life.

279
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:58,500
One even said that even the power
of Godzilla couldn't separate us.

280
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,333
Here you go.

281
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,166
Make sure there's enough sauce.

282
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,000
How much?

283
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,083
It's 160 baht.

284
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,750
I have to go now, Toom.

285
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,208
If there's a box of money
in front of your room,

286
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,875
don't forget to call me.

287
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:21,625
Maybe we can go abroad together. Bye now.

288
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,416
See you.

289
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Hurry.

290
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,166
I don't think
they'll last more than two months.

291
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,291
What did you say?

292
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,000
I don't think he'll last
more than two months. He's a playboy.

293
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,875
He changes women
like he changes his underwear.

294
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,833
Check, please.

295
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,375
That'll be 40 baht.

296
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,250
Is that you, Oy?

297
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,500
It's Toom.

298
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,875
Your friend, Toom.

299
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:56,125
No. I'm calling long distance
from Bangkok.

300
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,250
I have something to ask you.

301
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,375
Do you remember
the place where we went together

302
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,458
to get your fake passport
before you went abroad?

303
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,375
Where is it?

304
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,750
That's right, it was a Thai-style house.

305
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,291
Soi Annop.

306
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:18,250
Alley… okay, at the end of the alley

307
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,875
Yeah…

308
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,166
No, not for me.

309
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,333
It's for a relative of mine.
She got laid off.

310
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,083
So she wants to give it a try abroad.

311
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,625
Soon probably…

312
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,041
You want something from here?

313
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,541
MAMA noodles?

314
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,583
Sure. I'll bring some.

315
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,541
How's life?

316
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,291
Well, I'm sort of okay here.

317
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,291
A bit bored.

318
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,833
I have to go now.

319
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,750
I'll call again soon.

320
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,500
Thanks. Good luck. Bye.

321
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,250
Dear Mother,

322
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,750
don't be too surprised with this money.

323
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,250
"I just got a job abroad."

324
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,291
"I don't think I'll have
time to go and say goodbye

325
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,541
to you and the others in person."

326
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,958
"The company wants me
to start in a few days."

327
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,541
"I may even have to travel tonight."

328
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,833
"I can't really tell you
what kind of job it is at the moment,

329
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:08,583
but I can assure you that
it's not the type of job

330
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,958
that made Thai girls famous in the world."

331
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,541
"Mother, this is the money

332
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,041
the company paid me
three months in advance.

333
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:20,708
"It should be enough to take care
of Father and the rest for a while."

334
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,416
I love and respect you always.

335
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:24,750
Toom.

336
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:13,875
TAKE THE STAIRS
FOR A ONE-FLOOR TRIP

337
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:28,416
KANCHIT THAI BOXING

338
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,250
I think Noi and Berm
are still here somewhere.

339
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,000
That's their bike.

340
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,708
Yes?

341
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,666
Do you live here, young man?

342
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,666
Yeah, I do.

343
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,583
Did you happen to see two guys
dressed somewhat like us

344
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,208
around here this morning?

345
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,583
Yeah, I did.

346
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,333
"Kanchit Thai Boxing" sweatsuits
exactly like these.

347
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,666
They went into that apartment.

348
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,208
Whose apartment is it?

349
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,166
I don't know.

350
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,416
A woman. Pretty one as well.

351
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:28,958
Hey!

352
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,291
Can I ask you a question?

353
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:54,166
Are you guys here to set up a boxing gym,
or are you undercover cops?

354
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,625
Hey!

355
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,500
Son of a bitch!

356
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,833
It's a dirty phone call.

357
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:45,958
Why the hell did you give it to me?

358
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:49,416
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? I'M DEAF.

359
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:54,875
YOU'RE DEAF, SO WHY DID YOU PICK IT UP?

360
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,166
IT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE.

361
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,416
ONE DAY, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED ENOUGH
TO SHOOT ME DEAD.

362
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,208
DON'T WORRY.
A BAD PERSON LIKE YOU WON'T DIE EASILY.

363
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,833
I'M JUST AS BAD AS YOUR FATHER.

364
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,833
WHAT HAS MY FATHER GOT TO DO
WITH A DIRTY PHONE CALL?

365
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,250
What the hell are you nodding for?

366
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,500
Can you hear it?

367
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,541
Whoa! Fuck!

368
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,583
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised

369
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,291
if Berm's body suddenly appears
out of nowhere…

370
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,375
Shit!

371
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,750
It must be that fucking Tong for sure.

372
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,750
Boss, I found Berm and Noi.

373
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,041
What do they have to say?

374
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,250
Nothing. They're fucking dead, Boss.

375
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,541
Tong, you bastard.

376
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:43,625
That's exactly what I thought too, Boss.

377
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:48,208
I found them dead in a girl's apartment.

378
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,250
What girl?

379
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,416
I don't know, Boss.

380
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,416
Good-looking too.

381
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,958
You know how Berm and Noi are.

382
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:58,875
They always flirt around.

383
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,916
I'm sure Tong had this girl

384
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:05,833
seduce them into her room and kill them,

385
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,791
then took off with the money.

386
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,000
Are you sure?

387
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,500
I'm 1,000-percent sure, Boss.

388
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,583
I'm hardly wrong with this sort of thing.

389
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,625
I think the next person on his list
is "you," Boss.

390
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,916
That's why Tong told you
to bring the money yourself tonight.

391
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:29,583
Okay. First thing, you two come back here.

392
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:33,125
And bring me as much information
about the girl as possible.

393
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,791
About tonight, let me figure out
how to deal with that bastard.

394
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:41,208
And don't let anyone see you
when you come out, all right?

395
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:42,291
Yes, Boss.

396
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:49,791
You want some Sugas?

397
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:56,166
Sorry, madam.
It's a bit of a hectic day for me.

398
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,541
Okay, so when do you want it?

399
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,375
Can I have it by today?

400
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,208
Wow, it seems that
you're in a great hurry.

401
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:05,708
Is it possible?

402
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:08,458
A relative of mine suddenly got ill.

403
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,125
Of course, it's possible.

404
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:15,333
But it means we have
to jump the queue for you.

405
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:19,958
And that would cost a bit more.

406
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,625
How much?

407
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,875
Let's say 50,000 baht.

408
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,916
You can have it by 10 tonight.

409
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,625
You pay half of the fee now,

410
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:38,583
and the rest, when you come
and get the document tonight.

411
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,958
How's that, 50,000 baht?

412
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,583
Okay.

413
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,041
But how can I be sure that--

414
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,583
That I won't play you?

415
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,666
You can't be sure of anything.

416
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,583
If you want to be absolutely certain,

417
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:59,916
I suggest you go to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs for your passport.

418
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:04,541
Then get your real visa at the embassy.

419
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,583
That way, it's legal.

420
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:09,375
And it costs much less than mine.

421
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,250
But I guarantee that
you won't be traveling tonight for sure.

422
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:15,083
It'll take you a week or two
at the very least, madam.

423
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,500
And even if you do that,

424
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,333
how can you be sure that
you'll get a visa from the embassy?

425
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:24,458
Thai passport holders
are targeted in many countries,

426
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:31,166
particularly pretty young ladies
such as yourself.

427
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,291
Because those countries,

428
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,500
they still believe that there are
only two occupations in Thailand.

429
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,916
Please pardon my vulgarity,

430
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,041
women are all prostitutes

431
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,208
and men are drug dealers.

432
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,083
I told you not to move!

433
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,333
I'm not moving.

434
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,208
You cocksucker!

435
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,208
Who are you calling a "cocksucker"?

436
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,708
You're a cocksucker!

437
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,333
Excuse me.

438
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,291
Ma'am?

439
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,166
I completely reject all laws,

440
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,875
simply because they're stupid.

441
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:28,166
The only thing that the outlaws

442
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,958
like myself,
respect and honor is our "word."

443
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:38,291
Politicians only keep the laws,
but not their words.

444
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,833
If you're okay with the deal,

445
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:44,041
may I ask you to go
and have your photo taken?

446
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:48,166
Please do as the photographer tells you.

447
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,000
I think he's a bit moody today.

448
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,125
Are you sure you don't want any Sugas?

449
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:07,625
What are you looking at, Wiroj?

450
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,208
Here, have some Sugas.

451
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,166
How tall?

452
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,416
Fifty centimeters.

453
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,708
I mean how tall are you?

454
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:35,541
Me? I'm 168 centimeters.

455
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,041
Do you have anything bigger?

456
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,791
This is the biggest.

457
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,583
Are you going to put someone inside?

458
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,291
Just some old books.

459
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,416
Do you have a delivery service?

460
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,375
Of course, we deliver.

461
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,708
How much?

462
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,666
Four thousand baht.

463
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,416
That's already with a discount.

464
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,625
What the…

465
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,208
I'll help you get it inside.

466
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,541
That's all right. I can manage.

467
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,458
But it's heavy.

468
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,416
-I can manage. Thank you very much.
-Okay.

469
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:34,541
Don't be alarmed.

470
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:36,166
I can explain.

471
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,291
There's a gang of teenagers
doing drugs in the room next to yours.

472
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,500
I've been observing for a while.

473
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,333
Today, I think that
there's a celebrity among them.

474
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:54,250
So I thought I'd break in
through their balcony for a surprise.

475
00:54:56,375 --> 00:55:00,583
To do so, I need to go out
through your balcony.

476
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,833
Miss… may I?

477
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,291
What will you do to me?

478
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,541
No, nothing at all.

479
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,166
I'm just asking for your permission
to climb out your balcony. That's all.

480
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,791
-Go ahead.
-Great.

481
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,041
What's your name again?

482
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,208
What's your name, Miss?

483
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,625
Why? What have I done wrong?

484
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,333
Nothing. Just so I can mention your name
in the interview.

485
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,000
Interview?

486
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,875
Of course.

487
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,958
I'll make the front page tomorrow.

488
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,333
Thank you so much.

489
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,791
Put your hands behind your head!

490
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:10,041
Lie face down on the bed! Now!

491
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,125
Lie face down!

492
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,166
Lie face down!

493
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,500
Fuck!

494
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:45,750
Hi, missy.

495
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,791
Do you happen to have some fish sauce?

496
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,708
My name is Pen.

497
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:53,083
I live downstairs.

498
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,291
-Yes, I do.
-Can I ask you for some?

499
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,708
I'm sorry to bother you.

500
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:06,916
I'm making some papaya salad
with my friends.

501
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,500
But I ran out of fish sauce.

502
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,208
So I've been knocking on every door.

503
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,208
But no one is home. They're all at work.

504
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,458
You're the first one who answered.

505
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:19,125
Can I bring it down to you in a minute?

506
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,125
Oh, no! Don't bother.

507
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,666
I can come in and get it myself,
and I'll return it in a few minutes.

508
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,916
Please don't come in.
My room is in a mess at the moment.

509
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,250
That's okay.
I understand a single lady's lifestyle.

510
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,291
I feel uncomfortable having you in.

511
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,250
Are you with your boyfriend?

512
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,875
Oh, dear! I didn't know.

513
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:57,250
I'm so sorry to interrupt. Take your time.

514
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,333
I'll wait downstairs.
Room 6, right under yours, okay?

515
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,833
There's no need to rush.

516
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,208
Here's the fish sauce.

517
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,375
Thank you, darling.

518
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,625
Please come inside.

519
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,041
I'd love to, but I'm in a hurry.

520
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,625
We're making some papaya salad.
Come on, you're really not joining us?

521
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,958
Thank you but I'll take a rain check.

522
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,208
You should go.

523
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,291
Don't keep him waiting.

524
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,416
AUNTY SRI'S

525
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,125
Where the hell is he?

526
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,291
Sompan!

527
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,041
Fuck!

528
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:46,875
Hello, Boss?

529
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:51,250
I think there's something fishy
about the money from the fixed fight.

530
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,916
What do you mean?

531
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,333
I think this Kanchit guy
is up to something.

532
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,708
He got the police involved in this.

533
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,375
And the cop killed Sompan.

534
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,625
I think the situation
doesn't look too good.

535
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,000
Where is he now?

536
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:05,916
Who, Boss?

537
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,208
The fucking cop
who shot your pal, you idiot!

538
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,291
Oh, I got him already.

539
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:14,416
He wasn't bad, this cop.

540
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,875
But I was a bit faster.

541
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:18,083
Got him right between the eyes.

542
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,708
It was quite a fight, Boss.

543
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,458
You had a gunfight with the cop?

544
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:24,291
Yes, it was spectacular.

545
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,625
Whatever.

546
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:31,833
I'll do anything for you, Boss.

547
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:34,541
Come back here right away.
I want to know the details.

548
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,416
The bastard Kanchit doesn't know
who he's fucking with.

549
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,125
You're damn right, Boss.

550
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,458
Oh, my…

551
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:13,458
He sent this bitch to check us out,

552
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,125
pretending to come for the passport.

553
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:19,375
I thought she looked
rather suspicious this morning.

554
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:20,458
Don't you think, Wiroj?

555
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,541
You're right, Boss.

556
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,041
I noticed she was avoiding eye contact.

557
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:32,666
You two go and find out who this bitch is.

558
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,791
If she just came to check things out,

559
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,958
she wouldn't come back
for the passport tonight.

560
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:45,041
But you never know what kind of trick
Tong has up his sleeve.

561
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,166
He might send her back, who knows.

562
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,833
If she comes back, Wiroj…

563
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:51,750
Yes, Boss?

564
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:55,291
Take her immediately to the apartment
where I'll meet Tong.

565
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:59,291
-Yes, Boss.
-I also want to know

566
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:02,083
how he will explain this to me.

567
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:15,750
-Uncle Yen, it's your turn.
-I know.

568
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:27,083
Ms. Toom is behaving rather strange today.
She goes in and out of the apartment.

569
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,166
How come she's not at work?

570
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,041
Stop snooping into people's business.

571
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:33,250
You motherfucker!

572
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,666
Watch your mouth.

573
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,750
I'm older than your father.

574
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,958
Old people don't snoop?

575
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:43,625
In your case, it's "snooping,"
but in my case, it's "concerning," got it?

576
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,708
-Is it my turn yet?
-Yes.

577
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,250
That's it! Checkmate!

578
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:55,833
You wish your chess skills
were half as good as your mouth.

579
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,208
Now find out how to solve this.

580
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,375
You cheated!

581
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,666
Do you want this foot
in your mouth, you bastard?

582
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,541
Oh, what good timing!

583
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,708
I went to your room
to return the fish sauce,

584
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,000
but you weren't there.

585
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:13,916
What? Are you moving out?

586
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:17,666
Oh, no. They're for my books.

587
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,291
Wow, you read a lot!

588
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,000
Yeah, some.

589
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,791
You know, I always envy people who read.

590
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:27,875
They're smart.

591
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,041
I don't read at all.

592
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,708
I like watching TV.

593
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,875
Here, let me give you a hand.

594
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,500
Oh, no. You don't have to. Don't bother.

595
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:38,958
Not a bother at all. Let me help.

596
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,708
You can go now. I'll help her.

597
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,208
Come on. Let's go.

598
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:01,958
Thank you so much.

599
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,583
Don't mention it.

600
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:08,708
Oh, it's so dark.
How can you stay here like this?

601
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,041
Here you go.

602
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,375
See how much better it is?

603
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,958
How can you stay in the dark like that?

604
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,625
You must like this kind of box, don't you?

605
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,333
You have so many of them.

606
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,041
They're good for storing unused stuff.

607
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,375
The room is kind of small.

608
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:32,041
You know what? I don't like it.
Whenever I see this kind of box,

609
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,250
it always reminds me
of something horrifying.

610
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,416
What do you mean?

611
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:43,791
Back in my hometown in Ayuthaya,
when I was a little girl,

612
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,958
there was this lunatic
who killed people in the village,

613
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,791
then he put the bodies
into boxes like these

614
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,000
and threw them in the water.

615
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,333
Into the river?

616
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,541
No, it wasn't a river.

617
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:06,083
It was a pond. A pond in Bangsai.

618
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,291
And the water in that pond

619
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,583
was so dark and muddy
because of the waste.

620
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:13,791
Boxes like these that sink into that pond

621
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:17,000
will never ever be found.

622
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:20,750
And the smell, my gosh.
Have you ever been near such a pond?

623
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,250
No, I haven't.

624
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,416
Oh! The smell is so bad.

625
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,458
No matter how badly the corpses decayed,
no one could smell it.

626
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,000
Was the murderer caught?

627
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:37,166
I don't think so.

628
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,833
By the time the bodies were found,
he was long gone.

629
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:48,958
Or maybe he turned himself in.
It was a long time ago. I'm not sure.

630
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:51,583
Can I use your bathroom?

631
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:55,000
I had to go since I met you
in front of the elevator.

632
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:07,625
Is your boyfriend still here?

633
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,791
Oh! Why didn't you tell me?

634
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,791
Then I'd better leave you alone.

635
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,500
Thank you very much.

636
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,083
It's all right, dear.

637
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,291
-See you.
-Bye.

638
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,333
Really?

639
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Quiet.

640
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,041
Or she'll notice.

641
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,000
Are you all right, Pen?

642
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:33,375
What's wrong? Pen!

643
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:34,500
Hey, are you okay?

644
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,916
I'm sure they had done it more than once

645
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,708
for him to look half-dead like that.

646
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,458
I guess so.

647
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:49,208
Now I know why he got tired
so easily lately.

648
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,250
Unlike before.

649
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:58,750
We used to do it all the time.
Morning, noon, and night.

650
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,958
Sometimes, we even set
the alarm clock for this!

651
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,125
Wow! What a lucky girl you are.

652
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,916
In my opinion,

653
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:11,541
The bastard deserved
to get it chopped off!

654
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,583
-Chop what off?
-Well…

655
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:17,083
his dick, of course!

656
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:20,125
You should just chop his dick off.

657
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,875
If a dick turns a decent man
into a bad one,

658
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,208
why not just get rid of it?

659
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:25,250
I think it's only reasonable.

660
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,375
You're damn right!

661
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,791
Great idea, Pen.

662
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,166
Sorry.

663
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,250
All booked.

664
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:27,833
They're all booked.

665
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,125
The soonest would be on the 27th.

666
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:34,125
I can't wait that long.

667
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,708
I really need to go tonight.

668
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:39,125
-My relative is very ill over there.
-Tonight?

669
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:43,500
You just came in here two minutes ago
and you want to fly tonight?

670
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:49,208
This is an airline, madam, not a bus.

671
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:54,166
You need to have schedules and plans.

672
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,750
You can't just go to the next bus
when you miss this bus--

673
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,125
Isn't there any way at all?

674
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,916
Well, maybe I can take a look at it again.

675
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,625
There might be…
Well, you can't be so sure.

676
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:08,125
We must try harder, you know?

677
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:15,250
Somlak, Somjate, Sailom, Sawai…

678
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:16,833
Peter Lee…

679
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:20,125
Peter Lee…

680
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,666
-Roong!
-Yes.

681
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:28,166
How come this guy, Peter Lee,
hasn't confirmed his flight yet?

682
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:32,375
He's flying tonight but maybe…
maybe he's not.

683
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,250
I don't think he's going.

684
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:36,875
Peter Lee…

685
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:42,333
Well, he's not going.
You're going instead.

686
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,708
What a lucky girl you are.

687
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,708
Miracles do happen.

688
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,250
You cut it in one swift stroke!

689
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:13,750
After you cut it… put it in here.

690
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:20,291
Then you push this button.

691
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,000
While his banana is being minced,

692
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:29,125
that's when you explain to him
why he must part with his willy.

693
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:35,541
And to return the favor to that bitch
for her fish sauce,

694
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:41,625
you take the thoroughly minced pieces
of that flirtatious cop

695
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,958
and cook her a delicious dish
of spicy minced dick.

696
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,791
Here, let me do it.

697
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:13,000
The wastewater pond in Bangsai, remember?

698
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,208
No one will know.

699
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:25,833
Hello?

700
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,583
Yeah, Toom.

701
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,125
What do you want to borrow?

702
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,166
My pickup truck?

703
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,625
Why do you want to borrow it?

704
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,166
Donating books…

705
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,208
Why do you need the pickup truck?

706
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,750
Oh, lots of books.

707
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,416
What's wrong? Your voice is trembling.

708
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:52,875
Are you all right?

709
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:56,458
Yeah, come and take it.

710
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:58,833
I'll be here all day.

711
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:00,458
Okay. See you later.

712
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:12,250
Jim!

713
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,541
Jim!

714
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:24,750
Jim!

715
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,416
Jim!

716
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:29,500
Oh, my god! Jim!

717
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,375
Jim!

718
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:33,625
Jim!

719
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:54,291
What happened?

720
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:56,666
It's that motherfucker, Tor!

721
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,208
You guys had a fight?

722
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,541
Not a fight. A breakup.

723
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:06,666
Can you imagine?

724
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,500
The prick didn't even have the guts
to tell me in person.

725
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,375
He called me on the phone.

726
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:16,333
I asked him who the bitch was.

727
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:22,083
He said she's one of the customers
who often come to the shop.

728
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,333
And they've been going out for a while.

729
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,916
I asked him to come over and have a talk.

730
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,083
He said he was busy.

731
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,250
I offered to go over to his place,

732
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,958
but he said that bitch was with him.

733
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,333
So I asked if they were sleeping together.

734
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:55,250
He was reluctant to answer.

735
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,416
He said yes. That totally blew me off!

736
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,916
That's what happened.

737
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:06,208
You said every fortune teller told you
that you were soulmates.

738
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,666
I lied. I said it myself!

739
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:28,500
Toom, can you stay with me?

740
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,250
I don't want to be by myself.

741
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,541
I have something to do.

742
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:36,333
Please, I beg you.

743
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:39,166
I just can't be alone tonight.

744
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:42,041
Well,

745
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,291
let me take care of my business,
then I'll be back when I'm done.

746
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:48,791
Donating those books?

747
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:52,250
But it's already late.
Are they still open?

748
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:56,750
I called them earlier to wait for me.

749
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:00,458
I'll go with you, then.

750
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:05,166
No, you can't.

751
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,375
You just got out of the hospital.
Just stay here.

752
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:11,041
I'm afraid I'll do
something stupid again if I'm alone.

753
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,791
Please let me go with you.

754
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:15,083
I promise I'll be quick.

755
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:17,666
What's the matter, Toom?

756
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,125
I'll just be sitting quietly
in the car, just like at home.

757
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,916
But at least I have you near me.

758
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,708
So I won't get too depressed
and do something stupid again.

759
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,791
You who have never been broken-hearted
probably don't know what it feels like.

760
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,708
You have no idea how much
I get in a muddle about it. I have no one.

761
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:35,791
Tor left me. If you leave me,
I have no one else anymore.

762
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:39,375
Please, Toom, let me come with you.

763
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:42,208
Please! Why can't I go with you?

764
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:43,666
You want to go?

765
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,916
Okay, if you want to go,
close the door, and let's go!

766
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:49,583
You're so good to me, Toom.

767
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:53,125
At least you love me.

768
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:25,375
Toom….

769
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,166
What's the matter?

770
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,666
What the hell is this place?

771
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:07,708
This place stinks!

772
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,500
Is the place you're donating the books to
somewhere around here?

773
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:43,208
Toom, what's wrong with you?

774
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:48,833
Have you gone mad?

775
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,791
These aren't books, are they?

776
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,458
What are they? Tell me!

777
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:04,458
Toom, what the hell happened?

778
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,000
These aren't books, are they?

779
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:09,583
What's happening?

780
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:12,541
Tell me what's going on.

781
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:18,333
If these aren't books,
then what's inside these boxes?

782
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,083
What's going on with you?

783
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:24,333
Tell me. I'm your friend!

784
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:27,041
What's inside the boxes?
Why do you have to do this?

785
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,166
What happened?

786
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,333
Get in the car, Jim!

787
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,833
Get in the car!

788
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:42,458
I said get in the car.

789
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:22,666
Jim… do you have a passport?

790
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:28,416
I do. Do you want it?

791
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:31,958
Do you want to go abroad with me?

792
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:36,000
Toom, what have you done?

793
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:39,125
Did you rob a bank?

794
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,166
Remember when I called you this morning?

795
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,875
And I asked you what would you do

796
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:50,416
if you woke up and found a boxful of cash
in front of your apartment?

797
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:54,750
Yeah, I do.

798
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:01,875
You mean there really was money
in front of your room?

799
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,708
Yes. A lot as well.

800
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:08,583
Just like in the movies.

801
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:10,541
Where's the money now?

802
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,833
Wait here. I'll go up there
to get my passport real quick.

803
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:36,708
Pardon me, ma'am.
My boss wants to see you now.

804
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,916
Here's the other half.

805
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:44,375
Cut the crap, lady.

806
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:48,958
My boss is waiting. Come on.

807
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:51,250
Toom. Whose house is this?

808
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,000
-Jim!
-Where do you think you're going?

809
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:55,541
-Jim!
-Let's go!

810
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:57,250
Jim!

811
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,166
Go!

812
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:01,291
Hurry!

813
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,291
Pull… pull over, please.

814
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:11,041
Are you all right?

815
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,250
Nothing. I said stop the car, please.

816
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:39,625
What's the matter?

817
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,000
I miss my mother.

818
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:45,791
This is her most favorite song.

819
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,125
The night she died,
she asked me to sing it to her.

820
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:56,458
She passed away
before I could even finish the song.

821
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:02,083
How did she die?

822
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,708
She got a brain infection…

823
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,041
from having too much manicure.

824
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,125
Manicure?

825
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:14,500
Right. The tools were dirty, perhaps.

826
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:17,750
So, the bacteria entered her brain
through her nails.

827
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,291
Which salon was this?

828
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:42,375
KANCHIT THAI BOXING

829
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,875
I couldn't help her.

830
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,541
I couldn't help her at all.

831
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,500
What are you doing, bitch?

832
01:38:55,666 --> 01:38:56,500
Come in.

833
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:04,791
So, how's everything, Kanchit?

834
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:06,041
Do you have anything for me?

835
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:07,500
Of course!

836
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:12,333
A lot. Let's start with the first one.

837
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:15,875
Do you happen to know this girl?

838
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:30,291
Toom?

839
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:33,750
So you know her, right?

840
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:39,500
Then we should go to her room.

841
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:43,500
What does she have to do with this?
Did she steal the money?

842
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:44,833
I don't understand.

843
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:48,416
Come with me, if you don't understand.

844
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,333
Perhaps things will become
clearer for both of us. Come on.

845
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,875
Move!

846
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:06,375
Stop looking.

847
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:19,125
Where are we going?

848
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:20,500
You'll find out soon.

849
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,458
I'm fucked! Help me!

850
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:29,666
I tightened her veins for too long.

851
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,666
The tables have turned. Please help me!

852
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,208
She's dying. I…

853
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:41,291
Move it! Stop looking around.

854
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:53,875
Cut this crap already! It's getting late.

855
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,291
Where's my money, Kanchit?

856
01:40:56,041 --> 01:40:58,500
Well, I think it's you
who should cut the crap.

857
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:00,541
You already took the money this morning

858
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:03,833
and had that girl kill my boys
right here in this room.

859
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:05,791
The girl in the photo?

860
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,375
She was just a secretary at my company.

861
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:08,541
How could she kill anybody?

862
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:11,125
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I kill them?

863
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,791
I wouldn't care if you killed
someone else.

864
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:16,500
But you killed two of my most trusted men.

865
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:18,750
Why did you kill them?

866
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,833
I told you, I didn't.

867
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:22,583
It's you who got the police involved.

868
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,083
The damn officer even killed
one of my men.

869
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:25,666
Listen to you.

870
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:27,916
What police?

871
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,125
Don't try to change the subject.

872
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:34,000
Just tell me what did Noi and Berm do?

873
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:35,625
Why did you kill them?

874
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,458
I said I didn't kill them.

875
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:39,083
If I did, where are the bodies?

876
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:41,583
Now just give me the money
and end this nonsense.

877
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:53,416
May I?

878
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:57,875
I thought you already quit.

879
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:00,791
I never said I quit.

880
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:03,500
I just stopped.

881
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:07,875
You bastard!

882
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,125
Mr. Tong,

883
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:23,541
I'll wait until I finish this cigarette.

884
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:31,416
After that,

885
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,583
each of my boys will put a bullet
into your skull.

886
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:42,041
One through your temple for Noi.

887
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:49,666
Another through your chin,
up to your brain, for Berm.

888
01:43:25,208 --> 01:43:28,500
Mr. Tong, I have to kill you.

889
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:34,375
Otherwise, Noi and Berm's souls
won't find peace.

890
01:43:35,291 --> 01:43:37,750
It's nothing personal.
I hope you understand.

891
01:43:45,208 --> 01:43:46,541
Why are you smiling?

892
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:48,541
How can you smile
when you're about to die?

893
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:30,708
Isn't that delicious, my dear?

894
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:33,791
What's delicious?

895
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,833
My lord! Fuck!

896
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:00,500
Hey!

897
01:45:00,583 --> 01:45:02,291
Drop the gun now.

898
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,541
Holy shit!

899
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:55,125
You slut! You fucking whore!

900
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:14,958
I want to make love to you.

901
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,750
Wait…

902
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:26,666
Thanks for your cooperation.

903
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:29,750
I'll call you again next time.

904
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,250
Mr. Suwat.

905
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:18,791
Attention please.

906
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:22,208
This is an announcement
for all passengers traveling

907
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:25,791
aboard Thai Airways
International Flight 306 bound for London

908
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,166
that the plane is now ready for boarding.

909
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:33,708
All passengers, please proceed to Gate 69.

910
01:51:59,416 --> 01:52:03,958
WHEN GOD HANDS YOU A GIFT,

911
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:08,875
HE ALSO HANDS YOU A WHIP.

912
01:52:08,958 --> 01:52:15,208
TRUMAN CAPOTE
