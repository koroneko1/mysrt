00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.780
<i>‎Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.660
<i>‎But there's something about me</i>
<i>‎that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.100
<i>‎Because I have a secret.</i>

‎I'm sorry, Wayem,
‎but I've a casting this afternoon

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
‎and then a private fencing lesson.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.300
‎But we will hang out soon.
‎You're my number-one fan, after all!

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.540
‎But my father never lets me hang out and
‎I can't have friends over, either.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.860
<i>‎Seriously? You never have friends over?</i>

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.100
<i>‎That's harsh! One day, I'm gonna come over</i>
<i>‎and change your dad's mind.</i>

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.340
<i>‎And we'll have a rocking good time.</i>

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.020
‎My father doesn't change his mind
‎easily, but I appreciate the thought.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.020
‎OK, I gotta finish my homework
‎before the shoot. See ya.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780
<i>‎Bye, Adrien!</i>

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.780
‎Why don't you make the most
‎of your father being out of town?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.140
‎Have some friends over
‎and live it up a little!

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.100
‎My father has high expectations of me.
‎I can't go behind his back like that.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.420
‎Besides, even if I wanted to live it up,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.380
‎my bodyguard's making sure I stay in line.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.860
‎That's OK. You've got me,
‎and our endless supply of cheese!

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.260
‎That'll make anyone happy!

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
<i>‎-Is everything going to plan?</i>
‎-Yes. En route to the airport, sir.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.580
‎You will officially be
‎in Tokyo all weekend.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.020
<i>‎-No one will suspect you stayed home.</i>
‎-Perfect.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.900
‎Emilie, we miss you so much.
‎But you'll be back with us very soon.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.700
‎Thanks to my akumas, it's only
‎a matter of time before I take control

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.300
‎of their Miraculous. Merging them
‎will grant me power to reshape reality

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.740
‎and finally reverse our past mistake.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.660
‎They're ready. Nooroo, time to harvest.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.860
‎Hmm.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
‎OK. Remember our objective. To penetrate
‎the impenetrable fortress, Adrien's pad!

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.020
‎Our main obstacle, Adrien's old man,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.980
‎is headed for Tokyo
‎along with obstacle number two.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.860
‎As for obstacle number three, we have
‎our secret weapon to neutralise him.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.340
‎Operation Adrien begins... now!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.300
‎-Uh... now now?
‎-Yeah, now now. What now?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
‎Uh, now now is when I promised Mylène
‎I'd go help her plant some trees

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.260
‎-down by the river.
‎-Wait. This thing's today?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.220
‎Yes. And the probability of the girls
‎being disappointed

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.940
‎-if we don't participate is 100%.
‎-Which is why I already came up with

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.860
‎official excuses for each of you.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.940
‎-Like, you, Kim, have a swimming lesson.
‎-Great! I always have my trunks on me!

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.660
‎Dude, you don't have a swimming lesson.
‎That's just your excuse.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.100
‎-But isn't that lying?
‎-Sorry, but Max is right.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.820
‎The girls can't know about this!

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.020
‎So, is this mission still on?
‎For Adrien? Guys?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.340
‎Mmm-hmm.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.220
‎-Weren't the boys supposed to be here?
‎-Nino was asked to DJ

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.980
‎-his grandma's birthday party.
‎-Ivan rushed over to the dentist!

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.580
‎Nathaniel crashed his computer
‎and lost all his work.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.900
‎-Max and Markov are helping him fix it.
‎-Kim has a mandatory swimming lesson.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.740
‎Though I'm not entirely sure
‎why he texted me that.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.140
‎Uh, speaking of excuses, I... I forgot
‎that I was supposed to help

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.300
‎my grandpa bake a cake
‎for one of his mice's birthday's today.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.780
‎Sorry, Mylène. Catch you later, girls!

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.180
‎Did I miss something or is it
‎Bad Excuses World Championship today?

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.900
<i>‎Hello! We're here to see Adrien.</i>
<i>‎We've got a school project together!</i>

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.540
<i>‎Word is you're a big</i>
<i>‎superhero figure collectors.</i>

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.140
<i>‎Is it true your collection</i>
<i>‎is missing a few pieces?</i>

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.620
<i>‎Including this incredibly rare Majestia,</i>
<i>‎millennium edition?</i>

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.180
‎There you go.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.420
‎Two more of Adrien's buddies will
‎show up later to help with the project!

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.700
‎Vintage Knight Owl,
‎65th anniversary edition!

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.460
‎But if Marinette, Juleka, Rose, Alya,
‎Alix or Mylène come knocking,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.300
‎don't let 'em in, OK?

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.980
‎He sure strikes a hard bargain!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.580
‎-What are you guys doing here?
‎-We're here for the school project.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.180
‎-Project? What project?
‎-You know, the<i>‎ project!</i>

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.100
‎Oh! That project.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.700
‎Surprise project! You've never had
‎any hang-out time at your place, right?

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.900
‎-We get to have it whenever we want!
‎-So we wanted to right this injustice.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.580
‎That's really cool of you all,
‎but my father would never allow this.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.100
‎It'd be best if you...

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.860
‎But, hey!
‎As long as it's not for very long

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.500
‎-and he never finds out about it...
‎-Hang-out time!

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.140
‎A jet-stream bathtub!
‎So glad I came prepared!

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.060
‎Dude, I've always wanted
‎one of these in my room!

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.700
‎-Is there any game you don't have?
‎-Man, you've got the coolest stuff!

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.220
‎You ain't seen nothing yet!

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.900
‎Awesome!

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.540
‎This isn't the way to the bakery!

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.340
‎No, Tikki. I just said that so I could
‎lead my investigation undisturbed.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.980
‎-You lied to your friends?
‎-I didn't want to upset Mylène.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.940
‎It was her idea to plant the trees.
‎But something totally fishy's going on!

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.860
‎All the boys are unavailable,
‎with really lame excuses.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.220
‎Trust me,
‎I know lame excuses when I hear them.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.060
‎I've turned into an expert at them
‎since I became you-know-who!

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.260
‎ I know! I'm gonna call Ivan.
‎He can't lie to save his life.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.100
‎If there's something secret going on,
‎he'll blab!

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.420
‎Zidoune to Platino, who dribbles
‎and passes to Kyllian Nkake... Goal!

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.140
‎Yes!

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.300
‎-It's Marinette!
‎-Don't pick up!

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.100
‎You can't lie! If she finds out we're
‎here, you can say goodbye to guy time!

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.340
‎It's Marinette.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.220
‎Hmm?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.020
‎Proves my point. They're all together!
‎I may have an idea where they could be.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.660
‎Adrien's dad left town
‎for Tokyo Fashion Week!

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.740
‎While the cat's away the mice will play!

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.180
‎-Why can't we just answer Marinette?
‎-You don't want to miss out on

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.900
‎-a chance to hang out with your guys.
‎-But isn't Marinette one of my guys?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.500
‎Yes, but no.
‎Right now she's with her guys!

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.180
‎So, we aren't gonna
‎disturb her and her guys!

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.660
‎Otherwise we wouldn't be the good guys!
‎Get it?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.500
‎This whole guy thing's super complicated.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.180
‎OK! Music!

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.940
‎Whoa!
‎These can't be your awesome old records?

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.260
‎They were my mother's.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.380
‎Wait a sec! Is this as loud as it gets?
‎Max and Markov! Can you turn it up?

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.420
‎Affirmative!

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.420
‎I just need to hook into
‎the home's electrical panel.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.700
‎Ah!

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.500
‎-I knew it!
‎-Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.420
‎All the guys are at Adrien's,
‎so why can't I be there, too?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.420
‎I'll just pretend I was passing by and...

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.420
‎-Yet another lie?
‎-Just a half-truth!

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.220
‎Hey, guys!

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.180
‎Whoa! Your house has
‎an insane power supply, Adrien!

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.180
‎It could compete with a power station!

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260
‎-My father wants the biggest and best.
‎-Cool! Give me the biggest and best!

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.220
‎The system is down?

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.580
‎Emelie!

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.460
‎-You sure it's not too loud?

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.220
‎Are you kidding?
‎It's the way it's supposed to be!

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.780
‎-It's about time.
‎-This is my chance!

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.900
‎What's all this racket about?

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.980
‎Uh... Sorry, Officer, we're just doing--

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.020
‎A school project!
‎We're working on a school project!

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.700
‎-What's the topic? Eardrum damage?
‎-No. It's, uh... on Foosball!

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.340
‎Seriously? You're doing it all wrong!
‎Let me show you how it's done!

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.300
‎Cassette, de balayage... Goal!

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.820
<i>‎It's for the casting!</i>

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.500
‎Ma che bella fiesta!
‎The perfect setting for the photoshoot!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.340
<i>‎Uh, I'm one of Adrien's buddies</i>
<i>‎from school</i>

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.060
<i>‎and he personally invited me to his party.</i>

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.780
‎Hey, Adrien!
‎I'm digging the tunes! Rock'n'roll!

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.620
<i>‎Why are all the guys allowed in</i>
<i>‎and I'm not?</i>

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.900
‎Guys... Guys? Guys! Of course!

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.460
<i>‎Tell your young master</i>
<i>‎his fencing instructor awaits, wretch!</i>

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.780
<i>‎Can I rest here for a few hours, until</i>
<i>‎my daughter's make-up frenzy has passed?</i>

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.460
<i>‎Bonjour! I received a call</i>
<i>‎for an ice-cream delivery!</i>

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.900
<i>‎I'm sorry. I've lost a pigeon.</i>
<i>‎I think I saw it fly into your back yard.</i>

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.220
<i>‎Daddykins! I'm not finished with you!</i>
<i>‎Daddy!</i>

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.100
<i>‎Miss Bourgeois sends me here</i>
<i>‎looking for her Daddykins.</i>

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.700
<i>‎Would he be here by any chance?</i>

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.220
‎Jeannot!
‎Thanks for bringing your leaf blower!

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.100
‎-Stay peachy!
‎-Hoo! Hoo!

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.260
‎Stay peachy!

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.300
‎-Is hang-out time always like this?
‎-No! But it should be!

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.980
<i>‎Hi, there!</i>
<i>‎It's me, Marino, your neighbour.</i>

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.900
<i>‎I heard there was a party going on here,</i>
<i>‎guys only,</i>

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.300
<i>‎so I'd like to come too,</i>
<i>‎because I'm a guy.</i>

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.540
<i>‎In fact, it's hard for me to walk</i>
<i>‎with all these guy muscles of mine!</i>

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.100
‎ I mean, ho, ho!

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.180
‎-Master Fu?
‎-Who, me? No!

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.420
‎Not at all. I'm DJ Wong! Wiki, wiki, waa!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.300
‎-Master! It's me, Marinette!
‎-Marinette?

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.220
‎What are you doing here?
‎Aren't you supposed to be extra careful?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.300
‎Keeping the Miraculous hidden
‎so Hawk Moth won't find them?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.420
‎Don't worry, Marinette,
‎the Miraculous are cool!

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.660
‎Ah! Stationation!
‎Takes me back to my youth!

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.380
‎We could do the holiday-camp dance!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.900
‎-No. We can't.
‎-Why not, Captain Hessenpy?

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.220
‎-Nothing dangerous about that!
‎-No, look. We've got the butler,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.900
‎the ice-cream man, the policeman,
‎the janitor, and I can do the fireman.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.620
‎-But we're missing...
‎-The moustachioed biker.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.220
‎Gentlemen, I think you'll be able
‎to dance after all.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.100
‎The moustachioed biker!

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.820
‎I like your style! Whoa!

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.300
‎-Look out, sir!
‎-Thank you, young man.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.820
‎-Your natural reflexes are good.
‎-Helping others should always be

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.300
‎a natural reflex,
‎like swimming is for fish!

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.380
‎Hmm.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.820
‎Noroo, dark wings rise!

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.180
‎I need someone to restore power
‎from the outside!

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.540
‎I don't feel any negative emotion.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.860
‎There's only...

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.340
‎joy.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.260
‎What's going on in my house?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.660
<i>‎This is Adrien's voicemail.</i>
<i>‎Leave a message.</i>

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.860
‎Not only are you allowed to have friends
‎over, but a huge party is no big deal!

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.940
‎Why did you lie to me, Adrien?

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.380
‎Ah! I can feel a negative emotion.
‎At last,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.820
‎an unexpected, powerful
‎wave of disappointment.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.900
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise him!

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.100
‎Party Crasher, I am Hawk Moth.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.740
‎So, you weren't invited?

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.460
‎Well, I'm giving you the power
‎to crash that party and end it for good!

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.140
‎Let's get this party started, Hawk Moth!

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.020
‎To all of you who have invaded my house...

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.500
‎Now face the most fearsome super villain
‎ever created!

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.020
‎Adrien!

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.140
‎Your body language
‎is like second nature to me!

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.140
‎I can read your dance steps
‎and see all your moves in advance!

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.260
‎Aaah!

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.940
‎-Marinette?
‎-Uh, no, no, no. It's me, Marino.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.980
‎So, Adrien, too busy for your main fan?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.940
‎Well, I'll make sure you never forget
‎to invite me to one of your parties again!

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.620
‎Adrien! Where are you, Adrien?

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.340
‎Marinette! Run and hide!

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.260
‎Plagg, let's boogie!

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.180
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.940
‎Perfect!

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.540
‎Our surprise guests
‎should be here any moment now!

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.740
‎Disco dude! You know the tune.
‎When the heroes show up, the party's over!

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.180
‎Fools! All I need is to touch you
‎and your Miraculous will be mine!

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.140
‎Cat Noir, look out!

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.780
‎Whoa!

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.780
‎-How did he know what I was gonna do?
‎-He can anticipate our moves!

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.140
‎We'll have to figure out
‎how to surprise him!

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.140
‎Lucky charm!

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.100
‎An old cassette?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.020
‎Watch out!

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.580
‎-No!

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.140
‎Don't go in there alone.
‎You'll never pull this off by yourself.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.500
‎-Give me milady back!

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.020
‎-Huh?
‎-Huh?

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260
‎Idiot! You can't get me.
‎I can read your every dance step!

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.060
‎Disco!

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.620
‎Need some backup?

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:52.300
‎Pegasus? Viperion? Carapace?
‎Time to strut your disco stuff!

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.500
‎Beware of Viperion
‎and his power to go back in time.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.580
‎Second chance!

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.500
‎Don't worry, Cat Noir!
‎We've got you covered!

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.260
‎Shell--

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.540
‎Second chance!

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.340
‎Don't worry, Cat Noir!
‎We've got you covered! Shell--

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.740
‎Viperion!

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.060
‎There's only one Miraculous
‎that could save the day.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.620
‎But this one is so... special.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.340
‎-Aw! A flying monkey plushie!
‎-I'm no plushie!

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.500
‎-My name's Xuppu, you nitwit!
‎-My name's not Nitwit. My name's Kim!

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.140
‎I'm wondering
‎if this was the smartest move.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.620
‎-Just say "Showtime" already!
‎-Xuppu, showtime!

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.660
‎Incredible work! Now all you need to do
‎is send me the Miraculous!

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.460
‎Let's dance!

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.260
‎Hey! Wait a sec!
‎King Monkey loves to party too!

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.900
‎Uproar!

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.340
‎Eat this!

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.500
‎Seriously?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.260
‎What's going on?

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.980
‎Sorry!
‎I just love disrupting other powers!

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.620
‎Oh, no!

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.620
‎-Carapace, protect us!
‎-Shelter! Ha!

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.260
‎Pegasus, teleport here
‎and find something to play this!

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.860
‎Pardon me, sir! I promise
‎to return it after Paris is saved!

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.860
‎The only solution
‎is to be so unpredictable

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.780
‎that he can't read our dance steps.
‎So... Freak out!

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.300
‎What are you doing? It's nonsense!

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.460
‎-Cat Noir!
‎-Cataclysm!

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.660
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.100
‎Gotcha!

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.540
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.940
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.340
‎Pound it!

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.380
‎Scrub harder, guys!
‎Any trace of our awesome hang-out time

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.340
‎must be long gone
‎before Mr Agreste gets back!

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.220
‎I'm sorry, Wayem. I swear I had no idea
‎my friends were gonna surprise me.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.700
‎What matters is that you had a great time.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.060
‎And now, I get to clean house with
‎my idol! This is the best day of my life!

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.140
‎Things would probably have gone
‎differently if I hadn't lied.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.820
‎I wasn't completely honest today either,
‎but...

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.980
‎ I did it for Adrien!

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.500
‎If we hurry up,
‎we can still plant trees with the girls.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.740
‎Great idea!

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.700
‎Hmm.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.860
‎Ladybug, Cat Noir,
‎soon your luck will run out.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.020
‎And, one of these days, I'll be leading
‎you in a dance... a dance of doom!
