1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,360
Someone once said that life is like the hands of a clock.

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,680
They always come back to the same spot, repeating the same movements

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,680
over and over.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,800
We just never notice,

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,360
or we're just so used to this that we overlook it.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,960
But if we want to escape those same old loops,

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
how much courage would we need?

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,800
We have to think carefully

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,440
because it could be scarier than we ever imagined.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,280
-Let's eat. Are you hungry? -You're flirting again.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,640
Where are you running to?

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,560
Are you sure, Not?

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,040
-Yeah. -Did you bring all the books?

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Yeah, I did.

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,240
-When did you get here? -I've been here since 7:30 a.m., man.

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,480
-Too early. -Move aside.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,040
-What the heck? -Watch where you're going.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,960
-What's with that jerk? -It's too early for this annoying shit.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Hey, Q!

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,120
I couldn't find the book you mentioned.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,480
What should I do?

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,920
Why couldn't you?

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
What will you do?

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
Let's hope it's not true.

25

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,800

SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENT

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520

ROOM 6/4

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,480
They say that at 7:00 a.m. every day,

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,280
a mysterious message

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
would appear on the blackboard.

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
Each day, it would name a book for a subject.

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,840
If any student in the class failed to bring the book listed on the board,

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,600
that student would die and be erased from everyone's memory.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Jinx.

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Most people may think of it as no more than an app that teenagers use to vent.

KIDMAK @KID2005 - DAMN, I WISH I DIDN'T KNOW YOU

39
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
But for me and many others,

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,480
it's where we can be who we want to be.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,520
It's where we can speak our minds or write whatever we want.

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,200
And it's where I have friends who understand and think like me.

43
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,760
So sick of this. Do it your damn selves. Wish I could just sit on my ass like you.

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,040
Because, in reality,

45
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,720
we don't even know who we can call a friend.

Right?

77
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
Look at the homework he gave us. How are we gonna get it done today?

78
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
He only gave us one day?

79
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,080
I thought it was for the whole term.

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
-Fine. -What? You--

81
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Hey!

82
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,040
You guys really don't wanna know?

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,960
What we're going through right now,

84
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
is it a curse,

85
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,920
or is it just someone's prank?

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
If it's really a ghost,

87
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,360
we should get an exorcist,

88
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,440
shouldn't we?

89
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm not scared.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,200
If there really is a ghost in this fucking room,

91
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll piss in its fucking mouth.

92
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
You smart-ass.

93
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
-So brave. -You show-off.

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Hey. Wait.

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,760
If that's how you guys feel,

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
I guess Q doesn't need to get here so early anymore, right?

97
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
Auan!

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,240
What Q does for us these days works, doesn't it?

99
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,520
Can't we just be patient for now?

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,680
Hey, what if Q woke up late or forgot to tell us?

101
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
What would we do then?

102
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,960
Well, what else could we do?

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,920
His place is closest to school, so he should make sacrifices.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Right, Q?

105
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,640
Would anyone living farther away swap with him?

106
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,960
-Would you come at seven? -Would you?

107
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,560
-No! -Me neither.

108
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
Why? I'd rather sleep.

109
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,360
-No. -I changed my mind. No.

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,520
-No. -I wouldn't do it.

111
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
-I wouldn't. -I, for one, wouldn't.

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
-I'm so tired. -Hey.

113
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
-Weren't you being too harsh? -I didn't do shit.

114
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,400
-What's with him? -Q.

115
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,440
Can you leave home earlier?

116
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,960
You see, I have to leave home with my dad at 6:30 a.m.

117
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
And if I had to wait for you,

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,440
I'd be late.

119
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
And besides,

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
I bring all my books in case I need any.

121
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
It's too much, Q.

122
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
-Would you come at seven? -Would you?

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
-No! -I wouldn't do it.

124
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
Hey, are you listening?

125
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
If it's really a ghost…

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,880
…he should make sacrifices.

127
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,640
Do you understand me, Q?

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
-I'll piss in… -…works, doesn't it?

129
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,920
Hey, Q!

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
I've already tried to get here early.

131
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm asking you to try harder, man.

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,680
Enough, Vaan.

133
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Q has already done so much for us.

134
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
If Q could do any more for us,

135
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
he'd probably do it anyway.

136
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,680
Don't pressure him.

137
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,560
But he…

138
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,480
I'll try.

139
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
We'll see.

140
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
-Okay. -Yeah.

141
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,880

168
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,040
-Nothing, sir. -Get up, then.

169
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,920
What's wrong?

170
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
You look like you've seen a ghost.

171
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
What did you see? Tell me.

172
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,800
Everyone, let's continue.

173
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Turn to page 52.

174
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,200
WITTAYA

175
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,080
-Vaan, are you going home? -I have an English class.

176
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
Why were you late today?

177
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Hey.

178
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,120
I overslept.

179
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Are you sure?

180
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,480
Prem from Room One told me

181
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,120
that he saw you having breakfast downstairs this morning.

182
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,720
Q.

183
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
Were you just having breakfast?

184
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,320
Prem must have seen you having breakfast after you sent us the photo. Right, Q?

185
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,480
-Not. -Hey.

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,520
Not, stop it.

187
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,480
Let go of me.

188
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,600
He's lying. I don't trust him.

189
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
Would you swap places with him?

190
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,400
So that's settled.

191
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Let's all go home.

192
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,320
Q.

193
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,040
I hope you get here earlier tomorrow so that we won't all be late.

194
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
I feel bad for Vaan.

195
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,800
Hey, Q, for tomorrow, just get here before 7:00 a.m., okay?

196
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,480
Don't you all know

197
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,200
that if I get here that early,

198
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,240
something will happen to me?

199
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,680
Do you believe that stuff?

200
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,880
That old story?

201
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Shit, ghosts don't write on boards in the morning.

202
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,200
If they could write, they'd do it at night.

203
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
If you don't believe it, then tell me,

204
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
how did that name get on that chair?

205
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
Go on. Read it.

206
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
What does it say?

207
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,040
WITTAYA

208
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
Wittaya.

209
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,840
-What? -Who?

210
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,040
-What's he talking about? -I don't know.

211
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
Don't you remember?

212
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
The teacher said that name.

213
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,880
It's on the chair, and it's on the list of students.

214
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,400
So it's possible

215
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,760
that Wittaya was our friend,

216
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,360
but we can't remember him.

217
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,160
Do you ever think about that?

218
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,320
If you don't want to do it,

219
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,920
just say so.

220
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
Don't make up this bullshit.

221
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm telling you, we don't buy it.

222
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
If you don't buy it,

223
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
come and prove it with me tomorrow.

224
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Would you dare, Not?

225
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,160
And you, Big?

226
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,600
And you?

227
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
You'll have to come anyway.

228
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,720
Why should we?

229
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
You want to prove it?

230
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,680
You don't need our help.

231
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,400
It's your job,

232
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,400
so do it.

233
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
If you don't do what we tell you,

234
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
tomorrow,

235
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,360
we won't let you join our group project

236
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
that the teacher just assigned.

237
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,520
We'll make you do it for the whole class instead.

238
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
-You do it. -Hey.

239
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,480
Q, I guess you don't have to come so early anymore,

240
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,960
so you can do the work for the whole class. How's that?

241
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,520
That'll work.

242
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,520
Let's go, Q.

243
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
Not.

244
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Have you ever thought of me as a friend, or am I just your doormat?

245
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,720
I've always thought of you guys as my friends,

246
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,280
but I guess you've never felt the same.

247
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,440
-Be strong. At least you still have us. -We're your friends. Hang in there.

248
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,480
If they don't see you as a friend, don't think of them as yours.

249
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,880
I'm always here for you. Don't give a damn about them.

250
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
Come on, Q. Let's go home.

251
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,280
Be strong. I'm here for you.

252
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
I'll be your friend.

253
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
Life is a school full of tests and lessons to learn.

254
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
Hang in there.

255
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
GROUP M.6/4

256
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,600
You're finally there. I've been waiting.

257
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,840
Yeah, just go so we can see if there's a ghost.

258
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,960
-Hurry up, Q. My dad's leaving. -Come on. Don't be a wuss.

259
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,920
Don't pressure him.

260
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,720
-Go yourself if you're in such a hurry. -Turn on the camera.

261
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
ROOM 6/4

262
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,800
-TAN - DON'T PRESSURE HIM -NOT - TURN ON THE CAMERA

263
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,920
MATHEMATICS

264
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,480
MATHEMATICS

265
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,200
Are you satisfied now?

266
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,920
MATHEMATICS

267
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
Q.

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,840
Q

269
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,040
Are you satisfied now?

270
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,440
Q.

271
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
Q, are you okay?

272
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,480
While you were on the video call,

273
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,520
the camera went off.

274
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,280
So we rushed to find you, and we found you unconscious in front of the classroom.

275
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,360
Tan, did you see anything?

276
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,600
Right. Wait a second. Someone recorded it. I'll show you.

277
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,080
Have a look.

278
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,840
MATHEMATICS

279
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,560
Q, are you okay?

280
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,680
I think it'd be dangerous

281
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,280
if you had another episode when you were alone.

282
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
It's okay.

283
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,440
I can handle it.

284
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,920
Let's get back to class.

285
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
Q, are you really okay?

286
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
Why are you so quiet?

287
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,640
-What's with Q? -What the hell?

288
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,160
-Did he faint? -What's with him?

289
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,800
-He fell suddenly. -Did he faint?

290
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,400
-I don't know. -Shit. Did he drool?

291
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,320
That's weird.

292
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
What is it, Auan?

293
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,120
Listen, I forgot to bring the book.

294
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,680
Didn't you know which one to bring?

295
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Of course I knew. I already put it in my bag.

296
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
Maybe I grabbed the wrong one.

297
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
Check the classroom again.

298
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
Okay.

299
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
Check again.

300
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,440
-Do you even care? -I don't know. I skipped it.

301
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,640
Q.

302
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,840
What's wrong with you?

303
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Nothing.

304
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
I think Q was so scared that he passed out.

305
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't tease him.

306
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,320
-Wuss. -It's true, though.

307
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,560
Hey!

308
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,160
Is no one going to help me?

309
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,840
Why are you mad at us?

310
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,840
You forgot your own book.

311
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
-Yeah. -Right, guys?

312
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,920
-Shit. -It's not my fault.

313
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,600
-Why should we help? -Yeah, why?

314
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,520
Don't blame us.

315
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,560
-I'll send it to you if you want. -Right.

316
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,720
Shit. Did you resell it?

317
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
-You asshole. -And we have to help him?

318
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
-Why should we? -Why do we have to help?

319
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,440
Can't you just help Auan?

320
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Auan, borrow one from another class or buy one from the school co-op.

321
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I'll help you.

322
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,760
Damn idiots.

323
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,480
He forgot to bring a book. It's not like he'll get killed.

324
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,920
-Jeez, Not. -He's dead.

325
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,480
-Damn, he's so dead. -No doubt.

326
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,440
Let's go.

327
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,920
-I think he's just afraid of the teacher. -Tell him.

328
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,840
No.

329
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,920
Hey, Tas.

330
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,280
Do you guys have math today?

331
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
Today? No.

332
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,600
Thanks anyway.

333
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,480
Auan, go check the school co-op.

334
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,480
I'll ask around for you.

335
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
Q.

336
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,400
Listen.

337
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,240
Thank you so much for helping me.

338
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
SCHOOL CO-OP

339
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,960
It's closed?

340
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,640
-You'll see. -Sure.

341
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,000
-Hey, Prem. -Yeah?

342
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,240
Is your math book with you?

343
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
I don't have math today.

344
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,200
-And you? -Me neither.

345
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,320
Open. Come on.

346
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
Open.

347
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,520
Tan.

348
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,760
What were you two doing in the infirmary?

349
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,200
Not, this is a school, not a hotel.

350
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,880
Only you could come up with such dirty thoughts.

351
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,400
Do you like Q?

352
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,120
So what if I do? Is it your concern?

353
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,640
You, Tan… you like someone like Q?

354
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,760
That guy…

355
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
is just the son of a crooked official

356
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,760
who stole our taxes to pay his tuition fee.

357
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
A guy like him

358
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,320
can only ever be our doormat.

359
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,920
I know

360
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,040
that you think the same thing we do.

361
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,000
And what is that?

362
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,720
You just want to use him.

363
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,960
He's helping Auan find that book,

364
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,840
but do you think that Auan would appreciate him?

365
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
In the end,

366
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
Auan is just using him too.

367
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,280
Hey, Auan, how is it going?

368
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
Did you find that book?

369
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,440
No, I didn't.

370
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
I tried everything.

371
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,800
Auan,

372
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,760
you heard what I just said, didn't you?

373
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,560
What do you think?

374
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,520
I don't know.

375
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,920
I don't have time to think of anything.

376
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,560
But I know that Q helped me.

377
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
You guys didn't.

378
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
What the hell?

379
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,360
You forgot your own book.

380
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,600
I'm sure I brought it. I didn't forget it.

381
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,160
It must be you guys.

382
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,120
-What? -Did anyone see or hide my book?

383
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,080
-Again. -What the hell?

384
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,840
-He's mad again. -You forgot the book.

385
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,280
Now you're accusing us of stealing it?

386
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,720
You're fucking selfish.

387
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm not accusing anyone.

388
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
But I know what you guys are like.

389
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
Well, Tan?

390
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,600
I asked you a question. Aren't you gonna answer it?

391
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,560
What do you want me to say?

392
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,680
It's a silly question.

393
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Do you really like Q?

394
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,440
Did you already screw him?

395
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,920
Damn.

396
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
Did you screw him?

397
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,040
-I don't think she's like that. -Slut.

398
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,400
Answer me.

399
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,240
Answer me.

400
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
You screwed him, right?

401
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,480
Why won't you answer me?

402
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,840
Yeah.

403
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
I screwed him.

404
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
Why should you care?

405
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
So when you screwed me,

406
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
it was just a hookup?

407
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,920
Yeah, it was just a hookup.

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,680
I did it with everybody.

409
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,400
And with Q too.

410
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,560
I was just using him.

411
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,920
I tricked him into falling for me so that he would help you guys.

412
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,560
Yesterday, I came early with all the books for every subject.

413
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,760
That's how I saw him having breakfast at the canteen.

414
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,440
Not, I have to go.

415
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,560
I just saw Q.

416
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,120
Q, ARE YOU OKAY? AREN'T YOU IN THE GROUP CHAT?

417
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
And if I hadn't sent him a message, you'd all be dead now.

418
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,280
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU

419
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,360
How dare you talk to me like this?

420
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,600
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

421
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,000
Have you ever fucking thought about me?

422
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,560
Fuck you, Vaan. My book is here.

423
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,200
Why did you steal my book?

424
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
How do you know it's yours?

425
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,200
Your name isn't on it.

426
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,960
All the books look the same.

427
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, I didn't write my name on it.

428
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,120
But I drew the ghost of Room 6/4's teacher in it.

429
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
Take a fucking look.

430
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,520
-Look, everyone. -Damn.

431
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,880
-What a jerk. -Asshole.

432
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,720
-What now? -How could you do this?

433
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,320
-You betrayed your friend? -Jeez.

434
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,280
-Damn. -How could you do this?

435
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,520
-That's disgusting. -Auan is his friend too.

436
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
-So selfish. -Where are you going, thief?

437
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,520
I didn't want to steal it.

438
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
But it's all because of Q.

439
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,680
He took so long to say which book to bring.

440
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
It was too late for me.

441
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,040
What is it, Dad?

442
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,000
Vaan, why did you leave your book in my car?

443
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,080
Don't you need it for class?

444
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,000
My book?

445
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,000
Bye, Dad.

446
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,920
MATHEMATICS

447
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,080
Can you bring it to me now? I need it.

448
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,400
If it's so important, why did you forget it?

449
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,760
-Now you want me to bring it for you? -Shit. It really isn't here.

450
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,160
Dad, stop complaining. You've no idea how important it is.

451
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,400
-My life depends on it, Dad. -Vaan, don't use that tone with me.

452
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,400
If you behave like this, you have to learn the consequences of your actions.

453
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
If I didn't resort to this,

454
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,600
you guys would be treating me the same way you're treating Auan now.

455
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,960
You could have done it to anyone.

456
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
But why me?

457
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
I'm your best friend, Vaan.

458
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
I'm just trying to survive!

459
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,840
-Vaan, you asshole! -Hey!

460
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,760
-Hey. -Hey.

461
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
-Vaan's a jerk. -What?

462
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,240
I've been doing this for you guys all along.

463
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,440
You forgot your book, so you stole someone else's.

464
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,600
And yet you blame me.

465
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,960
But it was all your fault.

466
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,040
And you.

467
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,160
You made it all happen.

468
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,840
What's up with you?

469
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Are you nuts?

470
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,280
Whatever I tell you to do, just shut up and do it.

471
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,360
No, I won't.

472
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,040
Hey, Vaan!

473
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
What the hell?

474
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,360
Help me!

475
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Help me!

476
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,360
Let me go!

477
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,320
Let go!

A guy like him

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,200
can only ever be our doormat.

I asked you a question. Aren't you gonna answer it?

486
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,160
Did you already screw him?

487
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,920
Did you screw him?

488
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,760
Yeah.

489
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,880
I screwed him.

490
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,800
So when you screwed me,

491
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
it was just a hookup?

492
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Yeah.

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,680

501
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,520
Thanks, Q.

502
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,800
-EARTH - YOU'RE SO EARLY -TAE - K THANK

503
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,760
Not.

504
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,120
-Not! -Tan, move away!

505
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,800
Shit!

506
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,360
Who the hell are you?

507
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,120
I'm Wittaya.

508
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,760
For me? Why?

509
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,960
Don't you want to know

510
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,760
if the curse of our classroom is real?

511
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,000
Of course I do.

512
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,920
Here.

Wittaya's book?

515
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,080
Yeah.

516
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,920
I know that you can't stand him either.

517
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,480
I mean, yeah.

518
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,480
-But I think it's-- -Tan.

519
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,760
If you don't like him,

520
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,720
you don't have to care.

521
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,040
They say

522
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,640
that at 7:00 a.m. every day,

523
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,200
a mysterious message would appear on the blackboard.

524
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,600
Each day, it would name a book for a subject.

525
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,560
If any student in the class

526
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,960
failed to bring the book listed on the board,

527
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:48,200
that student would die and be erased from everyone's memory.

528
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,800
A tragic incident has happened at a school

529
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,280
where the students of Room 6/4 were brutally massacred.

530
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,280
The young homeroom teacher killed them all

531
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,440
and proceeded to kill herself afterwards.

532
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,440
The authorities have not yet determined the motives behind this mass killing

533
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,440
and don't know what drove this teacher to commit this act against her students.
