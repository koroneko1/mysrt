1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,750
What brought me to this point?

2
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,208
Friends? Girls?

3
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,500
Or greed?

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,791
Fuck it.

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,708
Now I'm in trouble.

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,750
Actually,

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,708
I'm in deep shit.

8
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,583
I'm hungry.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,916
Is that the forest? The sea?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,958
Sorry!

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,958
Motorbike!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Coming through!

13
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,541
Girl!

14
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,291
Hey!

15
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,500
Come on, girl.

16
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,875
Oh, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,750
Sorry.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,458
Hey.

19
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,541
You're still using a film camera?

20
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,375
And a cassette player?

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,958
So--

22
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,541
Come on. Don't talk to a punk.

23
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,333
-What?
-Come on.

24
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,666
-Let's go home.
-Come on.

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,833
Come home sometimes.

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,291
These assholes will drag you down.

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,083
Hey, where have you been?

28
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,791
Come play with me.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,291
Sim is such a noob. I'm struggling here.

30
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,291
And you're a turd who hides behind a post.

31
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,250
That's all I have. Take it.

32
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,416
Hey.

33
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,125
Don't you know how to say "thank you"?

34
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
I'm not your servant.

35
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,791
Why was your brother here?

36
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,291
He has a punchable face.

37
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,791
Don't mind him.

38
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,291
At least he gave me some money.

39
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,666
Are you sure that is enough?

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,750
You can't even buy items in the game.

41
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,208
Hey! That's my money!

42
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Skinny, where are you going?

43
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,666
That's my money.

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,791
It's 500 baht.

45
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,333
We should share.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,833
Help me, Sim.

47
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,208
This way. Everyone, follow me here.

48
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,625
-This is how we make a living.
-Over here.

49
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,041
Work that doesn't require much.

50
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:10,958
Can you see me?

51
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,416
It only needs teamwork.

52
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,875
We do what we are good at.

53
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,958
It might sound stupid,

54
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,208
but it's not so easy.

55
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,833
If one man could do it,

56
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,541
we wouldn't need a plan.

57
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,208
Hello, miss. Miss.

58
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,958
What took you so long?

59
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,583
I've been waiting for a long time.

60
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,000
Who are you?

61
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,375
Do not fall behind.

62
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,000
To execute a plan,

63
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,166
our team needs

64
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,458
a kick-starter.

65
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,833
A distraction…

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,166
that is so slick.

67
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,416
And we need secret players

68
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,291
that are ready to close any deal.

69
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,708
Moron.

70
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,458
Next time, put the oxygen--

71
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,500
-Put the oxygen in there next time.
-Who?

72
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,625
-Come out!
-Shut up!

73
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,333
Oh, yes, baby.

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,166
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,250
It's a damn cheap piece of junk.

76
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,791
It breaks when I bite.

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
Nine minutes, forty-five seconds.

78
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,666
-Still can't beat the record.
-Shit.

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,458
-Check this out.
-Hey.

80
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,666
Why are you showing off?

81
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,166
Did you borrow from a friend?

82
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,666
Yes, Chok.

83
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,458
All right, man. See you.

84
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,958
Guys, let's go collect coins.

85
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,291
To us,

86
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,208
Chok is fucking cool.

87
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,166
The more scars on his body,

88
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,791
the more intimidating he is.

89
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,375
If there is someone
that everybody in this city respects,

90
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,208
Chok is one of them.

91
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,916
Our job is

92
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,875
to collect the money for Boss.

93
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,083
This pendant

94
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,250
tells those motherfuckers

95
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,500
that we represent him.

96
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,708
Boss acts as the middleman

97
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,375
who clears the way
and makes all businesses run smoothly.

98
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125
Not anyone can do this.

99
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,166
Boss must be the one
that everyone respects.

100
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,208
Hey, Chok.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,666
He said you can wait here.

102
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,541
There are still a lot of customers.

103
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,750
Please wait.

104
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,375
Hey.

105
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,791
Have a cigarette while waiting.

106
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,458
Just let them clear out.

107
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,833
It's short.

108
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,500
Count carefully, Chok.

109
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,041
Shit, I counted three times already.

110
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,833
Well, if it's short,

111
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,958
Mr. Chow said it's all he has.

112
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,708
You just take that for now.

113
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,083
What's so hard about that?

114
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,208
Here, have some chicken with me.

115
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:51,625
This is our recommended dish.

116
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,625
-Pay in full.
-Shit.

117
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,875
What the fuck is with you, Chok, huh?

118
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,333
I'm having my meal.

119
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,625
Don't you get it?

120
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,416
I said this is all I have.

121
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,666
If that's not enough,

122
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,791
you want some more,

123
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,958
here it is.

124
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,500
Bastard.

125
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,083
Here, take it.

126
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,708
Pick it up and get your ass back
to your boss.

127
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,000
You fucker, I just want to eat.

128
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,750
What are you looking at? Pick it up!

129
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,916
Isn't that what you want?

130
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,708
My chicken is fucking cold, shit!

131
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,958
You denied my chicken offer,

132
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,458
maybe you want to taste my foot instead.

133
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,458
Hey.

134
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,875
Let me ask you this, Chok.

135
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,541
Is your boss

136
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,291
a real man or a beggar, huh, Chok?

137
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,083
Running around and begging
for money from all these different places.

138
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,916
What's up with that?

139
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,916
Get some coins from my office

140
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,791
to donate to them.

141
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,416
So they can leave my restaurant.

142
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,750
Just let me eat in peace.

143
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,250
Fucker.

144
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
-Bastard.
-Hey!

145
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,083
-Fucker!
-Motherfucker.

146
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,750
What the fuck are you doing?

147
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,541
Fucking eat it!

148
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,541
Motherfucker!

149
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,125
Motherfucker!

150
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,166
Get him!

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,875
-Chok, let's go.
-Asshole.

152
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,166
You asked for it, asshole!

153
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,041
-Boss.
-Are you all right, boss?

154
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,875
Chok, this way.

155
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,416
Chok, go.

156
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
-Boss.
-Chok, you motherfucker!

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,041
Motherfucker!

158
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,041
-Shit! He's got a gun!
-Get back here!

159
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,000
Motherfucker!

160
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,916
Chok, I'll get you!

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,416
Shit! We are so cool!

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,083
Damn! I punched three of them!

163
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,458
Fuck yes!

164
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,541
All right, I'll see to it.

165
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,708
He's dead.

166
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,791
I'm sorry, boss.

167
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,083
That fucker Koo cussed you out.

168
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,208
Chok.

169
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,583
So what if he cussed me out?

170
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,250
Would that kill me? No.

171
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,791
He would have to pay me anyway.

172
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,166
Do you know they're changing leaders?

173
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,208
It's Johnny.

174
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,833
Johnny?

175
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,875
Mr. Chow's son.

176
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,625
The one who was arrested
for drugs and went to--

177
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:36,625
Shush, quiet.

178
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,250
You remember Johnny, don't you?

179
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,916
Yes.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,708
Boss doesn't let us talk about it.

181
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,875
You know that Johnny won't let this slide.

182
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,708
Of all the people, Chok,

183
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,500
you killed someone in his family.

184
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,791
If you aren't here for a while,

185
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,416
will this be enough for your wife?

186
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,583
More than enough, sir.

187
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,625
All right.

188
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,666
Come with me.

189
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,041
What the fuck is going on?

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,958
-Shit.
-What the hell!

191
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,375
Chok.

192
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
We are even.

193
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,541
That's the rule.

194
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,583
You, you, and you.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,458
Don't you dare challenge me.

196
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,458
Understand?

197
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,500
Yes.

198
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:49,833
Tee.

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,541
You will take over for him.

200
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,750
Chok.

201
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,750
Just like what Chok told us.

202
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,500
Whoever runs a business in this city

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,333
has to follow the rules.

204
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,333
If you pay, you won't get hurt.

205
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,500
If you want to get hurt,
it will never end.

206
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,583
But if you want it to end,

207
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,250
Boss will end it for you.

208
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,291
Salute!

209
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,666
What a cool guy.

210
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
Do you think I'm cool?

211
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,750
What?

212
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,250
Give me a minute and we'll do it again.

213
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,166
No. I just lost money on a bet.
I'm in a bad mood.

214
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,916
Just wait for me.

215
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,958
Hey.

216
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,416
You said you wouldn't be back.

217
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
Why are you so surprised?

218
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,708
Did you go to school?

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,041
So?

220
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,041
Are you still with this bastard?

221
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,708
Watch your mouth.

222
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
I'm older than you.

223
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,791
But this is my place.

224
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,708
You stay here, don't go.

225
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,375
Let go. What is wrong with you?

226
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,583
I'm your brother.

227
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,500
Why would you let him beat you up?

228
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,166
That's between me and her.

229
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,166
Fuck off.

230
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,833
-I'm her brother, you fuck off.
-Oh, really?

231
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,791
-Motherfucker. What?
-Stop it, Tee!

232
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,041
-What?
-Tee, stop!

233
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,958
You bastard! Stop!

234
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,583
What's your problem?

235
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,041
I'm your brother!

236
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,500
It's between us, fuck off!

237
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,416
He beats me up.

238
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,833
It's my body.

239
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,208
What's it to you?

240
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,166
Do you think you treat me better?

241
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,208
What kind of brother are you?

242
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,291
I haven't been to school for months.

243
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,000
When was the last time
you paid for my tuition?

244
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,625
Why should I go to school?

245
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,875
I'm embarrassed!

246
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,875
Tee. You will take over for him.

247
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,625
What kind of brother are you?

248
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,583
Damn it!

249
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,916
When was the last time you paid
for my tuition?

250
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
That's the rule.

251
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,333
Don't you dare challenge me.

252
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,666
Don't overthink.

253
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,416
One day we will have to do that.

254
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,958
Aren't you going to wait for
Chok's wife to come out and get it?

255
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,875
Damn! Chok just died in front of us.

256
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,166
How can we look her in the eyes?

257
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,125
Let's go.

258
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,791
Why are you sleepy at the party?

259
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,666
Babe, wake him up.

260
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,875
Make him happy.

261
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,500
Joy, my dear.

262
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,666
Don't be nervous.

263
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,833
You can just chill here.

264
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,083
I know everyone here,
and everyone knows me.

265
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,208
Hey, busboy.

266
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,666
Busboy!

267
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,791
Baldy.

268
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,583
-Come over here.
-Just a moment.

269
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,208
Yes, sir. What can I get you?

270
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,125
Do you know me?

271
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,750
Yes.

272
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,583
See? He knows me.

273
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,458
I told you I come here often.

274
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,708
Come here.

275
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,666
I want a "snack." Do you have it?

276
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,416
Go get it.

277
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,541
Calm down, everyone. We'll have fun.

278
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,416
Fun and happiness is coming.

279
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,666
Happy vibes.

280
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,666
Just like old times, right, Joy, my dear?

281
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,708
Hey, where is my snack?

282
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,833
Sorry, it's out of stock.

283
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,791
Out of stock?

284
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,875
Then go get more,
why are you here telling me?

285
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,875
It's your job.

286
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,250
Go get it.

287
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,208
Do you want a snack?

288
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,458
If I didn't want it,

289
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,375
why would I be angry, Joy, my dear?

290
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,125
Does that mean

291
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,500
you don't want me anymore?

292
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,041
If I can have you,

293
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,583
I don't want anything else.

294
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,125
I'll fucking throw it away.

295
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,458
What if I take a snack but not you?
Is that okay?

296
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,458
Your job from now on

297
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,208
is to collect coins.

298
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,541
The main gangs
you have to visit are these guys.

299
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,958
Do you know Kim's gang?

300
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,458
They run a sex business.

301
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,416
When you see

302
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,333
a bunch of foxy girls standing outside,

303
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,000
that's their lair.

304
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,958
As for Sharif's gang,
they own big casinos.

305
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,958
I'm sure you have heard about them.

306
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,041
You've delivered to them before, right?

307
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,625
Next is Jaden's gang.

308
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,958
They forge all kinds of documents.

309
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,083
-Okay?
-They like to keep to themselves.

310
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,541
But they do go all in when fighting.

311
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,083
Muller's gang

312
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,250
owns brothels.

313
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,000
They find prostitutes for expats.

314
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,833
When you collect coins, count carefully.

315
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,041
They are damn tricky.

316
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,208
Last but not least, is Jacob's gang.

317
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,958
They are the most problematic.

318
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,625
They do every illegal business.

319
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,541
Let's say,

320
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,541
if there's anything,
you should talk to his brother, Evan.

321
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,250
He is about your age,
so you should get along easier.

322
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,416
What the fuck are you looking at?

323
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,208
And we are here today

324
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,625
because when these gangs have a problem,

325
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,291
we always meet up here to settle it.

326
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,791
Every issue ends here.

327
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,000
What he said--

328
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,791
-I don't agree.
-Me neither.

329
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,250
We all have to pay Boss.

330
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,500
I don't know about you guys,

331
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,375
but it's just a model I'm proposing.

332
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,500
Let's just say

333
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,208
we continue as we did before.

334
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,291
Jacob,

335
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,375
can you give your word

336
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,916
that you won't step into others' turfs?

337
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,916
Boss, if you say so,

338
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,583
how can I be against it?

339
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,625
Good.

340
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,541
Jacob is trying
to take over the whole city, isn't he?

341
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,708
Yes, but you know what?

342
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,458
He cannot succeed,

343
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,458
if Big Boss doesn't allow it.

344
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,333
Brother, Johnny is here.

345
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,166
That's great.

346
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,458
Congratulations.

347
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,083
Congratulations.

348
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:49,916
Hello, Boss.

349
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,333
Johnny,

350
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,875
when did you get out of jail?

351
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:55,958
Why didn't I know?

352
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,416
Well, your right-hand man…

353
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,333
Chok, let's go.

354
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,291
He broke the rule.

355
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,291
It was death that he deserved.

356
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,333
And the rest--

357
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,166
they are all little punks.

358
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,791
How would they know shit?

359
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,166
Come on, it's all in the past.

360
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,000
Johnny is so arrogant.

361
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,166
He must think that his dad is your peer.

362
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,791
If he doesn't want to be anyone's bitch,

363
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,166
he has to prove himself

364
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,916
that he is above Jacob.

365
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,791
I've got to go.

366
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,291
Goodbye, Boss.

367
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,250
You should be more respectful to us,

368
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,750
and you better watch over your turf.

369
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,291
Do you want to try me, motherfucker?

370
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,750
-Calm down.
-What?

371
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,666
What? Come on.

372
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,750
Evan is just Jacob's barking dog.

373
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,958
That dickhead.

374
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,875
But a dog like him might be useful for us.

375
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,000
Bastard.

376
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,166
-Ready?
-Ready.

377
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,375
-Clear!
-Clear!

378
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,333
Let's go!

379
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:27,458
I'll wait outside.

380
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,625
We have to be careful.

381
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,041
If it goes south, you have backup.

382
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,041
Backup, my ass.

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,791
Now that you have to deal with tough guys,

384
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,166
your legs are shaky.

385
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,333
Stop picking on him.

386
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,916
Let him wait here.

387
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,916
It's our first time.
We have to be careful.

388
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,125
-Take it.
-What?

389
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,625
Come on.

390
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,125
Chok is gone.

391
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,583
Boss sent us instead.

392
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,208
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,166
He sent you punks
to collect money from me.

394
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,000
Isn't that a bit weird?

395
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,291
If you're lying,

396
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,083
I'll kick your ass.

397
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,875
Kid.

398
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:50,916
Yes?

399
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,541
Pick up the cigarette for me.

400
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,291
Here.

401
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,958
Why don't we call Boss?

402
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,041
Just to be sure. Hey, get me my phone.

403
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,666
Shit, if it went like this
when we collect coins from others,

404
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,541
Boss would take phone calls all night.

405
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,583
Hey, you don't need to call.

406
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,750
We are not lying.

407
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,041
If you're not doing anything wrong,
why are you afraid?

408
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,416
I told you not to call!

409
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,541
Oh, gosh.

410
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,708
You bitch!

411
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:49,875
Why did you kick me?

412
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,416
We are here for Boss.

413
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,333
To collect money.

414
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,958
Even if you call him,

415
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,416
you have to pay me anyway.

416
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes, you are right.

417
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,375
Tell those two to put their guns down.

418
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,750
Put them down.

419
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,041
Who are you? MIB, huh?

420
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,625
They're my bodyguards.

421
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,958
Show us some respect.

422
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,000
Do it the easy way.

423
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,375
-Hand over the money, we go home.
-You're right.

424
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,458
-You go back, that's it.
-You're right.

425
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,250
Sure. Of course.

426
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,375
-Do it the easy way, will you?
-Can't you do it the easy way?

427
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,416
Yes, pay me!

428
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,375
Yes. I got it.

429
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,750
-Shit.
-Shit.

430
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,291
Who hurts my friends, you die!

431
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,583
-You guys--
-Don't make fun of him.

432
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,000
-"Who hurts my friends…"
-Come on.

433
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,458
Let's try this one.

434
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,958
Don't be chicken, guys.

435
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,083
I'll lead.

436
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:04,708
Not on my level.

437
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,666
Hey! Wasn't it too easy?

438
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,916
Why was it so easy?

439
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,583
You are the worst.

440
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,208
You are insulting me right now.

441
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,375
-Moron. Who is it now? That's not Boss.
-Yes.

442
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,666
Boss, are you still coming?

443
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,458
Boss?

444
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,250
-Shit.
-You're the worst.

445
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,291
Hey, Boss. Don't forget my money.

446
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,041
Don't forget me when you're rich.

447
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,166
I didn't do it.

448
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,875
-Didn't do what?
-I didn't do it.

449
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,416
-Do what?
-I didn't do it.

450
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,625
-I didn't do it.
-Fuck, this is bad.

451
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,958
Must be some rough stuff.

452
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,666
-Don't joke around.
-Boss.

453
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,916
-Shit, get her.
-Boss.

454
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,875
-Let me go.
-There's only you here.

455
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,916
-I didn't do it.
-What did you do to him?

456
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:20,791
-Boss, wake up.
-Get in there.

457
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,166
-Boss, wake up.
-Shit.

458
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,291
Boss, wake up.

459
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,083
What did you do to him?

460
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,375
-I didn't. He just went like that.
-Boss.

461
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,250
-I didn't do anything.
-Boss.

462
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,500
Hey, do something.

463
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,208
Boss, wake up.

464
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,291
-Boss!
-Tee, let's call the cops.

465
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,333
Boss!

466
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,208
I didn't do it.

467
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,250
-It wasn't me.
-Not yet.

468
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,750
I didn't do it. I didn't.

469
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,958
Come here.

470
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:53,916
Get in there!

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, I don't want to!

472
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,916
I think we can own this place.

473
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,916
Kid, you are unbelievable.

474
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,916
What are you talking about?

475
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,875
Come to think of it,

476
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,583
I think Kid is right.

477
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,125
Boss has no family.

478
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,916
And nobody knows that he is dead

479
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,833
if we don't tell.

480
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,666
What are you thinking?

481
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,500
This is wrong.

482
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:36,000
And you think what
we do every day is right?

483
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,000
There is nothing right or wrong.

484
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,166
But this is an opportunity.

485
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,166
I don't know about you.

486
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:48,291
If you want to tell the cops,

487
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,916
then go ahead, I won't stop you.

488
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,250
But think carefully, Tee.

489
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:02,625
Please, I didn't do it.

490
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,166
Please let me go.

491
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,333
What should we do with her?

492
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,208
I have an idea.

493
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,833
Tee, enough.

494
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,000
Trust me.

495
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,666
Let's do it this way. Who's with me?

496
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,875
Sure, whatever.

497
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,208
I'm in.

498
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,541
All right, me too.

499
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,708
Yes, that's it, man!

500
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,458
To take Boss's identity,

501
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,625
we first have to know what he was doing

502
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,666
or what he was thinking.

503
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,625
Make a turn at the corner.

504
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,500
Go to the other side, off you go.

505
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,541
Hey, give me more.

506
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,791
And turn everything of his

507
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,458
into ours.

508
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,250
Stay focused.

509
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:16,833
What, there's more?

510
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,166
Are you tired? Stay awake.

511
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,916
Tee, don't forget to collect coins today.

512
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,250
"Tee, don't forget
to collect coins today."

513
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,583
Go play somewhere else.

514
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:36,500
All we do is for Boss
to still have a presence in this city.

515
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,708
Don't forget to collect coins today.

516
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,791
Hey, you dumbass.

517
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,166
Hey!

518
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,500
Hey, it's open.

519
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,041
-Hey, it's open.
-It's open.

520
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,708
Look, it's open.

521
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,416
You did it.

522
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,458
Good job.

523
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,833
How cute. Let me give you a kiss.

524
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,041
Hey, Sim. You asshole. No.

525
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,416
No, Sim. Shit. Sim.

526
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,666
-What's wrong?
-Tee, help me.

527
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,250
-What are you doing? Get off him.
-Tee, he's climbing on my legs.

528
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,125
-Tee, help me!
-Get off.

529
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,500
You're drunk, Sim.

530
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,291
Sim, get off.

531
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:40,291
Sim. You are so heavy. Sim, come here.

532
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,250
Let go.

533
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,416
-You're so heavy.
-Guys, look at this.

534
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,875
Come on!

535
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,041
Cheers!

536
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,916
Loser.

537
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,541
What did you say?

538
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:16,875
You are a loser. Small dick loser.

539
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,833
Right.

540
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:22,250
Limp-dick.

541
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,666
You limp-dick.

542
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,541
You're a limp-dick.

543
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,916
-Sim.
-What's with you?

544
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,958
He is going to kiss me.

545
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,625
Hey.

546
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,208
Piss off.

547
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,375
Joy!

548
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,583
I'll be right back.

549
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:45,875
Hey, wait.

550
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,000
-What?
-He has to take a shit.

551
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,791
My dear Joy.

552
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,833
-Will you stay and talk to me?
-Hey.

553
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,625
Let me go!

554
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,916
Hey, you hurt me.

555
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,666
Aren't you going to apologize?

556
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,166
Apologize for fucking what? Let me go!

557
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,250
That's quite a mouth you have. Come here.

558
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,125
Wait.

559
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,250
Why do you grab me? Go get her.

560
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,083
How dare you do this to me?

561
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Asshole!

562
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,166
-Asshole?
-Yes!

563
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,750
Feisty. I love it!

564
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,583
Let go. Let go of me.

565
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,708
My ride is coming.
We will have fun tonight.

566
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,166
-Okay?
-Fuck off!

567
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,250
Hey, get in.

568
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,166
Let me go.

569
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,666
Just get in, you'll have fun.

570
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,916
Who's that?

571
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,833
Hey, calm down.

572
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,833
Whoa, so heroic.

573
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,791
All right.

574
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,708
All right.

575
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:47,750
Goddamn!

576
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,625
Bastard, I'll get back at you.

577
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,875
Thanks for helping me.

578
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,166
Yes.

579
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,625
You should be more careful.

580
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,333
Since you saved me this time,

581
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,541
you better save me again.

582
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,125
Are you leading me on?

583
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,750
No, I'm not.

584
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,208
Just kidding.

585
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,166
But really, thank you.

586
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,208
I'm Joy.

587
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,541
Oh, hell, I know.

588
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,708
I'm Tee.

589
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,708
“Hell”?

590
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,125
You are talking to a girl. Be polite.

591
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:42,416
Sorry.

592
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,625
I'm used to speaking like that
with my friends.

593
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:47,666
And

594
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,083
what school do you go to?

595
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,291
I don't go to school.

596
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:53,916
I see.

597
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,166
Sorry.

598
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,875
Why apologize?

599
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,791
I don't feel anything
about not going to school.

600
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,333
And

601
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,958
how old are you?

602
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,375
Who are you?

603
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,750
A detective?

604
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,916
Then do you have a girlfriend?
Just in case.

605
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,750
You are so bold.

606
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,666
Can I flirt with you?

607
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,625
Seriously,

608
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,875
if I'm in trouble again, will you help me?

609
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,500
Sure, if it's right in front of me.

610
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,500
But I won't always be there with you.

611
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,666
I can't take care of myself well.

612
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,958
Just keep an eye out.

613
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,916
Aren't you afraid of coming with me?

614
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,541
Why would I be?

615
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,083
That's great.

616
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,041
Most people are.

617
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,500
Damn. Why are you knocking?

618
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,500
Is your dad a drummer or something?

619
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,291
Hello.

620
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,333
What I did, I didn't mean it.

621
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,583
You had it coming, shit face.

622
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,500
You're tough, huh?

623
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:48,916
Joy.

624
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,250
Dad wouldn't like it
if he heard about this.

625
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,583
You are just a brother,
stop snooping around.

626
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,958
I want nothing to do with you.

627
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,375
Good, keep to yourself then.

628
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,583
Can you stop being a slut then?

629
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,625
You're embarrassing me.

630
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,041
And you went to jail.
Is that not embarrassing?

631
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,083
Joy!

632
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,458
For the shit you did,
you'll die a painful death.

633
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:44,750
Is that Boss's voice?

634
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,458
Do you think you can get away with it?

635
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,833
Where is it coming from?

636
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,791
Hey, don't panic.

637
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,833
Gosh, it sounded exactly like him.

638
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,125
How did you do it?

639
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,500
I used this app.

640
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:07,125
I used Boss's phone to call this one.

641
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,833
The voice you heard came from this.

642
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,250
When we use this app,

643
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,750
the other end of the line

644
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,583
won't catch it.

645
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:20,916
Hey, Johnny.

646
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,916
Yes, Father.

647
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,250
Where are we with Jacob?

648
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,166
Finish it.

649
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,083
Yes, Father.

650
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:32,083
If you can't do it,
I'll give the job to someone else.

651
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,041
I promise.

652
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,791
I'll pay your money back.

653
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,833
For Tee's sake, please, Jacob.

654
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,500
Let us go.

655
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:04,791
Tee?

656
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,708
Who the hell is he?

657
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,000
Does he think he is Boss?

658
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,458
You have to pay your debt anyway.

659
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,583
Do you know

660
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,916
Russian Roulette?

661
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,500
Look at this.

662
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,958
I said look at this.

663
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,708
Look at this closely.

664
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,666
Here, your turn.

665
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,916
Holy shit!

666
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,458
What is it, Kid?

667
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,458
-What happened?
-Shit

668
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,333
-What?
-It's the due date to pay the bribe.

669
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,166
What? Don't tell me--

670
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,750
To Big Boss.

671
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,708
Damn, we are in trouble.

672
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:33,000
BIG BOSS

673
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,791
BIG BOSS

674
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,458
-No!
-No!

675
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:42,541
Hello, Boss.

676
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,250
Hope you didn't forget our meeting.

677
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,458
Shit.

678
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,791
Hey.

679
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,166
We are going to Big Boss,
don't act like a kid.

680
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,916
How am I a kid?

681
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,625
I'm not a kid.

682
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:23,500
Hey.

683
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,166
Don't be nervous. Damn cool.

684
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,750
What the Big Boss says

685
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,333
is what you must do.

686
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,000
Take it.

687
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:07,750
How strange.

688
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,000
Boss normally doesn't send anyone else.

689
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,791
Shit, do you think that's him?

690
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,583
I don't think so.

691
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,625
What do you think?

692
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,083
Listen to his voice, it's definitely him.

693
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,166
What?

694
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,500
Well, Tee just means that you look so good

695
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,208
that we can't believe our eyes.

696
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,000
Are you sure?

697
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,583
-How does Boss trust you with this, huh?
-Here it is.

698
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,125
All small notes.

699
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,750
Didn't he tell you?

700
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,666
I only want 1,000 baht notes.

701
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,083
Damn it. Show me your face.

702
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:15,666
Take it off.

703
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,708
Strip off and get in here.

704
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,958
I won't get in.

705
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,666
-No way, I won't.
-I won't either.

706
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,833
You get in alone.

707
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,541
-Damn it!
-Shit!

708
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,708
I won't get in. Never!

709
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,000
Definitely not!

710
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:43,000
It's all right.
I don't take it personally.

711
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:45,208
Do you really think

712
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:46,750
that you can fool me?

713
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,708
I know. I have connections.

714
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,166
I know everything in this country.

715
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,708
And next time,

716
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,291
only give me big notes.
Seeing small notes irritates me.

717
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,541
Bring my gift to Boss.

718
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,208
Why are you all quiet?

719
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:07,125
Come on.

720
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,333
Laugh.

721
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,625
Hey, Tee,

722
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,666
I think I should go visit Boss some time.

723
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,416
I think this is too risky.

724
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,125
They'll catch us sooner or later.

725
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,083
I agree.

726
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,500
These people are not stupid.

727
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,791
We must change to lower the risks.

728
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,041
The old method that Boss used,

729
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,166
we should change it.

730
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,333
We have to find a better payment method.

731
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,208
That's easier said than done.

732
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:12,000
It's not easy like playing games.

733
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,000
But it's not that difficult either.

734
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,750
Shit, I got it.

735
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,125
After you topped up 10k?

736
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,500
It's my money. Piss off.

737
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,458
Hey, I think,

738
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,416
to be able to control everything,

739
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,041
we must build it ourselves.

740
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:39,791
What do you mean, Kid?

741
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,375
At first, I didn't get what the fuck

742
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,375
Kid was talking about.

743
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,541
What's in your mouth? Throw it away.

744
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,666
He asked for a budget to upskill himself.

745
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,708
He enrolled in things
we never thought of learning,

746
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,541
be it conventional

747
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,333
or unconventional.

748
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,625
We use graphs.

749
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,916
It's easier to look at these graphs.

750
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,541
The graphs are all integrated.

751
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:09,875
This is the latest game model
that I developed.

752
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,458
He didn't stop at just one skill.

753
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:16,208
He asked for more budgets to go further.

754
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,875
We will use the game
that we play every day.

755
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,750
We will exchange money in the game.

756
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,708
And with this password,

757
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,375
everybody can log in to the game.

758
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,541
-It's our rules. We created them.
-Put it in.

759
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:36,583
From now on,
everything happens in the game's world.

760
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,375
But there will be a secret mode
for the gangs,

761
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,916
not open to the public,

762
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,500
via the phone's flash drive.

763
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,250
And we'll collect the money from there.

764
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,875
In exchange for discounts
on the purchase of items in the game

765
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:53,791
via the characters we created
to represent the gangs.

766
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:57,708
Here, we are gods.

767
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:00,541
-You like it?
-Yes.

768
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,333
We don't have to meet them.

769
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,833
They still benefit from us.

770
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,291
It's a win-win.

771
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:08,583
Do you like it?

772
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,791
-Yes.
-You like it?

773
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,041
Pay for these two for me.

774
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,583
-Bye, see you.
-Bastard.

775
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,416
Guys!

776
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,166
The balance is climbing! Look!

777
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,166
The balance is climbing!

778
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,833
Today is the day they have to pay us.

779
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,666
You guys just wait.

780
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,208
We'll get more later tonight.

781
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,416
I'm rich.

782
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,500
It's hot, isn't it?

783
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:15,791
Don't you miss me at all

784
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,000
that I haven't been here
for several days, huh?

785
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,583
You're fighting back?

786
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,583
The offer you gave me--

787
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,416
I can't take it.

788
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,958
It's shitty.

789
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,000
Good. Very honest.

790
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,000
I have something to show you.

791
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:51,833
Look.

792
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,750
I know what you are thinking.

793
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,708
I'm not stupid.

794
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,875
I won't jump in to be fed on.

795
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,208
These animals are predators.

796
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,208
No matter how well you tame them,

797
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,708
they are still dangerous.

798
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,291
I've been busy lately.

799
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,125
I didn't have much time to feed them.

800
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,500
They must be very hungry now.

801
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,666
Don't get me wrong.

802
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,750
Seeing how you've been under
your brother's shadow for so long,

803
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,750
I just thought you might want
to build something for yourself.

804
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,708
Building something for myself
like you said,

805
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:52,583
I would have to betray my own brother.

806
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:55,083
I wouldn't do it.

807
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,041
Jacob must know

808
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,250
that these alligators

809
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,083
can't be tamed like dogs.

810
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,875
Eat up.

811
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,625
Hey.

812
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,375
Johnny, how dare you?

813
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,208
Johnny! Let me go!

814
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,500
Johnny!

815
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,750
Don't go.

816
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,000
How could that be an accident?

817
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,375
What a fucked-up way to die.

818
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,458
Evan was not a kid.

819
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,791
How could he just fall into the pit?

820
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,208
That's right.

821
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,583
And if that's what happened,

822
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,666
who could have gotten that close to him?

823
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,166
Hey, guys.

824
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
Jacob called.

825
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,208
He wants Boss at Evan's funeral.

826
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:07,375
We're fucked.

827
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:09,375
What should we do, Kid?

828
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,500
Why should we be afraid?

829
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,750
We will go.

830
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,500
Isn't Boss here yet?

831
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,458
He'll be here soon.

832
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,000
Hello, Boss.

833
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,208
Everyone is waiting.

834
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,125
Hello?

835
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,375
Are you okay, Boss?

836
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,708
I'm sorry.

837
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:12,666
I'm not feeling well.

838
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,666
I haven't been out much.

839
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,250
Your voice sounds terrible.

840
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,583
I'm fine. I'm okay.

841
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:31,041
Shit, he's almost here.

842
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:34,583
I'm all right. Don't worry.

843
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:36,458
Shit.

844
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,666
I think you should go back and rest.

845
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,541
I'm so--

846
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,750
Shit, he hung up.

847
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,583
Goddamn.

848
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,541
Smooth.

849
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,250
Jacob.

850
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,250
Pick it up, moron.

851
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,958
Cough.

852
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,541
Yes?

853
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:21,625
Hello, Boss.

854
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,708
Are you on your way back?

855
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,875
I'm on the way. I'm almost home.

856
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,291
How come you are so fast?

857
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,083
Just kidding.

858
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,208
I'm ill. Everything is a blur.

859
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,166
I forgot to tell you.

860
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,416
Let me deal with this myself.

861
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,416
You stay out of it.

862
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,083
Say something.

863
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:57,708
Hello?

864
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,291
Boss.

865
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:02,083
You won't even let me do this?

866
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,250
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

867
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,583
Who is he?

868
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,875
Hey, are you Jacob's guy?

869
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,708
I don't think so.

870
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,125
No, I don't think he is.

871
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:39,583
Shit! He is running. Follow him.

872
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:42,041
We need a weapon! Understand?
We need a weapon!

873
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,250
Stop! Shut the fuck up!

874
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,791
Sim!

875
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,333
Hey, you.

876
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,666
Is he still in shock?

877
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,291
See the state he's in

878
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,416
yourself.

879
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:05,416
Take him to take a bath.
Maybe he'll feel better.

880
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:13,625
Hey. What are you doing?

881
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:20,583
I'm done with the body.

882
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,791
So tired.

883
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,375
Will you check on Sim?

884
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,208
Yes.

885
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,750
Did your sister come back?

886
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,416
I don't know.

887
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,041
She wants to be with a man, let her.

888
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,875
Won't you try to bring her back?

889
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,666
She never listens to me anyway.

890
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,958
I'm not her father.

891
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,750
I guess I just need to let her go.

892
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,708
What about Joy?

893
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,333
Are you serious with her?

894
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,583
Don't forget

895
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,416
she is Johnny's sister.

896
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,875
Damn you, Tee.

897
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,666
Why are you asking for trouble?

898
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,416
Come on. Smile.

899
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,041
-No.
-Smile.

900
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,208
-Let's see.
-There you go.

901
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:42,458
No. It shouldn't be exposed to the light.

902
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,500
What? Where is the film?

903
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,125
There's no film.

904
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,458
How do you take pictures?

905
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,041
I'm just playing with it.

906
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,583
I don't need film.

907
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,458
Here, I got you a new cassette player.

908
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,791
It should keep you entertained.

909
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:07,250
Where did you get it?

910
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,916
-Not that hard.
-I've been looking for it.

911
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:13,833
What? There's no tape?

912
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,833
You just play with it.

913
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,083
You don't need a tape.

914
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,166
Cheeky.

915
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:22,875
Want to listen? Here.

916
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,125
-Come on. Just play along. Come on.
-What?

917
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,125
What is this?

918
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,375
Hey, Tee.

919
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,333
Come here.

920
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,125
Come here.

921
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,333
Just come here. Quickly.

922
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,291
-Come on.
-What is it?

923
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:45,708
Someone wants to talk to you.

924
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,791
You bought so much ice cream,
give me some.

925
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,791
Give me one, come on.

926
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,708
Now I remember.

927
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,500
It was you, wasn't it?

928
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:09,416
You told the police on me.

929
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,375
It was you?

930
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,541
Stay away from my sister!

931
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:01,958
Out!

932
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:03,458
Get out!

933
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,541
SOLDIER KILLS GIRLFRIEND

934
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:08,500
Sim.

935
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,333
-What?
-Look.

936
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:11,500
What?

937
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,458
Look.

938
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,250
-It's Tee's sister.
-Moron.

939
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,541
What about Tee's sister?

940
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,833
Shit, yes. Shit.

941
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:22,750
Tee, wake up.

942
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,166
I found your sister.

943
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,708
Where?

944
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,791
Killing each other over debt?

945
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,250
Really?

946
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:56,541
SOLDIER KILLS GIRLFRIEND

947
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,333
Our game is going well.

948
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,583
And our lives

949
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,750
are what we want them to be.

950
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,416
This is for you, Mom.

951
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,708
Open it.

952
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,458
You don't have to struggle anymore.

953
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,750
Here.

954
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:01,083
Call me if you need more.

955
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:14,250
Tuek, where did you get this?

956
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:22,083
Want some? I saw that you liked it too.

957
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,666
Your story is incredible,

958
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,333
but it sounds fun.

959
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,208
At the end of the day,

960
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:51,208
everybody is looking for happiness.

961
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:53,291
Sim.

962
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,250
Tuek.

963
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,333
They spend money on indulging themselves

964
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,458
without having to worry
about making ends meet.

965
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:06,833
But for Tee,

966
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,125
his happiness is different.

967
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,666
Let's run away together?

968
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,458
Are you kidding?

969
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:55,791
Why?

970
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,375
It's nothing to worry about.

971
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,291
Just leave everything we are used to.

972
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:04,583
Are you serious?

973
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,833
How could we do that?

974
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:12,708
Everything is here.

975
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:14,208
It started here.

976
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,250
How could we run away?

977
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,791
Of course we can.

978
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,166
Just go farther than we've gone.

979
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,625
Like you said,

980
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,000
just never come back.

981
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,416
There you go.

982
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,416
-Then what?
-This way.

983
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:11,125
Take control, you are the rider.

984
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,791
Look, it's on fire.

985
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:29,333
Hello?

986
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,333
What's up?

987
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,166
-Boss.
-What?

988
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,250
Tee is still seeing Joy.

989
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,541
-What do you want us to do?
-Follow them.

990
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,791
Don't lose sight of them.

991
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:45,666
Find a chance and get rid of him.

992
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,583
Make sure my sister is safe

993
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:50,791
and bring her back. Got it?

994
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:51,791
Yes, boss.

995
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:22,416
Shit, it's pigs.

996
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,291
Bastard.

997
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,500
What took you so long, you dog flea?

998
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:43,791
You know, my family,

999
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,166
we started from selling pigs.

1000
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,000
So whoever used to sell pigs,

1001
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,708
are good at butchering.

1002
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,250
I'm curious

1003
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,791
if a pork consumer like you

1004
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,458
knows how to butcher.

1005
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,791
Pig butchering

1006
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,041
is not my expertise.

1007
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:19,625
Butchering humans, however,

1008
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,208
I'm pretty good at.

1009
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:11,125
Respect me like others do.

1010
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,708
I want you to fear me

1011
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,333
like others do.

1012
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,458
I hope you come to me in peace next time.

1013
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,000
If Boss was here, he'd be delighted.

1014
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,583
To know that Johnny

1015
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:14,125
gave most of his turf over to me to run.

1016
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:21,208
This is reconciliation, isn't it?

1017
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,750
I have to thank you, Johnny.

1018
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,083
Since you and I are now partners,

1019
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,708
let's forget about the past.

1020
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,166
I'll keep this between us.

1021
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:03,833
Jacob.

1022
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:27,208
Do you think you treat me better?

1023
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:30,000
When was the last time
you paid for my tuition?

1024
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:31,041
LOAN AGREEMENT

1025
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,583
What kind of brother are you?

1026
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:40,833
This is mine.

1027
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,291
I don't want yours. It's full of brothels.

1028
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,916
-Great. I like that. You can take it.
-Here.

1029
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:52,541
All of you are filthy scumbags

1030
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,333
like this shitty city, assholes!

1031
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,000
-What the fuck?
-You're scumbags.

1032
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:57,250
All of you.

1033
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:00,458
What the hell?

1034
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:03,958
-Are you crazy, Tee?
-Let go.

1035
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:06,500
-Tuek, open it.
-Let go!

1036
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,041
-Get in there, Tee.
-Don't.

1037
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,458
-Get in there, asshole.
-Let go.

1038
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:21,916
Damn it!

1039
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,541
What should we do?

1040
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,000
What should we do?

1041
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,625
What do I do with you guys?

1042
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,083
Johnny,

1043
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,541
we don't have bad blood.

1044
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,208
Don't we?

1045
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:03,416
Where is Boss?

1046
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,375
What's in there?

1047
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:23,833
Cat got your tongue?

1048
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,166
There's nothing.

1049
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,916
Don't pretend you don't know.

1050
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:40,333
Don't pretend to be naive.

1051
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,250
Shit.

1052
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,541
Sim, you didn't bury Boss's body?

1053
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,791
I'm sorry.

1054
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,916
How dare you do all of this?

1055
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,541
Tee.

1056
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,166
I'll expose

1057
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:57,250
the shitty business you assholes did.

1058
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,250
Damn it.

1059
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,708
Johnny came here because of you, Tee.

1060
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,291
What the hell?

1061
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,208
You didn't bury Boss, now you blame me?

1062
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,958
-We might be spotted.
-Wait.

1063
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,750
-Get back.
-Shit, it's the cops.

1064
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,375
The cops are here. Get back.

1065
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,916
We better bring Boss's body back upstairs.

1066
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,166
You guys drive that woman home.

1067
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,708
Just give her a lot of money.

1068
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,500
-Shit.
-Shit.

1069
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,875
I'm tired.

1070
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,125
Damn you, Sim.

1071
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:41,250
I thought you got rid of Boss's body.

1072
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,000
Why did you put him in the wine barrel?

1073
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,166
You can't just blame it on him.

1074
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,041
We all made mistakes.

1075
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,291
Yes, if the two of you hadn't fought,

1076
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,875
we would have been done with the body.

1077
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:57,041
What do you want?
Do you have a better idea?

1078
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,083
-Well, say it.
-It's because of you

1079
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:01,041
we carried it up and down like ten times.

1080
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,250
So what?

1081
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,458
You always blame it on me.

1082
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:10,750
Sim, get up.

1083
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,416
-Asshole.
-Asshole.

1084
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,416
Hey, my arm.

1085
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,166
Shit.

1086
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,375
-Thank you.
-Shit.

1087
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,458
I don't think we will survive this.

1088
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:31,291
Of course we will.

1089
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,458
Why won't we?

1090
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,375
How could we?

1091
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,208
Who would believe we didn't kill Boss?

1092
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,916
What about that woman?

1093
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,666
Do you remember where she lives?

1094
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,791
Just take her back here.

1095
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:50,833
We can't do that.

1096
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:52,166
She's dead.

1097
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:54,875
Shut the fuck up.

1098
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,083
What the hell are you talking about?

1099
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,916
Hey.

1100
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,041
Are you guys hiding something from me?

1101
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,875
The issue about Boss is not bad enough?

1102
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,625
What the hell happened? Tell me.

1103
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,750
What happened?

1104
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:24,375
Damn, Tee and Kid are such dictators.

1105
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:26,833
Why are you complaining so much?

1106
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,666
Just follow Kid's plan.

1107
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,625
What else do they want from me?

1108
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,666
-Hello.
-Hello, Sim.

1109
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,000
Don't take her home.

1110
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,083
What if she talks?

1111
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,291
We'll be all doomed.

1112
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,416
What did you say?

1113
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:45,750
You want us to kill her?

1114
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,125
I don't want to do that.

1115
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:49,541
No!

1116
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:51,291
Shit, she jumped out.

1117
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,541
-She ran away.
-What's happening?

1118
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,541
Shit, Kid, she jumped out.

1119
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,458
Shit.

1120
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,250
Oh, shit.

1121
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,000
-She's fucking dead.
-Calm down.

1122
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,208
Shit. She's dead.

1123
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:05,125
-Hey, calm down.
-Kid, what should we do?

1124
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:06,083
Follow my plan.

1125
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,041
Don't let Tee know.

1126
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,000
This fucking door can't stop me.

1127
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,250
I can't take it anymore.

1128
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,208
I'm done running.

1129
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,625
We'll just end up dying.

1130
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,416
What then?

1131
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,458
I'll fight back.

1132
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,583
I'll fight like a desperate dog.

1133
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,291
Asshole.

1134
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,666
You are out of your mind, Tee.

1135
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:31,541
Our chances of winning this fight

1136
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,750
are very low.

1137
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,291
But if we run,

1138
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,541
our chance of survival is zero.

1139
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,333
-Jacob, we need to talk.
-Hello?

1140
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:48,625
-Let's meet.
-Pardon?

1141
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,916
-It's about Johnny.
-Johnny?

1142
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,333
If it's about him,
just wait for a moment, Boss.

1143
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,791
I'll be right there. See you.

1144
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:19,750
Where is Boss?

1145
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,291
Tee, you bastard,

1146
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,000
you stabbed me?

1147
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,000
-Shit.
-You stabbed me?

1148
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:41,500
Sim, get him.

1149
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,125
You motherfucker.

1150
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,333
Motherfucker.

1151
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:00,625
Motherfucker, what are you doing?

1152
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,458
Sim!

1153
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,666
Motherfucker.

1154
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,708
You hurt my friend.

1155
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:20,791
You killed my sister, you bastard?

1156
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,250
Bastard.

1157
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:38,041
Sim.

1158
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,666
Sim.

1159
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,500
Sim, are you all right?

1160
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,666
Sim!

1161
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:00,458
Sim.

1162
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,833
Sim.

1163
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:03,791
Sim, stay with me.

1164
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,250
Sim!

1165
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,208
Sim.

1166
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:21,000
Sim!

1167
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,166
Sim!

1168
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,458
Fuck!

1169
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:19,875
Bastard!

1170
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:32,833
Find them.

1171
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,000
Tell everyone.

1172
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:41,083
We used to be kids who were full of fear.

1173
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:45,291
Because Boss put fear in us.

1174
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:50,291
Now we are ready to face it.

1175
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,875
You won't survive this.

1176
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:03,916
What the fuck is this?

1177
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:12,541
We know what we did was wrong.

1178
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,000
It's the gift we gave you.

1179
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,416
The gift that makes all of you satisfied.

1180
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,833
JACOB

1181
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:27,291
The gift nobody else
was able to deliver before us.

1182
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:31,083
The two feet that stomped on you,

1183
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:34,291
the two hands that took advantage of you.

1184
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:37,708
I only did what you all wanted to do
but didn't dare to do.

1185
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,833
If we hadn't done it,

1186
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,666
would you have had the guts?

1187
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,500
Fuck!

1188
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,125
What should we do with them?

1189
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:57,041
I'll kill them!

1190
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,666
Who killed Boss?

1191
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:08,416
You all deserve to die.

1192
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,291
You have to thank the system
that you created.

1193
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:16,083
It keeps you alive today.

1194
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:18,458
An unexpected twist,

1195
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:20,291
it's like we are born again.

1196
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,833
And whatever your job was,

1197
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:24,208
just go back to do the same.

1198
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,250
Got it?

1199
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:36,750
There is nothing complicated about it.

1200
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:40,666
The last gift box,
which was sent to Big Boss…

1201
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:41,625
Damn it.

1202
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,125
…is the evidence of the shit

1203
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,375
-Jacob's gang did.
-What are you waiting for?

1204
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,500
Yes, take them all.

1205
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,208
Leave no one.

1206
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:50,625
Especially of them breaking the rules,

1207
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,958
invading others' turfs.

1208
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:54,000
We just used it against them.

1209
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,000
It's all about benefits.

1210
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,041
In this game,

1211
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:02,125
"Boss" doesn't mean being the leader.

1212
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,666
But it is the representative of
a special relation.

1213
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,083
Only a special person
can forge that connection.

1214
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:24,958
What we did was savage,

1215
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:26,708
but we wanted it that way.

1216
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,416
We rattled this city,

1217
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:35,625
and it has done what it's good at.

1218
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:38,125
It has swept our wrongdoings
under the rug entirely.

1219
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,333
The silence takes the place of
the shout of our victory. 

1220
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:47,958
Damn.

1221
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:03,875
Are you getting famous?

1222
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,791
Johnny.

1223
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,250
What should I do with you?

1224
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:13,791
I can't kill you.

1225
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:18,041
And yet you are my enemy.

1226
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:23,916
Then learn to respect me.

1227
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,250
So you don't have to be my enemy.

1228
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,500
Oh, Johnny.

1229
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:39,166
Bastard! I've had enough with you.

1230
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:45,041
Bastard!

1231
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,375
Can you tell me now

1232
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:53,458
where my sister is?

1233
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:05,708
You were with her before she was taken.

1234
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:08,250
The van that took my sister

1235
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:12,833
was found wrecked
at the bottom of the cliff.

1236
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:15,000
There was nothing inside.

1237
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:16,791
There was no one.

1238
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,375
Who?

1239
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,583
I don't know.

1240
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:28,000
You don't know?

1241
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,750
Then you are useless!

1242
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:54,791
Everything almost comes to an end.

1243
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,375
It will end with my life.

1244
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:59,000
For my friends who survive,

1245
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,791
they will be at the top of the food chain.

1246
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,583
Here. I trust you.

1247
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,583
Joy.

1248
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:18,666
Joy.

1249
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:21,000
What took you so long?

1250
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:23,125
I should have left you to die.

1251
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:25,250
It's not a miracle.

1252
01:36:25,333 --> 01:36:27,666
I have something crazy for you to do.

1253
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,375
I like crazy.

1254
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,375
What is it?

1255
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:33,375
We'll provoke people in this city.

1256
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:35,666
Especially

1257
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,583
Johnny.

1258
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,041
You guys follow them.

1259
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:41,791
Don't lose sight of them.

1260
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:52,041
Tuek, go.

1261
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,125
Don't worry about him.

1262
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,333
Right, Tee is tough.

1263
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,916
Don't worry if he's going to die.

1264
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,375
Stop suspecting me.

1265
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:08,666
If I was going to do anything that stupid,

1266
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,458
I wouldn't hide it, all right?

1267
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,333
We will start new lives together

1268
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,625
and let people of this city

1269
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:17,666
forget us for good.

1270
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,375
You guys are crazy.

1271
01:37:22,458 --> 01:37:23,916
You guys are fucking crazy.

1272
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,208
Let me see your face.

1273
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:36,916
Gosh.

1274
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,666
Take me to the doctor.

1275
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,958
Yes, you need that.

1276
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:42,250
Take me to the doctor.

1277
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,125
It's like I have a new boyfriend.

1278
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:21,250
I can give you more than those punks.

1279
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,708
But you aren't one of us.

1280
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:54,125
