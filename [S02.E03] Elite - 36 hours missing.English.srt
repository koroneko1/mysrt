1
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,560
When a teenager disappears,

2
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,039
it's normal not to be
too worried at first.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,600
A party could have gotten out of hand.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,039
Or they might have run away in a huff
but end up coming home.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,600
36 HOURS MISSING

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,920
But if no one has heard from them
after 48 hours...

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,519
with every second that passes,

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,039
it becomes less likely
that we will find them.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,960
MISSING
SAMUEL GARCÍA DOMÍNGUEZ

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,600
Samuel has been missing
for nearly two days.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,880
If you know anything that could help us
find out what happened to him,

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,079
now is the time to talk.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
Tomorrow may be too late.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,039
We were in the same class,
but we barely spoke.

15
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,560
How do we know
that you're not lying to us?

16
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,079
Why would I lie to you?

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,439
Good morning.

18
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,439
How did you sleep? Good?

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah?

20
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,879
Remember, I need you to cover
for me today and clean the two houses.

21
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,680
I have to take your grandpa
to the doctor.

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,319
Okay, Mom.

23
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,039
-Hi.
-Hi.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,240
The chauffeur
is still not used to the schedule.

25
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,039
He is so...

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
Carla.

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,879
What are you doing? What's wrong?

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,439
Whatever it is
that you know about Marina's death,

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
you have to tell the police.

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,759
No need to go in person.
Just an anonymous call.

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,240
-Do you really think I was involved with--
-I don't think. You told me.

32
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
I thought it was only a game.

33
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,439
I thought it was what you wanted to hear.
That it'd turn you on.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,080
Why would that turn me on?

35
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't know. You tell me.
Because it worked, didn't it?

36
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,360
So you're a pervert.

37
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,439
I never thought you were so interesting.

38
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm not another idiot
that you can make a fool of.

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,319
Are you two together?

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Not now, Polo.

41
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,520
Why are you doing this to me?

42
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,199
Why? I'm doing it for you!

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,719
Samuel suspects both of us.
I'm with him to keep him under control.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,240
Sure. Like with Christian, right?

45
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,080
You're pretty good at that,

46
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,240
grabbing guys by the dick as if it were
a joystick to control them.

47
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,800
Do you think I like it?

48
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,000
You think it makes me happy?

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,280
Well, just so you know, since the day
that you told me you killed someone,

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
I haven't been happy at all.

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,240
When all of this is over,
you and I will get back together, right?

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,879
We'll be Carla and Polo again.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,599
You are joking, right?

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
Come on, close the door, please.

55
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,759
I know it's Friday,
but let's not get carried away, please.

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
Now that's what I call
getting carried away.

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,759
There you have it. Taste it.

58
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,160
-I don't know what you find so funny.
-Me.

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,360
Don't you like it?
The video's pretty awesome.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I think you look ridiculous.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Weren't you all saying I needed
to stop mourning and start living?

62
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,480
Well, that's what I'm doing.

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,079
Since you changed lab partners,
you've been going downhill, Polo.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Well, brother,
it's clear chemistry is not your thing.

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,519
I'm better at the practical side
than the theoretical.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,639
When Dad kicks you out for failing,
will you be joking then, too?

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,600
You're so good...

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
So good at being mean.

69
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,240
If you'd actually worked on your part...

70
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,680
Where's your head?

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,680
In Soto del Real prison.
That's where my head is.

72
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,120
My father had a stroke.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
-Think it's easy for me to study?
-Sorry.

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,720
-That's not the only thing.
-What else?

75
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,160
Where do people keep their secrets?
In their texts, pics, and videos.

76
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,399
You want to steal her phone?
If you get caught, you'll be expelled.

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,720
No way.
Doing it at school would be a mess.

78
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
But isn't there a party
in that fancy club tomorrow night?

79
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,600
That's it. Lots of people around,
not much light, tons of alcohol...

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,319
My phone got stolen three times like that.
And I've done it twice.

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,279
-Samuel's not like you.
-Come on,

82
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,040
he must've stolen something once.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,439
-Not even at the supermarket?
-I don't even cheat when weighing fruit.

84
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,839
I don't know if that makes you cute
or a textbook loser.

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
But you're not a thief.
Nor a detective or a spy.

86
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,680
What should I do?
Do nothing after what she said?

87
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
No, you're right. It's all in her phone.

88
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,480
And with a little bit of luck...
we’ll fuck the little marchioness over. 

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,319
Hey.

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,759
-Would you help me out in chemistry?
-Have you seen my grades?

91
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,839
Just jerking off as friends, right?

92
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,839
What're you staring at?

93
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
Now we don't seem like friends.

94
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,319
Why don't you reply to my texts?
Why can't you look me in the eye?

95
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,800
Because you remind me
that I cheated on Omar. That's why.

96
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,439
Now he keeps calling,
and I don't know what to do.

97
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,680
I feel like shit.

98
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,680
I just need help...

99
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,240
with the exam.

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,279
Ask Guzmán for help.

101
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,040
Polo.

102
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,160
-I'm fine!
-Like hell you are.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,079
Move.

104
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,519
Sorry.

105
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,639
-Are you still taking the pills?
-They aren't working like they used to.

106
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,279
I don't understand why you're like this.
Is it because of Carla?

107
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,279
Just fucking ignore everything.
Forget her and move on.

108
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
It's not that easy, Guzmán!

109
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,199
It's like your thoughts drag you down,
take on a life of their own.

110
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,120
-They destroy you!
-Are you a shrink now?

111
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,120
No.

112
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
But I've been a patient
since I had my first anxiety attack at 12.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,319
But now it's much worse.

114
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,879
Fuck, you're making me feel like shit.

115
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,000
What?

116
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,720
The past few months have been so bad

117
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,000
that I thought I was the only one
with problems. But no.

118
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,159
I haven't been there when you needed me.

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
You're nobody without me, Polito.

120
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,559
Hey, if you want, I can help you study.
Come to my house this afternoon,

121
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,799
and we'll study together,
like in the old days.

122
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,000
I've been calling you.

123
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,559
I know. Sorry, I've been really busy.
With the move and all that.

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
How is your mother?

125
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,639
She's fine. It's a divorce,
not the end of the world.

126
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,039
What's this?

127
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,279
Just a gift.

128
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,480
You said your back hurts
from spending so much time here.

129
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,879
Thank you.

130
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't get too excited.
It cost eight euros.

131
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,320
It's not that.

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,320
Seeing as you weren't answering
my calls yesterday,

133
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,480
I thought maybe you'd met someone
and you were ignoring me.

134
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,399
I hooked up with Polo.

135
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,039
But it really meant nothing.

136
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,919
So why are you telling me about it?

137
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,960
I don't know. I don't know, Omar.

138
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
Did I cheat on you?

139
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,559
I don't even know if we're together.

140
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,440
Or when I'll see you
without being surrounded

141
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,759
by melons and zucchini.

142
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,200
What future do we have?

143
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,200
-No future.
-Omar...

144
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,519
Omar!

145
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,320
Come help me with your father!

146
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,399
I'm being serious, Ander.

147
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,639
This is my life, and it sucks.
I know that.

148
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,960
I don't want to drag you down. Seriously.

149
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,360
Go. Hook up with whoever you want.

150
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,960
Kiss whoever you want.
Fuck whoever you want. I'm being serious.

151
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,039
I only want you to be happy.

152
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
I only want to be with you.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,039
I want that, too.

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,759
But I also want to leave
this shitty shop, and that won't happen.

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
The number of 4p electrons in a Ge atom...

156
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,759
is four.

157
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Well done, Polito. Relax,
you've got everything under control.

158
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,879
What's going on?

159
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,399
-I didn't know you were coming, either.
-No worries.

160
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,720
Fuck, here we go.
Are we friends or what?

161
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,679
I'm always the last to know about things.

162
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,960
You'll never forgive me
for not coming out to you first, will you?

163
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,960
No. Spill it. What's going on here?

164
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,679
The other day when we were here,
we kind of hooked up.

165
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,080
-But it didn't mean anything.
-You hooked up?

166
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,039
You two hooked up?

167
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,639
When I was there, drunk? In my bed?

168
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,840
We got caught up in the moment.
It was nothing. We're just friends.

169
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,200
-Just friends jerking off.
-Just friends jerking off?

170
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,559
I was worried,
and you were laughing in my face?

171
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,960
Can't you find other guys to fuck?

172
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,200
Guzmán.

173
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,960
Don't get involved, Samu.
It's too dangerous.

174
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,679
You're exaggerating. It's just a phone.

175
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,000
It was just a watch,
and look where that got me.

176
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,480
And that's why.
Don't you want me to get you out of here?

177
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,519
I don't want you to end up
in the hospital like Christian...

178
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,080
or in the graveyard like Marina.

179
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,879
Don't get obsessed with that girl,
don't play her game, understood?

180
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,639
You don't have to get me out of here.

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,759
If I don't do it, who will?
Because no one else is doing anything.

182
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,879
We're all going in red.

183
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm having this killer dress made.

184
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,559
It's in the reserved area upstairs.
So VIP.

185
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,320
Valerio always manages to get us in.
You can't miss it!

186
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,759
-I won't.
-May I come in?

187
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
It's better this way. At our last party,
we trashed your house.

188
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,360
Don't worry, it was no big deal.

189
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
Go ahead, and I'll catch up with you.
I need to...

190
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
-Don't be too long.
-I won't.

191
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,679
What? Close the door.

192
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,519
Where did you invite them?
The Fritz-Patrick house?

193
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
No, the Torres house.

194
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,039
The day when I covered for you...

195
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,039
again.

196
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I know what I'm doing.

197
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,759
I cleaned, left it spotless,
and nobody found out.

198
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,320
No. I found out about it.

199
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,600
-Okay.
-I almost had a heart attack!

200
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,559
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have taken this job.

201
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,120
Mom,
this is what you've always wanted for me.

202
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,639
You've drilled it into my head
since I was a girl.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,720
You even named me Cayetana.

204
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,279
That's why you took the job.
And I'm making the most of it.

205
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,679
Who? Who's making the most of it? You?

206
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,639
Or the girl you made up?

207
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,360
This is what I am...

208
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,399
Yes!

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,759
Do you think they would accept me
into their circle,

210
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,480
that I could be their friend,
if they knew I was the cleaner's daughter?

211
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,120
My job is what puts a roof
over our heads and food on the table.

212
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm not going to lose it because of you.

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,639
If you mess up again--

214
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,759
What? You'll take away
my nonexistent allowance?

215
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Remember that I work, too.

216
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm going to stop hanging my head
when I see you in the hall,

217
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,799
and I will greet you as what you are,
my daughter, in front of everyone.

218
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,120
Like I should have done from day one...

219
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,799
instead of asking the teachers
not to mention your scholarship

220
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,039
because you were ashamed.

221
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,799
Is that clear?

222
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,679
Crystal clear, Mom.

223
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,960
Careful, girl!

224
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,440
Snobby asshole.

225
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,159
Hi.

226
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,200
I didn't know about your father.

227
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,159
I'm sorry I hadn't heard.
And I'm sorry for not talking to you.

228
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Don't worry.
I know you had other things on your mind.

229
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,120
Do you have something to say to me
about me having fun?

230
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,480
There's no need for me
to tell you what I think.

231
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
It's the same thing
you thought a few months ago.

232
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,000
It doesn't matter. I only wanted to say...

233
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,600
that I would’ve liked
to have been there for you...

234
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,080
and have done something.

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,559
What would you have done?

236
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,480
I don't know. Talked.

237
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,799
Given you a hug, at least.

238
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,919
A hug from you...

239
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,919
Just what my father was missing
to finish him off.

240
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,600
Samu!

241
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,519
-Nadia.
-Don't come near me.

242
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,720
Samuel!

243
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Samuel!

244
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Samuel!

245
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,679
Samu!

246
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,039
Samuel!

247
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,200
Samuel!

248
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Samuel!

249
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,000
Private lessons?

250
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,720
Yes. Math.

251
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,840
Well, and a little chemistry, too.

252
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,759
Physics. Listen, basically everything.

253
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,440
A mix of all the subjects.

254
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,200
Adriana.
You could also try studying a little.

255
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,559
Thanks for your notes. I owe you one.

256
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,200
You were being serious.

257
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,400
I don't have time.

258
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,160
-I'll pay you €20 an hour.
-No, thanks.

259
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,599
€30.

260
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,279
Money can't buy everything, Valerio.

261
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,000
€100.

262
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
This must be a joke...

263
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,599
This is your tutor?

264
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,680
You do know you're wasting
your time with him, right?

265
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,960
It was difficult to convince her,

266
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,440
but you know me.
When I set my mind on something, I get it.

267
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,319
Really?

268
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,519
Is that why you hired me?
To get on your sister's nerves?

269
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,119
Well, among other things.

270
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,319
Why? Does it bother you?

271
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,839
I'm starting to get used to the lengths
that rich people go to to have fun.

272
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
What about you? How do you have fun?

273
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,160
Everything that I like
is forbidden by your religion.

274
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,200
I don't know. Normal stuff.
I'm a Muslim, not an extraterrestrial.

275
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:20,680
What about sex?

276
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,240
Guys? Or girls?

277
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,559
What makes you think I would tell you
anything about my sex life?

278
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm taking an interest.

279
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,359
And I get the impression
that that doesn't happen to you much.

280
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,839
I'm not a prude.

281
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,440
I simply want to do it with someone
I'm in love with.

282
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,920
Wow... You haven't been in love?

283
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,039
-No.
-Sure.

284
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,920
Hey, is lying a sin in your religion?

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,319
You're lying to me.

286
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,359
What's going on with Guzmán?

287
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,480
He's a good friend.
And your sister's boyfriend.

288
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,400
I don't know for how much longer.
Let’s say the chemistry...

289
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,960
is not working.

290
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,160
That's the closest you've come to talking
about the course all afternoon.

291
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,319
Open the book.

292
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,160
That restaurant may have been really good,
but the service was horrible.

293
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,519
I had to wait for an hour to get my food.

294
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,559
The orders were wrong.
The food came cold.

295
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,759
It was horrible.

296
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,720
Cayetana,
I need you to wash all these, please.

297
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,319
-All of them?
-Yes, all of them.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,319
The waiter was so rude. It was horrible.

299
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,720
But I must say,
at least the food was delicious.

300
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,119
I have to go. I'm running late.

301
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,839
Okay, that's great. Bye.

302
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,720
Okay, this is the one.

303
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,759
Hold on a second, Cayetana.
I forgot the panties.

304
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Thanks.

305
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,359
May I speak now? Okay.

306
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
I don't like having to tell you off.

307
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,559
I don't like it.

308
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,799
I spent the whole summer with you
to comfort you and support you,

309
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
to move on from all this shit...

310
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,079
We both decided to do all this,
but you're not helping.

311
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,960
I want to be your girlfriend,
not your fucking mom.

312
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,799
I know, Lu.

313
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,319
And I'm eternally grateful.

314
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
But as my girlfriend,

315
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,880
can't you understand
that I had a shitty summer

316
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,839
and I feel like having fun?

317
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,200
And I was with you
all that shitty summer.

318
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,400
You're always telling me to have fun.
That's what I'm fucking doing!

319
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,640
Have fun, then, asshole!

320
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Have as much as you want,
take drugs, get drunk...

321
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,640
-You want to end up a junkie...
-Class is over.

322
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,880
-Excuse me.
-...like your biological parents.

323
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,839
That's sinking very low, even for you.

324
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,119
What's wrong?

325
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,480
Surprise.

326
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Fun is here!

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,839
Your...

328
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,720
fun.

329
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,960
Be alert.

330
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,039
Our work here today
is not only to look for Samuel,

331
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,519
but also to watch them.

332
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,400
Those behind a disappearance are often
the first to assist in the search party.

333
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,519
That way, they look innocent
and can control what we find.

334
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,920
Samuel!

335
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
-Nadia.
-Samuel!

336
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,880
What are you doing here?

337
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,359
-Why shouldn't I be here?
-Samuel!

338
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,640
I wanted him gone
but not like this.

339
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Samuel!

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,920
Samuel!

341
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,359
What are they doing?

342
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,119
The only way for my brother
to get chemistry through his thick head

343
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
is through his nose.

344
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,319
Are you worried about Guzmán?

345
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,119
No, I couldn't care less.
He can do whatever he wants.

346
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,720
Why don't you talk to him?

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,160
Since you're so worried about him,
he may listen to you.

348
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Rebeka will be right down.
Sure you don't want something to nibble?

349
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,839
Yes.

350
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,839
Come closer, for God's sake.
I don't bite.

351
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,079
You never told me
how polite your friend is.

352
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,640
You know, he saw me
with wads of cash the other day,

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,440
and he didn't even mention it.

354
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,799
I didn't see anything.

355
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
-You didn't see the money?
-No.

356
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,680
What a shame. It was glorious.

357
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,559
Winning the lottery must be incredible.

358
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,640
The lottery, he says...

359
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,400
All you need for that is luck.

360
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,160
And luck played no part in all this.

361
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,960
It took a lot of work
to get everything that I've got.

362
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,319
What?

363
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,119
I wasn't going to tell you
my life story right off the bat.

364
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,279
But now that we can trust each other...

365
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,160
Listen, I'll tell you something.

366
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,720
When my husband died, I opened
a haberdashery in my neighborhood. 

367
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,039
I never studied, and I had no experience.

368
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,200
Nothing. And I did damn great.

369
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,519
Have some.

370
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,359
But...
then a shopping center opened next door.

371
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
And the haberdashery went to shit.

372
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,160
So I found another in-demand product.

373
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,359
With no big company
that could come and step on my turf.

374
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,559
It sounds more dangerous
than selling panties and bras.

375
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,400
Isn't it dangerous riding a bike around
with cars passing at high speeds?

376
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,359
How much do you get paid

377
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,960
for risking your life
so that pizza’s hot when it arrives?

378
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
They pay shit.

379
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
Take a seat.

380
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,039
Mom pays her people very well.

381
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,400
You could get your brother's bail money
together faster working for her.

382
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,839
A lot faster.

383
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,440
One family member in prison is enough.
Thanks.

384
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,079
Why me, anyway?
Do I look like a dealer?

385
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
Precisely because you don't.

386
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,319
You won't attract attention
coming and going on your bike.

387
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,319
Anyway, you wouldn't be a dealer,
only a deliveryman. 

388
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
I haven't been here long,
and I need people I can trust.

389
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,279
Think about it.

390
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,079
Bingo! Look who's coming.

391
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,039
Hi!

392
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,319
Well, I'm ready. We can leave now.

393
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,079
Could I come to that party, too?

394
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
Wow, wait a minute, honey.

395
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,599
Let's see...

396
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,799
It's a red party.

397
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,240
And from what I've seen,
you only have clothes in two colors:

398
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,240
boring and mega boring.

399
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,640
Let her borrow something of yours.

400
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,279
I'm sure something in your huge wardrobe
would look good on her.

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,319
Let the party begin!

402
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
I see.

403
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,440
-Cayetana! We're over here.
-Hey.

404
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,680
-Hi.
-How are you?

405
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,000
I love it!

406
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,559
-Thanks!
-Haute couture, right?

407
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,799
-A Ralph Lauren.
-I know. Gorgeous.

408
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,000
Hi.

409
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Are you all right?

410
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,720
Better than ever, kid.

411
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,519
-I can see that.
-How about a selfie?

412
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,240
Omar,

413
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,079
before you close up, clean the camera,

414
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,119
and make sure
all the receipts are there.

415
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
-Yesterday, you forgot a few.
-Sure.

416
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
Inspector!

417
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,160
Inspector!

418
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Inspector!

419
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,519
I found something.

420
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,119
-Next to that tree.
-Everyone, stay there.

421
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,880
Fucking hell!
We won't attract attention at all.

422
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,160
Want to play again?

423
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,559
I came to apologize.

424
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,599
I kinda lost it the other day.

425
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,599
-Champagne?
-You can't impress me with your money.

426
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
My money’s the least impressive thing
about me, babe.

427
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,920
-I know. I've seen your Instagram.
-Did you like it?

428
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,920
-I did. Except I'm nowhere to be seen.
-That's easy to fix.

429
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:48,000
Hi. I didn't know you guys were coming.

430
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,440
Shit! Don't you look cute!

431
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,599
You're not still thinking about...

432
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,240
You go do your thing, huh?
Have fun with your new friends.

433
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
I'll do one.

434
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,519
-What are you saying?
-I want to do one. How much is it?

435
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,240
Nothing. This moment is priceless.

436
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,519
Nadia, what are you doing?

437
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm going to do what you're doing.
Drink what you're drinking all night long.

438
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
Maybe I'll understand you
by the end of it.

439
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,119
Or maybe you will realize how scary it is
to see someone you care about doing this.

440
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
Is that why you came?

441
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,640
-To lecture me?
-No.

442
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,079
But don't worry.

443
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,680
If this is so harmless,
you won't mind me doing it, too.

444
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,039
Right?

445
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,759
What are you doing?

446
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,720
What the fuck are you looking at?

447
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,680
So we had to take the metro. The smells!

448
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,359
The colors! There was no--

449
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,160
Relax, don't make such a big deal.

450
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,960
This is not a white party.

451
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,319
I'm leaving.

452
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,279
Of course.

453
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,640
Sure. You wouldn't be worried
about spilling anything on you,

454
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,680
wearing last year's dress.

455
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,319
I have better things to do

456
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,960
than spend the day thinking
about what clothes I'm going to wear.

457
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,200
Instead, you think about
the clothes you're going to take off

458
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,720
the next lowlife you want to fuck, right?

459
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,039
I need another drink to put up with this.

460
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,000
Whose round is it?

461
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,119
Mine! I'll go.

462
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,240
I'll be right back.

463
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,519
Valerio... Let's see if this works.

464
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Sometimes my card works,
sometimes it doesn't.

465
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,680
I've worn it out from too much shopping.
What are you doing?

466
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,640
A bottle for my friend!

467
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,480
For...

468
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,079
Thanks!
It's worn out from too much shopping.

469
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,440
-You pay with a card?
-Yeah.

470
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,799
Vintage, huh?

471
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,920
Okay, yes, you're right.

472
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,759
When I activated mobile payments,

473
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,160
I ended up killing the battery
at the Prada boutique in Goya.

474
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,400
And then I had to hail a cab
in the street.

475
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,799
That really was vintage.

476
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,759
So? How do you like Las Encinas?

477
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,000
It's a dream come true.

478
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,599
Thanks.

479
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,480
Please, man, I don't want to go up there.

480
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,400
All I'm asking you is
to tell my friends I'm here.

481
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,119
Let him in. He's with me.

482
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,119
Come.

483
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,400
What are you doing here?
What about the store?

484
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,039
I've had enough of the store.

485
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,319
I've had enough of the store
and my father.

486
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,920
I've had enough of cushions, melons.

487
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,119
-I've had enough of all of it.
-Okay.

488
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,480
No more cushions.
Do you want the receipt to return it?

489
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,240
No, you idiot.

490
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,400
What I'm trying to say is that
our relationship isn't complicated.

491
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,240
What’s difficult
is spending all day in the damn store,

492
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,839
pretending to be someone else.

493
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,640
Closing up, coming here to find you,

494
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,279
and kissing you in front of
an entire club full of people

495
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,079
is the easiest thing
I have done in my life.

496
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,440
Do you have anything to tell me, Nadia?

497
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,440
Don't be afraid.
Whatever you say is confidential.

498
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,280
Nobody will find out.

499
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Not long before Samuel went missing...

500
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,719
someone threatened him
in the hallway at school.

501
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,039
Who?

502
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,599
You couldn't pry her away
from her phone with a stick.

503
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,800
Not even a selfie stick.

504
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,159
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

505
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,800
Is it Jägermeister? It stains!

506
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,039
-This is a Ralph Lauren!
-Relax, girl.

507
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,159
Aren't you filthy rich? Buy a new one.

508
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,039
It's calimocho.

509
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,960
I wouldn't be surprised if you snuck
the cheap wine in in your bra.

510
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,599
Hey, I said I was sorry.

511
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,320
-You should be sorry for existing.
-Oh, should I? There you go.

512
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,280
What are you doing?

513
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,880
-Please, stop.
-You fucking bitch!

514
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,920
What are you doing with Carla's phone?

515
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,159
Don't tell me you're
a thief as well, waiter.

516
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,320
It must be in your blood.

517
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,320
I didn't have time to break
your brother's legs,

518
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,679
-but as for you--
-Guzmán, leave him!

519
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,360
He got mixed up.

520
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,360
-We have similar phone covers.
-What are you talking about?

521
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,639
Let him go.

522
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,360
Here. All yours.
You know how to unlock it, right?

523
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,000
You're giving it to me
'cause you've deleted

524
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,440
anything that might implicate you.

525
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,800
If something could implicate me,
I would delete it.

526
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm not an idiot.

527
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,280
But there's nothing. I had nothing to do
with what happened.

528
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm not a fucking idiot either!
Look me in the eye.

529
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,559
It wasn't a game. You meant it.

530
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,840
You were involved with Marina's death.

531
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Get out!

532
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,639
Yes, I did have something to do with it.
You know why?

533
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,679
Because I wasn't there.

534
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,760
She was my best friend
since primary school.

535
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,320
I dumped her and went off with Lu,
just because she was more fun.

536
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,519
Less intense.

537
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,280
I wasn't there, not for the HIV thing,

538
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,559
nor when she hooked up
with your brother and stole the watch.

539
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,239
I wasn't a best friend to her.
And now she's dead.

540
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,719
Where are you? Do you have it?

541
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,000
The main thing is not to overdo it.

542
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,280
Cheers!

543
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,320
I'll have one of those. Whatever it is.

544
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,079
-Shit.
-Okay.

545
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,159
Again?

546
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,360
Excuse me a second.

547
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,599
-How much did you drink?
-As much as you.

548
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't you have someone else to bother?
Everyone in here is on something!

549
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,039
Guzmán, please!

550
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,239
You're the one that I'm worried about.

551
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,440
The worst thing isn't
that you're taking drugs.

552
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,679
It's your reason for doing it.

553
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,119
It's not about having a good time.

554
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,840
You want to fill the void Marina left.

555
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,920
-Please, Nadia, don't bring that up now.
-Listen to me.

556
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,000
But no chemical substance will do that.

557
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,199
And I'm scared...

558
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,199
that you'll keep on trying

559
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,119
until you end up joining her
before your time.

560
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
And it's a bit too early

561
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,639
to tell which of our gods is right
about the afterlife.

562
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,079
Don't you think?

563
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Guzmán!

564
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Happy now?

565
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,239
And a little smashed.

566
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,440
Or at least I think so.

567
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,199
-This is what smashed means, right?
-Yeah.

568
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,440
-I can tell you are.
-Thanks.

569
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,280
So...

570
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,920
Why don't we have a nice glass of water
loaded with ice?

571
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Thanks.

572
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,719
-Shall we?
-Let’s.

573
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:28,119
It came out! Sorry.
It's just that I really love this dress.

574
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,039
Though I think it's time to hang it up.
It's very early 2018,

575
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,039
and velvet isn't...

576
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you all right?

577
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,199
-What?
-Are you all right?

578
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,880
I don't want to ruin the party for you.

579
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,239
That's what my best friend
should be here for,

580
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,199
but she left without saying goodbye.

581
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,559
I'm here, Lucrecia.

582
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,360
For anything you need.
You can trust me and--

583
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,199
Call me Lu.

584
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,119
Call me Lu.

585
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,519
Is it true?
The thing about the jacket and...

586
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,760
the blood?

587
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,599
What relationship did you have
with Samuel?

588
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,159
None.

589
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,199
-We hardly spoke.
-Are you sure?

590
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,039
Because one of your classmates told us

591
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,800
that you said something to him
in the hall a few weeks ago.

592
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,599
Do you remember what you said?

593
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,880
What did you say to him, Lucrecia?

594
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,840
I said, "You're a dead man, you bastard."

595
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,719
It's my fault.

596
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I left the door wide open
for Miss Palestine.

597
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,880
And she has thrown herself
into reconquering him.

598
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,000
Lu, you don’t have to look after Guzmán
his entire life.

599
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,599
Anyway, who's looking after you?

600
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,199
So, where are you going?

601
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,800
Our car has arrived, miss.

602
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,000
What?

603
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,039
I almost went down,
but I puked a very, very, very little bit,

604
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,880
-and look at me! Now I'm good as new.
-Sure.

605
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,519
I bet Luis Miguel makes a song about that.

606
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,440
No.

607
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,440
Don't you want to come with us?

608
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,400
Your house is not too far.

609
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,960
No, I already ordered a Cabify.
I think it's this one.

610
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,519
I'll take it and leave.

611
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,320
-Bye, honey.
-See you.

612
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,559
NEXT BUS: 40 MINUTES

613
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:01,960
It's really weird,

614
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,440
being here, with you.

615
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,960
-What are we doing?
-You think it's weird?

616
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,039
I do.

617
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,920
What about now?

618
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:17,639
I still do.

619
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
What about now?

620
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,039
A little less.

621
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:27,719
What about now?

622
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,840
Do you want me to take you home?

623
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,880
Don't you get tired of always playing
the knight in shining armor?

624
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,480
What's wrong with that?

625
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:50,599
Didn't they used to kill Muslims
during the Crusades?

626
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I forgot that I'm dealing
with an infidel Muslim and not a lady.

627
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,079
It's true.

628
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,559
I'm not much of a lady.

629
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:00,280
I think...

630
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,719
I've had too much to drink.

631
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,960
No, just enough to do
what you've been wanting to do.

632
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,079
And I have, too.

633
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,960
-Good night, Guzmán.
-Nadia...

634
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,480
What's going on with you?

635
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,000
The pills, the alcohol...

636
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,599
I don't know.

637
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:51,880
Come on, I'll take you home.

638
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,960
Do you know I've been here over an hour?
Nobody even noticed.

639
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,400
Shit.

640
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,400
How can you close the store like this?
Without emptying the register.

641
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,000
-Anyone could have come and taken it.
-But they didn't.

642
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,719
You say that you're going
to start being responsible,

643
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,639
but you never change. Never.

644
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,360
Your family needs you. And what do you do?

645
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,480
Look at your sister.

646
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,920
You bring her home like this,
wearing makeup, smelling of alcohol.

647
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,199
-Dad, Omar is not to blame.
-Stay out of it.

648
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,440
I'm to blame for everything, right?

649
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,679
There are rules in this house.

650
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,480
What will you do if I don't follow them?
Will you punish me?

651
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,559
My whole life is a punishment. Every day.

652
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,159
Sentenced to run this shitty shop!

653
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,480
Don't talk like that in front of your mom!

654
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,519
Or what? Are you gonna hit me?

655
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,679
Haven't you always wanted me
to be the man of the house,

656
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,199
the fucking alpha male?

657
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,519
Well, there you have it.

658
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,840
From now on, you and I both
make the rules, got it?

659
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,239
You are not the man of the house.

660
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Get out!

661
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:38,199
Yusef, please, don't do this.

662
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,480
Go and don't come back.

663
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,000
Go!

664
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,000
What’s wrong, Polo?

665
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,480
I'm sorry about yesterday.

666
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,280
I'm still your friend.
No jerking off, just friends.

667
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,440
You can tell me anything.
I won't judge you.

668
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:55,719
I can't.

669
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Why not?

670
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:00,760
You would never forgive me.

671
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,719
Polo, whatever it is,

672
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,800
it won't change anything between us.

673
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,519
I killed her.

674
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:21,519
What?

675
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,440
I killed Marina.

676
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,400
Ander.

677
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,280
Please, don't go, Ander.

678
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
Don't go, please.

679
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,719
4 MESSAGES FROM POLO

680
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Carla...

681
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,119
Carla, I couldn't help it anymore.

682
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,159
I couldn't keep this secret anymore.

683
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,039
I confessed it all,
everything that happened.

684
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,400
I'm sorry.

685
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
