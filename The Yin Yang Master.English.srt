1
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,791
YIN YANG MASTERS
USE THE DOCTRINE OF FIVE ELEMENTS

2
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,166
TO DISTINGUISH MEN FROM MONSTERS.

3
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,458
RIGHTEOUS MEN GATHER
IN THE YIN YANG BUREAU

4
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,000
TO TRAIN AND CAPTURE EVIL SPIRITS.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,833
Qingming.

6
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,666
What have you done?

7
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,375
Brother Cimu…

8
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,041
was killed.

9
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:19,958
Cimu.

10
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,791
What did you do to him?

11
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,625
Nothing.
A demon escaped the Sealing Chamber.

12
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,083
And tried to steal the Scale Stone.

13
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,041
There are dismembered bodies.

14
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,250
So tell me, how was it
that you escaped untouched?

15
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,375
I didn't do it.

16
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,083
-Please, I swear.
-One cannot change one nature.

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,416
The only true demon here is you.

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
It wasn't me!

19
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,125
Baini.

20
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,500
What happened here?

21
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,041
Qingming killed Cimu
and tried to take the Scale Stone.

22
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,875
But that's…

23
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,166
-impossible.
-He has already fled out of guilt.

24
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,916
If you can't tell right from wrong,
how will you expect to be chief?

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
The bellflower bracelet.

26
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,333
SEVEN YEARS LATER

27
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:43,750
PINGJING CITY

28
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,791
When Pangu separated heaven and Earth,

29
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,208
humans and demons
initially live together in harmony.

30
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,333
But then an evil demon named Xiangliu,

31
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
proclaimed himself
to be the Demon Emperor.

32
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,750
The nine-headed serpent
seduced the demons

33
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,291
into wreaking havoc upon the mortal world.

34
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,583
Fortunately, a group
of Yin Yang Masters fought back.

35
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,541
They forged a sacred weapon,

36
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
the Tushan Sword.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,833
With it, they slay Xiangliu

38
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,083
and banished all demons.

39
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,375
Humans and demons were forever separated.

40
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,041
Humans inhabited cities,

41
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,791
while demons strolled
in the Monster Realm.

42
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,291
Both sides kept to themselves.

43
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Whenever a demon crosses the border,

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,333
a Yin Yang master is treated as a part
of the Demon Emperor's army.

45
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,958
It's captured and imprisoned
in the Sealing Chamber.

46
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,666
Move aside. Move aside.

47
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,958
The Capital Guards are on a mission

48
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,541
to escort the imperial tribute
out of the city.

49
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,041
Move aside.
The Capital Guards are on a mission

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,833
to escort the imperial tribute
out of the city.

51
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,416
MONSTER REALM IS DANGEROUS

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,375
LEAVE AT YOUR OWN RISK

53
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,291
It is the time for ghost festival,

54
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,041
yet the Captain volunteered us
to escort the offerings out of the city.

55
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,541
This is just asking for trouble.

56
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,125
Agreed.
Why they send us to do this?

57
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,208
This is supposed to be the Bureau's job.

58
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
Something in the woods.

59
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,166
Oh?

60
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,916
Who's out there?

61
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,833
Go!

62
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,875
Whoever…

63
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,875
is foolish enough to challenge us,

64
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,791
this is what will happen to you.

65
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,125
Oh…

66
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:58,791
Sword!

67
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,208
Give me the sword!

68
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,958
Stealing the imperial tribute? Outrageous.

69
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,125
You.

70
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,541
Huh?

71
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,916
I was just passing through.
Figured I'd help you.

72
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,583
Good sir.

73
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
You're welcome.

74
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,000
-Ah…
-Hey!

75
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:06,916
Stop that.

76
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,708
I said stop!

77
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,166
I'm helping you exorcise demons
but don't worry,

78
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,791
no need for a thank you gift.

79
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,500
-I'll just help myself.
-Who said anything about a thank you gift?

80
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,500
Huh?

81
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,416
Well?

82
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,833
-Good sir.
-Huh?

83
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,333
You're in the wrong here.

84
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,208
When people barely survived
the demon attack,

85
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,041
they'd happily show their gratitude.
But I make the effort to help you…

86
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,833
and you don't appreciate it.

87
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,250
It's our duty to escort
the imperial tribute.

88
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,416
So hand it over.

89
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,083
It's obvious that those three demons
knew you.

90
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,458
My guess…

91
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,458
is you're a demon in human guise too.

92
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,708
Sir.

93
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,708
Your suspicion is so small-minded.

94
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,833
Hmm.

95
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,500
Small-minded?

96
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,250
You're coming with me.

97
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,625
If you intend to keep this up,
you will fall.

98
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,458
I assure you.

99
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
You're actually with the Bureau.

100
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,416
-How dare you knowingly break the law?
-Purity from within and without.

101
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,708
Hmm.

102
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,958
Thieving pig.

103
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,291
Oh. Oh…

104
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,875
What's your rank in the Bureau?

105
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,708
I dare you to tell me your name.

106
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,458
Okay.

107
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,083
Qingming.

108
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,458
Qingming?

109
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,250
I'll remember you.

110
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,458
I can't watch you fall anymore.

111
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,958
So for now…

112
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,500
I think we're done here.

113
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,583
What happened to all the Capital Guards?

114
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,750
YIN YANG BUREAU

115
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,875
YIN YANG BUREAU

116
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,166
SCALE STONE WARD

117
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,916
Something is wrong in the Sealing Chamber.

118
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,166
SUBDUING CELL

119
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,250
Move.

120
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,083
Return to purity, seal.

121
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,541
-Demons have broken in.
-Chief.

122
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,875
Who's guarding the Scale Stone?

123
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,083
Sunless day, moonless night.

124
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,750
Return to purity from within and without.
This seal must be…

125
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,500
The northeastern road, seven miles away.

126
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,000
The Scale Stone.

127
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,041
Don't touch the Scale Stone.

128
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,541
You're not going anywhere.

129
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,750
Rat demon.

130
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,791
Put it down.

131
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,166
Stop!

132
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,041
My failure must be punished.

133
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,041
We took the Scale Stone from the Bureau,

134
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,458
but then we ran into three rat demons.

135
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,416
I don't know who gave them the order,

136
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
but someone must have told them
to intercept the Scale Stone.

137
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,916
You said three rat demons?

138
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
They must be Qingming's ferrets.

139
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,916
What were they doing there?

140
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,416
Your job was very easy.

141
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,250
How did you ruin it?

142
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,791
The Raven Hound twins.

143
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,208
Monster Realm's greatest warriors.

144
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,333
They said you could never fail.

145
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,625
Turns out…

146
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,791
they were wrong.

147
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,166
But then again,
the Scale Stone has been removed.

148
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,416
I suppose the Raven Hounds
have at least achieved something.

149
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,708
You can die in peace now.

150
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,541
If you think
that you can make up for things

151
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,375
just because you got back in tribute,

152
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,208
Master took you in
because he expects great things from you

153
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,458
but if you slack off,
you will be punished.

154
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,458
Practicing military maneuvers
in martial arts

155
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,958
to prepare you from whatever is upon.

156
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,041
High.

157
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,041
Forward thrust.

158
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,208
Side thrust.

159
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,375
Side swipe.

160
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,458
Lift your arms.

161
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
Harder. What are you aiming at?

162
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,541
Remember,
Master has graciously taken you in

163
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,541
to be the Spirit Guardians.

164
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:19,083
If not for him, you will all be out now
wandering alone, bullied.

165
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,666
-Shh.
-Don't take this lightly.

166
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,166
Work hard.

167
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,833
What are you doing?

168
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,166
What's the matter?

169
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,833
Stop.

170
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,541
Fell down. Who fell down?

171
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,416
He swallowed something.

172
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,500
And he got into a fight.

173
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,166
We meet again, Qingming.

174
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,791
The Scale Stone has finally been removed
from the control of the Bureau.

175
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,416
You will help me return
to the mortal world.

176
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,541
That is your destiny.

177
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,583
Do you understand, Qingming?

178
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,875
I summon the light of Purple Star
for protection.

179
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,708
Has something happened here?

180
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,833
Look after the ferret.

181
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,708
Something might have happened to
Scale Stone. I'm going to Monster Realm.

182
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,791
Removing the Scale Stone from the Bureau

183
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,916
has wreaked havoc on the Sealing Chamber.

184
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,625
The Defenders have tried to contain it
with sigils all night to no avail.

185
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,041
I refuse to believe
it was merely a coincidence,

186
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,333
that those who stole the Scale Stone
were all Qingming's cohorts.

187
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,375
It is obvious

188
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,875
that he came back to finish
what he failed to do seven years ago.

189
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,458
Losing the Scale Stone is disastrous
for the Bureau.

190
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,416
It's hard to fend off a thief
who lives among us.

191
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,583
If Qingming didn't betray the Bureau,

192
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,791
how did the Raven Hounds
access the restricted area?

193
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,583
How could they have known the spells
to destroy the golden pagoda?

194
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,750
As soon as the Scale Stone was stolen,

195
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,708
the three rat demons were there.

196
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,375
The Bureau should have apprehended
that traitor long ago,

197
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,208
had the Chief been able
to make a decision…

198
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,541
Xican.

199
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,875
…that demon would be roaming
wherever he pleases.

200
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,166
Elder, you don't need to worry
about my past with Qingming.

201
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,583
-I didn't want you to forget.
-Elder Xican.

202
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,875
Choose your words carefully.

203
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,041
I have my own thoughts
on the Scale Stone issue.

204
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,750
A hundred years ago,

205
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,875
helpless elders at the Bureau
took it upon themselves

206
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,333
and sacrificed their lives

207
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,458
to finally slay the demon, Xiangliu.

208
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,166
But the evil serpent had nine heads

209
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,000
and its power was immense.

210
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,083
And although its body was destroyed,

211
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,916
its spirit could never be eradicated.

212
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,583
They could only reduce it
into the Scale Stone

213
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,500
which was then sealed inside this pagoda.

214
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,708
And so…

215
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,166
defending the golden pagoda
and safeguarding the Scale Stone

216
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,208
are the two greatest duties
of the Yin Yang Bureau.

217
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,583
One day, it will be your turn.

218
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,375
And you can never relax in your duties.

219
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,250
Cimu.

220
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,625
Lead the chant
to ward off the evil spirits.

221
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes, Elder.

222
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,333
Black Tortoise protects the north,
Vermilion Bird guards the south.

223
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,000
Black Tortoise protects the north
Vermilion Bird guards the south.

224
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,000
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

225
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,625
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

226
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,083
Qingming.

227
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,625
Don't chant with them.

228
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,041
You're a demon.

229
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,750
You and I are connected by blood.

230
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,750
Release me

231
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,750
and join me.

232
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,375
No!

233
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,375
Qingming.

234
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,791
-Qingming.
-Are you out of your mind?

235
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,333
This is a Scale Stone Ward.

236
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:47,375
He's half-man, half-demon.
Demonic blood flows to his genes.

237
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,041
Xiangliu has been calling out to you.

238
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,583
Don't say that.
Qingming will be a Yin Yang Master.

239
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,083
He was abandoned as a baby,
we barely know anything about him.

240
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,875
The Bureau only took him in

241
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,916
-to contain his equal--
-Shut up. That's an order.

242
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,875
You're not chief yet, Baini.

243
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,166
-We're not listening--
-Shut up.

244
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,416
And sit down.

245
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,208
Yes, Brother Cimu.

246
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,500
Qingming.

247
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,041
Qingming.

248
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,375
Qingming.

249
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,666
All of this…

250
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,375
stays between us.

251
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,666
Yes, Brother Cimu.

252
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,166
Man or demon,
you must learn to gain control.

253
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,625
Otherwise,

254
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,125
you'll destroy yourself.

255
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,458
TOMB OF CIMU

256
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,833
Brother Cimu,
I will not let your death be for nothing.

257
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,333
Qingming has left us no choice
by doing this.

258
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,916
We brought shame on the Bureau

259
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,458
by failing to apprehend that traitor
for the past seven years.

260
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,708
Even if we have to scour
the entire Monster Realm,

261
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,791
we will bring him to justice.

262
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,000
COURT OF THE GUARDS

263
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,166
Order?

264
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,541
What order?

265
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,416
I must go to the Yin Yang Bureau,

266
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,708
to arrest Qingming
and reclaim the tribute.

267
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,083
Something serious happened
at the Bureau last night.

268
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,541
They can barely deal with it.

269
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,666
Why would they care about
the imperial tribute?

270
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,833
I hereby pronounce

271
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,291
Seventh-Rank secondary captain Yuan Boya

272
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,916
is suspended effective immediately.

273
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,125
He has three days
to repay the lost tribute

274
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,708
or face imprisonment
and confiscation of family assets.

275
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:05,166
You spend every day thinking about
nothing but your ambition.

276
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,333
But in the end, you're just a nobody
who doesn't know his limits.

277
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:13,041
I'm going to capture that demon now.
And then you'll see who's the nobody.

278
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,750
Sir, I'll tell you the truth.

279
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,791
I used to get my demonic goods
from Yanyan Le.

280
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,500
Yan what? Come again?

281
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,000
He's a mystical master,

282
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,000
-specializes in demons.
-in demons?

283
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,666
His shop is over there.
If you wanna know about Qingming, ask him.

284
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,750
Quit wasting your breath.

285
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,416
Tell me now.

286
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,041
There is no path
to the Monster Realm.

287
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:44,250
Are you going to tell me or not?

288
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,375
Shh.

289
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:56,875
Whoever is in there,

290
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,833
this is Captain Yuan Boya.

291
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,791
I'm here to investigate a crime.

292
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,125
Where are your manners?

293
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,708
The incense outside is still burning,
it means he's with a client.

294
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,791
You can't just barge in.

295
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,250
Are you the expert Yan Lele?

296
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,916
I'm looking for somebody.

297
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,083
Name is Qingming.

298
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,500
Do you know where he lives?

299
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:21,416
You're asking about
the Yin Yang Master, Qingming.

300
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,541
That's him. I fought him yesterday.

301
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,833
But he fled in defeat.

302
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,958
-I'm bringing him into justice.
-You're full of shit.

303
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,166
Who's hiding back there?

304
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,875
Get out here and talk--

305
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,083
How dare you assault an imperial officer!

306
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,666
I'm going to charge you for this!

307
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,833
You can't even capture me,
why would Qingming run from you?

308
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,541
Are you Yan Lele?

309
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,416
I'm the only one who gets to talk here.

310
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
-I'm looking for Yan Lele. You better--
-Get in with the talking.

311
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,916
And his name is Yanyan Le, moron.

312
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,083
What?

313
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,000
Isn't that exactly
what I just said to you?

314
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,791
You're not very smart as a Capital Guard.

315
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,791
Yes, I still need your help then.

316
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,750
So talking or beating?

317
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,583
-No. No.
-I have my umbrella.

318
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,041
It's right behind me,

319
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,333
inside that pile of hides.

320
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:24,250
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
It would have saved us a lot of trouble.

321
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,750
Not just anyone can get in
to the Monster Realm.

322
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,958
-A map won't be much help for--
-Then how does Qingming go back and forth?

323
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,708
Qingming is half-demon.

324
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,416
-He is?
-He also has the sigils from the Bureau.

325
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,416
Sigils?

326
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,375
I have a sigil.

327
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,833
You do?

328
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:46,083
Where is it?

329
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,000
Untie me.

330
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,416
Untie me.

331
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,916
My young captain,

332
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,833
I can tell you're someone special
and not just some ordinary nobody.

333
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,833
Get back.

334
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,583
This it?

335
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,666
Sir.

336
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,291
I swear on my name, Shenle,
I will help you get into the Monster Realm

337
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,375
and arrest Qingming.

338
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,583
If we go to the Monster Realm…

339
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,708
we'll find Qingming?

340
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,250
Uh-huh.

341
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,000
I could tell Qingming
wasn't a decent person.

342
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,666
But half-man, half-demon?

343
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,833
You know nothing.

344
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,375
A man of Qingming's power comes along
once in a century.

345
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,375
-He's the only one who can control demons.
-Fine.

346
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,625
If he won't be a human,
let him be a demon.

347
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,791
Either way, I'm taking him down.

348
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,708
Hey, check your map.

349
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,333
How far away are we?

350
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,375
How will I check when I'm all tied up?

351
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,375
You're tied up for your own protection.

352
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,666
The map says to go about
35 miles after passing the Temple of Earth

353
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,000
then we'll see the stone statue
at the entrance to the Monster Realm.

354
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:07,958
CRUMBLING CLIFF

355
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,291
And voilà, here we are.

356
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,166
Well…

357
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,541
we definitely found the entrance.

358
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,833
Only problem is…

359
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,375
How are we supposed to go through it?

360
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,833
Hey.

361
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:36,416
Give me the sigil.

362
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,958
Give it. Come on.

363
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,791
A halo of golden light engulfs my body.

364
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,916
I fly like a cloud
through the three realms world.

365
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,500
I traveled thousands of miles
like the shadow that follows me.

366
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,416
A halo of golden light engulfs my body.

367
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,666
I fly like a cloud
through the three realms world.

368
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,375
I traveled thousands of miles
like the shadow that follows me.

369
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,208
W-what'd you do?

370
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,791
What… You destroyed the sigil. You…

371
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,583
-You're a swindler. You're under arrest.
-You're the swindler.

372
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,750
Where's your badge? 
Can you prove you're a Guard?

373
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,208
Behave yourself.

374
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,583
Let go of me.

375
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,708
Huh?

376
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,333
There's the path. You see?

377
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,500
It takes time for the spell to work.

378
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,083
If you're going to be stupid,
just keep your mouth shut.

379
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,583
What are you doing?
We have to go now or we won't make it.

380
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,833
What?

381
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,500
You were just as surprised as I was!

382
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,041
What's that?

383
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,166
Plum-infused water.
To mask our human scent.

384
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,875
Why didn't you do that before?

385
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:25,041
-I was so excited, I forgot about it.
-Come on, focus.

386
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,000
This is the place.

387
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,583
The Red Tower.

388
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,958
The Port Master handles all the affairs
in the Monster Realm. He lives here.

389
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,708
Qingming has been doing business with him.

390
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,416
Fish-eye earrings.

391
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,083
How much?

392
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,083
Can you focus on the job, please?

393
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,541
-How does it look?
-It's horrendous.

394
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,208
Qingming won't show up
until the time is right.

395
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,208
If you're worried,
you can stick out by the bridge.

396
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,541
Yuan Boya.

397
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,166
Try this.

398
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:48,833
Mmm.

399
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,041
It's not bad.

400
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,416
What is it?

401
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,375
Hey.

402
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,125
Are you okay?

403
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,500
Go away.

404
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,041
Come on.

405
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,666
Try on this belt.

406
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,416
-What is this?
-It's a gift.

407
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,375
It looks good on you.

408
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,416
I like it.

409
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,625
We're here on a dangerous mission

410
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,250
and you're acting like--

411
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,916
-Master.
-Oh…

412
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,666
Master!

413
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,583
Demon thief?

414
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,583
Master.

415
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,000
Master, I've finally found you.

416
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,625
Uh, here's a gift to introduce myself.
Please accept it.

417
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,500
I finally caught up with you, you coward.

418
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,875
-Ow. Ah…
-Back off.

419
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,208
Leave him alone.

420
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,041
Master, this guardsman wants to hurt you.

421
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,291
I came to warn you. So don't forget it.

422
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,250
I know what you are, freak.
And I, Yuan Boya, am taking you in.

423
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,291
Whoa.

424
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,833
What was your name again?

425
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,291
Yuan Boya.

426
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,541
Seventh-Rank secondary captain
of the Capital Guards.

427
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,750
-Is this how you write?
-Let go of me.

428
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,125
Oh… Oh.

429
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,458
Oh, using evil magic…

430
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,958
-Spirit Guardian sigil.
-What sigil?

431
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,291
Spirit Guardian.

432
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,333
What is that?

433
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,291
Oh, hey…

434
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,666
Cast the Spirit Guardian sigil on me too.

435
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,500
-Cast it on me too, Master.
-Why can't I control my arms and legs?

436
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,208
-I'm willing to give my life to you.
-Remove the spell now.

437
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,000
Whoa.

438
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,291
Oh.

439
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,291
Hey. What are you doing?

440
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,125
-Hey, master.
-Demon thief!

441
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,583
Master! Master!

442
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,083
-Get back here, freak.
-Let go, Yuan Boya!

443
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,125
Hey, that was so fun.

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,166
Mm.

445
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,791
Mm.

446
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,791
What an honored guest.

447
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,250
Welcome. Welcome.

448
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,125
It hasn't been long

449
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,708
but feels like forever.

450
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:14,291
Your familiars sent me two carts
of offering yesterday.

451
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,541
Today, you're here in person.

452
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,666
I wonder

453
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,583
if you brought me even more treasure.

454
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,541
Actually…

455
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,916
I need something from you.

456
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,916
Giving and taking brings opportunities.

457
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,708
-So, what do you want?
-The Tushan Sword.

458
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,958
That name is taboo in the Monster Realm.

459
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,208
Why would I have it?

460
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,458
-Think carefully before you answer.
-My precious gems!

461
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,375
After you pledged your allegiance
to the Bureau,

462
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,750
you borrowed the sword to dominate
the Monster Realm

463
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:49,875
but you never returned it.

464
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,666
Still wanna play dumb?

465
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,833
Such a trivial matter.
Not sure why you'd even remember it.

466
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:08,166
The Tushan Sword slayed the Demon Emperor
Xiangliu a hundred years ago

467
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,583
and the Monster Realm
still hasn't recovered.

468
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,791
Once the Demon Emperor was gone,

469
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,083
nobody cared much about the sword anymore.

470
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,000
So, what do you want with it now?

471
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,208
The Emperor's body perished
but its spirit lives on.

472
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,458
It never hurts to be prepared
for the worst.

473
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,125
But I can't afford to offend the Bureau.

474
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,333
Hey. Stop.

475
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,666
You can't bully me.

476
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,041
You're in the Monster Realm,
this is my turf.

477
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,458
I am the boss here and what I say…

478
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,416
No!

479
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,333
Be reasonable.

480
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:45,750
Fine, let's negotiate
but you have to make me a decent offer.

481
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,375
How about two live humans?

482
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,833
Oh.

483
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,666
"Live humans"?

484
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,750
So does this offer sound better now?

485
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,708
Kill that human, don't stand there!

486
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:09,916
Master!

487
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,541
-Master!
-Yeah!

488
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,916
Master, look here!

489
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,375
Master!

490
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Hey.

491
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,208
Yuan Boya, watch out!

492
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,708
Let her go! Right now!

493
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,250
Don't worry about me!

494
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:05,291
My dear demons and thieves,

495
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,791
prepare to witness a fight that lights up
which you've never seen.

496
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:13,083
Man versus demon in a battle to the death!

497
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:17,625
Place your bets now
for this once-in-a-lifetime showdown!

498
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,833
Hey, captain or whatever.

499
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,500
You better give it your best.

500
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,875
Otherwise, your little pal dies.

501
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:36,041
May I present to you the Red Ghost Demon.

502
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,458
Born and raised in this very arena,

503
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,875
he has never lost a fight.

504
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,208
Two of you enter

505
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,166
but only one of you will live!

506
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,875
Yes!

507
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,583
Yes!

508
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,333
Get up!

509
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,500
Stop!

510
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,583
This is it!

511
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,458
The more you hurt
the Red Ghost, the stronger he gets.

512
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,000
This is what he's truly capable of.

513
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:22,416
This is why he's remained
unbeaten in the ring.

514
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:04,000
The Tushan Sword's manna is too great.

515
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,125
You have to go alone.

516
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:48,750
You got here fast.

517
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,208
Who knew the Bureau was so capable?

518
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,916
The light shines a thousand miles.
Connect.

519
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:33,958
Master's sigil?

520
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,250
Three thousand spears
between Heaven and Earth. Break.

521
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,708
How have you been?

522
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,625
I'm not here to talk about the past.

523
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,833
You have something that isn't yours.
Give it back.

524
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,333
So, the Chief wants this sword too, huh?

525
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,541
Don't be coy. Give me the Scale Stone.

526
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,583
What?

527
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,875
So it really was stolen?

528
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:29,250
You're either pretending
or you need to talk to your ferrets.

529
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,541
"Ferrets"?

530
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,666
They might cause trouble
but would never steal the Scale Stone.

531
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,083
Awfully trusting of you.

532
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,458
Of course.

533
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,208
That's why I've made them
my Spirit Guardians.

534
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,166
They're not evil by nature.

535
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,958
Spirit Guardians live and die
with their masters

536
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:51,875
and never betray them.

537
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,458
That is what you taught me.

538
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,375
The nose! Hit his nose!

539
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,708
Yeah!

540
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,750
Nice hit!

541
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,291
Kill the freaking loser.

542
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,750
-That's the rule of the fight.
-Yeah!

543
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,958
Only one gets to be alive.

544
00:51:57,541 --> 00:51:58,875
Let's go!

545
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,291
Stop them!

546
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,041
Don't let them get away!

547
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,166
Be careful! This human can fight!

548
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,166
Where are you going?

549
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,958
Where are you going?

550
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,583
-Huh? Watch out.
-Huh?

551
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:05,291
Huh? Oh…

552
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,875
The Tushan Sword!
What is the Tushan Sword doing here?

553
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,500
-There they are!
-Surround them. Get them!

554
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,625
-The ghost is helping you!
-I don't want that thing to help.

555
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:44,166
Whoever returns the sword
will get a hefty reward.

556
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,125
Demon thief decided to surrender, huh?

557
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,333
Captain…

558
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,833
That thing you're holding
is worth more than your life.

559
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:10,750
Give it.

560
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,791
-Is it yours?
-Of course.

561
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,458
Now you lost something,
so it's your turn to be worried.

562
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,208
Give it now.

563
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,791
Come back to headquarters,
prove my innocence.

564
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,583
Fine.

565
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:30,000
The Yin Yang Bureau's people! Run, run!

566
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:39,958
Chief!

567
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,625
Baini!

568
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,250
Baini.

569
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,083
Go, go, go.

570
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,500
Ouch.

571
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,916
What's he doing here?

572
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:44,000
Well… where are we now?

573
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,000
Huh?

574
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,791
This is Master's home.

575
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:58,416
That bandit lives here?
So this is where he hides his loot.

576
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:06,333
Wait, stop. Stop it.
We're on the same side.

577
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,416
Did you think that following Master
would make you one of us?

578
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:13,958
Who wants to be one of you?
You think I don't recognize you?

579
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,250
You're the filthy little thieves
who stole the imperial tribute.

580
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,625
Who are you calling a thief?
I'll rip out your tongue.

581
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,708
Quiet.

582
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:24,291
Sister.

583
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,250
Please, forgive this stupid human.

584
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,708
They are guests.

585
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,791
Bring them inside.

586
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,625
Thank you so much.

587
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,250
We'll just have a look around.

588
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,291
Don't mind us. We're not even here.

589
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:42,208
Thanks.

590
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:22,500
Baini.

591
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,708
Is there really no place for me
at the Bureau?

592
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,625
-What's that?
-It's a token.

593
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,375
That's for girls. I don't want it.

594
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,375
This bracelet will let me cast
a Spirit Guardian sigil on you.

595
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,583
The sigil's only for demons.

596
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm a human.

597
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,583
You're also half-demon so that counts.

598
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,916
I'm not a demon.

599
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,500
And I'll never be one.

600
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,666
Qingming, it's okay if you are.

601
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,541
Be my Spirit Guardian,
and I'll be your master.

602
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,125
Don't you know about that?

603
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,916
Once a demon has a master,

604
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,458
it knows it has a home,

605
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,333
and they will never become evil.

606
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,833
Well…

607
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,791
I…

608
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:08,833
Qingming…

609
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,958
from this day forward,

610
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,458
am Baini's guardian.

611
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:17,500
We now live and die as one
and we shall never betray each other.

612
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,833
Never betray each other.

613
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,916
Careful with those wounds.

614
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,375
I promise…

615
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,833
-I'll help you find the truth.
-Your promise…

616
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:47,625
is worthless.

617
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,166
If that's true…

618
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,083
why would you take this one for me then?

619
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,833
I've been looking for the Scale Stone.

620
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,875
Your demons have been a nuisance
for years. Everyone knows that.

621
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,375
You're definitely involved in this.

622
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,083
All the demons here
have the same fate I do.

623
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,333
We're not allowed in the capital city
and don't belong in the Monster Realm.

624
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,166
We're outsiders,

625
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,541
living as thieves.

626
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,666
Trying to survive

627
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,583
-the only way we know how--
-So now it means you and the demons?

628
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,458
You promised
that we would always be you and me.

629
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,375
But you chose to leave the path
and ruined everything.

630
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,583
I left the Bureau

631
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,166
because I had no other choice.

632
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,666
That night, seven years ago,

633
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,916
it was my turn to guard
the Scale Stone ward.

634
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,458
I bumped in to Brother Cimu.

635
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:41,958
Qingming.

636
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,666
He was concerned
about my well-being as always.

637
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,583
Brother Cimu.

638
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,750
Are you still being troubled
by Xiangliu's spirit?

639
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,333
During the ghost festival,

640
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,541
it's especially bad.

641
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,833
Thankfully, you taught me
that protection spell.

642
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,333
I've been chanting it a lot lately.

643
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,541
You can't afford to cause
any more trouble.

644
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,666
If you truly lose control someday…

645
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,666
reverse the incantation
and destroy yourself.

646
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,375
So Xiangliu doesn't possess you.

647
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,500
"Reverse the protection spell"?

648
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,500
I'll guard the Ward for you tonight.

649
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,166
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

650
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,833
Little did I realize

651
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:39,875
that the evil spirit
would be especially violent that night.

652
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,291
I knew…

653
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,708
that something serious must have happened.

654
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,666
…purity from within and without.

655
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,833
The Golden Pagoda?

656
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:02,000
Inside the ward,
there were bodies everywhere.

657
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,541
I tried to find Brother Cimu,

658
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,291
but the Golden Pagoda had melted.

659
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,166
The evil spirit inside the Scale Stone

660
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,625
was driving me insane.

661
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,666
Qingming, you're pathetic.

662
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:28,666
You're seen as nothing more than a freak
in the human world.

663
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,833
but little did you know

664
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:33,791
that you belong to the rarest
and most precious bloodline.

665
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,875
Purity from within and without.
This order shall break the seal!

666
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,625
Don't bother
with that useless incantation.

667
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:40,958
You are a demon.

668
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:44,666
You and I are connected with my blood.

669
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,041
Another one has gone for the Scale Stone.

670
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,041
-Hmm.
-It was the Snow Queen.

671
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,500
She was supposed to be locked
in the Sealing Chamber.

672
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,333
How did she get inside the Ward?

673
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,750
-Brother. Brother!
-Qingming, get out.

674
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,208
That was the last time I saw Brother Cimu.

675
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,791
I had no choice but to defend myself,

676
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,625
then I saw that Brother Cimu had been
torn to pieces by my counterattack.

677
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,041
And the Snow Queen had disappeared.

678
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,291
No one has wanted to find her
more than I have these past seven years.

679
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,250
"The Snow Queen"?

680
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,375
There's nobody else besides you
who could send demons into the Ward.

681
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,166
Seven years ago,
Brother Cimu died because of you.

682
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,041
Seven years later, people at the Bureau
died because of you again.

683
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:50,083
You're not innocent in this.

684
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,208
If you're so sure it's me…

685
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,791
why do you still have our token?

686
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,333
Give it back.

687
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,958
Huh?

688
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,875
There it is again.

689
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,666
-Something's in there.
-Wait.

690
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,958
You can't touch anything in the courtyard.

691
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,666
Wanna bet I can?

692
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,458
-Hey.
-Maybe that's the beheaded tribute.

693
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,833
Wait your turn.

694
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,083
Qingming.

695
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,625
The Tushan Sword.

696
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,291
The Ferret has mutated.

697
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,375
Kill it.

698
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,291
What do you have to say now?

699
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:18,166
If the Bureau had done its job
and protected the Scale Stone,

700
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,500
the Ferret would still be alive.

701
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,583
I won't bother with you all tonight.

702
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,416
You and your demon friends
can have a few more days of peace.

703
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,833
But when I return,
I'm going to destroy this place.

704
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,666
The life of a demon, it needs a master.

705
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,500
So it has a home,

706
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,833
it doesn't become evil.

707
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:12,500
But back then…

708
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,000
my demon sisters…

709
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,291
didn't even get to be buried.

710
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,833
Your demon sisters?

711
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,666
I was born an orphan.

712
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,458
I had to beg for food. One time…

713
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,833
I was chased by a ferocious dog.

714
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,208
Ended up passing out
in front of a big house.

715
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:32,208
There was an amazing smell
coming out of it.

716
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,333
I felt energized all of a sudden.

717
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,916
The pain from my wounds was gone.

718
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,291
You were dreaming, weren't you?

719
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,083
It was even better than a dream.

720
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,541
It was called the Courtyard.

721
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,166
"The Courtyard"?

722
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,166
Wait, are you talking about
the famous brothel?

723
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,916
Why were you so happy to end up there?

724
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:54,875
It was wonderful.

725
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,250
The sisters treated me so well.

726
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,500
And when I was seven…

727
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,416
the Bureau came.

728
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:19,333
They told me that my sisters
were all demons hiding in the city.

729
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,000
They weren't allowed
to stay there anymore.

730
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,208
Those who cooperated were sealed away.

731
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,833
Those who resisted
were slaughtered on the spot.

732
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:32,583
But that time…

733
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,916
there was a young man with them.

734
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:36,833
He was shivering.

735
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,583
He was a Yin Yang Master,

736
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,208
but he didn't harm any of my sisters.

737
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,041
Instead, he just held me in his arms

738
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,000
and gave me one of my sisters' umbrellas.

739
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,291
That was the day

740
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:55,000
I decided he would be my master.

741
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:57,750
Wherever master went…

742
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,833
that's what I'd call home.

743
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,625
I am no one's master.

744
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,208
You really have an urge to say that?

745
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,583
You're the problem.

746
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,125
If you're a demon,
why would you become a Yin Yang Master?

747
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,958
If you're a human,

748
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,041
why do you keep those demons around?

749
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,375
-It's ridiculous.
-We were both abandoned.

750
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,666
No need to insult each other.

751
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,500
-You're comparing yourself to me?
-Aren't we both…

752
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,541
oddballs who got fired?

753
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,541
Hmm?

754
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,791
Come here.

755
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,166
-Drink with me.
-Hmph.

756
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,208
What's wrong?

757
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:34,083
Afraid I'd poisoned the wine?

758
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,833
-Do you think I'm afraid of you?
-Yuan Boya.

759
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,083
Stop it.

760
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,875
You want a drink? Let's drink.

761
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:46,166
-We'll see who's afraid.
-Don't make a fuss.

762
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:03,708
The chief left Qingming's garden
with her injuries unhealed.

763
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:06,833
They've cast a spell
to keep her from going back.

764
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,791
The Scale Stone must not be returned
to the Bureau.

765
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:42,125
Last round then I'm bringing you in
and putting this case to rest.

766
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,333
Even my closest ally

767
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,250
has called me a traitor.

768
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,875
Yet you still believe

769
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,583
that I will keep my promise.

770
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,500
Then why…

771
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,750
would I not believe you?

772
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,583
If you have any sense of gratitude,

773
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,708
-you should make a toast to master.
-Hmm?

774
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,708
Did you think you beat him
all by yourself?

775
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,125
It was my master's sigil
that helped you win.

776
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:12,166
Just hurry up and remove the spell, okay?

777
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,041
A grown man wearing a red bow

778
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,708
is so embarrassing.

779
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,500
Stop being such an ingrate.

780
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,708
-Hmm?
-Master, can I have it too?

781
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,833
That's not a Spirit Guardian sigil.

782
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,333
The red bow in his palm…

783
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,333
is just a prank master's playing on him.

784
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,625
Huh?

785
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,333
-It's not a real sigil?
-Humans can't be guardians.

786
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:33,750
Only demons can.

787
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,916
-Fine with me.
-So just because we're human,

788
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,791
we're not allowed to be a Spirit Guardian?

789
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,541
The human heart is fickle by nature.

790
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:43,166
Promising to be faithful
till death do you part?

791
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,875
No human is capable of that.

792
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:48,000
Hey, don't look down on humans.

793
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:49,750
If you think humans are so bad,

794
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,625
that means half of your master is bad too.

795
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,916
If I think demons are stupid,

796
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,708
then half of your master is stupid.

797
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,125
In other words,

798
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,958
he's a bad and stupid

799
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,208
freak.

800
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:08,500
Hey.

801
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:09,958
Very well said.

802
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,375
I am absolutely a freak.

803
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,375
From one freak to another.

804
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,375
Well, I'm a freak too.
So I also get a drink.

805
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,291
Hmm. Stupid demon.

806
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,000
Stop it. He is not.

807
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,958
-Whatever. I'm so drunk.
-Hey, pass it over here.

808
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,541
Come on.

809
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,166
Why have I ended up here?

810
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:04,666
Chief.

811
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,250
-Chief.
-Chief.

812
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,041
Chief.

813
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,208
We came as soon as we got your location.

814
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,375
Are you all right?

815
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,541
This place is dangerous.

816
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:18,666
We can't stay here.

817
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,750
Keep this safe.

818
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,208
The Scale Stone.

819
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:23,250
Return it to the Bureau
as fast as you can.

820
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,666
Hmm.

821
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,583
Watch out.

822
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:14,958
Behind you.

823
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:32,916
The Scale Stone.

824
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,291
Take it and go, Chief.

825
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,083
Baini!

826
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:40,291
It's you.

827
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,458
It's unfortunate we had to meet this way.

828
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:45,250
Then again, if you kill her,

829
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,416
get back the Stone for Master,

830
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,291
you're sure to be rewarded.

831
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,791
You started this seven years ago.

832
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:54,875
Today…

833
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:56,416
I'm finishing it.

834
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:02,250
If you want me, come and get me.

835
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,208
It's my fault for not trusting you.

836
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,375
We have the Stone. We can still win.

837
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:16,875
The Snow Queen mentioned her master.

838
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:20,041
-I'll find him.
-Qingming.

839
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:23,833
When this is finally over…

840
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,541
the bellflower bracelet…

841
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:28,833
will be yours again.

842
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,250
With or without the bracelet,

843
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,125
you are my master.

844
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,583
We live and die as one,

845
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,833
and shall never betray each other.

846
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,750
I won't be long.

847
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,000
Was your master too afraid to show up?

848
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,000
Patience.

849
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:16,333
You will kneel before him shortly.

850
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:19,791
The whole world will kneel before him.

851
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:33,583
Who's there?

852
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:36,166
The Scale Stone doesn't belong
to the human world.

853
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,833
It's been away from its rightful place
for too long.

854
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,083
If that's true, then where does it belong?

855
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:45,541
In the hands of the world's
most powerful demon, of course.

856
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,958
It doesn't matter who your master is.

857
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,500
Today, you'll finally pay your debt.

858
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,916
You really are a fool.

859
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,625
The master looked after you at the Bureau.

860
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,375
Weren't you always very grateful to him?

861
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,958
Cimu.

862
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,583
I joined the Bureau at the age of nine.

863
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,583
At 30,

864
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,916
I became the youngest Defender ever.

865
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,666
But for what?

866
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,500
At that point, the Bureau
had nothing more to offer me.

867
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,333
Travelling to the mortal world…

868
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,083
in my eyes, you were nothing
but distractions.

869
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:24,750
I understand your obsession with Qingming,

870
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:28,583
but I have my own obsession.

871
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,750
The freak who'd been abandoned
by everyone existed for only one reason.

872
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:39,791
To show me the true strength
in demonic power.

873
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,333
If little Qingming could possess it…

874
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,958
then with Xiangliu's aid…

875
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,125
what could possibly be out of my reach?

876
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,708
What I want…

877
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,583
is the power of the Scale Stone.

878
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,500
Master Cimu…

879
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,250
is the savior

880
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,125
for both of us.

881
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,666
Do you hear the master's call?

882
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,041
You're lying.

883
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,083
I know what I saw that night.

884
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,458
I watched Broher Cimu die

885
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,875
right in front of me.

886
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,250
Just a simple illusion.

887
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,500
Master.

888
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,708
SNOW QUEEN

889
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,625
I, the Snow Queen, hereby vow

890
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,375
that I shall serve

891
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,166
Master Cimu forever.

892
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:46,666
Greatness will be yours.

893
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,125
I…

894
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:51,333
I wish I could be there

895
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,083
to see you…

896
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,041
achieve it.

897
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,500
Show me the road.

898
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,500
Mommy!

899
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:25,416
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy…

900
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:30,375
I want to go home.

901
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,791
Mommy…

902
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,583
I want to go home.

903
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,958
I wish I'd been alive
till the Demon Emperor's reign,

904
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,333
but I was born too late

905
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,750
and I had to become the Bureau's lapdog.

906
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:50,625
But if the Demon Emperor were to return,
I would gladly sacrifice my life for him.

907
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,625
Where is my wine?

908
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:04,000
More wine for me. More wine.

909
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,083
Why are you still lying there?

910
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,500
Unless you wanna become a barbecue,
we have to move now.

911
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,166
Barbecue? Where is the barbecue?

912
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,791
Let's go.

913
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,208
Huh?

914
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,875
What the heck is that?

915
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,625
Oh, what happened here?

916
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,708
What is going on?

917
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,166
Cover your nose and mouth with the sigil

918
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,958
to protect you from mutating.

919
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,541
-Give me one too.
-Humans don't need it.

920
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,500
What?

921
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,625
Why is that?

922
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:42,958
An evil demon has acquired the Scale Stone

923
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:44,750
and opened the gateway
to the Monster Realm.

924
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,541
Hordes of demons will soon be invading.

925
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,541
Invading?

926
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,750
-Why?
-For years,

927
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,041
Master has trained you for war

928
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:54,000
because he never forgot his duties
as a Yin Yang Master.

929
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,125
And now…

930
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:57,166
we'll honor him

931
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,875
-and protect the Capital City.
-Capital?

932
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,000
-Who's invading the Capital?
-Today is the day.

933
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,750
-Guard the Border Bridge with your lives.
-What?

934
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:06,666
Spirit Guardians…

935
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,625
fight until your last breath.

936
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,375
We've burned our garden.

937
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,750
There's no retreat for us.

938
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,583
Hey… Wait!

939
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,625
Shenle, where are you going?

940
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,791
Uh…

941
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,375
You're using this as a cover to escape.

942
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,000
You are not one of us.

943
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,708
Go back to the Capital Guards.

944
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,250
Not one of us?

945
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,750
She says it like it's a bad thing.

946
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:48,750
What?

947
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,375
What does that mean?

948
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,000
Keep an eye on them?

949
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:55,041
You know what? I think I'll do that.

950
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,833
Catch up.

951
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,208
Brother Cimu,

952
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,291
I have a question for you.

953
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,000
We're not at the Bureau.

954
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:41,666
So…

955
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:44,875
no need for brother.

956
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,125
Seven years ago,
you were the Bureau's Defender

957
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,666
yet you conspire with the Snow Queen.

958
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,583
to slaughter your brothers

959
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,041
and steal the Scale Stone.

960
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,458
Purity from within and without,
this order shall break the seal!

961
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,208
Master. A human body
can't handle the Stone's power.

962
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,166
Only a demon's can.

963
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,166
Stay back.

964
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:21,583
Master, let it go. Let it go.

965
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,916
Or it will kill you.

966
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,041
Master.

967
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,500
Master. The alarm bells are ringing.

968
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,333
We need to go now.
Live to fight another day.

969
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,625
Another one has come for the Scale Stone.

970
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:44,708
Mm-hmm.

971
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:49,958
Mm!

972
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,375
Sure, I lost an arm,

973
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:05,833
but its replacement was far superior.
So it was worth it.

974
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,166
You were the one

975
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,333
who showed me the true power of demons.

976
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:16,166
Yet you did not know how to follow
your true nature.

977
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:19,291
That's why you're in this pathetic
predicament now.

978
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,166
Actually, I think you,

979
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,750
Brother Cimu,

980
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,291
are far more pathetic.

981
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,333
You've become a monster
with nowhere to go.

982
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:37,958
Maybe my guard…

983
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,833
can take you in.

984
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:42,041
Take me in?

985
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,708
I answered Xiangliu's call.

986
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,250
I tortured myself

987
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,541
to create this demonic form,

988
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,625
and now I have the power
of the Scale Stone.

989
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,375
Which makes you…

990
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,958
lower than the mud underneath my feet.

991
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,333
Xiangliu called to you?

992
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,875
Yes, and he told me
that it was my destiny.

993
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,500
To be the strongest being on Earth.

994
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,208
And if anyone in the human world

995
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,500
or Monster Realm ever dared to defy me,

996
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,666
they'd be destroyed.

997
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:04,333
Innovation.

998
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:23,750
I never would have thought
I would kill you with this sword.

999
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,375
The Scale Stone

1000
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:37,083
has been growing stronger
for over a hundred years.

1001
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,833
Did you honestly think…

1002
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,666
this rusty old sword could beat me?

1003
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,833
Also, you should know

1004
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:55,375
you're never gonna see Sister Baini again.

1005
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,375
Your beloved,

1006
01:29:58,458 --> 01:29:59,875
your master,

1007
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,666
is gone.

1008
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:36,500
It's the most important moment
and that freak is nowhere to be found?

1009
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:37,791
Let me through. Let me through.

1010
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,541
Well, I guess I just have to take care
of everything…

1011
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,958
myself.

1012
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,291
That…

1013
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,208
That… that might work too, I guess.

1014
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,666
Assuming it doesn't take a year.

1015
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,333
-Uh…
-Chew harder!

1016
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,250
Don't let them cross the bridge!

1017
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,666
What's happening?

1018
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,375
It's awful.

1019
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,375
It's demonic…

1020
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,291
Where? Is it poisonous?

1021
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,083
Are demons attacking?

1022
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:00,833
Shenle!

1023
01:34:00,916 --> 01:34:03,291
I'm coming.

1024
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Shenle. If we get out of this alive,
I'll take that belt you picked up.

1025
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,125
What bell?

1026
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30,041
What bell are you talking about?

1027
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,916
Oh, yeah. Well, Red hit so hard that…

1028
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:36,458
he'd be great at ringing bells.

1029
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:58,041
Why'd they stop?

1030
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,791
Careful, it could be a trick.

1031
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:09,125
What is that?

1032
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:27,666
Master?

1033
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:39,750
Huh?

1034
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:52,500
Master!

1035
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,708
Master!

1036
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,666
Master!

1037
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:18,708
Master!

1038
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,666
Master!

1039
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,541
Master told me that if one day…

1040
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,666
he should die,

1041
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:43,791
all of you

1042
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:45,666
were free to go your separate ways.

1043
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,875
There's no need to die with him.

1044
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,958
It won't make any difference
if we go back now.

1045
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:14,583
So let's stay and die fighting.

1046
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:20,000
There are more Capital Guards
protecting the city besides me.

1047
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:32,166
I do so enjoy
watching pointless struggles.

1048
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:34,750
It's so amusing.

1049
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,958
The bridge is breaking. Everyone, run!

1050
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:07,833
Shenle.

1051
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,333
I'll remember you.

1052
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:13,833
And I hope you'll remember me too.

1053
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,708
Yuan Boya!

1054
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,875
Destroy the bridge!

1055
01:38:21,958 --> 01:38:24,250
Even if it takes us with it.
We can't let them pass!

1056
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,375
Qingming.

1057
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,541
Wake up.

1058
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,541
Baini?

1059
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:49,166
What is this place?

1060
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,208
Thankfully…

1061
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,166
you kept your promise.

1062
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:59,083
I've been waiting for you for a while.

1063
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,125
Forget your demon friends.

1064
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,291
Forget the Bureau and Pingjing City.

1065
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:06,291
There's only you and me.

1066
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:08,875
We'll be together forever.

1067
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:10,500
Isn't this

1068
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,333
what we always wanted?

1069
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,291
You are not Baini.

1070
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,833
Baini would never turn her back
on the mortal world.

1071
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,458
Are you sure about that?

1072
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:30,541
Demon.

1073
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:35,541
Qingming.

1074
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:39,791
You must replace Cimu

1075
01:39:39,875 --> 01:39:42,500
and join with me.

1076
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:46,041
"Replace Cimu"?

1077
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:51,708
You were the one controlling him,

1078
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,000
driving him insane.

1079
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:55,625
You wouldn't embrace your true nature

1080
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:58,541
and kept refusing my call.

1081
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:02,333
Now that Cimu has pierced your heart,

1082
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:04,958
you and I are finally connected.

1083
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:09,916
This is the perfect time for us
to become one.

1084
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,916
Why does it have to be me?

1085
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,833
Cimu does not share my bloodline.

1086
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:17,208
You are the only one

1087
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,333
who can truly bring about my resurrection.

1088
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,625
No.

1089
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,791
I'd rather reverse the protection spell

1090
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:26,333
and destroy myself

1091
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,583
than become your puppet.

1092
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,333
But what about them?

1093
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:36,125
Do you want them to be destroyed as well?

1094
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:51,750
I once made a pact with Baini

1095
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:54,041
that I would never become an evil demon.

1096
01:40:55,541 --> 01:41:00,375
Baini.
You also hold Baini's life in your hand.

1097
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:01,291
No.

1098
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:04,458
No! Stop it!

1099
01:41:09,541 --> 01:41:11,666
Cimu has the power of the Scale Stone.

1100
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,833
I am no match for him.

1101
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:20,541
Join with me

1102
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:24,083
and fully embrace your demonic nature.

1103
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:27,291
Recognize me as your master.

1104
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,208
You can still achieve greatness.

1105
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,750
Recognize you as my master?

1106
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,250
Would you rather be a weak human

1107
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:43,208
or a demon capable of saving the world?

1108
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,333
Which do you choose?

1109
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:04,666
Yuan Boya!

1110
01:42:21,875 --> 01:42:23,416
Red!

1111
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,875
The bridge is broken.

1112
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:08,250
We'll guard the city.

1113
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:11,666
If it's the last thing we do.

1114
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,958
Do you really think this will stop me?

1115
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:37,583
I'm Seventh-Rank secondary captain
Yuan Boya,

1116
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:40,625
I'm honored to fight alongside you

1117
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,333
and die without regret!

1118
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,125
Hmm?

1119
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,041
Huh?

1120
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:07,375
Nice trick…

1121
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:08,416
freak.

1122
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:16,208
How did you…

1123
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,958
I was supposed to control both realms

1124
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,333
and rule over all.

1125
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:47,791
Vanity fills your heart.

1126
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:50,041
You have no respect for the world

1127
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:52,250
and no attachments to anyone or anything.

1128
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:54,791
And you think you deserve to rule?

1129
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,625
The Scale Stone

1130
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:59,833
is not yours to use.

1131
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:44,666
Chief,

1132
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,875
we defended the Border Bridge

1133
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,875
and saved the capital,
all thanks to Master.

1134
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:04,125
Take the Scale Stone
and come to the Yin Yang Bureau.

1135
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:15,291
Master.

1136
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,041
Qingming.

1137
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:35,208
You once promised me

1138
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:37,833
we'd live and die as one
and never betray each other.

1139
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,500
Did you forget?

1140
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:41,291
Freak!

1141
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,500
You know that stupid sigil of yours?

1142
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:46,666
I believe in it. And look at them.

1143
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:49,916
They were willing to die
because of their loyalty to you.

1144
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,750
Which do you choose?

1145
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:56,416
So you used…

1146
01:48:58,041 --> 01:48:59,541
Cimu to force my hand.

1147
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,875
You made him wreak havoc for both realms

1148
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:03,791
to coerce me into joining you.

1149
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,500
Yes.

1150
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:22,208
Return to the unity,
purity from within and without.

1151
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:25,458
You're actually reversing
the protection spell?

1152
01:49:26,625 --> 01:49:30,333
You will destroy yourself!

1153
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:32,375
Both my body and soul

1154
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:33,875
will be destroyed.

1155
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,083
And you will be trapped

1156
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,166
forever

1157
01:49:38,416 --> 01:49:39,916
inside Cimu's body.

1158
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:45,708
You can't do this to me!

1159
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,041
If you want me to free you,

1160
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,708
call me Master

1161
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:53,541
and obey.

1162
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
-It's not possible! Stop it! No!
-Will you obey?

1163
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:00,958
Say it!

1164
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:03,625
Qingming!

1165
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:06,041
If you take me as your Spirit Guardian,

1166
01:50:06,125 --> 01:50:08,000
you will continue my work,

1167
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:10,875
you will abandon everyone
and everything you love

1168
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:13,916
and you will forever
be an enemy to humanity.

1169
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,208
I'll ask again.

1170
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:21,416
Will you obey or not?

1171
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:37,750
I swear on my name, Xiangliu,

1172
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:42,250
that I shall become Qingming's
Spirit Guardian from this day forward.

1173
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:45,000
We will live and die as one

1174
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:48,208
and never betray each other.

1175
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,083
You're all released…

1176
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,000
from my guardian spell.

1177
01:51:26,666 --> 01:51:28,666
Master!

1178
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:33,583
From now on,
we are no longer connected.

1179
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,458
In the seventh month
of the 47th year,

1180
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,375
disaster struck Pingjing City.

1181
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,291
Hurricanes, tornadoes
and pestilence ravished the land.

1182
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:51,791
At least,
that's what the historians wrote down.

1183
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:54,500
My report, however,
told a different story.

1184
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:58,875
The battle at the Border Bridge
decided the fate of the world.

1185
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:00,958
And it was Qingming
and his Spirit Guardians

1186
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:02,625
who won this impossible battle.

1187
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:04,708
I was there purely by chance

1188
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:06,833
but somehow emerged as a hero.

1189
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,833
Qingming.

1190
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:10,958
What happened to you?

1191
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:14,208
I fear I may never know for sure.

1192
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:17,625
But what I do know
is that you look so determined

1193
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,833
when you released your Spirit Guardians.

1194
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:22,250
And you clearly didn't have a choice.

1195
01:53:27,916 --> 01:53:30,750
Your sacrifice brought peace
and prosperity to people,

1196
01:53:31,666 --> 01:53:34,333
but it also scattered your guardians
to the winds.

1197
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:38,583
I, too, no longer have a home.

1198
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:11,833
Qingming.

1199
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:15,000
I don't care who's the master
and who's the spirit guardian,

1200
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:18,333
we are all hoping
to see you again someday.

1201
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:21,541
And we'll gladly follow you
wherever you wanna lead us.

1202
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,875
In the end, isn't that what it truly means
to be a Spirit Guardian?

1203
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:31,541
Sharing all sorrows and joys,
living and dying as one,

1204
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:34,041
and never betraying each other.
