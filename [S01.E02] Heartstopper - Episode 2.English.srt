[in French] Do you have a boyfriend?

337
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,319
Yes, I have a girlfriend.

338
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,880
[in English] "Une" makes it feminine,
so you'd be saying you have a girlfriend.

-You're worse.

365
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,279
[Tara] I'm not. It does matter
if you said it because I won,

Only a few of our friends know,
