00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.520
How are you doing?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.280
It still hurts.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.920
My head hurts.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.880
Do you want my help?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.560
It's okay.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Get some rest then.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.720
You'll get well soon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.560
Boss...

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.920
do you think I'm bad at gaming?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240
I'm starting to want to stop game broadcasting.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000
Why?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.360
Let me call you.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.520
Boo!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.280
I thought you're a ghost.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.160
No ghost would look this good.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.760
Why do you want to stop broadcasting game?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.960
Umm... I don't know. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.800
Maybe because my friend ditched me.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960
But you like gaming, don't you?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.520
Look at your place, it's full of game posters.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.320
That's right..

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.880
but it's not fun anymore.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.400
Find something else to do then.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
Didn't you say, you want to be TikTok star?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.960
Actually... 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
I didn't want to do gaming at the beginning.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
I saw my friend does it, so I wanted to do it too.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.200
What do you want to do?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.440
Umm... I don't know.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
I want to be more famous, I guess.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.720
So I will have sponsors. Maybe I can get more money.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
Let the doctor check your conditions.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.160
How?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.440
Look at the contents you've posted.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
No one will follow these contents for long.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.880
It's my account.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
I... want to post whatever I like.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.120
I know. Why don't you pick just one content...

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.760
and focus only at that one.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.480
What about those I had posted.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.480
If someting doesn't work, 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.800
you need to let it go to start over.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.200
If you really like to do something, 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.320
just do it your best.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.160
You need to ask yourself, 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.360
what do you like and dislike.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.040
Umm... thanks.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
Can I have your t-shirt as a price?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.920
What do you want it for?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.080
I want to smell it.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.840
No way, you pyscho!

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.400
I'm serious. Can you send it to me?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.120
Who told you to make that face?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.760
Why? You like it?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.120
No. It's scary. You look like a mud man.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.000
Delivery.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.480
How come you're here?

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.800
You asked me to come.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.840
I did? When?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.160
Yesterday.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200
Yesterday...

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.840
weren't we playing game yesterday?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480
We didn't.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.000
What are you doing?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.640
It's hot.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.120
Do you have air con here?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.760
It's already on.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
So... how can you come here?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.280
Didn't they order us to qaurantine at home?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.240
There is an order...

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.280
But...

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.320
I can't stand it anymore.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.480
What are you doing?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.480
Don't you do bad stuff to me.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.000
I'm still a virgin.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.360
If you do it. I'll call someone to arrest you.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.320
Just shout then.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.880
I want to eat mackerel,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.320
but I prefer eating you.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.680
DAM!!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.400
My pants are all wet.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.600
I'm not sure about this.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.200
Come on. Don't think too much. It's just for fun.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.680
If you're this cute, can I circle all of you?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.080
Nonsense.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.400
Porjade's calling? Should I pick up?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.040
Go ahead. Pick it up.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.680
Tono...

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.120
What's up?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.840
I'm sorry...

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.520
Can you not stop doing gaming channel?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.520
You have a lot of followers.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.400
I think... 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.680
I don't like gaming that much.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.280
I think, right now I want to be...

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.760
I want to be a TikToker.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.600
You're not mad at me, aren't you?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.600
I'm not mad. I understand.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.160
Then, I wish you to be a TikTok star soon.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.360
Good luck, man.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.720
Umm. Bye.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.120
You guys have made peace with each other.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.160
You can stop being sad now.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.920
Who's sad? No one is sad.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.720
You're so stubborn.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.880
Boss.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.600
Thank you.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.360

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.960
For... everything.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.120
Thank you for being beside me.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.280
And.., thank you for making me feel better.
