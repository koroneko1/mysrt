1
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're thinking.</font>

2
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lone rider.</font>

3
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dystopian world.</font>

4
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A land that's gone to waste.</font>

5
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did this world
get so broken?</font>

6
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that all began
500 years ago.</font>

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kumandra.</font>

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what we used to be.</font>

9
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When our land was whole,</font>

10
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we lived harmoniously
alongside...</font>

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dragons.</font>

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magical creatures
who brought us</font>

13
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">water and rain and peace.</font>

14
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was paradise.</font>

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, the Druun came.</font>

16
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mindless plague
that spread like wildfire,</font>

17
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">multiplying
as they consumed life</font>

18
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and turned everyone
they touched into stone.</font>

19
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dragons fought for us
the best they could,</font>

20
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it wasn't enough.</font>

21
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when
the Mighty Sisudatu,</font>

22
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the last dragon,</font>

23
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">concentrated all her magic
into a gem and...</font>

24
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...blasted the Druun away.</font>

25
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone that was turned
to stone came back.</font>

26
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except the dragons.</font>

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that was left of Sisu
was her gem.</font>

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It should have been
this big inspirational moment,</font>

29
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where humanity united
over her sacrifice.</font>

30
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But instead,
people being people,</font>

31
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they all fought to possess</font>

32
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the last remnant
of dragon magic.</font>

33
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Borders were drawn,
Kumandra divided.</font>

34
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all became enemies,
and the gem had to be hidden.</font>

35
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not how
the world broke.</font>

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That didn't truly happen
until 500 years later,</font>

37
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I came into the story.</font>

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

39
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

40
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like someone's trying
to be clever.</font>

41
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Tuk Tuk,</font>

42
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's show 'em
what clever really looks like.</font>

43
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuk Tuk!</font>

44
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

45
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Focus!</font>

46
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

47
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bud, that was awesome.
Give me some shell.</font>

48
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got ya.</font>

49
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

50
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second.</font>

51
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This feels too easy.</font>

52
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Benja.</font>

53
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's your job
to try and stop me, but</font>

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't.</font>

55
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't mistake spirit
for skill, young one.</font>

56
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise
you will not set foot</font>

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Dragon Gem's
inner circle.</font>

58
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even a toe.</font>

59
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might wanna take out
that blade.</font>

60
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna need it.</font>

61
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not today.</font>

62
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boop.</font>

63
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said, not one foot
on the inner circle.</font>

64
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost, Raya.</font>

65
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I?</font>

66
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya...</font>

67
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I probably should have said
2 feet.</font>

68
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't beat yourself up
too much, Chief Benja.</font>

69
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave it your best.</font>

70
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't.</font>

71
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's either "Father"
or "Ba" to you.</font>

72
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did good, dewdrop.
You passed the test.</font>

73
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

74
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The spirit of Sisu.</font>

75
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For generations, our family
has sworn to protect the gem.</font>

76
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, you will join
that legacy.</font>

77
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:37,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya, Princess of Heart,
my daughter,</font>

78
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are now
a Guardian of the Dragon Gem.</font>

79
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Ah...</font>

80
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, someone's excited.</font>

81
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah!</font>

82
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, anyone hoping
to steal the Dragon Gem</font>

83
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now has to face the fury</font>

84
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the two baddest blades
in all the lands.</font>

85
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad
you feel prepared, dewdrop,</font>

86
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I have something
important to tell you.</font>

87
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other lands, they're on
their way here, as we speak.</font>

88
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are? Uh...</font>

89
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

90
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, no, we can do this.
I'm ready.</font>

91
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know exactly
how we'll stop them.</font>

92
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Tell me what you know
about the other lands.</font>

93
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First... Tail.</font>

94
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries</font>

95
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who fight dirty.</font>

96
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second, Talon.</font>

97
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A floating market famous
for fast deals</font>

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and fighters
with even faster hands.</font>

99
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Third, Spine.</font>

100
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A frigid bamboo forest</font>

101
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">guarded by
exceptionally large warriors,</font>

102
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and their giant axes.</font>

103
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fourth, Fang.
Our fiercest enemy.</font>

104
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A nation protected
by angry assassins,</font>

105
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and their even angrier cats.</font>

106
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay,</font>

107
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we're gonna need some
crossbows and catapults and...</font>

108
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! What about
flaming catapults?</font>

109
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, how about
shrimp paste from Tail.</font>

110
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lemongrass from Talon,
bamboo shoots from Spine,</font>

111
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chilis from Fang
and palm sugar from Heart?</font>

112
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll poison them?</font>

113
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're not going
to poison them</font>

114
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're not going
to fight them.</font>

115
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to share a meal
with them.</font>

116
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">-Wait, what?
-I invited them.</font>

117
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're our enemies.</font>

118
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're only our enemies</font>

119
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because they think
the Dragon Gem</font>

120
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">magically brings
us prosperity.</font>

121
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's ridiculous.
It doesn't do that.</font>

122
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They assume it does,</font>

123
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like we assume things
about them.</font>

124
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya, there's a reason why
each land</font>

125
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is named after
a part of the dragon.</font>

126
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were once unified.
Harmoniously as one.</font>

127
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kumandra.</font>

128
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's ancient history, Ba.</font>

129
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it doesn't have to be.</font>

130
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, if we don't stop</font>

131
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and learn to trust
one another again,</font>

132
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's only a matter of time</font>

133
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before we tear
each other apart.</font>

134
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't the world
I want you to live in.</font>

135
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe that
we can be Kumandra again.</font>

136
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But someone has to take
the first step.</font>

137
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

138
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things look
a little tense, Ba.</font>

139
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry,
I'm gonna open with a joke.</font>

140
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't.</font>

141
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding, I'm kidding.</font>

142
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People of Tail, Talon,</font>

143
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spine, and Fang,</font>

144
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">welcome to Heart.</font>

145
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For far too long,
we have been enemies,</font>

146
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but today is a new day.</font>

147
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, we can be Kumandra
once more.</font>

148
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice speech, Chief Benja.</font>

149
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why'd you really
bring us here?</font>

150
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna rob us?</font>

151
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would he need to rob us?</font>

152
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The land of Heart
already has everything.</font>

153
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's easy to pontificate
on Kumandra</font>

154
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you hold the mightiest
weapon in all the lands.</font>

155
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gem's not a weapon.
It's a sacred relic.</font>

156
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kumandra!
Kumandra's a joke!</font>

157
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He brought us all this way</font>

158
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to talk about fairy tales.</font>

159
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pointless!</font>

160
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something to say.</font>

161
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's hungry?</font>

162
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

163
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead. It's all right.</font>

164
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Namaari, of Fang.</font>

165
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya.</font>

166
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that Sisu?</font>

167
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, um, yeah,</font>

168
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might be a little bit
of a dragon nerd.</font>

169
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm the one wearing
the Sisu fan necklace.</font>

170
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

171
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you eaten yet?</font>

172
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

173
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mom actually said that?</font>

174
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awkward.
Okay, next question.</font>

175
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand-to-hand or swords?</font>

176
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blades all day.
- Right?</font>

177
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, dressy or casual?</font>

178
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a monster would choose</font>

179
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to wear this outfit
on the regular.</font>

180
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, rice or stew?</font>

181
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think
that'd stump you.</font>

182
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... This is actually
one of the first times</font>

183
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had rice in awhile.</font>

184
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:33,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

185
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fang may look nice
on the outside,</font>

186
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we have some pretty
big holes on the inside.</font>

187
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

188
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Didn't mean
to bring it down.</font>

189
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where were we?</font>

190
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both have single parents</font>

191
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who are terrible
at telling jokes.</font>

192
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're both warrior women</font>

193
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who despise uncomfortable
formal wear.</font>

194
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're both Sisu superfans.</font>

195
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

196
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Fang legend says
she's still out there.</font>

197
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu? You're kidding, right?</font>

198
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna see something?</font>

199
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you supposed to have that?</font>

200
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

201
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">According to this,</font>

202
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after the Mighty Sisu
blasted away all the Druun,</font>

203
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she fell into the water
and floated downstream.</font>

204
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Legends say she's now sleeping
at the river's end.</font>

205
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But which river?
There's, like, hundreds.</font>

206
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

207
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if we could find it,
could you imagine?</font>

208
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A dragon back in the world.</font>

209
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things could be
so much better.</font>

210
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

211
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we really could be
Kumandra again.</font>

212
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

213
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

214
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

215
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From one dragon nerd
to another.</font>

216
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

217
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

218
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come with me, dep la.
I wanna show you something.</font>

219
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The spirit of Sisu.
I can feel it.</font>

220
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the last bit
of dragon magic</font>

221
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">left in the whole world.</font>

222
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see why
Heart guards it so closely.</font>

223
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, dep la.
You've been very helpful.</font>

224
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a different world, maybe
we could have been friends,</font>

225
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I have to do
what's right for Fang.</font>

226
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Virana, I'm so glad
Fang accepted our invitation.</font>

227
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

228
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no way
you're taking Sisu's gem.</font>

229
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. It's Fang's now.</font>

230
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will not set foot on
the Dragon Gem's inner circle.</font>

231
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

232
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

233
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fang's
making a play for the gem!</font>

234
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Spine should have the gem!</font>

235
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if we get to it first!</font>

236
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our blades say different.</font>

237
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me!</font>

238
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a choice.</font>

239
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can tear each other apart,</font>

240
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:23,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or we can come together
and build a better world.</font>

241
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not too late.</font>

242
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:31,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still believe
we can be Kumandra again.</font>

243
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba!</font>

244
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of my way!</font>

245
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gem belongs to Spine!</font>

246
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the gem!</font>

247
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No... No...</font>

248
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Druun.</font>

249
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's still magic in them!</font>

250
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get the pieces!
- No!</font>

251
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba! Come on, we have to go!</font>

252
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're repelled by water.</font>

253
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry! Get to the river!</font>

254
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba, get up! Come on!</font>

255
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, we have
to keep moving.</font>

256
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up!</font>

257
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba! We don't have time!</font>

258
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand up! I'll help...</font>

259
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya, you have to listen.</font>

260
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the Guardian
of the Dragon Gem.</font>

261
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba, why are you saying this?</font>

262
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's still light in this.
There's still hope.</font>

263
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! We can make it together.</font>

264
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay.</font>

265
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya.
Don't give up on them.</font>

266
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, my dewdrop.</font>

267
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba?</font>

268
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

269
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba!</font>

270
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba.</font>

271
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please let this be it.</font>

272
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

273
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing,
you big fur bug?</font>

274
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy, focus.</font>

275
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk.</font>

276
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>

277
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so easily distracted.</font>

278
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting a little
too big for this, bud.</font>

279
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 years of searching</font>

280
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:31,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we end up
at a literal shipwreck.</font>

281
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a bad sign, is it?</font>

282
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisudatu...</font>

283
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

284
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
if you're listening.</font>

285
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've searched every river
to find you,</font>

286
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now I'm here
at the very last one.</font>

287
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, there's not
a lot of us left,</font>

288
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we really...
We really need your help.</font>

289
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I can be honest,</font>

290
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really need your help.</font>

291
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a mistake.</font>

292
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trusted someone
I shouldn't have, and...</font>

293
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...now the world's broken.</font>

294
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisudatu...</font>

295
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just really, really
want my Ba back.</font>

296
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

297
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay...</font>

298
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here goes everything.</font>

299
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suvaa de draa sim</font>

300
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mandra de draa lim</font>

301
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:53,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bavaa de draa
Tomben</font>

302
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, buddy,
I haven't forgot...</font>

303
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my... Where am I?</font>

304
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pengu? Amba? Pranee?
Are you here?</font>

305
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Mighty Sisu.</font>

306
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said that?</font>

307
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

308
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

309
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

310
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.</font>

311
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not too bad.
Just a little dusty.</font>

312
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me get that for ya.</font>

313
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu?</font>

314
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are Sisu?</font>

315
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're people.</font>

316
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

317
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya. I'm Raya.</font>

318
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're not made of stone,
which means...</font>

319
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:09,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked!</font>

320
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it!</font>

321
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear that, Pengu?
It worked!</font>

322
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mess it up!</font>

323
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that food?</font>

324
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was so focused
on saving the world,</font>

325
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot to have
breakfast today.</font>

326
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today?</font>

327
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When exactly
do you think today is?</font>

328
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuesday.</font>

329
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean...
Mmm.</font>

330
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this delightful
culinary treat?</font>

331
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:34,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's jackfruit jerky.
I dried it myself.</font>

332
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, compliments to the chef.</font>

333
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna finish this, Skippy?</font>

334
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

335
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu, there are a few things
I need to catch you up on.</font>

336
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

337
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You broke it?</font>

338
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad.
This is bad.</font>

339
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been asleep
for 500 years,</font>

340
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you brought back
the Druun,</font>

341
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and none of my brothers
and sisters came back.</font>

342
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't they come back?</font>

343
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:00,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

344
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, you broke the gem!</font>

345
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still have
a big chunk of it, though.</font>

346
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that supposed
to make me feel better?</font>

347
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you lost a puppy,
and I said...</font>

348
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Well, we still
have a big chunk of it!"</font>

349
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would that make you
feel better?</font>

350
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you just make
another one?</font>

351
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't just
"make another one."</font>

352
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're a dragon.</font>

353
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be real
with you, all right?</font>

354
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not, like,
the best dragon, ya know?</font>

355
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you saved the world.</font>

356
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did do that. That's true.</font>

357
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But have you ever done
like a group project,</font>

358
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but there's, like,
that one kid</font>

359
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who didn't pitch in as much,</font>

360
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but still ended up
with the same grade?</font>

361
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I wasn't the one
who actually made the gem.</font>

362
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just turned it in.</font>

363
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Uh...</font>

364
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're glowing.</font>

365
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you.</font>

366
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I use aloe and river slime
to maintain my...</font>

367
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Look!</font>

368
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! This is my little sister
Amba's magic.</font>

369
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the glow!</font>

370
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your little sister's magic?</font>

371
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, every dragon
has a unique magic.</font>

372
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what's yours?</font>

373
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a really strong swimmer.</font>

374
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait,
you touched this gem piece</font>

375
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:08,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it gave you powers.</font>

376
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what
this means, right?</font>

377
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I no longer need
a night light?</font>

378
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:15,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No!
You're still connected to the gem's magic,</font>

379
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that means
you can still use it</font>

380
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:18,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to save the world.</font>

381
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we can get
all the other gem pieces...</font>

382
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can reassemble it...
- ...you can reassemble it...</font>

383
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and boom
the Druun away!</font>

384
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And bring my Ba back?</font>

385
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And bring
all of Kumandra back.</font>

386
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess Namaari,</font>

387
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Tail lands
are infested with Druun.</font>

388
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benja's daughter is as good
as stone out here.</font>

389
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Retrieving
some useless dragon scroll</font>

390
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">isn't worth the risk.</font>

391
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else wanna question
why we're out here?</font>

392
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so here's the sitch.</font>

393
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After the gem broke,
each piece was taken</font>

394
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by one of the chiefs
of the five lands,</font>

395
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon,
and Tail.</font>

396
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where we are now.</font>

397
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. So many questions.</font>

398
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First one,
why am I wearing this?</font>

399
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we don't want
to attract attention.</font>

400
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you definitely chose
the right hat for that.</font>

401
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:01,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what makes you think
the Tail chief's here?</font>

402
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because this place
didn't just booby-trap itself.</font>

403
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:17,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This doesn't make sense.</font>

404
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of this
would stop a Druun.</font>

405
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not to stop Druun.
It's to stop people.</font>

406
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

407
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

408
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you looking at me
like that?</font>

409
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

410
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just not used to
seeing dragons.</font>

411
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impressed, huh? Wait until
you see my backstroke.</font>

412
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm wicked
when I hit that liquid.</font>

413
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got water skills that kill.</font>

414
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I slaughter
when I hit the water.</font>

415
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm, like, really good
at swimming, through rhyme.</font>

416
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was trying to make that...</font>

417
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I'm really good
at swim...</font>

418
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:57,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a good swimmer,
is basically what I'm...</font>

419
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, um,
we need to keep going.</font>

420
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no!
- What? What is it?</font>

421
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We forgot to bring a gift
for the Tail chief.</font>

422
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. A gift?</font>

423
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A gift says,</font>

424
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You can trust me,
can I trust you?"</font>

425
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. Hey there,
little fella.</font>

426
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This beetle's got a booty.</font>

427
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Careful.
It's a Toot N Boom.</font>

428
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it called a...</font>

429
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it. Noted. Makes sense.</font>

430
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

431
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to admit though,</font>

432
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">these bug booties
are kind of cute.</font>

433
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say
we found the Tail chief.</font>

434
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to her?</font>

435
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:54,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the looks of it,</font>

436
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:56,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she was hoarding the gem</font>

437
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and became a victim
of her own traps.</font>

438
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you gotta admire
her commitment.</font>

439
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Hold on.</font>

440
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we were doing
a jumpy thing!</font>

441
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry. My bad.</font>

442
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it now. I'm with it.</font>

443
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu...</font>

444
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't.</font>

445
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two down, three to go.</font>

446
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just shapechanged!
Into people!</font>

447
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Dragons can do that?</font>

448
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was my sister
Pranee's thing.</font>

449
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at my people arms
and my people face.</font>

450
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look how close my butt is
to my head.</font>

451
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that
you don't have to hide me,</font>

452
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">getting the rest of the gems
is gonna be a breeze.</font>

453
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, this one was easy,</font>

454
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the rest of them
are being held</font>

455
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by a bunch
of no-good Binturis.</font>

456
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Binturi?</font>

457
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:26,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a very nice way
to describe an old friend.</font>

458
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:30,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namaari.</font>

459
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's drippin', dep la?</font>

460
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I see you've finally
made a new friend.</font>

461
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here I was worried</font>

462
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were gonna end up
becoming a cat lady</font>

463
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like me.</font>

464
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something tells me
you're not besties.</font>

465
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:47,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stealing Dragon Gem pieces,
are we? Why?</font>

466
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I say?
Bling is my thing.</font>

467
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

468
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta admit, Raya,
until a few months ago,</font>

469
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were stone.</font>

470
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then, someone stole
Fang's dragon scroll.</font>

471
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, is that why
you're chasing me?</font>

472
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here I thought
it was because you missed me.</font>

473
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you really looking
for Sisu?</font>

474
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, 12?</font>

475
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I actually was looking
for Sisu.</font>

476
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and guess what?
I found her.</font>

477
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say hi, Sisu.</font>

478
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:20,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

479
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very nice to meet you,</font>

480
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:26,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I love your hair
and your cats' hair.</font>

481
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:28,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take them.</font>

482
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

483
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not like that! Two legs!</font>

484
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right!</font>

485
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuk Tuk! Roll!</font>

486
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

487
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jump!</font>

488
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was that girl?</font>

489
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:20,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Namaari.</font>

490
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's the backstabbing Binturi
that broke the world.</font>

491
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, those cats
are really fast, huh?</font>

492
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do cats and Druun
have in common?</font>

493
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... They have no souls?</font>

494
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:44,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they both hate water.</font>

495
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Hold on!</font>

496
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Is anybody here?</font>

497
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the world-famous
Shrimp-orium.</font>

498
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Boun.
I'll be your server today.</font>

499
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to hear
our daily specials?</font>

500
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:11,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, please!</font>

501
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got shrimp, we got congee.</font>

502
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a shrimp congee
that won't quit.</font>

503
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The captain,
where is the captain?</font>

504
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go get him.</font>

505
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, my new customers?</font>

506
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Captain Boun,</font>

507
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the owner, chef,
and chief financial officer</font>

508
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the Shrimp-orium.</font>

509
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I help you?</font>

510
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:30,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm Sisu and...</font>

511
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we need
to get to Talon now.</font>

512
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. The Shrimp-orium
is not a water taxi.</font>

513
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toi, that's a lot of jade!</font>

514
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half now, half when we arrive
in Talon. Deal?</font>

515
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clasp onto your congee.</font>

516
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today's special is</font>

517
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go.</font>

518
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Captain Boun?</font>

519
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this thing go any faster?</font>

520
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! You didn't tell me
Fang was after you!</font>

521
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna cost you extra!</font>

522
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, I got it.</font>

523
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:05,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is she doing?</font>

524
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:16,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is happening?</font>

525
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend's
a really strong swimmer.</font>

526
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye, Binturi.</font>

527
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess Namaari,
if they're after gem pieces,</font>

528
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their next stop
would be Talon.</font>

529
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not following them
to Talon.</font>

530
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:36,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going back to Fang.</font>

531
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to speak
with Chief Virana.</font>

532
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu? Sisu?</font>

533
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

534
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please get out of there.</font>

535
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a water dragon.</font>

536
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is water.
It's sort of my thing.</font>

537
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna come in?</font>

538
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone could see you.</font>

539
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop
and Lock over there?</font>

540
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:23,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, are you scared</font>

541
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's gonna challenge me
to a dance battle?</font>

542
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu, I saw people
lose their minds</font>

543
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:36,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over a Dragon Gem.</font>

544
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you imagine what they'd do
over an actual dragon?</font>

545
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we need you
to make this all work.</font>

546
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until we have all the gems,
you have to stay human.</font>

547
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

548
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you really
got some trust issues.</font>

549
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, my father
blindly trusted people,</font>

550
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now, he's stone.</font>

551
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we'll get your Ba back.</font>

552
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, girl.
Come on, who's your dragon?</font>

553
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:02,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, human. Because
I'm gonna be a human until...</font>

554
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you... You get it.</font>

555
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, who's hungry?</font>

556
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I am.</font>

557
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two house specials.
How spicy would you like it?</font>

558
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hot, hotter,
or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?</font>

559
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bring on the heat!
- Yeah, no.</font>

560
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't think so.</font>

561
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, what are you doing?</font>

562
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't
know him. It could be poison.</font>

563
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would he poison us?</font>

564
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, why would I poison you?</font>

565
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, to get my jade purse,</font>

566
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:27,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">second, to steal my sword,</font>

567
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:31,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and third, I don't know,
to kidnap my Tuk Tuk.</font>

568
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All good points,
but if this is poison...</font>

569
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm!</font>

570
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:38,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you're gonna die happy.</font>

571
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:41,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, thanks,
but we got our own eats.</font>

572
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is delicious.</font>

573
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, not poison.</font>

574
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's...</font>

575
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hot. Ooh, it's hot!</font>

576
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hot! It's really hot!</font>

577
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my! Oh! Water!</font>

578
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boun? Captain Boun?
We need water on deck!</font>

579
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, buddy.</font>

580
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, during the day,</font>

581
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can almost forget
they're here,</font>

582
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but at night...</font>

583
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why
I never leave the boat.</font>

584
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a smart kid.</font>

585
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are Druun, anyways?</font>

586
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A plague.
Born from human discord.</font>

587
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've always been here.</font>

588
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:48,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waiting for a moment
of weakness to attack.</font>

589
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're like
the opposite of dragons.</font>

590
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:56,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of bringing water
and life to the world,</font>

591
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're like a relentless fire</font>

592
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that consumes everything
in its wake</font>

593
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:05,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until there's nothing left
except ash and stone.</font>

594
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They took my family.</font>

595
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They took mine, too.</font>

596
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like we're here.</font>

597
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where are you guys heading
after Talon?</font>

598
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might be heading there, too.</font>

599
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, for a fee, of course.</font>

600
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

601
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! What a smart way
to Druun-proof your house.</font>

602
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Build right on the water.</font>

603
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People of Talon are geniuses.</font>

604
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:30,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Talon may look nice,</font>

605
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's a hotspot for
pickpockets and con artists.</font>

606
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky for me. Empty pockets!</font>

607
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so here's the good news.</font>

608
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where the gem piece is.</font>

609
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:39,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bad news?</font>

610
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's being held by
the notorious Chief of Talon,</font>

611
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dang Hai.</font>

612
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What Dang Hai lacks in style,
he makes up in mean.</font>

613
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:48,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

614
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha.</font>

615
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we're just gonna have to
turn up the charm.</font>

616
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get him a gift.</font>

617
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu, I think maybe
it's safer for you</font>

618
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to stay here on the boat.</font>

619
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

620
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without you, we can't
put the gem back together.</font>

621
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I wanna help.</font>

622
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, and you will.</font>

623
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By staying safe.</font>

624
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back
before you know it.</font>

625
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you see any hungry faces,
send 'em my way.</font>

626
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it, Captain.</font>

627
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:42,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
there's Dang Hai's house.</font>

628
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No detours
till we score that Dragon Gem.</font>

629
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. What in the...</font>

630
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

631
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

632
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby, toddler, thing...</font>

633
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:00,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...whatever you're called.</font>

634
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's really late.
What are you doing out here?</font>

635
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are your parents?</font>

636
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, whose baby...</font>

637
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Ongis?</font>

638
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop 'em!</font>

639
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

640
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? A con-baby?</font>

641
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, this is giving me
bad feels.</font>

642
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Dang Hai
does not sound like</font>

643
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:27,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">someone you could smooth talk.</font>

644
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Raya
didn't even bring a gift.</font>

645
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. I'm going shopping.</font>

646
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait.
I don't have any money.</font>

647
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're an adult.</font>

648
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could just put it
on credit.</font>

649
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh... Uh, what's credit?</font>

650
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kinda like a promise.</font>

651
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:42,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take what you want now,</font>

652
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you promise
you'll pay it back later.</font>

653
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay it back later? Huh!</font>

654
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What an amazing concept.</font>

655
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Captain Boun.</font>

656
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be buying this
with credit.</font>

657
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Dang Hai's
gonna love this!</font>

658
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Credit, please.</font>

659
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah,
I'll be using credit, yes.</font>

660
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love credit!</font>

661
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:06,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you!</font>

662
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going
to pay for any of that?</font>

663
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

664
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, right.
No, this is on credit.</font>

665
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm gonna pay it
back later.</font>

666
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay us back later?
We don't know you.</font>

667
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no credit here.</font>

668
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pay us right now.
- Now?</font>

669
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have anything,</font>

670
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if I could just find
my girl Raya,</font>

671
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she has a sword, dried eats,</font>

672
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">two Dragon Gem pieces.</font>

673
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we don't!
What? Who said that?</font>

674
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better pay up, Binturi.</font>

675
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:33,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a charity.</font>

676
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you think
you're stealing from?</font>

677
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:37,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from her!</font>

678
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you see
she's new in town?</font>

679
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:41,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, dear. Don't be afraid.</font>

680
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

681
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:54,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, watch out!</font>

682
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye!</font>

683
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:21,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diaper!</font>

684
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

685
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:40,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, it's none of my business,</font>

686
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but using your baby charm
to rip people off...</font>

687
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...is super sketchy.</font>

688
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
where is your family?</font>

689
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

690
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

691
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:58,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

692
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

693
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How would you like to earn
some honest loot?</font>

694
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:10,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gah?</font>

695
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Dang Hai,</font>

696
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take that
Dragon Gem piece.</font>

697
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! I'm not Dang Hai.</font>

698
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Chai, the flower guy.</font>

699
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Dang Hai?</font>

700
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:46,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right over there.</font>

701
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Who has his gem piece?</font>

702
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most vicious chief</font>

703
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:54,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talon has ever seen.</font>

704
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those folks were,
like, crazy mad.</font>

705
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:00,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted
to bring some gifts</font>

706
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the Talon chief Dang Hai.</font>

707
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that who
you're looking for, dear?</font>

708
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know exactly where he is.</font>

709
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do?</font>

710
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm. I will take you there.</font>

711
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? That's what I've been
trying to tell my girl Raya.</font>

712
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:15,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she's all like,
"You can't trust people."</font>

713
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Don't talk to anyone."</font>

714
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I only eat terrible foods
I dried myself."</font>

715
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, dear.</font>

716
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:24,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Dang Hai
is just outside the city,</font>

717
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beyond the gates.</font>

718
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Away from
the water, huh? Wow.</font>

719
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He really likes living
on the edge.</font>

720
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:33,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi there, Dang Hai.</font>

721
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:34,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I'm Sisu,</font>

722
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:38,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've come here
to offer you some...</font>

723
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:41,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

724
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you're gonna tell me</font>

725
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:56,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where I can find
those other Dragon Gem pieces,</font>

726
00:49:56,622 --> 00:50:01,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'll have to leave you
outside with that thing.</font>

727
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:02,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your pick.</font>

728
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I... I trusted you.</font>

729
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big mistake.</font>

730
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better talk fast.</font>

731
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks hungry.</font>

732
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no. No, no, no!</font>

733
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:18,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya!</font>

734
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop her!</font>

735
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu, I told you
to stay on the boat.</font>

736
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:24,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry!</font>

737
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on to this for me,
will ya?</font>

738
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fog?</font>

739
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That was
my brother Jagan's magic.</font>

740
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
3 down, 2 to go.</font>

741
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Captain Boun,
next stop, Spine...</font>

742
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:40,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aah!</font>

743
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for the new customers!</font>

744
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I sort of promised
to buy them</font>

745
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the congee they could eat.</font>

746
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we're stuck with them
for a while</font>

747
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause ongis have
9 stomachs.</font>

748
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Toi.</font>

749
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:54,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe it.</font>

750
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That old lady
was really gonna hurt me.</font>

751
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:58,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm sorry, Sisu,</font>

752
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that's what
the world is now.</font>

753
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't trust anyone.</font>

754
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does that include babies?</font>

755
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:07,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, well...
- She's so cute.</font>

756
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look at those cheeks.</font>

757
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:13,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, I'm Sisu.</font>

758
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She loves my face.</font>

759
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:22,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, watch out
she doesn't steal your teeth.</font>

760
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me help you.</font>

761
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:25,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's so sweet.</font>

762
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:28,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's, uh...
That's too much sweet...</font>

763
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too much sweetness.
It's too much!</font>

764
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Virana,
we're running out of room.</font>

765
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to expand
to the mainland.</font>

766
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:50,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how do you propose
we handle the Druun,</font>

767
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General Atitāya?</font>

768
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without proper protection,</font>

769
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it would be a death sentence
for our people.</font>

770
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might have a solution
for that, Mother.</font>

771
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My little morning mist...</font>

772
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's good to see you home.</font>

773
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:05,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I located Raya.
She's out stealing gem pieces.</font>

774
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:06,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

775
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to take
the royal army</font>

776
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and intercept her in Spine.</font>

777
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
if she's going into Spine,</font>

778
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I doubt there'll be much left
of her to intercept.</font>

779
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:17,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's more capable
than you realize.</font>

780
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to stop her.</font>

781
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:21,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk with me.</font>

782
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:24,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around.</font>

783
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:28,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made all this
by making smart decisions,</font>

784
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:29,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not emotional ones.</font>

785
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:31,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are safe.</font>

786
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:35,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our canal protects us
from those monsters.</font>

787
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:37,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it's wise
to risk yourself</font>

788
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:38,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you don't have to.</font>

789
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you heard the general.</font>

790
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:43,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're running out of space.
We need to expand.</font>

791
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:47,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we had all the gem pieces,
we could do that safely.</font>

792
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

793
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't
an emotional decision.</font>

794
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:51,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the only decision
we can make</font>

795
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to secure Fang's future.</font>

796
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namaari, you're truly growing</font>

797
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the leader
I raised you to be.</font>

798
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General Atitāya,
ready the royal army</font>

799
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for my daughter's command.</font>

800
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mother.
I won't let you down.</font>

801
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Stop eating!</font>

802
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

803
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:29,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, buddy, I got this.</font>

804
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just throw
a shrimp at me?</font>

805
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even edible!</font>

806
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Don't look at me...</font>

807
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Hey, guys?</font>

808
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...like that,
you fuzzy garbage can!</font>

809
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:36,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna play
hide-and-seek?</font>

810
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:40,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Ready?</font>

811
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1.</font>

812
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:44,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2.</font>

813
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks.
- 2 and a half.</font>

814
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

815
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind me to never have kids.</font>

816
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Being people is hard.</font>

817
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:56,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

818
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6.</font>

819
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7.</font>

820
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have small heads.</font>

821
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:02,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No tails.</font>

822
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lie to get what you want,</font>

823
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the Talon chief
back there.</font>

824
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
the world's broken.</font>

825
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't trust anyone.</font>

826
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe the world's broken</font>

827
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you don't
trust anyone.</font>

828
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound just like my Ba.</font>

829
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he sounds like
a smart man.</font>

830
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:19,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he was.</font>

831
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really wanted
to believe him.</font>

832
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:22,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really wanted to believe</font>

833
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we could be
Kumandra again.</font>

834
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:26,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we can.</font>

835
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Literally thousands of people
turned to stone</font>

836
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would argue otherwise.</font>

837
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.</font>

838
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:35,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I did.
And you know what happened?</font>

839
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:38,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a gift.</font>

840
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around.</font>

841
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a world
of orphans because</font>

842
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">people couldn't stop fighting
over a gem.</font>

843
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna know why other dragons
didn't come back?</font>

844
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's because
people don't deserve them.</font>

845
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:51,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can change that.</font>

846
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Sisu, I am done trying.</font>

847
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kumandra is a fairy tale.</font>

848
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing
important to me now</font>

849
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is bringing my Ba back.</font>

850
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... I think we're in Spine.</font>

851
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:09,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu!</font>

852
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, my congee!</font>

853
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.</font>

854
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu! Come back! Please!</font>

855
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What... What are you doing?</font>

856
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to show you
that you're wrong!</font>

857
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:34,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How? By getting squashed by
a bunch of Spine rage-heads?</font>

858
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:35,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

859
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:36,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By proving to you</font>

860
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that if you wanna get
someone's trust,</font>

861
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to give
a little trust first.</font>

862
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Sisu, don't...</font>

863
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In hindsight,
maybe I was a little hasty,</font>

864
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:49,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, uh, who's hungry?</font>

865
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? I'll leave you alone.</font>

866
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:56,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, where are we?</font>

867
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interesting choice of digs.</font>

868
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two must be
dung of brain</font>

869
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:12,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to think you could steal
Spine's Dragon Gem.</font>

870
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gem?</font>

871
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said anything about gems?</font>

872
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:17,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have no interest in gems.</font>

873
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, yeah, I can see how</font>

874
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that makes me look
like a liar.</font>

875
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I think
it was the lying</font>

876
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that made you look
like a liar.</font>

877
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure what's funny.</font>

878
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:34,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fear
is like delectable nectar</font>

879
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">feeding the tum-tum
of my soul.</font>

880
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>

881
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tastes like... mango.</font>

882
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. I love mango.</font>

883
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you love mango!</font>

884
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a tongue-less
cretin wouldn't.</font>

885
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:48,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Toi!</font>

886
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been such a long time</font>

887
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since I've last peered</font>

888
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the eyes
of a trembling enemy.</font>

889
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where has the time gone?</font>

890
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been so long.</font>

891
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He seems lonely.</font>

892
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I'm not lonely.</font>

893
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a Spine warrior.</font>

894
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was born and bred to do
only one thing.</font>

895
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To invoke fear</font>

896
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to crush the skulls
of my enemies!</font>

897
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's actually two things.</font>

898
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:19,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at your face.</font>

899
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:21,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. What do you plan on doing
with us?</font>

900
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's gonna be bad.</font>

901
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:25,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horrifying!</font>

902
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll take me 2 weeks
to clean up!</font>

903
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea, do you?</font>

904
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I do.</font>

905
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:33,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm formulating this
gruesome plan in my head...</font>

906
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes me sick
just thinking about it.</font>

907
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:37,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You just wait.</font>

908
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until then, why don't you
just hang around?</font>

909
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:42,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good one, huh?</font>

910
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

911
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little one?</font>

912
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:56,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

913
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phew! Good work, Captain Boun!</font>

914
00:57:58,437 --> 00:57:59,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fang's here!
- What?</font>

915
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:02,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People of Spine,
we are hunting for Raya,</font>

916
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a fugitive from Heart!</font>

917
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:07,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send her out,
or we're coming in!</font>

918
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only one here?</font>

919
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My people battled the Druun
with much valor,</font>

920
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but lost.</font>

921
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

922
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Fang gang's here
for me, not for you,</font>

923
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so, um,
if I can distract them,</font>

924
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:32,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you guys
can get out of here.</font>

925
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna fight
an entire army?</font>

926
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm just gonna stall them.</font>

927
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know how to push
Namaari's buttons.</font>

928
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:40,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And once you guys are clear,
I'm out of there.</font>

929
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:46,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name?</font>

930
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The moniker given to me
is Tong.</font>

931
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:50,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Tong, look,
you don't know me,</font>

932
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:51,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know you,</font>

933
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:53,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm sure that
you know a back door</font>

934
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:54,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a way outta here,</font>

935
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's really important that
my friends stay safe, okay?</font>

936
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:01,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I am sincerely asking you,
will you help us?</font>

937
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

938
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

939
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Note to self,</font>

940
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:18,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't die.</font>

941
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:21,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn them out.</font>

942
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey there, Princess Undercut.</font>

943
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fancy meeting you here.</font>

944
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You
and the Dragon Gem pieces</font>

945
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are coming with me.</font>

946
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.
My sword here says we're not.</font>

947
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:41,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I knew you couldn't
handle rolling solo.</font>

948
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're nothing
without your band.</font>

949
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:45,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand down.</font>

950
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This shouldn't take long.</font>

951
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you need that, dep la?</font>

952
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah.</font>

953
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:19,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like somebody's
been taking classes.</font>

954
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you stealing
gem pieces?</font>

955
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:43,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm just
trying to get a matching set.</font>

956
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't happen
to bring Fang's gem, did you?</font>

957
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:03,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No? Never mind.</font>

958
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just swing by
and grab it later.</font>

959
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.</font>

960
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, she's a dragon.</font>

961
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

962
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:42,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

963
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just hit me
with a shrimp tail?</font>

964
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When were you gonna tell us
she was Sisu?</font>

965
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, technically,
you always knew she was Sisu.</font>

966
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:15,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

967
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:17,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you here,</font>

968
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">divine water dragon?</font>

969
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that obvious, big guy?</font>

970
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My girl Raya and I
are gonna fix the world.</font>

971
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring everyone back.</font>

972
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna
bring everyone back?</font>

973
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna help.</font>

974
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:30,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.</font>

975
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too dangerous.</font>

976
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only one
who lost family to the Druun.</font>

977
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:40,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

978
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me help you.</font>

979
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:53,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I too wish to join
this fellowship</font>

980
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Druun butt-kickery!</font>

981
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My big brother Pengu's magic.</font>

982
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Captain Boun.
To Fang.</font>

983
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:19,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it!</font>

984
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:40,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everyone,
here's the plan.</font>

985
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:43,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last gem piece is in Fang,</font>

986
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:45,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most heavily guarded
of the five lands.</font>

987
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, they're protected
by an artificial canal</font>

988
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:50,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that separates them
from the rest of the world.</font>

989
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way in or out</font>

990
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:53,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is by water.</font>

991
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:02,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luckily for us,
we have a magic water dragon.</font>

992
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the palace will be
swarmingwith Fang soldiers.</font>

993
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:09,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To sneak past them,
we'll need to...</font>

994
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:10,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this, guys.</font>

995
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:12,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care
of the first wave.</font>

996
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:15,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tong will follow up</font>

997
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with hisgiant axe
of bad-axery.</font>

998
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:21,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then come the ongis
and that crazy con-baby...</font>

999
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:26,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...who will toss the gem
to the Mighty Sisudatu.</font>

1000
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:30,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then, bye-bye, Binturis.</font>

1001
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Super flow plan, am I right?</font>

1002
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:40,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow.
That's a clog.</font>

1003
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I agree.</font>

1004
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's my plan.</font>

1005
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:44,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We infiltrate Fang,</font>

1006
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">confront Namaari,</font>

1007
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and offer her something nice
and go...</font>

1008
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Wanna help us
save the world?</font>

1009
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because all it takes
is one gem piece.</font>

1010
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1011
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been waiting
for someone to ask me!</font>

1012
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go!</font>

1013
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best friends forever!</font>

1014
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think I'd rather
go with Boun's plan.</font>

1015
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:07,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1016
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:08,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1017
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, why?</font>

1018
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's Fang.</font>

1019
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their blades
are specially designed</font>

1020
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:15,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the stabbing of backs.</font>

1021
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:16,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it weren't for them,</font>

1022
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">none of this
would have happened.</font>

1023
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're the worst.</font>

1024
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we're just honest with her,</font>

1025
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:24,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">deep down, I got a feeling</font>

1026
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she wants to fix the world
as much as we do.</font>

1027
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You weren't there
when Namaari betrayed me.</font>

1028
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:30,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're sticking with my plan.</font>

1029
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:36,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Uh...
What's with the downpour?</font>

1030
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:37,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
I need to show you something.</font>

1031
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do we do now?</font>

1032
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1033
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you taking me?</font>

1034
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu, why did you
bring me here?</font>

1035
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:20,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where it all happened.</font>

1036
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>

1037
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was there.
- No.</font>

1038
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where it all happened
500 years ago.</font>

1039
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:38,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to meet
my brothers and sisters.</font>

1040
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:40,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real mighty ones.</font>

1041
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss them.</font>

1042
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never knew
they were here.</font>

1043
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that classy-looking one
over there?</font>

1044
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Amba.
I get my glow from her.</font>

1045
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's Pranee.
She's a shapeshifter.</font>

1046
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jagan, fog.</font>

1047
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:01,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Pengu.</font>

1048
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:03,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's our big brother.</font>

1049
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He brings the rain.</font>

1050
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were the last dragons.</font>

1051
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the other dragons
had been turned to stone.</font>

1052
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:18,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were drowning
in a sea of Druun.</font>

1053
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:25,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my oldest brother Pengu
refused to accept defeat.</font>

1054
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is where
we'd make our last stand...</font>

1055
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:31,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">united.</font>

1056
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, one by one,</font>

1057
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:41,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they combined all their magic,</font>

1058
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:44,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">creating the Dragon Gem.</font>

1059
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why
they chose me.</font>

1060
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:54,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could have been any of us.</font>

1061
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I know</font>

1062
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:00,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is I trusted them...</font>

1063
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and they trusted me.</font>

1064
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so...</font>

1065
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When they put their faith
in me,</font>

1066
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:23,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it empowered me beyond
anything I could imagine.</font>

1067
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:26,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The same can happen
with Namaari.</font>

1068
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really wish
I could believe that.</font>

1069
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:32,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I once thought
that we could be friends.</font>

1070
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:33,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all this,</font>

1071
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe you can be.</font>

1072
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:38,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if she wanted to help us,</font>

1073
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how could I possibly
trust her?</font>

1074
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if somehow you could,</font>

1075
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't just bring
your Ba back.</font>

1076
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd also bring back
his dream.</font>

1077
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kumandra.</font>

1078
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think
he would even recognize me?</font>

1079
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much has changed.</font>

1080
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he will.</font>

1081
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remind me of him.</font>

1082
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? Strong?</font>

1083
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good-looking
with impeccable hair?</font>

1084
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopeful.</font>

1085
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How would I even
approach Namaari</font>

1086
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after all that's happened?</font>

1087
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:45,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may feel impossible,
but sometimes,</font>

1088
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you just have to take
the first step,</font>

1089
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even before you're ready.</font>

1090
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

1091
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:01,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We'll go with your plan.</font>

1092
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:03,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? My plan?
You're gonna go with my plan?</font>

1093
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:06,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- All right!</font>

1094
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna regret this.</font>

1095
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're gonna need
a really good gift.</font>

1096
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think she's into?
Cats? Knives?</font>

1097
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cats with knives?</font>

1098
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:14,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knives with little cats
on them?</font>

1099
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:18,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I know exactly what
to give her.</font>

1100
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:27,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is how
the land of Fang rose</font>

1101
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:31,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in spite of all the monsters
that wanted to destroy us.</font>

1102
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we're smart, resilient,</font>

1103
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we take care of one another.</font>

1104
01:11:36,672 --> 01:11:38,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother! We need to talk.</font>

1105
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Princess Namaari!</font>

1106
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right,
now, run along, kittens.</font>

1107
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to speak with the princess.</font>

1108
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:48,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother, you won't believe what I saw.</font>

1109
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:50,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw a dragon.</font>

1110
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:52,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General Atitāya informed me</font>

1111
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:55,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you'd be returning home
without the gem pieces.</font>

1112
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was Sisu.</font>

1113
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can fix what we broke.</font>

1114
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can bring everyone back.</font>

1115
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's what scares me.</font>

1116
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When everyone comes back,</font>

1117
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who do you think
they'll come for?</font>

1118
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:08,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forget.</font>

1119
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other lands blame us
for what's happened.</font>

1120
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we... We never meant
for anyone to get hurt.</font>

1121
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:17,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but if we had the dragon</font>

1122
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:18,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the gem pieces,</font>

1123
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we would be forgiven.</font>

1124
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could save the world.</font>

1125
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:25,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But more importantly,
our people would remain safe.</font>

1126
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Raya isn't just gonna
give Sisu to us.</font>

1127
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not going to give her
a choice.</font>

1128
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do?</font>

1129
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's no longer
your concern, my love.</font>

1130
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:38,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done enough.</font>

1131
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she refuses to help,</font>

1132
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've just flushed
our tactical advantage</font>

1133
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- into the dung pot.
- I know.</font>

1134
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:57,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. She really has no reason
to help us.</font>

1135
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:58,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

1136
01:12:58,670 --> 01:12:59,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This jerky's terrible.</font>

1137
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:00,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

1138
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:03,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure
those 4 miniature menaces</font>

1139
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be successful?</font>

1140
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1141
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1142
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:27,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1143
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1144
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's too much spice.</font>

1145
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no.
There's too much bamboo.</font>

1146
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:25,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know?</font>

1147
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:26,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have the taste buds
of a tall baby.</font>

1148
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you dress like
a tall baby.</font>

1149
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:29,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the spoon!
I'm taking over!</font>

1150
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back off, tidal wave.
I'm the professional here.</font>

1151
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:33,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I?</font>

1152
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:39,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1153
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's good.</font>

1154
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a little
something my Ba showed me.</font>

1155
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:43,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. Did he also show you</font>

1156
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how to make
that delicious jerky?</font>

1157
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that was all me.</font>

1158
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be nice to share a meal
with him again.</font>

1159
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:54,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you mean.</font>

1160
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have this really
obnoxious sister</font>

1161
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who always tousles my hair.</font>

1162
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't wait to see her
the most.</font>

1163
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After we win the day,</font>

1164
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I look forward
to filling my eyeball</font>

1165
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:11,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the joytastic image
of my village full again.</font>

1166
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:17,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you will be reunited
with your family, Noi.</font>

1167
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, what did you
just call her?</font>

1168
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:21,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Noi. It's her name.</font>

1169
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's written on her collar.</font>

1170
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:26,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have none of you ever checked?</font>

1171
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they think of me
as the ruffian.</font>

1172
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that mean?</font>

1173
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means we're on.</font>

1174
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:37,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu,</font>

1175
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:38,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until we get that gem</font>

1176
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:41,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and confirm Namaari's actually
on our side,</font>

1177
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">promise me you'll stay hidden.</font>

1178
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:00,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you got my gift.</font>

1179
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never thought
I'd see this again.</font>

1180
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh...</font>

1181
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:06,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to take
good care of it.</font>

1182
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the only
dragon nerd here.</font>

1183
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The final piece.</font>

1184
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to bring everyone back.</font>

1185
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:44,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu and the gem pieces
are coming with me.</font>

1186
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:46,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sisu!
- Stay back!</font>

1187
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was foolish
to trust someone from Fang!</font>

1188
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't come any closer!</font>

1189
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namaari,</font>

1190
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it doesn't have to be
like this.</font>

1191
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:57,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have any other choice.</font>

1192
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:01,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I got this.</font>

1193
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you don't wanna
hurt anybody.</font>

1194
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:12,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1195
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:15,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just want a better world.</font>

1196
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like we all do.</font>

1197
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu...</font>

1198
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust you, Namaari.</font>

1199
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1200
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu!</font>

1201
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>

1202
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

1203
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1204
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It appears that
with the last dragon gone,</font>

1205
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:14,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so too goes the water.</font>

1206
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now there is nothing
to stop the Druun.</font>

1207
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1208
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:33,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya?</font>

1209
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Raya?</font>

1210
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namaari!</font>

1211
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:15,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's finish this, Binturi.</font>

1212
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya!</font>

1213
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:51,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She cannot see us.</font>

1214
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya's blinded
by her own rage.</font>

1215
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:58,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gem's powers are fading!</font>

1216
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these people
are Druun food</font>

1217
01:20:01,844 --> 01:20:02,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we don't get them out.</font>

1218
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:09,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.</font>

1219
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:12,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stupid Druun! Out of my way!</font>

1220
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

1221
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up we go! Yep!</font>

1222
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:29,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go! Hurry!</font>

1223
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:32,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the water!
Keep going! Keep going!</font>

1224
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:38,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on!</font>

1225
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never meant
for any of this to happen.</font>

1226
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:27,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liar!</font>

1227
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:31,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care
if you believe me.</font>

1228
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:32,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu did.</font>

1229
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:35,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't trust her.</font>

1230
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:39,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why we're here.</font>

1231
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:41,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do whatever you want.</font>

1232
01:21:42,486 --> 01:21:45,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're as much to blame
for Sisu's death as I am.</font>

1233
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tong, there's still
people back there!</font>

1234
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry!
We're running out of time!</font>

1235
01:21:58,377 --> 01:21:59,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it!</font>

1236
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:01,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, out! Come with me!</font>

1237
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:38,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Tuk,
these are the last of 'em.</font>

1238
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! We're right behind you.</font>

1239
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:42,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuk Tuk!</font>

1240
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you waiting for? Go!</font>

1241
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:56,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya!</font>

1242
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the one who slayed Sisu!</font>

1243
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya! Raya!</font>

1244
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gem's magic,
it's almost gone!</font>

1245
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They aren't backing off!</font>

1246
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:19,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're everywhere!</font>

1247
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:46,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why
they chose me.</font>

1248
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could have been any of us.</font>

1249
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I know is I trusted them,</font>

1250
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:55,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they trusted me.</font>

1251
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:57,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so...</font>

1252
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone, give me your gems.</font>

1253
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can still put it together.
It can still work.</font>

1254
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:07,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu's gone, Raya!
We don't have her magic!</font>

1255
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:10,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about her magic.
It's about trust.</font>

1256
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1257
01:24:11,593 --> 01:24:14,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why it worked.
That's why we can do it, too.</font>

1258
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:17,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By doing the one thing
Sisu wanted us to do.</font>

1259
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:19,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What my Ba wanted us to do.</font>

1260
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:22,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To finally trust each other
and fix this.</font>

1261
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:26,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have to come together.</font>

1262
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:27,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1263
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:29,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After what she's done?</font>

1264
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll never trust her!</font>

1265
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:38,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then let me take
the first step.</font>

1266
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya! No!</font>

1267
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:14,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked! It worked!</font>

1268
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuk Tuk!</font>

1269
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:04,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1270
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pranee! Amba!</font>

1271
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:24,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jagan!</font>

1272
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:26,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pengu!</font>

1273
01:30:26,552 --> 01:30:28,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1274
01:31:00,252 --> 01:31:01,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raya.</font>

1275
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:03,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu.</font>

1276
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:07,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so hungry.</font>

1277
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:09,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got some jerky.</font>

1278
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:11,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that hungry.</font>

1279
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sisu!</font>

1280
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:26,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, it's good to breathe in
your glorious dragon stench again.</font>

1281
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:28,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I take that
as a compliment.</font>

1282
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma!</font>

1283
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My baby!</font>

1284
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:26,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, look, it's Boun!</font>

1285
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:29,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Boun!</font>

1286
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba?</font>

1287
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dewdrop?</font>

1288
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:20,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba!</font>

1289
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:38,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that really her?</font>

1290
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:46,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief Benja,
your daughter did you proud.</font>

1291
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:50,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you don't mind,
she brought some friends.</font>

1292
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:20,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ba?</font>

1293
01:34:21,203 --> 01:34:23,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Kumandra.</font>

1294
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:19,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a choice</font>

1295
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To build or destroy</font>

1296
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:26,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To fight or to come together</font>

1297
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:28,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love is a bridge</font>

1298
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:30,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And trust is a gift</font>

1299
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:36,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We give it
And it gets better</font>

1300
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:38,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an energy
in the water</font>

1301
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:41,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is magic
deep in our heart</font>

1302
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:43,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a legacy
that we honor</font>

1303
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we bring
the light to the dark</font>

1304
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:48,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever brings us together</font>

1305
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:50,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can never tear us apart</font>

1306
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:53,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We become stronger than ever</font>

1307

1317
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:17,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open up your heart and feel</font>

1318
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:22,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no difference
We're all family here</font>

1319
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:25,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Despite all of our doubts</font>

1320
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All our up and downs</font>

1321
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:33,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's never really
anything to fear</font>
