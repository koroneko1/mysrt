&lrm;Thanks for showing up!

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.900
&lrm;So, check this out.
&lrm;I've got the biggest scoop!

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.620
&lrm;But FYI, it's seriously hush hush.
&lrm;Top secret. Classified information.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.380
&lrm;-You know who Ladybug is?
&lrm;-No. But it's almost as hot.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.540
&lrm;Marinette is...

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.900
&lrm;Wait.
&lrm;Do you think this is such a good idea?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260
&lrm;I don't think it is. I know it is!

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.100
&lrm;But remember, girls,
&lrm;your lips are sealed. Got it?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.140
&lrm;Well, Marinette
&lrm;is head over heels for somebody!

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.620
&lrm;- Yeah. Adrien!
&lrm;- [laughter]

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.300
&lrm;-What? But how did you know?
&lrm;-Well, it is pretty obvious!

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.100
&lrm;So do you think...
&lrm;I mean... Adrien knows too?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.980
&lrm;No way.
&lrm;Boys never pick up on things like that.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.100
&lrm;Right. Let's get down to business.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.420
&lrm;Your mission,
&lrm;is to arrange a ridiculously romantic date

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.380
&lrm;- between Marinette and Adrien.
&lrm;- Oh, that's so sweet!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.300
&lrm;- Great!
&lrm;- Big time!

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.620
&lrm;We know we can always count on you,
&lrm;so you can count on us, too!

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.380
&lrm;- Aw, thanks, girls!
&lrm;- You're up, Marinette!

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.340
&lrm;Alya and I have come up with a plan.
&lrm;It's called "Operation Secret Garden"!

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580
&lrm;Excuse me, but why do we need a plan?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.860
&lrm;Can't Marinette just ask Adrien out?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.220
&lrm;[laughter]

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.100
&lrm;Seriously? This is Marinette
&lrm;we're talking about here!

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.020
&lrm;Now, each of you
&lrm;will have a code name based on a flower.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
&lrm;Alix you'll be "Violet",
&lrm;Mylène, you'll be "Sunflower",

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.900
&lrm;Juleka, you'll be "Rose",
&lrm;and Rose will be "Tulip."

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.100
&lrm;- Uh... Why isn't my name "Rose?"
&lrm;- Because "Rose" is your real name!

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.100
&lrm;It won't be a code name
&lrm;if we call you "Rose!"

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.460
&lrm;This afternoon, "Buttercup" has
&lrm;a photo shoot at the Trocadéro fountains.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.900
&lrm;- Adrien!
&lrm;- Ah!

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.420
&lrm;His security guard, aka "The Nanny",
&lrm;will be waiting for him in the car.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.380
&lrm;He's supposed to take Buttercup home,
&lrm;except that's not gonna happen!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.460
&lrm;This is where you guys come in!

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.220
&lrm;Step one, Rose will have a fake
&lrm;no-parking sign. She'll go over to...

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.060
&lrm;- Who's Rose again?
&lrm;- Me, of course!

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.420
&lrm;No, Rose, it's Juleka! You're Tulip!
&lrm;Violet, Sunflower, Rose, Tulip!

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.260
&lrm;- [sighs]
&lrm;- So, step one...

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.980
&lrm;Rose, you put the sign
&lrm;next to The Nanny's chariot.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.340
&lrm;Step two. Sunflower,
&lrm;you'll go and find a police officer

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.580
&lrm;and say to him,
&lrm;"Hello, Mr Police Officer!

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.460
&lrm;That car's parked illegally!"

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.180
&lrm;"You don't say!
&lrm;I'll enforce the law this second!

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.980
&lrm;Thank you, young lady!"

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.500
&lrm;[blows whistle]

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.340
&lrm;Oh! Grr!

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.060
&lrm;Step three. No more Nanny!
&lrm;Step four. Tigerlily will let us know

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.100
&lrm;as soon as Buttercup's done.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.340
&lrm;Tigerlily.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.340
&lrm;But instead of meeting back up
&lrm;with The Nanny, Adrien's going to find...

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.540
&lrm;Lotus!

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.260
&lrm;That's Marinette!

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.660
&lrm;But when Buttercup
&lrm;sees the chariot's gone,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.980
&lrm;he'll text his Nanny, won't he?

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.940
&lrm;Impossible. Buttercup always leaves
&lrm;his personal items in the car,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.540
&lrm;even his phone.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.100
&lrm;Such a professional!

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.100
&lrm;She knows everything about Adrien.
&lrm;Creepy, no?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.940
&lrm;Yeah! It's so romantic!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.900
&lrm;So, then...

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.340
&lrm;"Hey, Marinette."

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.980
&lrm;"What are you doing here?
&lrm;What a incredible, crazy, coincidence!"

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.380
&lrm;Now Tulip will give the signal
&lrm;to the rickshaw driver

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.180
&lrm;to come and park in the car spot.
&lrm;Then all I need to do is say to Adrien...

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.900
&lrm;Blblblblblblblb!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.540
&lrm;[laughter]

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.660
&lrm;You're right. That's usually how it goes.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.460
&lrm;But this time, I'm really ready.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.900
&lrm;I've got you guys with me.
&lrm;I'll do it, I promise!

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.300
&lrm;- You'll be great.
&lrm;- Yeah!

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.260
&lrm;So I say to him, "Since your car's
&lrm;not here, let's ride home together.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.260
&lrm;Look, there's a rickshaw, right here!"

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
&lrm;"Awesome idea, Marinette. I've always
&lrm;dreamed of going on a rickshaw with you!"

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.060
&lrm;We take a really romantic ride
&lrm;along the Seine

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.060
&lrm;and over the Pont des Arts bridge,
&lrm;where we run into André,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.700
&lrm;the sweethearts' ice-cream maker!

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.620
&lrm;Then Violet skates by
&lrm;and showers us with rose petals!

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.620
&lrm;It's gonna be perfect.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.380
&lrm;It's... it's... so beautiful!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.980
&lrm;Any questions?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.860
&lrm;- Which flower am I, again?
&lrm;- You're Rose.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.860
&lrm;- That's right, right?
&lrm;- Mmm-hmm.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.220
&lrm;- Yes!
&lrm;- Operation Secret Garden, here we come!

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.100
&lrm;Come on, more happy! The smile like you're
&lrm;smelling a delicious lunch in the kitchen!

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.940
&lrm;Ah! No, no! We need...

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.020
&lrm;A lollipop!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.260
&lrm;There!

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.300
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.220
&lrm;Now we have good taste! Mmm-hmm!

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.380
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.860
&lrm;No, August! Lollipops are not for babies!
&lrm;Your snack is a delicious bottle of milk!

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.420
&lrm;Are all the flowers planted?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.260
&lrm;Rose planted!

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.060
&lrm;Sunflower planted!

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.860
&lrm;Tulip planted!

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.220
&lrm;Perfect! Go, Rose!

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.900
&lrm;- Uh... Me?
&lrm;- No, the other Rose!

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.740
&lrm;- Hmm...
&lrm;- [chuckles]

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.020
&lrm;Huh? [gasps]

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.060
&lrm;- Um, you guys, I've got a problem.
&lrm;- Rose?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.620
&lrm;- Yeah? What?
&lrm;- It's stuck in the grate.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.860
&lrm;- Rose! Louder!
&lrm;- Yeah? What?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.380
&lrm;[both] Oh! Shh!

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.940
&lrm;Ugh!

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.540
&lrm;Uh-oh!

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.420
&lrm;- What's this fake sign made of?
&lrm;- Metal, like road signs are made of. Why?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.380
&lrm;Couldn't you have made it
&lrm;out of cardboard or something?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.220
&lrm;Go and get the police officer!

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.980
&lrm;Caution! Buttercup's photo shoot
&lrm;will be over soon!

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.220
&lrm;Ah, seriously? Enough with the chitchat.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.460
&lrm;I know you!
&lrm;You're in class with my daughter!

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.220
&lrm;Hello, sir...
&lrm;I just wanted to tell you something...

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.140
&lrm;Huh? Tell me about it!
&lrm;These pigeons are such a nuisance!

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.780
&lrm;- Huh?
&lrm;- Come on, Rose, do it now!

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.020
&lrm;OK!

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.580
&lrm;- Not you, Tulip! The other Rose!
&lrm;- [gasps] No, wait!

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.140
&lrm;Come on, Rose, you can do it!

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.700
&lrm;- Illegally parked car!
&lrm;- Hmm?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.500
&lrm;Yes!

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.660
&lrm;Oh!

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.460
&lrm;Thank you, young lady!

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.820
&lrm;Great job, Rose!

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.140
&lrm;No! Look at me! Give me your best smile!

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.300
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.460
&lrm;No, August, Mummy told you already.
&lrm;You're too young for lollipops!

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.580
&lrm;That poor lady.
&lrm;She could really use a hand!

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.700
&lrm;If you do that, Adrien will see you!

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.020
&lrm;Oh, here we go, honey.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.420
&lrm;Sir! Move this vehicle right away.
&lrm;This is a no-parking zone!

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.820
&lrm;Grr!

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.900
&lrm;Move it, move it, move it!

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.380
&lrm;- Hey, watch it!
&lrm;- He's right, be careful!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.300
&lrm;U-turn, please!

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.500
&lrm;Mmm-hmm.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.340
&lrm;Bravo, girls! Step two, commence!

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.580
&lrm;Eh?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.940
&lrm;Grr! Grr!

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.660
&lrm;Seating! Perfect! Hold it right there!

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.980
&lrm;Lotus! Uh... Marinette! Stay here!

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.020
&lrm;Hello, ma'am! Hello, little baby!

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.500
&lrm;Thank you so much!

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.540
&lrm;All right, have a good day!

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.380
&lrm;Look out! Buttercup's on the move!

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.580
&lrm;Sorry!

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.180
&lrm;- Here you go.
&lrm;- Thank you!

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.100
&lrm;You're welcome! Bye!

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.260
&lrm;Red alert! The Nanny's back!

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.780
&lrm;- Um...
&lrm;- Yes?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.500
&lrm;Hey, you, Mister! Over there!
&lrm;You've asked for it!

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.220
&lrm;Here are fines for a parking violation,
&lrm;non-compliance with orders

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.500
&lrm;and for infuriating
&lrm;a usually cheerful police officer!

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.140
&lrm;A man who takes his work very seriously,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.980
&lrm;whose blood is boiled
&lrm;by the slightest shortfall...

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.940
&lrm;That's what I call
&lrm;an easy target for my dear akumas.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.660
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him!

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.300
&lrm;[wailing baby]

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.660
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.380
&lrm;You're being quite stubborn today, August!

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.820
&lrm;What happened? His emotions just vanished!

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.420
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop! Lollipop!

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.500
&lrm;This wasn't what I had in mind.
&lrm;But, why not, after all?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.140
&lrm;What could be
&lrm;more emotionally powerful than a baby

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.500
&lrm;throwing a giant temper tantrum?

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.900
&lrm;Gigantitan, I am Hawk Moth.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.020
&lrm;Hawk-mo?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.980
&lrm;No... Not Haw-mo.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.860
&lrm;Just Hawk Moth. Well...
&lrm;You're going to be... big and strong,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.020
&lrm;and you'll get to do... whatever you want!

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.260
&lrm;But in return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.540
&lrm;- Lollipop?
&lrm;- Not lollipop! Miraculous. Mi-ra-cu-lous!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.860
&lrm;- My little baby!
&lrm;- Lollipop!

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.660
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.940
&lrm;Kids these days, they grow up so fast.
&lrm;Am I right?

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.540
&lrm;- It's a baby!
&lrm;- Whoa! Don't blink now! Come on!

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.820
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.100
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.420
&lrm;Ah!

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.780
&lrm;- August!
&lrm;- Stay out of danger, ma'am!

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.420
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon
&lrm;and save your little August!

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.300
&lrm;Oh!
&lrm;I was just about to take a cheese break!

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.940
&lrm;Oh, don't be such a baby, Plagg!
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.060
&lrm;Girls, where is Lotus?

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.340
&lrm;Marinette, where is she?

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.780
&lrm;Hey, look!

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.340
&lrm;[screaming]

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.420
&lrm;Well, you're the biggest
&lrm;rug rat I've ever seen!

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.460
&lrm;Kitty!

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.940
&lrm;Let's go splish-splash, Megababy!

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.780
&lrm;You can't catch me!

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.380
&lrm;Let's get our feet nice and wet.
&lrm;But we can't squish anyone, OK?

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.340
&lrm;Lure him where there's nothing to destroy.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.140
&lrm;Nice move, Cat Noir!

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.660
&lrm;Looks like
&lrm;that romantic outing is on hold.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.580
&lrm;We'll be pausing
&lrm;for an epic battle instead.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.820
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.620
&lrm;Lolli...

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.060
&lrm;Well, hey there, kitty-cat!

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.500
&lrm;I see you're not much
&lrm;of a natural with kids.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.540
&lrm;Are you kidding?
&lrm;We were just playing a fun game of tag!

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.820
&lrm;The akuma's probably in his bracelet.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.020
&lrm;Gigantitan,
&lrm;watch out for the very naughty Ladybug!

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.620
&lrm;Whoa! How about that?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.340
&lrm;You're not a natural with kids either!
&lrm;Nice flying!

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.780
&lrm;Ha, ha! For your information, I've never
&lrm;babysat anything heavier than ten tons!

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.740
&lrm;Kitty!

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.740
&lrm;Yes!

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.740
&lrm;Ah! No!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.780
&lrm;Change of plans. To calm a baby down
&lrm;just put him in a playpen!

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.180
&lrm;Where are we gonna find
&lrm;a playpen his size?

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.100
&lrm;The Eiffel Tower! We'll pen him up
&lrm;in there with my yoyo,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.980
&lrm;sing him some lullabies...

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.260
&lrm;We can read him a bedtime story,
&lrm;make cooing noises... Coo! Coo!

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.220
&lrm;Then, when he's getting sleepy, bam!

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.220
&lrm;You'll destroy his bracelet!

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.580
&lrm;Interesting idea, Milady.
&lrm;But how are we going to get him there?

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.660
&lrm;Don't you have a simpler plan?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.180
&lrm;If this is too complicated,
&lrm;just copy what I do!

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.780
&lrm;- Yoo-hoo!
&lrm;- Over here, little guy!

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.980
&lrm;Once we get him in his playpen,
&lrm;I'll sing him a lullaby.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.100
&lrm;- We don't want to burst his eardrums!
&lrm;- What? I have a great voice, you know!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.980
&lrm;I'll miaow you a serenade
&lrm;one of these days.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.860
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.940
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.100
&lrm;- Hey! Hey, over here!
&lrm;- We're here!

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.540
&lrm;Big baby!

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.340
&lrm;We're losing him, Cat Noir!

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.260
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.260
&lrm;[crying]

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.940
&lrm;[honking]

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.100
&lrm;- Vroom!
&lrm;- Gah!

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.940
&lrm;Vroom, vroom!

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.140
&lrm;I loved playing with cars
&lrm;when I was a kid, too!

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.220
&lrm;Look! He's going to his playpen
&lrm;all by himself! Good job, Kitty!

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.980
&lrm;No! Stop playing!
&lrm;Attack the kittycat and Ladybug!

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.700
&lrm;Vroom!

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.140
&lrm;Oh, no!

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.820
&lrm;Here we go!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.020
&lrm;[whistles]

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.620
&lrm;Hurry! Use your cataclysm on his bracelet!

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.540
&lrm;At your command, Milady!

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.540
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.780
&lrm;Whoa!

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.140
&lrm;[groans] Did she take
&lrm;the rickshaw ride with Adrien or not?

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.420
&lrm;[screams]

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.380
&lrm;I hear your ice-cream's the best in Paris!

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.380
&lrm;Uh... thank you, Cat Noir!

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.540
&lrm;Turn around! Look at the mean Ladybug!
&lrm;Grab her!

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.660
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.820
&lrm;Hey, silly baby!
&lrm;This isn't a delicious lollipop!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.900
&lrm;- Ah!
&lrm;- Supersize!

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.740
&lrm;- Hold on tight, Ladybug!
&lrm;- Thanks, girls!

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.620
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.740
&lrm;No! Don't let the ladybug get away!
&lrm;Argh!

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.980
&lrm;Quick! We don't have much time left!

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.980
&lrm;OK. Enough with complicated plans!

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.300
&lrm;Sometimes it's best to get to the point!

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.580
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.420
&lrm;- Gift wrap?
&lrm;- Great!

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.660
&lrm;Now figure something out
&lrm;so we can "wrap this up!"

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.100
&lrm;Got it!

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.540
&lrm;Girls, I can't do it any more. Run!

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.060
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.540
&lrm;[crying]

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.900
&lrm;Who wants a nice tasty lollipop?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.620
&lrm;Lollipop!

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.660
&lrm;You've heard of the Trojan horse?
&lrm;Now meet the Parisian lollipop!

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.420
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.620
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.540
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.980
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.940
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.020
&lrm;- Kitty!
&lrm;- OK,

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.420
&lrm;you are a natural with babies, after all!

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.300
&lrm;- August!
&lrm;- Mama!

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.380
&lrm;We gotta get going! Bye-bye, little guy!

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.340
&lrm;Thank you, Cat Noir. Thank you, Ladybug.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.420
&lrm;Thank you!

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.260
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir! Gigantitan
&lrm;may not have been big enough for the job,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.940
&lrm;but I promise my next villain
&lrm;will be more than you can handle!

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.140
&lrm;- Hey, guys!
&lrm;- [laughter]

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.300
&lrm;- Marinette!
&lrm;- I was so worried about you!

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.020
&lrm;I was worried too.
&lrm;I looked all over for you guys!

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.900
&lrm;- I'm so glad everything worked out OK!
&lrm;- Except for your date with Adrien.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.380
&lrm;- Oh, yeah, where did he go?
&lrm;- Oh! There he is!

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.540
&lrm;- Maybe we can finish the job, after all.
&lrm;- Awesome!

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.460
&lrm;No. No more complicated plans!

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.460
&lrm;Sometimes it's best
&lrm;to just get straight to the point!

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.620
&lrm;Adrien!

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.900
&lrm;Marinette, what are you doing here?

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.820
&lrm;- Is she going to do it?
&lrm;- It's just like a romantic movie!

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.220
&lrm;I came here to sketch!
&lrm;I can't believe we've run into each other!

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.380
&lrm;- Hey, would you like to... ?
&lrm;- [honking]

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.420
&lrm;Hang pout, I mean, hang about?
&lrm;No... hag out?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.540
&lrm;[honking]

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.380
&lrm;Oh, forget it!
&lrm;Better not keep your guard waiting.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.100
&lrm;Uh... OK.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.300
&lrm;But we could take you home, if you wanted?

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.300
&lrm;No, it's OK.
&lrm;I'll take a cole slaw home, thanks!

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.540
&lrm;OK... Enjoy your meal, then!
&lrm;See you at school tomorrow!

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.620
&lrm;Why did I say no? I'm so lame! I could
&lrm;have ridden home with him, in his car!

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.740
&lrm;At least you got a sentence out
&lrm;without losing your cool!

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.780
&lrm;- One sentence out of three. Not bad!
&lrm;- You'll get there in the end!

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.900
&lrm;- Sure will.
&lrm;- Thanks, girls!

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.860
&lrm;Don't tell me "Buttercup" left
&lrm;the flowerbed with the Nanny.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.580
&lrm;Yup! But it's all good! Come on, BFF,
&lrm;let's take a ride on the "cole slaw!"

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.420
&lrm;- Please tell me I didn't say that!
&lrm;- Yeah!

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.220
&lrm;[laughing]
