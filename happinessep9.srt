1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,677
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,555
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,487
The building representative
took Mr. Kim out,

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,113
and they both seemed weird…

5
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,076
Hi.

6
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,872
Mr. Kim.

7
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,665
Hey.

8
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,255
Are you thirsty too?

9
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,509
Don't you dare mess with her.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,678
If you have anything to say, talk to me.

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,015
You too, Mr. Kim.

12
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,062
Sae-bom, we should look for the infected.

13
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,606
They might not know
if they've been infected or not.

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,235
Detective, stand up straight.
You're restoring order.

15
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,783
This house still has lots of food
and drinking water left.

16
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,577
We'll be staying home,

17
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,622
so please stop this and leave.

18
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,207
Right now.

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,003
I'm running out of patience.

20
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,005
Look at her, glaring at me.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,550
Come on. Aim your gun at her!

22
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,533
That guy really is nuts.

23
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
Look here.

24
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,789
Are you looking for something?

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,583
What should I get you?

26
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,670
I was just…

27
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,882
It doesn't seem like a newlyweds' home.

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,550
It does without you here.

29
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,764
By the way, we shouldn't let
the kid stay here, should we?

30
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,558
What if she gets bitten by you two?

31
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,269
Then where should she go to?
To your house?

32
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,437
That's an option.

33
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,188
I'm good at babysitting.

34
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,065
I can tutor her too.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,447
You're here to find the drugs, right?
The drug that gives you Mad Human Disease.

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,829
Give me that, hide in here and keep quiet.

37
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,706
Then I'll let you live here.

38
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,541
What are you going to do with it?

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,919
Your previous plan
to infect everyone failed.

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,173
I thought about it,

41
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,800
and my wife came back to life
because she took that drug,

42
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,719
even though her head was crushed.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,763
When I'm in danger,
I'll take that drug too.

44
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,015
Then there's no possibility of dying

45
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,018
from excessive bleeding
after getting bitten by those monsters.

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,730
I can get the disease without any pain.

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,441
-Aren't you scared of the disease?
-What's so bad about it?

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,070
I won't fear anything if I get it.

49
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,407
Mister, this isn't some narcotic.

50
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,926
What were you doing there?

51
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,262
Weren't you on the third floor?

52
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,598
I got permission from the detective
at Unit 501 and moved there.

53
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,643
Is something the matter?

54
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,355
We heard the people
from that house got the disease.

55
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,401
Did they not try to bite you, like this?

56
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,528
No, they didn't.

57
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,827
Honey, did they really get the disease?

58
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,789
You'll be responsible for everything
that happens afterward.

59
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,295
Now, all of you who are here,
let's gather and talk.

60
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,216
We need to discuss
what to do with Unit 501.

61
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,634
Everyone!

62
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,929
Go have a meeting
at the building representative's house.

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,473
It's totally empty. There's nothing there!

64
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,601
It'll still have a lot of space
even if everyone here

65
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,396
all goes in there, right?

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,481
Detective!

67
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,570
Sae-bom, what's wrong with you?

68
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,908
Sae-bom, take a deep breath and relax.

69
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,121
Goodbye.

70
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,873
Let's go inside.

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,465
Sae-bom.

72
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,719
Are you okay?

73
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
Aren't you thirsty?

74
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm really disappointed in you.

75
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,235
The building representative's house
sounds like a good spot.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,905
And we'll get to see the royal floor too.

77
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,451
Yes, our unit was too shabby
to have valuable guests like you people.

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,871
We're not done cleaning the house yet.

79
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,123
That doesn't matter.

80
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,751
The building representative's house
sounds nice.

81
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,086
Let's go, then.

82
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,212
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

83
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,715
Come, let's go.

84
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,261
Are you okay?

85
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,807
Do you think I'd wish
for Sae-bom to get the disease?

86
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,476
I was just worried. You saw it too.
That scar on her hand…

87
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,312
That really is nothing, Jung-kook.
It's just a wound.

88
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,607
You're worrying about nothing.

89
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,530
Yi-hyun, you go inside first.

90
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,574
I'll make sure to guard this place.

91
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,911
When nothing happens
even after a few days,

92
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm sure they won't be worried anymore.

93
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,335
Jung-kook, be careful.

94
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,255
You must never trust those people.

95
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,883
This house is really far off.

96
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,969
It really is.

97
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,679
I know, right?

98
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,849
The royal floor has its weaknesses too.

99
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,310
I sacrificed myself
and went down all the time.

100
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,855
Next time, let's just talk down there.

101
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:24,861
There's nothing here.
Do you really live here?

102
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,865
By the way, this could get you charged
a lot for cleaning.

103
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
Why does a pastor drink so much?

104
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,328
More than that,
what should we do with the infected?

105
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,915
You all saw Ms. Yoon's reaction, right?

106
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,376
She can break in anytime at this rate.

107
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,713
Remember what the lawyer said?
Emergency evacuation.

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,799
But I don't see him today.

109
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,051
I'll tell you.

110
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,306
It's hard to apply that article
because it's their house,

111
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,600
and the disease did not occur yet.

112
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,186
Right, they didn't cause
any harm or anything.

113
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:04,275
I have evidence that the female
cop on the fifth floor is infected.

114
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,237
It may be better
to just kick her out of there.

115
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,615
Human beings tend to be strangely brave

116
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,075
when they have nothing
or nobody to back them up.

117
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,829
The disease occurs when they drink water.

118
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,039
The water in that house…

119
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,374
Wouldn't it be more dangerous
if it's there?

120
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
Right.

121
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,505
They have a lot of water,
but we can't just throw it away.

122
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,468
The lockdown is getting longer
and everyone must be having difficulties.

123
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,514
So let's share them equally
among all the residents.

124
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,350
Seriously…

125
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,524
They're all so mean.

126
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,777
But they're not bad people.

127
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,363
It's just because they're scared.

128
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,492
-Is the man at Unit 601 scared too?
-Except for him.

129
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,912
Don't go near him, and don't talk to him.

130
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,538
Treat him like he doesn't exist.

131
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,040
-Don't even look at him.
-Right.

132
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,417
But how can Mr. Kim do that to us?

133
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,295
We've known each other
for more than ten years.

134
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,548
I'm not trying to defend him,

135
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,926
but he has been away from home
for a long time now.

136
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,012
He must be worried and
miss his wife very much.

137
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,098
You know I score people, right?

138
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,683
Points for doing good things,

139
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,434
and deductions for doing bad things.

140
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,563
Mr. Kim has reached minus now.

141
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,483
Give some of my points to him.
I'm sure I have a lot of points.

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,236
I'm above zero, right?

143
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,131
The detective went up.

144
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,008
Went up to where?

145
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,802
People are upstairs,
planning to kick you two out.

146
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,179
I told him that, and he went up.

147
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,103
Kick us out to where?

148
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,606
Outside. They're also planning
to take your water and food.

149
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,489
Stay here with Seo-yoon.

150
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,116
Sae-bom!

151
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,035
Yoon Sae-bom! Stay calm!

152
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,330
Are you worried?

153
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,458
Not about Sae-bom…

154
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,668
but about the others.

155
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,675
She's a public official,
so if she bites someone,

156
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,011
she'll lose her house.
You all know it, don't you?

157
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,847
Sae-bom was so happy to live
in an apartment!

158
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,558
You live in the same apartment.
Why are you doing this?

159
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,147
Sae-bom, why are you here?

160
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,649
I'll explain everything,
so you go home first.

161
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,402
Detective, what are you doing?
She's holding a knife!

162
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,823
What were you all talking about?

163
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,465
What? Are you going to shoot?
And kill us all?

164
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,385
Hey, Sae-bom. Calm down.

165
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,678
It's okay, just let her be!

166
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,098
She doesn't even have the guts to shoot!
Go ahead and shoot!

167
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,536
Police officers always
leave the first round empty.

168
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,332
Now what are you going to do?

169
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,253
Are you going to scare us
and live here, infected?

170
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,381
I just came here because I got angry.

171
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:02,721
Since we're all here anyway,
should we look for the infected?

172
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,225
Is there a way?

173
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,896
I'm sure you all know
that the infected feel thirsty.

174
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,065
So what would happen
if they see human blood

175
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,651
after holding it in
and hiding their thirst?

176
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,902
Where's the blood?

177
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,739
Here.

178
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,174
Darn it.

179
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,384
It's okay.

180
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,298
She quieted down a moment ago.

181
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,718
What should we do now?

182
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,011
We must wait for now,

183
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,514
until she's able to communicate.

184
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,520
Since Mr. Kim is here,
let's go up and get you treated.

185
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,109
The smell of blood will only
make it harder for Bo-ram.

186
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,363
You stay here.

187
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,708
We have to find out
if she got bitten or took drugs.

188
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,085
Okay, I'll ask her later.

189
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,296
Hey.

190
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,094
Let's hurry. It'll be serious
if you get a bacterial infection.

191
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,637
Calm down, okay?

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,848
I have a strong immune system.

193
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,520
Ms. Lee is moving.

194
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,524
I'll go up alone,
so you go ahead in there.

195
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,861
I know how to do simple first aid.

196
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,487
I just need to stop the bleeding.

197
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,366
Put ointment on,
and cover it with a new towel.

198
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,285
Put your hand up high,

199
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,038
and lie down.

200
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,640
Give me some water too, please.

201
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,141
That scared the crap out of me.

202
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,602
This isn't yours!

203
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,651
All of you should go now.

204
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,987
This is not the right time
for a discussion.

205
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,660
Honey, let's go.

206
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,335
You're all still here.

207
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,670
What is it now?

208
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,882
You can't just go.
Sae-bom went through all that trouble.

209
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,841
Gosh.

210
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,969
We must find everyone infected
until the end.

211
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,680
Mr. Oh, we don't know
if you're infected, either.

212
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,598
Don't you think so?

213
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,520
You too, building representative.

214
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,613
I'm going in.

215
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,536
You should get out now.

216
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,205
I might change again soon.

217
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:43,419
Don't worry. You came back to normal,
so it won't happen again for a while.

218
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,342
I'm here to talk
about something important.

219
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,014
We must find out where you got infected.

220
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,516
We need to be prepared.

221
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,644
Did you…

222
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,065
get drugs from the gym, by any chance?

223
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,236
I got infected at the supermarket.

224
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,199
I think I got my leg scratched
when I hid from the infected.

225
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:30,090
I was scared that they wouldn't
let me into the apartment if I told them.

226
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,595
No one's going to come here,
so get some rest.

227
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,849
Thank you.

228
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,643
If it wasn't for you,

229
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,646
I would have bitten someone.

230
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,024
You don't know that.

231
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,447
Perhaps you would've been able
to hold it in, without biting anyone.

232
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,913
Did you throw away a bloody towel
by the emergency stairs?

233
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,164
In a trash bag?

234
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,251
No, that wasn't me.

235
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,889
Why? Is something out there?

236
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,059
I hear something from outside.

237
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,812
From the golf course.

238
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,735
Isn't Mr. Na there?

239
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,747
You…

240
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:49,044
just need to say the woman
on the fifth floor seems infected.

241
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,298
What?

242
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,176
I think I heard something from over there.

243
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,096
No one would come down
when there's an infected here.

244
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,314
Do you play golf?

245
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,358
Just screen golf, occasionally.

246
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,237
Then you can practice comfortably here.

247
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,906
You get out as a single player.

248
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,337
When the cure is out,
you should get a shot and go home safely.

249
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,717
Your family won't like it if they find out
that you got Mad Human Disease.

250
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,762
Is it because of the woman
on the fifth floor?

251
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,515
Because she's in the SOU?

252
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
I was in the military too. The KATUSA.

253
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,356
And I was in
the National Guard in Kentucky.

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,194
I could tell straight away. She's nothing.

255
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,362
Are you sure?

256
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,366
Are you sure you were in the army?

257
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,994
I was a military chaplain.

258
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,999
You should go home now.
I'm sure your wife is quite shocked.

259
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,967
Leave the golf club here.

260
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,647
When you go downstairs,
explain the situation to others,

261
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,273
and be careful of each other.

262
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,776
-And always meet in groups.
-Okay.

263
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,781
You've done so much.

264
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,663
You should be careful
not to get infected too.

265
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,874
Don't worry. I'm always careful.

266
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,251
Change your pants when you get home.

267
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,586
I think they're wet.

268
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,633
Please go so I can be alone.

269
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,970
You should stay home for a while too.

270
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,805
It might have an incubation period.

271
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,043
Honey.

272
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,921
What's going on?

273
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,764
-What are you doing?
-I saw blood.

274
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,433
The couple from the fifth floor
did something crazy again.

275
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,145
I need to gather the residents again.

276
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:40,108
This time, we will get rid
of the infected inside for good.

277
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,789
Where have you been?

278
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,542
You said you'd stay home.

279
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,755
I did. With my hand up, and lying in bed.

280
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,804
But I got a better idea on my way up.

281
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,061
Let's see how much better that idea was.

282
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,773
Listen, okay?

283
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,525
Since I bled anyway,

284
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,277
I thought it'd be better
to find more infected people…

285
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,949
So did you find them? The infected?

286
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,577
No.

287
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,163
I mean, that's a good thing…

288
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,585
But this is not good.

289
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,005
You can put ointment on it.

290
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,340
It will heal soon.

291
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,092
Let's go inside.

292
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,975
What are you doing there?

293
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,275
I was too ashamed to see you guys.

294
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,070
I was gullible,
so I just caused trouble for you…

295
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,073
I'll just stay on the second floor
or in the gym.

296
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,910
I can't face Seo-yoon, either.

297
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,580
Forget it. Hurry up and come inside.

298
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,290
We have to treat Yi-hyun's wound.

299
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,170
Mr. Kim.

300
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,132
Cheer up.

301
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,093
From now on,
tell us if you have any concerns.

302
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,308
Don't betray us.

303
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,268
That was…

304
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,438
That was my first time betraying anyone.

305
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:42,939
Jeez.

306
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,614
-Let's go inside.
-Right.

307
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,741
Thanks.

308
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,535
Hey.

309
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,831
I promise to live a good life.

310
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,006
Come on, let's go inside.

311
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,351
Mister, are you badly hurt?

312
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,228
No, it's just a scratch.

313
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,105
Not by the infected. By a knife.

314
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,734
-Hey…
-I just cut myself.

315
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,613
Seo-yoon, he needs to be treated,
so let's wait outside.

316
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,864
-I harmed myself…
-Hey.

317
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,992
Sit here.

318
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,630
How could you suddenly cause such trouble

319
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,008
when you seemed totally fine?

320
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
What could I have done?

321
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,346
Just watch you do it yourself

322
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,598
and compliment you
for making a nice, clean cut?

323
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,433
You and I are not the same.

324
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,437
I would've made a small cut,
for just a few drops.

325
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,191
You only needed to scare them,
not cover the place with your blood.

326
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,318
It's because I'm passionate.

327
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,155
I only bled a bit.
My blood vessels are all fine, look.

328
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,366
Do I look that dumb?

329
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,507
See? It's fine.

330
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,262
It's not?

331
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,391
Will my hand be damaged forever?

332
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,940
It won't need stitches.

333
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,860
Okay.

334
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,529
Don't do this next time.

335
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,364
I feel sick seeing you hurt.

336
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,366
My stomach doesn't feel good.

337
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,952
I don't think I can eat dinner.

338
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,370
Same for me.

339
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,291
All those people were staring at you

340
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,543
and you held up a knife,
trying to cut yourself.

341
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,171
-So how could I just stand there?
-Then what about me?

342
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,507
It's okay for me to do this,
but you shouldn't do it.

343
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,135
-Why?
-Just don't do it when I say so.

344
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,099
Don't overreact.

345
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,698
She's infected. Why is she still there?

346
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,949
Be quiet.

347
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,660
You said that she is infected.

348
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,206
Is she really tied up?

349
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,167
Can you move aside?

350
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,516
I'll take her, so you wrap up
the situation here.

351
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,704
Damn it.

352
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,708
Where do you want to go?
There's space in the golf course.

353
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,587
I feel stuffy.
I'd like to go to an open place.

354
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,965
Okay.

355
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,351
Everyone who can come is all here.

356
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,978
The 15th floor guy never joins us,

357
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,481
and the family on the third floor
said they'll just stay home.

358
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,233
The pastor isn't here.

359
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,819
He said he's not feeling well.

360
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,947
-Make sure to check if he's infected too.
-What did you say?

361
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,492
Please calm down.

362
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,912
The cleaning lady isn't here, either.
By any chance…

363
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,664
Is she at your house?

364
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,666
No, she isn't at our house.

365
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,126
Didn't she go to the basement?

366
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,044
There's an employee lounge there.

367
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,338
Let's not drag this and find the infected.

368
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,799
You said they go insane
when they see blood.

369
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,472
I am not infected. I'm serious.

370
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,516
Detective, please speed it up…

371
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,061
-Get me a cup.
-Okay.

372
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,022
Well then…

373
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,445
Mr. Lawyer, you can do this yourself.
We have a knife too.

374
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,115
Fill half the cup,
like during a urine test.

375
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,495
Come on, that's what
a police officer should do.

376
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,080
You're already wounded too.

377
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes, he's right.

378
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,626
You want me to open my wound again?

379
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,045
The police are not blood donors.

380
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,005
Anyone who wants to do it can do it.

381
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,386
No one?

382
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,276
Would this be enough?

383
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,114
Stop the bleeding.

384
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,243
Do you all feel relieved now?

385
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,579
Here.

386
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,000
If there's anyone infected here…

387
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,171
there may be a sign, don't you think?

388
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,687
Seriously…

389
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,230
Come here.

390
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,067
Be careful.

391
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,736
Look at it straight.

392
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,408
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

393
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,621
So, none of us here are infected, right?

394
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,040
Right.

395
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,544
Now then, let's discuss food.

396
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,338
I heard you people
are trying to make a killing.

397
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,507
You were demanding ridiculous
amounts of money.

398
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,925
What do you mean, ridiculous?

399
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,677
Demand and supply. Capitalism.

400
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,306
You live in such fancy apartments,
and you can't even pay that much?

401
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,267
You're being rude.
Why are you talking down to us?

402
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,394
I didn't talk rudely!

403
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,563
You just talked rudely, again!

404
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,274
And what do you know about capitalism?

405
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,026
WONJUNG DORMITORY

406
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,862
A new variant has been confirmed
among severe patients.

407
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,946
How is it different?

408
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,741
It can control the timing
of the occurrence.

409
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,743
It suppresses the thirst most of the time,

410
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:55,246
and it occurs only when it's convinced
that it won't get caught.

411
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,333
This disease is as cunning as humans.

412
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,587
The authorities want follow-up measures,

413
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,548
but it's difficult to secure those
infected with the variant.

414
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,051
How's his current condition?

415
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,012
We injected a tranquilizer cocktail.

416
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,515
It would keep him in
a normal state for ten minutes,

417
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,645
but he has a high chance of
being unable to recover ever again.

418
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
Ten minutes would be enough.

419
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,530
How have you been?

420
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,411
I'm a bit late. I had a lot
of work to do because of you.

421
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,084
The funeral went well.

422
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,298
Some cried when they heard
you volunteered for the clinical test.

423
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,930
When everything's over, you might
receive a Medal of National Merit.

424
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,600
Your children were crying a lot.

425
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,480
You didn't tell them the account number
for your slush fund, did you?

426
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,482
Do you think it'll end like this?

427
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,527
Of course, it won't.
We still have a lot of tests to conduct.

428
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,861
The authorities…

429
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,616
are all getting you to make
the dirty decisions, aren't they?

430
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:18,204
Do you think you'll become someone big
if you hold out until the cure is out?

431
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,165
That won't happen.

432
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,503
Once the hunt is over,
the hounds become useless.

433
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,134
Your wife, your kid…

434
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,055
They will all become like me.

435
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,314
You have five minutes left

436
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,567
to speak with sanity.

437
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,361
The hound…

438
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,701
If I secure the cure…

439
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,871
who do you think
would be treated as the hound?

440
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,460
What about Ms. Yoon's blood analysis?

441
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,087
The result will be out tomorrow
at the earliest.

442
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,173
You need severe patients with the variant?

443
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,090
Yes.

444
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,886
They hide their thirst well,
and we can't tell just by looking.

445
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,139
And we can't neglect
those who are already infected

446
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,599
until they get the variant.

447
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,018
Seyang Forest.

448
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,815
A lot of severe patients are there.

449
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,363
It's been ten days since the lockdown.

450
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,866
That means there might have been
enough mutations.

451
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,580
Is that why you insisted on the lockdown?

452
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,125
To track down the mutation of the virus?

453
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,295
We have to find out
how the virus mutates in a natural state.

454
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,341
So it's like a petri dish
containing a collection of germs.

455
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,637
And you must've thought
that an antibody may have formed,

456
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,930
if you were lucky.

457
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,684
Make a small opening,
just enough for one person to squeeze out.

458
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,937
Then the infected
will come out on their own,

459
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,480
so catch and study them.

460
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,706
Did you tell your husband
before you came here?

461
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,043
I have a favor to ask.

462
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,215
Do you have items needed
for outdoor survival?

463
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,385
And can you please give me
some water and food too?

464
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,722
It's not for me.
There's someone on the rooftop.

465
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,020
Stay here for a while.

466
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,022
I'll keep all the doors blocked.

467
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,275
Thank you so much.

468
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,361
I brought some water and food.

469
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,575
I'll go get some more from my house.

470
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,451
Please don't bring any water.

471
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,704
The more I drink it, the thirstier I get.

472
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,164
It's better to just wet my lips a bit.

473
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,042
The cooler…

474
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,795
You didn't drink water then, right?

475
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,719
I didn't.

476
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,681
Who else didn't drink water there?

477
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,019
I only put a small amount of water in it.

478
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,647
Drink the water in small amounts,
and tell me if you feel thirsty.

479
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,323
I'll untie you while you eat…

480
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,782
Don't come near me.

481
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,624
When someone gets closer,
my thirst gets worse.

482
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,294
I'm okay. I'll just eat like this.

483
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,176
Were you okay yesterday?

484
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,012
I heard the pastor on
the 12th floor came here.

485
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,972
Didn't you have a long talk with him?

486
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,475
But…

487
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,979
I didn't want to attack him.

488
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,150
Looks like the disease
is choosy about people.

489
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,779
Even mosquitoes bite
only one person out of many people.

490
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:24,242
Jung-kook, you said that the infected
did not attack the pastor?

491
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,870
He's very religious.

492
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,872
He has spiritual powers.

493
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,173
Our Father in heaven,

494
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,468
hallowed be your name,

495
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,971
your kingdom come,

496
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,228
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

497
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,607
Give us today our daily bread,

498
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,611
daily bread, daily…

499
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,500
You still haven't cleaned the blood?

500
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,880
Did you find any other infected?

501
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,922
Not yet.

502
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,676
I need to go to the 3rd floor
and the 15th floor too.

503
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,970
It'll be nice to say

504
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,473
that I protected the apartment,
don't you think?

505
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,983
It's blood. We need something
to catch the infected with.

506
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,237
It's from that guy on the second floor
who keeps his face covered,

507
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,198
but he's weird too.

508
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,539
Bite me if you want to.

509
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,376
What?

510
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,754
I said, did I lose my hair?

511
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,005
A little bit.

512
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,424
What?

513
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,510
Really?

514
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,845
Darn it!

515
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,076
Where am I missing my hair the most?

516
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,036
No, I think you're fine.

517
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,627
Hey.

518
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,045
How's Bo-ram?

519
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,171
She's fine.

520
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,091
More than that, the water from the cooler…

521
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,259
Yes?

522
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,885
The pastor didn't drink it.

523
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,512
I thought of that too.

524
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,556
The infected didn't bite the pastor.

525
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,683
Right? It's a cult.

526
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,935
-Isn't it weird?
-Let's go and check.

527
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,979
The purpose of the virus
is to spread the disease.

528
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,731
So they stop drinking blood
when the victim is infected.

529
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,568
Would the infected bite each other
when they're together?

530
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,570
-They wouldn't.
-Right?

531
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,197
It makes sense to not feel
the thirst for each other.

532
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,782
Then the pastor is also…

533
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,244
We have to go check.

534
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,429
This is just a misunderstanding.

535
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,848
Yeon-ok, let's…

536
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,852
Let's talk face to face, okay?

537
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,105
Why would I do that, you jerk?

538
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,858
When did you get infected?

539
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,986
Seung-beom gave me drugs.

540
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,157
There must have been something in them.

541
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,243
Then you should've told me!

542
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,623
If I told you,
you wouldn't have forgiven me!

543
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,918
I tried to hold it in too.

544
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,796
I tried drinking my own blood,

545
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,549
but it's no use.

546
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,478
The thirst only gets worse.

547
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,357
This is hard for me too!

548
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,736
Should I just go down to the gym?

549
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,705
Woo-chang, it's been so hard for us.

550
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,583
If they find out about your disease,

551
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,253
I won't be able to become
the resident representative.

552
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,380
We can't just give up like this!

553
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,382
Then what should we do?

554
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,970
If you stay in your room,
I will give you food.

555
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,930
Okay?

556
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,808
Let's just tell them that you're sick.

557
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,269
If you wait for a few days,
the soldiers will come.

558
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,563
Just hang in there. Can you do that?

559
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,149
Honey.

560
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,026
Woo-chang?

561
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,155
Woo-chang!

562
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,970
Anybody home?

563
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,601
Should we break the door?

564
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,812
Hey, calm down.

565
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,024
You should be the one calming me down.

566
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,900
Sometimes we need to switch our roles.

567
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,361
Building representative!

568
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,790
Is the pastor home?

569
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:48,959
No.

570
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,170
He went outside.

571
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,841
Are you sure he's not home?

572
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,375
Pastor, I'd like to pray.

573
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,063
What are you doing here?

574
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,410
We had a few more things to discuss.

575
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,745
And the weather is hot…

576
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,899
The pastor…

577
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,659
Hey!

578
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,082
Doesn't this look more delicious?

579
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,013
Looks like it needs ointment again.

580
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,933
Let's go.

581
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,411
Once they smell blood,
their symptoms get worse.

582
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,789
Go in there when he calms down.

583
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,002
Did your thoughts
on the infected change now?

584
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,780
You killed him.

585
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,868
You did…

586
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,011
Have you been here this whole time?

587
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,516
It seemed like the infected were outside.

588
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,644
Did you take care of it?

589
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,921
You were scared, weren't you?
I should've protected you…

590
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,217
I know you're going to do that
from now on. I trust you.

591
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,764
Oh Joo-hyung was with the pastor.
He might've been infected.

592
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,349
Then what should I do?

593
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,226
I can't stay at your house, either.

594
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,980
I'll talk to my wife about it--

595
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,231
No.

596
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,026
She'll find out about our relationship.

597
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,527
But still…

598
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,407
I told you.
Oh Joo-hyung's bankruptcy is fake.

599
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,785
He invested everything in cryptocurrency.

600
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,038
Once we know the passcode to
his account, it'll all be ours.

601
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,876
Okay?

602
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,350
Where have you been?

603
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,102
Did you hear the man
on the 12th floor died?

604
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:50,273
Yes, I was pretty shocked,
so I went to the rooftop to get some air.

605
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,485
The rooftop? But Ms. Lee is there.

606
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:58,657
She is, I just sat in front of the door.
I was so shocked, you know.

607
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,410
The man's eyes turned all white, and…

608
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,996
You should've seen it.

609
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:12,879
By the way, let's say that you have
a very important passcode.

610
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,006
Something very long and complex,

611
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,342
something no one should find out.

612
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,885
Where would you hide it?

613
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,054
I should memorize it.

614
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,849
Or write it somewhere
the others don't know about,

615
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,684
so only I'd know.

616
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,595
Are you thirsty?
You're not feeling sick, are you?

617
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,556
You washed your hair
when we have no water?

618
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,850
I couldn't help it.
It was itchy and greasy.

619
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,018
And don't worry.

620
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,895
We'll have a source of water soon.

621
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,534
Don't ever do this again.

622
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,745
We don't even have antibiotics.

623
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,497
I'm a human vitamin
and a human antibiotic.

624
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,874
I'm totally fine.

625
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,302
The pastor from the 12th floor…

626
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,096
It wasn't our fault.

627
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,640
I know.

628
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,685
I still feel bad.

629
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,439
He should've told us that he was sick.

630
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,319
It's hard to confess
to being infected by the disease.

631
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,740
And they'd be scared
about wanting to bite the others.

632
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:11,706
And they might think they could
get the cure if they just hold out.

633
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,210
And it would also hurt…

634
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,923
to think someone they care about
might get scared of them.

635
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,931
Why? Do I have a fever?

636
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,684
I have a fever.

637
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,895
You have fever medicine, right?

638
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,066
I'll take that just in case,
and let's rest tomorrow.

639
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,150
And not do anything.

640
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,152
Good night.

641
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:42,988
Good night.

642
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,575
Am I okay?

643
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:51,913
Go to sleep.

644
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,247
Honey.

645
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,162
We had no idea.
How could they have done this?

646
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,957
I heard the pastor
on the 12th floor was infected.

647
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,085
He passed away.
Please wish for him to rest in peace.

648
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,420
Unbelievable.
That couple tricked all of us.

649
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,090
I think you two should restore
order around here.

650
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,508
Did you come here to say that?

651
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,677
That, and we're here for water too.

652
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,930
You know everyone's short on water, right?

653
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,266
We saw that you had a lot
of water in your house.

654
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,184
You want some of our water?

655
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,603
-Yes.
-You and the 15th floor.

656
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,814
The others went to the 15th floor.

657
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,651
I went to the rooftop,
and the supermarket lady said

658
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,195
she's not going to drink water,
and she gave us this.

659
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,281
You didn't mess with Ms. Lee, did you?

660
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,534
Goodness, why would we mess with her?

661
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,161
The infected are scary, you know.

662
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:41,040
This is the water
from the 15th floor, right?

663
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,209
That guy has a lot of water
at home, right?

664
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,796
He does.

665
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,882
Right, we should go there first.

666
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,675
We should've gone there first.

667
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,183
When is it going to rain?

668
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,100
What?

669
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,019
I feel nothing.

670
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,689
By the way…

671
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,901
should we give out our water too?

672
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,404
We're fine, but Seo-yoon…

673
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,823
More than that, the 15th floor…

674
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,492
People went to the 15th floor.

675
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,622
Excuse me, please open the door. We…

676
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,875
What is it?

677
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,753
You have a lot of water, right?
Everyone's having a hard time.

678
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,795
Share some with us.

679
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,048
The lockdown will be over
in a few days, anyway.

680
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,049
What if it doesn't?

681
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,800
I'll pay you, so share some.

682
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,429
These cleaners sell water
for 200,000 won per 500ml.

683
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:38,681
That's even more expensive than oil.

684
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,850
If you think it's unfair, you do it too.

685
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,186
Excuse me, we'll talk to him.

686
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,354
-You should go.
-But…

687
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,149
-Doing this won't solve anything.
-The residents should get along.

688
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,610
-You might need legal consulting someday!
-Hi.

689
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,779
You know the doctor
has a dirty temper, right?

690
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,073
-He may set this place on fire.
-Don't say that!

691
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,242
-I get it, so…
-Let's talk for a minute.

692
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,295
Go ahead.

693
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,423
I'm sorry.

694
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,969
I asked you for all sorts of things…

695
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,387
With what's going on,

696
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,181
how about sharing some water
if you have a lot left?

697
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,892
You'd only have to share
a little bit of it.

698
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:28,731
You don't have to do it,
but please think about it.

699
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:32,735
If things really get hard,
we'll go outside and get some.

700
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,570
You don't need to go outside.

701
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,906
Building 103 has EPS…

702
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,952
Emergency Power Supply,
in the electrical room

703
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,579
under the senior citizens' center.

704
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,498
It's made to turn on
emergency lights for elevators.

705
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:47,458
If you turn on the general power,

706
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,295
the electricity and water
will be turned on.

707
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:56,092
But it's turned on with a diesel
generator, so it will be quite noisy.

708
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,761
So the infected will all come
when they hear it.

709
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,222
We'll discuss what to do.

710
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,183
Tomorrow…

711
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,269
morning…

712
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,316
I will sort out what
I can give out tomorrow morning.

713
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,612
You're going to share with everyone?

714
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,448
-Sir, bless you.
-Thank you.

715
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,285
Bless you.

716
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,335
-Will he give us water?
-What about anything else?

717
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,045
It seems like he has a lot of food.

718
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,422
It's only right to share the water!

719
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,799
Please tell him to share it with us.

720
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,343
Calm down, please.

721
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,720
We will share what we have first.

722
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,724
He said he'll think about it
until tomorrow, so don't bother him.

723
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,018
Let's go.

724
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,436
He has a lot of water, right?

725
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,188
-He might change his mind…
-Let's go!

726
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,939
-Come on.
-He could change his mind.

727
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,192
Come on, let's go downstairs.

728
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,821
Hasn't Han Tae-seok contacted us yet?

729
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,866
No. It looks like he'll contact us
when he wants to.

730
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,329
-What are you looking for?
-You see…

731
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:13,169
I got this when I was training
for the FBI SWAT team.

732
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,213
And it's a large size.

733
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,341
What about it?

734
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,052
I want to say thank you
to the man on the 15th floor.

735
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,346
He's a bit cranky, but he's generous.

736
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,307
I have a T-shirt
from the Italian Championships.

737
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,601
-Shall we take that too?
-No, keep that one.

738
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,452
Honey.

739
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,913
Yes, Young-in, it's me.

740
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,708
Everything seems like a dream.

741
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,671
I feel like I'd be home
when I wake up, but…

742
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:03,302
What about our baby?

743
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:13,980
She's fine.

744
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,440
Honey.

745
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,737
Can't you take our baby out first?

746
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,826
There's a high chance of her
being born infected

747
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,744
because she shares your blood.

748
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,039
Honey.

749
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,040
Yes?

750
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,711
Never give up…

751
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,841
on our baby, okay?

752
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,551
Okay.

753
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,875
We can't postpone the childbirth anymore.

754
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,546
You will have to make a decision.

755
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,257
If miscarriage were possible,
it would've happened already.

756
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,717
If anything happens to the baby,

757
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,886
it may worsen her state of infection.

758
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,766
You still have to choose.

759
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,436
You have to choose whom
you're going to save

760
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,855
if you can save only one.

761
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,317
I only have one choice.

762
01:04:26,862 --> 01:04:29,198
Ms. Yoon's blood test result is out.

763
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,242
She has the antibody.

764
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:56,642
I'll be back.

765
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,935
Want me to go with you?

766
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,980
No, he seems to get sensitive
whenever he sees you.

767
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,317
That's how shy people are.
I'll be back soon.

768
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,153
Be careful.

769
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,443
Mr. Jung.

770
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,494
I'm listening.

771
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,073
What did he mean by a wrongdoing
that can't be undone?

772
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,076
We got the background check results
for those in the apartment,

773
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,828
and something's weird.

774
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,788
Do you think Kim Se-hoon really did this?

775
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,165
Someone died.

776
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,250
That's not important right now.

777
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,793
The food is gone!

778
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,170
Are you in danger?

779
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,880
Get the infiltration team ready.

780
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,467
Please help us so Sae-bom can live safely.

781
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,888
This will be my last favor.

782
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,598
Yi-hyun!

783
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,731
