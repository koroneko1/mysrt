00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.200
Hey

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.880
I told you before

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.440
You don’t have to do that for me. I can do it myself

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.440
I also told you before

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.840
You’re my boyfriend

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.840
I can take care of you

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.460
I’m serious

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.560
You don’t have to do everything for me

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.440
What’s wrong?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.440
Why so serious?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.700
Is it because of the job?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.860
Yea

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.540
The company that contacted me

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.480
It’s a direct sale company

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.480
Pin just went there for an interview

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.920
It’s okay

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.320
Whatever happens

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.320
I’m here beside you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960
About work…

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.820
You just have to wait. No need to hurry

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.980
We have to help each other

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.220
We both graduated

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Look at me

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.060
Wait for me

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.600
I don’t want…

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.600
I don’t want you to suffer because of me

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.100
I get to see you after work everyday

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
I already feel that my power is fully charged

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.300
Thank you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.660
Sure

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.160
I’m free today. Is there anywhere you want to go?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.240
Um…

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.200
Our house is so messy

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.260
Let’s do Big Cleaning Day

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I will be your assistant

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.200
Let’s do it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.900
Ewww

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.880
Catch

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.980
Wish

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.200
Gotcha

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.540
I’m losing followers again?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.640
Your vlog is not fun anymore. Nonsense

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.340
You should change some content. Other channels are doing so much better than yours

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.320
(Content creator for hire)

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.820
The room is finally clean

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.100
The room is clean

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.580
But how about you? Are you clean yet?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.520
You should take a shower now

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.540
You’re sweaty. You’re making our bed dirty

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.480
Wait for me

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.700
Who’s here?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.520
Here

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.400
You’re interrupting my precious time

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.060
Why are you so angry?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.400
What were you doing?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.840
What?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.320
I was going to take a shower

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.260
Taking a shower?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.160
Yes

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.160
You dress like this to take a shower?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.780
Yes

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.280
What’s wrong with you?

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.300
Showering…
What’s wrong with you?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.920
Showering…

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.220
What’s the matter?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.560
The thing is

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.200
Aeoy doesn’t approve any of our work

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.800
It’s a disaster

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.420
And you know what

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.720
Our boss blamed me that I misunderstood her briefing

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.580
I called you and you didn’t pick up

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.680
I didn’t pick up?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.760
I don’t know what were you doing?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.940
Aeoy is bad. Aeoy is the worst. She can’t do this to us. Our boss is wrong

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.100
Someone is trying to go off-topic

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.680
What should we do?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.220
Meeting tomorrow at 10 AM

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.560
What? But it’s weekend

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.080
Client wants it that way

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.260
What are you going to do?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.520
My weekend

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.920
Hello, Art

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.340
Hello

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.100
Hello

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880
We meet at last

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.860
Why are you looking at him like that?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.720
He’s mine

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.000
He’s cute

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.660
I cannot even look at him?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.880
Are you guys talking about work?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.820
I will wait for you upstairs then

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.760
I will go up soon

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.380
I will go up soon…

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.540
Why do you have to hurry?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.780
You boyfriend is cute

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.580
Of course, he is

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.100
I want to marry him

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.680
If there’s any work, let me know

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.740
I want to earn more money

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.560
You want to save money for your marriage?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.240
Do you want to be a content creator?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.380
Really?

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.360
Yes

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.320
I will send con to you

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.560
What con?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.020
Condo?

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.540
What?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.100
Condom?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.720
What?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.140
Contact?

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.660
What?

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.740
That’s the right answer!

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.960
Don’t say what again

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.600
What?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.880
Why do I have to make these lame jokes with you?

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.920
Big Cleaning Day

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.200
There’re so many dusts

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.780
Lucky me. No pimples

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.800
Hello

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.140
Hello

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.660
Where is your friend?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.480
Is he late?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.840
It’s just me today

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.120
You can tell everything to me. I will let him know about it. We’re in the same team

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.100
Okay. That’s good

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.640
There’s nothing much

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.640
I’m here to cancel the work

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.680
What?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.700
You didn’t mishear it

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.460
I have a new team to work with already

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.580
The thing is…

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.440
I don’t want to wait for you guys

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.140
Such a waste of time

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.420
Do you know why we wasted so much time?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.700
Because your brief doesn’t make any sense

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.180
How about the creator content job? Do you still think it’s a waste of time?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.140
I actually like your idea

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.740
I’m okay if you want to do it

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.600
What about…

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.640
My pay?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.240
About that, you can request it

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.720
But I need you to be on-time

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.460
If you’re lazy

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.220
If you’re addicted to you girlfriend

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.040
I don’t think you’re qualified for the job

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.700
I will do it

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.460
Here is my proposal. I think it can increase the engagement

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.000
You can check it first if you want to add or get rid of anything

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.760
I want to attract younger audience

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.060
You’re so pretty

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.740
Got it

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.340
Also…

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.900
What’s your name?

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.240
Gosh! Can you let me work first?

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.360
Aeoy

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.820
Calm down

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.540
He’s just a kid

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.400
I’ll talk to him

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.280
Bro

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.280
Don’t disturb her

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.540
Let us work first

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.180
Okay?

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.220
Okay

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.240
Let’s shake hand

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.660
Where’s your hand?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.060
I’m so sorry

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.680
Didn’t I tell you not to disturb other people?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.500
Bye bye

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.860
I’ll find you later

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.360
Aeoy

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.300
I will be right back

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.980
Where are you?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.200
You’re working today too?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.380
Are you coming back to eat?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.740
Um…

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.060
I’m hungry

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.240
Should we order something to eat?

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.940
Sure

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.880
What do you want to eat? Spaghetti?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.900
Sure. Up to you

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.940
Spaghetti Carbonara

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.860
Salmon salad

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.740
Fish and Chips

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.340
Baked spinach with cheese

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.000
Wow

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.520
You eat so much but you're so skinny

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.920
Because I’m too skinny that’s why I eat a lot

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.140
Can I take a picture with you?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.020
Sure

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.880
Thank you

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.060
Is he your boyfriend?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.420
You can take a picture with us too

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.160
Really?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.620
Yes

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.060
Come on. Let’s take more

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.360
One. Two. Three

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.860
Thank you so much

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.040
Thank you

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.000
Why were you doing?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.360
It’s just a joke. Fan service. Do you know?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.260
Don’t be serious

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.440
Don’t be serious…

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.880
They all look so good

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.840
You can start eating first

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.600
You first

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.440
No. You first

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.880
Let me take pictures first then

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.520
Right…

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.140
Where should I put this?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.660
You ordered so many

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.000
Can you hold this for me?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.520
Don’t put it down yet. Let me take a picture first

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.980
I need to find the right lightning

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.960
This one goes in

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.980
Move a bit

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.740
Hello, Kong

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.660
Where are you?

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.100
I’m working, obviously. I’m at my hair salon

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.840
There are so many clients

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.840
Did you fight with your boyfriend again?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.820
Because of Two

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.520
I don’t know what work he’s doing

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.700
I feel that he is close to a girl

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.000
I found a picture of him with that girl

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.980
It’s just work

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.180
He is so crazy about work

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.120
I understand that

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.920
I trust Two

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.740
It’s the girl that I don’t trust

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.720
I will tell you something

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.080
You don’t have to be worried

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.540
You guys have been through so much together

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.560
Have faith in Two

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.020
Okay?

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.200
Stop feeling down

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.240
Okay. I will try

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.440
Thank you so much

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.400
Dude. Stop. What are you thinking?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.000
I said there’s nothing

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.500
It’s just work

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
Why are you not telling me anything?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.300
Whatever

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.700
I’m going now

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.500
I want to poo

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.500
Bye

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.500
You’re not sleeping yet?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
No

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
You were so loud

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I couldn’t sleep

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
What are you doing?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Oh

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.000
I was going to charge the phone for you

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Trust me

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.500
Don’t think too much

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.000
There’s nothing

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Everything that I do is for us

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.500
I know

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.500
It’s just work

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm going to sleep now

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.000
Black coffee from a person with black heart

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.600
Wow

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.000
How was your weekend?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Why?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.500
There’s nothing

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.500
Normal

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.600
Nothing much

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.000
Nothing more?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
Just that?

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.000
You were working with Aeoy

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.700
Aeoy…

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You have no right to say anything

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.500
Why?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.700
You

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.500
Ditch

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500
Me

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I will remember this

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I’m sorry

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.500
I will say no more

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500
You ditch me

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.500
I will help you remember

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.500
We both remember

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500
I remember

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.500
You ditch me

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.500
I ditch you

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.000
You understand?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yes

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.500
You ditch me

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.000
I ditch you

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.500
You ditch me

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.000
Someone is going off-topic again

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.000
Give it to me

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.500
If you’re not going to eat it then I will eat it

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.500
I’m eating it

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.300
You have more desserts everyday

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I don’t know what they are though

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
They all look so weird

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.000
I haven’t seen the two aunties today

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.500
Do you have more aunties that provide you food support?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.500
Come on

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.500
I don’t think so

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
These things actually tasty

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.000
Hey

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.500
Hello

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500
Can you go to the award ceremony with me tonight?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.000
Huh?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.500
Me?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
What time do you finish working?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.300
We’re done since 5 PM

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.600
Stop being nosy

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
See you

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.500
Don’t be late

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.500
Come on

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.200
Just go with her

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.000
We’re all in the same team

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.500
You should help her if you can

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.000
Just a bit

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Go away

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
What the hell?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Where is my snack?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.500
Go away

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.500
Just a bit of salt, sugar, and pepper

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.500
Is this sugar or salt?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Whatever. I will just put it in

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Pepper

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
He works until very late

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I’ll give this to him at the office then

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.500
Put this into the oven

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.000
Done

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
OMG! The sun!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Where are you going after this?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.200
I have some business

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.200
Right…some business

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
See you

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.000
Thank you so much

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.500
Wait

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.500
Thank you for coming with me

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.600
You were dragging me to go with you

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.000
I will pay you then

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
No worry

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Hello, Pin

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.500
What did you do to Wish?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.500
What ?

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.000
You should clear things up with him

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
He’s at Gun’s house

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.500
Go there asap

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.500
I don’t think he’s okay

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.500
Okay. I will go there now

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Wait

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.500
What is it?

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.700
I have to go and see my boyfriend now

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.700
I have something to tell you

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I like you

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I think you know it

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.000
But I have a boyfriend already

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.500
I love him very much

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I know that you have a boyfriend

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I have a fiance too

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
So?

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.500
I’m just thinking

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.500
Male-male relationship won’t last long

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500
I don’t love my fiance anymore

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
When I’m with you, my feeling becomes clearer

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.000
I think you shouldn’t judge other people’s relationship

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It doesn’t matter what gender I'm attracted to

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
Or the feelings that you have for me

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.300
For me

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.300
You’re just my client

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Do you think you’re special?

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.000
I’m not

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.000
You’re just a normal person

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.700
I’m also a normal person

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.500
I’m a normal person who doesn’t have any feelings for you

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500
Excuse me

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.500
Calm down

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.500
I think

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.000
You should listen to him first

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.500
I don’t understand why

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
The person you thought you know the most

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Turns out that you didn’t understand him at all

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.000
You guys have been together for so many years

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.000
Just because this one incident

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.500
You look at him differently?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.500
I don’t know

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Just think about it carefully

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
These past few years

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
He is so caring

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
He always takes care of you

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Two even talked to me about asking you to marry him

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Marry?

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500
I’ll be right back

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.500
What are doing here?

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.500
I’m here to explain

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.500
I’m here to explain what you misunderstand

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.500
Misunderstand?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.500
I misunderstand?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.500
I saw the photos. I saw your chat

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.500
You guys were walking together

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.000
And you said I misunderstand you?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Listen to me carefully

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.500
She hired me to be a content creator

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.500
There’s nothing more than that

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.500
The reason I didn’t tell you is because I’m scared

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.000
I’m scared that you will think too much

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.500
I’m scared that you will feel bad

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.500
I’m scared that you will feel that you are my burden

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.000
I don’t want you to think that way

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.000
I want you to trust me

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.500
Everything that I do

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.000
Is for our marriage

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I used to believe you

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.000
But you ruined it by your own hands

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
I’m sorry

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I’m sorry

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.500
I should have told you since the beginning

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.500
I’m sorry

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.700
I think we should take a break from one another

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.000
I want to stay alone

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.000
So, you don’t have to be tired

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
You don’t have to work hard for me

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.500
You don’t have to keep hiding and lying to me

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.500
Please take care of him for me

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.500
Please take good care of him

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I know

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Thank you so much

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Bye bye

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
You miss him, right?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
You’re right

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I miss him so much

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Are you going back soon?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
How about you?

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.800
You haven’t eaten

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.800
You will die in this office

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I know

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I will work for a bit

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I will go back home soon

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
You can go back first

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500
Are you sure?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I’m going back first then

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500
Don’t go back home late

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.000
See you

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.000
See you

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Why are you coming back? Did you forget something?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.000
Here

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.500
You’re hungry, right? I have some leftover

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.500
I miss you so much

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.500
Don’t disappear on me again

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.500
I’m here with you now

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.500
I cannot live without you too

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
You can let me go now

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Give me one more chance

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.400
Can you be my boyfriend again?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.500
Let me think about it

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Please

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.500
I will give you the answer later

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.400
If you’re not giving me the answer

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.000
I will kiss you now

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Huh?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Fine. I’m your boyfriend

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.100
We're back together. I can kiss you now
