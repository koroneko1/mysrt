1
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,791
Yes!

2
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,083
I win.

3
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,500
The deal was,
the loser has to pay for the movie.

4
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,583
I won't flake out.

5
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,041
If you're so skilfull,
let's race for one more round.

6
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,833
That's not the deal.

7
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,125
What a wimp.

8
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,500
Come on, Tan, don't be a sore loser.

9
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,875
When did you get here, Ice?

10
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,833
Ice, this is Perth.

11
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,583
This is Ice, my girl.

12
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,583
I remember.

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,041
You're the guy Tan tells me
he practices with.

14
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,250
Yeah.

15
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,375
Actually, we aren't here to swim.

16
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,625
We are secret lovers.

17
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,958
Right, darling?

18
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,000
Get off me. Get away.

19
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,541
Get away.

20
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,666
Get out.

21
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,666
I'm okay with seeing you two
at the same time.

22
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,583
Hey!

23
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,291
Don't you think you should ask me?

24
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,500
This pool looks really big.

25
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,541
Why don't we try diving
from that platform?

26
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,333
Wow.

27
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,916
Before you think about diving,

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,041
I think you should learn
how to swim first.

29
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,958
I'm not scared.
I have two varsity swimmers here.

30
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,500
Hey, Ice. Ice, wait!

31
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,041
If you don't know how,
you can hurt yourself, Ice.

32
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:55,833
Ice!

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,291
Stop messing around!

34
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,541
Ice!

35
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,000
Your eyes are about to fall out.
Stop staring at her.

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,666
Just keep diving.

37
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:22,916
Hey!

38
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,541
Don't you dare stare!

39
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,500
Hey, Ice!

40
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,583
Are you for real?

41
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,375
3 MONTHS AFTER ICE'S DEATH

42
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,583
BANGKOK GAMES 2014
NATIONAL YOUTH GAMES

43
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,291
-Perth, hurry.
-Hurry, Perth. Hurry!

44
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,416
-Perth!
-Go, Perth.

45
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,458
Come on. Hurry!

46
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,750
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

47
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,333
Yes!

48
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,833
He's amazing, well done.

49
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,500
Seriously,

50
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,875
before my gold medal win,

51
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,541
were you ever interested in me?

52
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
How about this? Is this called interested?

53
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,958
Hey.

54
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,125
I don't have a condom.

55
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,041
Perth.

56
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,791
Don't be a spoilsport.

57
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,666
Is this...

58
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,208
what you call a spoilsport?

59
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,250
CONGRATULATIONS TO

60
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,333

00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,291
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU PERTH.
GOOD JOB.

63
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,875
CUTE AND TALENTED.
WHAT A PACKAGE.

64
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,916
LIKE

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,750
YOU CAN DO EVEN BETTER.

66
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,250
THANK YOU, BUT I STILL NEED MORE TRAINING.

67
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,500
GREAT JOB, PERTH.

68
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,125
YOU WON THIS TIME
BECAUSE TAN WASN'T COMPETING.

69
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,250
JUST NOW.

70
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,416

71

GO TO SLEEP. 8TH JUNE 2014

73
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,500
THIS SATURDAY DON'T FORGET

74
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,083
ICE'S 100TH DAY MEMORIAL.

75
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
8TH JUNE 2014

76
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,416
MESSAGES.

77
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,875
ICE: WHAT CLIP?
PERTH: THE BEACH CLIP.

78
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,083
ICE: WHY DO YOU NEED IT?
PERTH: I WANT IT.

79
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,750
ICE: HERE YOU GO.

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,166
Here, they have an example, too.

81
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,208
"In order to",
must be followed by a finite verb.

82
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,625
But...

83
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,208
"In order that",

84
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,000
must be used in conjunction

85
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,583
with a complete sentence.

86
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,833
Understand?

87
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,291
Who are you daydreaming about?

88
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,916
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,875
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

90
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,416
What the heck, Mint?

91
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,583
I just wanted to check my Facebook.

92
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,416
What is the matter?

93
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,625
Ask me first.

94
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,916
I don't like people messing with my stuff.

95
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,041
I'm sorry, then,
for intruding in your personal space.

96
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm leaving.

97
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,708
-Hey, wait!
-Get in!

98
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,708
Let me go! Get off!

99
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,000
-Come on in.
-Wait, I don't want to.

100
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,416
-Come on.
-Hey!

101
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,416
Ice?

102
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,625
I like you, Ice.

103
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:30,750
How about you?

104
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,125
Do you feel the same?

105
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,125
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Come on, you!

106
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,541
Throw her in!

107
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,208
-Throw her!
-Throw her in!

108
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,166
Where are you going?

109
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,083
-Come on!
-Throw her in!

110
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,375
I like you, Ice.

111
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,083
I like you, Ice.

112
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,708
I like you, Ice.

113
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,916
I like you, Ice.

114
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,708
I like you, Ice.

115
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,333
I think your dad's car
is starting to fall apart.

116
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,000
This morning, the car overheated
and broke down on an overpass.

117
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,041
Luckily, there were no cars behind me.

118
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,541
-Mom.
-Hm?

119
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,375
Last night, did you come in my room?

120
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,500
Last night, I worked the graveyard shift.

121
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,666
Did something happen?

122
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,791
Nothing.

123
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,291
Use your quads!

124
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,458
Faster!

125
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,125
Come on, faster!

126
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,375
Overall, everyone improved
on their average time.

127
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,916
So just cool down by doing ten laps,

128
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,041
and then you can go home.

129
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,208
Perth.

130
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,416
I told you to eat one raw egg a day.

131
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,708
Have you started yet?

132
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
Don't you want to qualify
for the university sports quota?

133
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,875
You know, this time,

134
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,666
just one slot is open
and it goes to first place?

135
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,000
If this is your best time,
Tan could do better.

136
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,500
Are we going anywhere after?

137
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
-Not after today's grueling practice.
-I'm not going, you?

138
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,541
-How about you?
-Pussy!

139
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,541
-Hey!
-You're not going?

140
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,625
-Oh man. I'm done.
-I'm done, too.

141
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,916
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

142
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,833
Where have you been hiding?

143
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,708
The whole team is worried.

144
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,166
Are you still hung up
about what happened to Ice?

145
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,875
Ice has found peace now.

146
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,458
Just let it go.

147
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,208
"Found peace?"

148
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,125
You think people who commit suicide
find peace?

149
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,541
And how does stressing out do any good?

150
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,916
It won't bring her back, you know.

151
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,708
I must find...

152
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,708
the asshole who caused Ice
to kill herself.

153
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,333
What is that supposed to mean?

154
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,958
Ice killed herself...

155
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,625
because she was pregnant.

156
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,416
-You talk like the both of you never...
-No.

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,708
No, we never had sex.

158
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,375
Even if you find out...

159
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,875
what can you do about it?

160
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,291
I'll kill him.

161
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,125
WHERE ARE YOU, TAN?

162
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,250
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER.

163
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,416
Ice, your coochie is showing.

164
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,666
You pervert.

165
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,875
You can't see anything.
I'm wearing shorts.

166
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
What time are you guys supposed to meet?

167
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,916
Did you call him?

168
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,083
I called already, but Tan didn't pick up.

169
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,541
You are always training.

170
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,375
Tan never trains this much.

171
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,250
Tan is gifted.

172
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,541
I'm not.

173
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,250
So I need to train harder.

174
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,166
That's not true.

175
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,125
Tan can't swim underwater as long as you.

176
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,666
Yeah, there should be...

177
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,833
an underwater diving competition, huh?

178
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,208
Hello, Tan, where are you?

179
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,583
Stop talking. It's always the same excuse.

180
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,083
So you are ditching me again, right?

181
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,916
And what about teaching me to swim?

182
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,375
If I have to wait for you,

183
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,333
I will never learn to swim.

184
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,375
Ice.

185
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,500
Here.

186
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,708
Hey.

187
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,791
You know today is my birthday?

188
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,708
It's Tan's.

189
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,416
He asked me to give this to you
in case he didn't make it.

190
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,500
It's cute.

191
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,041
Of course.
I was the one who picked it out.

192
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,875
Here.

193
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,166
This is from me.

194
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,125
I made it myself.

195
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,875
Thanks.

196
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,875
I got to go. I will see you later.

197
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,666
Ice?

198
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,125
I can teach you to swim.

199
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,416
What's wrong?

200
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
-Do you have a cramp?
-Yeah.

201
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,541
Are you feeling better?

202
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,333
Yeah.

203
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,375
You have a tattoo?

204
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,583
Just for fun.

205
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,083
What does it say?

206
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,791
"Ai."

207
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,291
"Ai"?

208
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,708
What does it mean?

209
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,916
"Ai" means love.

210
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,250
As in...

211
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,916
"Wo Ai Ni", I love you?

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,875
Yeah.

213
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,333
Then...

214
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,000
Wo Ai Ni.

215
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm okay now.

216
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,166
Let's get back to my lesson.

217
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,041
Wait.

218
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,416
So do you also Ni Ai Wo?

219
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,375
What's wrong?

220
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,833
Don't you feel the same?

221
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,416
But I'm still with Tan.

222
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,166
INTHIRA RATIKANAN

223
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,250
TAN: ARE YOU AT ICE'S FUNERAL?

224
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,666
ARE YOU AT ICE'S FUNERAL?
IS IT ALMOST OVER?

225
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,583
ALMOST DONE.

226
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,500
WHEN THE FUNERAL IS OVER. CALL ME.

227
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,708
WHERE ARE YOU?

228
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,750
I'M AT ICE'S HOUSE.

229
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,833
Let's go home.

230
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,875
The number you have dialed
is not available.

231
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,333
Tan?

232
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,500
Tan?

233
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,583
Tan!

234
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,541
Her mom is coming back. Come on out.

235
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,208
It's me. Perth.

236
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,375
Tan, can you hear me?

237
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:27,833
Hey!

238
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,875
Ice?

239
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,083
Don't you love me anymore?

240
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,541
That's why you left me here alone.

241
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,333
I'm so lonely.

242
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,291
I...

243
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,541
lit an incense stick to guide you home.

244
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,666
Please come home.

245
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,125
Please come home.

246
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,625
Let me have a look...

247
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,125
at how pretty you are.

248
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,250
Perth?

249
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm pregnant.

250
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,750
Perth?

251
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,083
Stop freaking out.

252
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,791
Perth, I'm just joking.

253
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,750
Here, look. There is only one line.
You see?

254
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,166
I didn't think you would
stress out this much.

255
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:49,833
Mint...

256
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,083
I am really busy training now.

257
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,166
I don't think I will have time to see you.

258
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,458
Are you breaking up with me?

259
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,583
What happened that night...

260
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,625
I...

261
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,458
I didn't mean to...

262
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,291
It didn't mean anything to me, too.

263
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,375
You are so full of yourself.

264
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,458
I'm sorry.

265
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,166
If I were really pregnant...

266
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,583
would you still treat me this way?

267
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,875
I'LL BE LATE. PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF DINNER.

268
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,333
Mom?

269
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,208
Mom!

270
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,625
Perth, I told you if I am not home yet,

271
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,166
do not lock the main door.

272
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,416
I was out at the supermarket.

273
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,041
Your teacher saw I had a lot of stuff,

274
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,000
and gave me a lift home.

275
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,708
Oh.

276
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,166
So where is your car?

277
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,041
This morning,
I took the car to the repair shop.

278
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,125
What's with the mess?
I thought we ran out of cooking gas.

279
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,416
I was the one who told Perth
to eat raw eggs,

280
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,708
to boost his energy.

281
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,625
You're supposed to only eat one a day.

282
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,958
He must take after me.

283
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,625
When I was pregnant,
I loved to eat raw eggs.

284
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,166
-Really?
-Yes.

285
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,458
If you eat this many raw eggs,
you will definitely be in shape.

286
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,416
If you were giving birth,
you wouldn't need a doctor.

287
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,208
Nonsense.

288
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,750
Perth!

289
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,291
You must be eating like a pig.

290
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,708
Your six-pack is now just one-pack.

291
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,125
I got it. You're constipated, right?

292
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,458
Hey, Tan.

293
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,125
Are you back to train?

294
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:29,625
Nope. I just feel like swimming.

295
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,708
-Perth, we're gonna go.
-See you.

296
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,416
Hey.

297
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,541
What were you doing at Ice's house?

298
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,500
So, you know where she lives?

299
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,166
That's how you followed me there?

300
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,291
I took her home once.

301
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,916
When you were at a swim meet.

302
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,083
So what the hell were you doing there?

303
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,708
I went in to get her cell phone.

304
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,208
But the screen was all smashed
and wouldn't turn on.

305
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,083
I'm going to take it
to see if they can fix it.

306
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,458
I'm sure there'll be pictures
of that asshole.

307
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,750
I think you should just drop it
and come back to school.

308
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:56,958
Okay.

309
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,125
Whatever. It's none of my business anyway.

310
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,458
I got to go.

311
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:32,791
Excuse me.

312
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,958
The pool will be closing soon.

313
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,625
Put your stuff away and go home,

314
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,166
before I lock the doors.

315
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,666
Okay.

316
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,541
PHARMACY

317
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,333
INCOMING CALL TAN

318
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,000
Hello?

319
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,166
My mom dropped her phone in water.

320
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,833
That shop you used, is it good?

321
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:45,500
I don't know.

322
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:46,916
I haven't gotten it back yet.

323
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,083
Where is it?

324
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,500
I will get it fixed there, too.

325
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,208
It's at Robinson.

326
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,541
The shop has a big yellow sign in front.

327
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:01,958
Excuse me.

328
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,458
Um...

329
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,666
My friend asked me to pick up his BB.

330
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,958
The one you were trying
to recover data from.

331
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,750
I think you got the wrong shop.

332
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,625
Nobody brought in a BB for repair.

333
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:18,750
No, I'm sure.

334
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,791
Let me see the receipt.

335
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,458
Oh.

336
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,458
Give me a second.

337
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,375
I forgot to bring it.

338
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,333
Sorry.

339
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,958
Without a receipt,

340
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,583
even if it was you who dropped it off,

341
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,916
I couldn't give you the phone.

342
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,041
Perth.

343
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,875
You brought your mom's phone?

344
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,083
Yeah.

345
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,500
Excuse me.

346
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,458
I'm here to pick up the BB that needed
the data recovered.

347
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,000
One second.

348
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,375
Where is your mom's phone anyway?

349
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,708
Why don't you give it to check?

350
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,791
It's okay.

351
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,916
I want to shop around a bit first.

352
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:31,708
Excuse me.

353
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,583
Your phone is damaged beyond repair.

354
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,875
We couldn't recover any data.

355
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,416
That's okay.

356
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,916
I will see if another shop can help.

357
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,458
I'm going to get wasted tonight.

358
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:48,500
You want to come?

359
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,208
No, you go ahead.

360
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,250
I gotta meet up with my mom here.

361
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,541
Shit.

362
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:51,833
Hey.

363
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,291
Let go of me!

364
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,125
You trying to scare me, Ice?

365
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,166
I always see you training late at night.

366
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,625
Scared of ghosts?

367
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,125
Who? Me?

368
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,291
Scared?

369
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,541
Oh, boo-hoo.

370
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,000
Sure you're not scared?

371
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,791
Don't even give me that smirk.

372
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,333
What are you doing here this late?

373
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,541
I broke up with Tan.

374
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,791
Does he know about...

375
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,166
you and me?

376
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,208
No.

377
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,625
I want you to tell Tan yourself.

378
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,541
So, when are you going to talk to him?

379
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:46,833
After he is done competing.

380
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,166
I'm afraid he will lose focus.

381
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,750
But that's a long time from now.

382
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,500
I don't like sneaking around like this.

383
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,458
But sneaking around...

384
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,958
like this is exciting, isn't it?

385
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,750
You like to be excited, huh?

386
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,583
Perth?

387
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,291
Perth, are you here?

388
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,208
Perth?

389
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:21,875
Perth?

390
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,541
Aren't you over doing it?

391
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,083
What are you...

392
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,083
doing here so late?

393
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,625
Ice broke up with me.

394
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,208
Then let's...

395
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:54,208
go get wasted together.

396
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,416
But can I catch up in a bit?

397
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,833
You're getting your kicks up there.

398
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,208
You don't have to come.

399
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,291
I don't want to take you from anybody.

400
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,875
Enjoy! I'm out of here!

401
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:39,500
What we are doing is wrong, isn't it?

402
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,791
Do you still have feelings for Tan?

403
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,666
I just don't want him to get hurt.

404
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,125
I get hurt, too...

405
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,625
when I see you around Tan.

406
00:44:58,625 --> 00:44:59,625
What now?

407
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,375
Come on.

408
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,625
Snap out of it.

409
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,375
Snap out of it!

410
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,416
Stop teasing me.

411
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,041
I'm still mad at you.

412
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:23,291
Let's get off.

413
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,166
I didn't mean this.

414
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,208
So...

415
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,208
what did you mean?

416
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,000
I love you, Ice.

417
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,416
Perth?

418
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,375
Do you have protection?

419
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,000
Don't worry.

420
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,416
If worst comes to worst...

421
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:54,583
I will carry our baby for you.

422
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,125
You're silly.

423
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:52,958
Take care of our baby.

424
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,833
Other than a seahorse's unique
method of reproduction,

425
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,916
its specie's other unique characteristic,

426
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,541
is its loyalty to its mate.

427
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,250
Even after it's mate dies,

428
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,958
the remaining seahorse

429
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:51,041
will not find another mate.

430
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,375
YOU STUDIED WITH THIS JERK
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, RIGHT?

431
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:56,583
Try. Very good.

432
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,875
HE POSTED A LOT ON ICE'S FACEBOOK.

433
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,458
Okay, all of you, I want you

434
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,708
DO YOU THINK ICE DID IT WITH HIM?

435
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,541
to get into groups of three

436
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,041
and do the assignment.

437
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,750
I DOUBT IT.

438
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,916
About the reproduction
of underwater animals.

439
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:15,666
Or go and look for info at the aquarium.

440
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,666
Have you been there?

441
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,583
It's near your home, right?

442
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,958
In that case...

443
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,291
I KNEW IT!

444
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,166
YOU KNEW WHAT?

445
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,791
I SAW THEM WALKING TOGETHER AT THE MALL.

446
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:57,625
Reports say that 56 percent
of motorists drive recklessly,

447
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,375
-drive through red lights.
-Drive through red lights?

448
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:03,708
While 24 percent do not pull over
at designated stops.

449
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,500
Mom!

450
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,125
Shit!

451
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,500
The initial blood test came back normal.

452
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:42,291
I am going to order an ultrasound.

453
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:45,500
Perth.

454
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,875
Perth?

455
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,666
Come here.

456
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,666
This will feel a little cold
on your abdomen.

457
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,250
Your pregnancy is in its fourth trimester.

458
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,875
Everything looks normal.

459
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:15,750
This right here, is the baby's head.

460
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,166
This is the spinal column.

461
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,833
Right here. Can you see it?

462
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,416
It is the arms and legs.

463
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:24,958
Right here...

464
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:28,458
is the heart.

465
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,791
I will let you hear the heartbeat.

466
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:12,958
Ice, just calm down.

467
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,916
These tests are not 100% accurate.

468
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,250
Maybe...

469
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,000
you did it wrong.

470
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,875
I took the test twice already.

471
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Pissing on a piece of plastic,

472
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:26,916
isn't that difficult.

473
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:35,791
Have you told Tan yet?

474
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,125
Ice...

475
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:45,541
I didn't mean it like that.

476
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,208
I will take care of it myself.

477
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:49,625
Take care of what?

478
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,500
An abortion?

479
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,541
That is murder.

480
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,541
Okay.

481
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,208
I won't have an abortion.

482
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:11,833
We can tell my mom together
this evening, then.

483
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:16,500
Then, tomorrow...

484
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,166
we can drop out from school.

485
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,250
Perth?

486
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,833
Do you have some money saved up?

487
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,125
You should start looking for a job soon.

488
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,750
When our baby is born...

489
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,666
we don't want to be penniless.

490
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:46,666
Also, about...

491
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,375
I'm so sorry.

492
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,000
I will find a way to take care of this.

493
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:03,333
I have a friend who had one before.

494
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,625
Ice, where did you get this money?

495
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,375
From my aunt.

496
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,541
This will feel a little cold.

497
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:54,958
Who's there?

498
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,000
Open the door!

499
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,666
Mint?

500
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,916
Mint!

501
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,333
Mint!

502
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,916
Mint! Mint!

503
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,916
Mint!

504
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:44,458
Who the hell is there?

505
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:49,958
Shit!

506
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,125
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

507
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,291
What are you doing down here?

508
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,750
Coach sent me to get something.

509
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:12,791
But I cannot find it.

510
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,541
If you're going to lie,

511
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,291
you have to do better than that.

512
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:27,875
Keep your nose out of my business.

513
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,041
What do you mean?

514
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:34,958
You mean you and Ice?

515
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,750
Taking off already?

516
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah.

517
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,500
Hey,

518
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,791
I heard you're in the next qualifier?

519
00:58:58,125 --> 00:58:59,041
Yeah.

520
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,375
What is your best time?

521
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:21,583
Why don't you race me and see?

522
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:25,291
I'm curious if the national champ...

523
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,291
can keep up with me yet.

524
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:28,541
You better find out...

525
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,250
at the swim meet, then.

526
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:35,625
I don't really care what your time is.

527
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,916
I'm out of here.

528
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:57,083
Twelve...

529
00:59:57,666 --> 00:59:58,625
thirteen.

530
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:03,375
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

531
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:16,416
Forty-four, forty-five, forty-six,

532
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,000
forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine,

533
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,125
fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two.

534
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,083
Here.

535
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,791
-Thanks.
-It's nothing.

536
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,916
How did you do
on your first day of training?

537
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,708
I did okay.

538
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,833
Still a little rusty.

539
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,500
CONGRATULATIONS TO KITTHIPHONG PHROMMUL

540
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:55,833
BRONZE MEDAL WINNER.

541
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:03,958
No practice today?

542
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:05,708
Nope.

543
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,291
Qualifiers are soon.

544
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,958
I want to rest my muscles.

545
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,458
Perfect.

546
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,291
I need a wingman.

547
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,708
Hey!

548
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,375
Hey, man, slow down! What's the hurry?

549
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,958
Damn!

550
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,500
Why are we here?

551
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:57,833
Perth, how many years
have we been friends?

552
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:01,083
What the hell is going on?

553
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,083
Perth what is so important

554
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,250
that you wanted to meet here?

555
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:42,750
You are the asshole...

556
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,000
who knocked up Ice, right?

557
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,000
What the hell are you on about?

558
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,416
Don't play stupid.

559
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,083
-Tan, calm down.
-Wait a second!

560
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,250
Let me explain.

561
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,083
I only commented on her Facebook,

562
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:54,958
but she didn't reply.

563
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,333
Don't lie.

564
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Perth said,

565
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,458
that he saw you two
walking together at the mall.

566
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,250
Perth?

567
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,958
When did you see me with Ice?

568
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,250
It wasn't me!

569
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,208
Perth!

570
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,666
Why don't you just admit it?

571
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,375
Perth!

572
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,791
When did you see me at the mall with Ice?

573
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,000
-I don't even have her number.
-Asshole!

574
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,750
How dare you still lie?

575
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:36,750
Asshole!

576
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,750
This guy has no shame at all.

577
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,125
We kicked his ass
and he still didn't fess up.

578
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:55,708
Perth, are you crazy?
I could have fallen off for real!

579
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:57,625
Crazy? Look who's talking.

580
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,541
What are you on about?

581
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:01,750
I saw you...

582
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,500
talking to Tan.

583
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,791
So what if I talk to Tan?

584
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,291
You're afraid I will tell Tan
about the clip?

585
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,125
That clip is so old.

586
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,125
I already forgot about it.

587
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,208
I admit...

588
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:25,625
that I used to have a crush on Ice.

589
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:28,666
But Ice was Tan's girlfriend.

590
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,625
Okay?

591
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,583
Right now,

592
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:36,833
I don't care if Tan finds out.

593
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,916
What I do care about
is you talking with other guys.

594
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:44,958
I don't believe you.

595
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,791
You know I am bad at lying.

596
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,833
Mint, you've got to work with me on this.

597
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,083
If we both qualify
for the university admission quota...

598
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,666
we can move in together.

599
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,875
That's all for today.

600
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:34,833
DHARMA FORUM

601
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:37,333
Don't forget to turn in your work.

602
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:38,541
Everyone can go now.

603
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,583
MR. D-E-B ARE YOU A MONK?

604
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:40,583
I AM AN ORDINARY PERSON.

605
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,250
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

606
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:53,958
GO AHEAD

607
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,458
CAN A SPIRIT POSSESS A PERSON'S BODY?

608
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,375
A SPIRIT CAN POSSESS, YES.

609
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,208
I MEAN, CAN IT REALLY ENTER A HUMAN BODY?

610
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:05,041
IT DEPENDS WHAT THE SPIRIT WANTS.

611
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,958
THE SPIRIT WANTS TO BE REBORN.

612
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:10,250
DID YOU HAVE AN ABORTION?

613
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,166
Perth.

614
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,333
What do you think
Ice's Facebook password is?

615
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:57,583
You know...

616
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,791
when people come up with a password,

617
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,208
they base it on something personal.

618
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,041
Like, their address,

619
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:08,125
birthday, or phone number.

620
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,333
Even their boyfriend's birthday.

621
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,041
Why do you want to know?

622
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,666
The guy had to chat with Ice
on Facebook for sure.

623
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,458
You will have to keep digging, then.

624
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:26,458
Perth.

625
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,208

It's leaking. It's all leaked out.

How is it leaking?
You didn't get it repaired?

645

I...

647
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:43,291
Well...

648
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,875
I came to get a book

649
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,416
that Ice borrowed from me.

650
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,583
Well...

651
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,125
I...

652
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:54,208
I needed it for an exam.

653
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:44,958
-Over here!
-Over here!

654

-Quick!
-Hurry!

655
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,958
-Over here!
-Give me the ball!

656
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:50,833
-Moss!
-Give me the ball!

657
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,083
-Pass it!
-You're gonna lose!

658
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,666
-Quick!
-Quick, over here!

659
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,291
On the Internet, it says...

660
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,083
do not use this
if over nine weeks pregnant.

661
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:48,666
Moss! Moss!

662
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,666
Moss, quickly!

663
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,125
Come on!

01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:18,833
Ice?

666
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,125
Ice?

667
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,666
Ice, you got stomach cramps?

668
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,000
Ice?

669
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:24,708
Ice?

670
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,958

01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,958
You need to step outside.

682
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:03,750
Where the hell are you?

683
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,625
Come on out!

684
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:07,958
Come out!

685
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:35,250
Don't worry.

686
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,875
Perth's going to be fine.

687
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:43,291
Perth?

688
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,500
Perth?

689
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:50,708
Perth!

690
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:53,625
Open up!

691
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,666
-Perth!
-Perth, open the door!

692
01:32:55,916 --> 01:32:56,791
Perth!

693
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,083
Perth, open the door!

694
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,125
-Perth, please open the door.
-Perth!

695
01:33:20,666 --> 01:33:21,541
Ouch.

696
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:28,916
-Perth!
-Perth!

697
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,750
Perth, open the door!

698
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:32,791
Perth!

699
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,208
Perth!

700
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:22,458
-Perth!
-Perth!

701
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,791
Perth!

702
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,166
Perth!

703
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:26,750
Perth?

704
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:27,750
Perth?

705
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:28,750
Perth!

706
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,541
Perth is suffering
from excess abdominal fluid build-up.

707
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,541
It is a symptom of having Hepatitis B.

708
01:34:36,041 --> 01:34:39,541
Teens usually contract the disease
through sexual intercourse.

709
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,416
Is there a cure, doctor?

710
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,208
Well, it could take up to...

711
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,166
Perth.

712
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,625
Perth, everything is okay now.

713
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:51,000
Mom.

714
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,750
I'm pregnant.

715
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:56,083
Mom!

716
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,125
It's in my tummy.

717
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,250
It's in my tummy, Mom.

718
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:02,541
-Mom, you have to help me.
-There is nothing wrong with you.

719
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:04,416
It's just some fluid in your stomach.

720
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,875
Here. Feel it for yourself. See?

721
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,708
But I really saw it with my own eyes.

722
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,041
Where did it go?

723
01:35:12,375 --> 01:35:13,291
-Where is it?
-Perth.

724
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,625
-It's in my tummy.
-Perth, relax.

725
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,041
-It's in my tummy.
-It's nothing.

726
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,750
-Perth.
-Really, Mom.

727
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:19,208
The doctor said it's just fluid.

728
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:21,875
I already gave him an injection
to relax the muscles.

729
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:24,666
Tomorrow I will have a psychiatrist
come and examine him.

730
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,625
Perth.

731
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:28,583
-Perth, trust me.
-Mom, help me.

732
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:30,333
Tomorrow, I will be here
early in the morning.

733
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,250
Damn it!

734
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:27,083
You're pathetic, Perth.

735
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,083
How gross.

736
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:32,916
So this is all it takes for you
to piss your pants.

737
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:36,583
Tan.

738
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:38,625
I...

739
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:43,541
I'm sorry.

740
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:46,708
Don't shit your pants yet.

741
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,583
You don't even know what I am going to do.

742
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,208
Did you know...

743
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:07,041
that I give Ice the money
for her abortion?

744
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,708
I didn't even ask her...

745
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:13,000
who the asshole was.

746
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:17,166
I just wanted her
to get past that shitty situation.

747
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,208
TOMORROW, I'M COMING OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE, OKAY?

748
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:27,208
SURE, THE POOL IS CLOSED.
I'LL BE HOME ALL DAY.

749
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:28,166
THANK YOU.

750
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:31,583
That day, Ice sent me a message

751
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,666
that she was going to come over.

752
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,541
So I don't believe...

753
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:42,083
that she would kill herself.

754
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:47,291
I am getting back with Tan.

755
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:49,250
No.

756
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,583
I won't let you get back
together with Tan.

757
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:53,833
I didn't come here
to ask for your permission.

758
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:55,541
I just want to let you know.

759
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:57,541
No, you can't!

760
01:38:58,375 --> 01:38:59,333
I beg you.

761
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:00,708
Let's stay together, please?

762
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:02,875
-Let go.
-No.

763
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:07,291
Perth, let go! Perth!

764
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,333
Perth, let me go!

765
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:11,833
Perth!

766
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:14,291
Perth, let me go now!

767
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:15,708
Perth! Perth!

768
01:40:07,666 --> 01:40:08,583
I...

769
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:09,833
I'm...

770
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,166
I am sorry.

771
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,958
Just a sorry, and you think
I would let you go?

772
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,458
Today at 8:00 am,

773
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:30,958
the body of Mr. Tantai Gunta-in,

774
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,916
a 17-year-old swimmer was found

775
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,041
at the bottom of the city pool
in Chonburi province.

776
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:39,750
He was found with weights
tied to his ankles.

777
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:42,166
There were no signs of any struggle.

778
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,333
Police forensics say it was a suicide.

779
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:49,000
The reason was supposedly guilt,
for breaking his girlfriend's heart.

780
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:52,958
The event occurred at the same place
she took her own life earlier this year.

781
01:43:53,041 --> 01:43:55,916
Investigators will keep the case open...

782
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:04,958
6 MONTHS AFTER TAN'S DEATH

783
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:49,041
I left a part of me with you
For you to feel my warmth 

784
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:53,250
And tenderness

785
01:44:53,333 --> 01:45:00,333
Because I will always be with you
wherever you are

786
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:05,291
Until the day that you return

787
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:38,291
Tomorrow

788
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:44,500
Our lives may change

789
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:53,291
But tomorrow can't change our love

790
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:57,375
Tomorrow

791
01:45:57,458 --> 01:46:03,625
Our lives may change

792
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:11,083
But tomorrow can't change our love

793
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,916
I left a part of me with you
For you to feel my warmth

794
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:18,791
And tenderness

795
01:46:18,875 --> 01:46:22,291
Because I will always be with you
Wherever you are

796
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:29,041
Because I will always be with you
Wherever you are

797
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:34,083
Until the day that you return
