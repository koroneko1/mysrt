1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,839
There it is, our stage.

2
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,160
Do you guys have anything to say
before we go inside?

3
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:23,920
Like what?

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,000
Whatever you want to get off your chest.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,280
I think I do.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,000
WEDNESDAY, 16 FEBRUARY 2000

7
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,560
Don't let anyone wrap their arms
Around these shoulders

8
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,240
Don't let anyone hold these hands

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,119
Just think of me as a cat

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
Who is so easy to take care of

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,159
I'll be waiting around for you
To see how cute I am

12
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,960
I was born looking Chinese

13
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,719
I was born looking Chinese

14
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,640
You don't like it, right?
That's too bad

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,760
I look Chinese, so what?

16
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,799
Very good! Okay, you get full marks.

17
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,560
Please go back to your seat.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,239
Who's next? Who wants to sing next?

19
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,040
Let's see. Have you prepared a song?

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,959
SINGING CLASS

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,400
If you can't think of one,
just sing the alphabet.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,560
Who did that?

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,239
Koong! You did it!

24
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,159
"I just want to see your face.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Your face."

26
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,359
Hey.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480
Tuang, Koong, what's going on?

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,159
-What?
-Koong threw a paper ball at me.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,959
"Your face."

30
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,000
Koong...

31
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,280
What did you say?

32
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,359
No!

33
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,040
"I just want to see your face."

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,280
You threw it, right?

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,280
Tuang.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,199
Tossapol.

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,719
You're a big boy now,
but you can't even sing a song?

38
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,280
Come on! Just sing!

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,639
I just want to see your face

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,199
All right. You can go back to your seat.

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,919
Okay.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,120
Since you're mouthing lyrics
to your friend,

43
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,840
you're going to sing next, Earn.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
What the hell was that?

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,759
I don't love you that much
I just want to see your face

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,960
I don't like you that much
I just want to see your face

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't miss you that much
I just want to see your face

48
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,000
That's all

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,599
We're just neighbors and nothing more

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,719
Nothing more, that's all

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,199
I just want to see your face, that's all

52
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,360
That's all

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,479
Koong, can I ask you something?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,439
What kind of song is this?

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,439
JUST WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE

56
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,000
You asked the right person.

57
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,439
It's a rock song.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,639
So how are rock songs like?

59
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,199
Rock songs are fast.

60
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,800
I see.

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,039
But what if the song is slow?

62
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,520
If the song is slow, it is a love song.

63
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,560
So rock songs and love songs
are the only two kinds of songs, right?

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,199
No, there are two kinds,
but they're either from RS or Grammy.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,319
If you don't believe me,
listen to the radio.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
The songs will be either one of the two.

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,079
What about country music?

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Thai classical
and Northeastern-style songs?

69
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,600
Are they fast?
If so, then they are rock songs.

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
That's bullshit!

71
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,639
Bullshit!

72
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,680
This is none of your business, Kay!

73
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,720
Mom is here.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,079
I'm leaving.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,839
Tossapol.

76
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,120
You're free, right?

77
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,240
Earn!

78
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,879
Earn!

79
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,319
What's up, Ped?

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,759
Your grandma is here.
I was asked to come and get you.

81
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,800
Okay.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, Earn.

83
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,920
Your family sells
music cassette tapes, right?

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,319
You must have lots of music
to listen to, then.

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
Yes.

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
That's so cool.

87
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,759
But I don't want to sell cassette tapes.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Actually, I want to be a singer,

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,680
so I can release my own album
and sell it at my shop.

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
Really?

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,759
Your customers will probably think
it's funny

93
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,360
that the person selling the tapes
looks like the artist on the cover.

94
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,240
So why do you like listening to music?

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,639
I don't know.

96
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,079
When I listen to music,
I lose myself in it.

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,920
I guess it's like having company.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Listen to this.

99
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Before the sky clears up

100
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,079
Before the warmth of the sunlight

101
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,360
Before the flowers bloom

102
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,480
Before your sweet dreams

103
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,120
You can feel it, right?

104
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,519
Yes.

105
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,199
Earn, your grandma is here.

106
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,240
Okay.

107
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,959
Oh, Ped.

108
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,560
This tape has the song
I was trying to tell you this morning.

109
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,639
Listen to it.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,759
I would like to hear you sing that song.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,040
-Goodbye. Be safe.
-Goodbye.

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,079
Bye.

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
Earn!

114
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,680
When do you want the tape back?

115
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,759
Before this Saturday.

116
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
I'm moving to Bangkok soon. See you.

117
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:19,079
My heart and my soul belong to you

118
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,040
I promise that for the rest of my life

119
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,759
I will be here to fight for you

120
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,639
My heart belonged to no one
Until your love came into my life

121
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,919
Now, I see everything
So brightly and clearly

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,679
I never had someone to call my own
Until your love gave me

123
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,639
The strength to live on

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,759
My heart belonged to no one

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,200
Until your love came into my life

126
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,679
Now, I see everything
So brightly and clearly

127
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,519
I never had someone to call my own

128
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,360
Until your love gave me

129
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,960
The strength to live on

130
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,120
What's going on?

131
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,799
It's loud enough to bring the house down.

132
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,879
Why didn't you take off your shoes?

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Look, you've stained your sheets!

134
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,159
Go and take a shower now.
It's time for dinner.

135
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,240
Then do your homework after.
Come down now.

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
PAWNSHOP

137
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,200
This is heaven on earth
For you to rest and sleep

138
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,879
Hello, ma'am.

139
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
Don't look back

140
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,639
What happened to your face?

141
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,559
Don't mind it.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Anyway, what's up?

143
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,759
Oh, I want to borrow
your guitar and songbook.

144
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,840
What do you need them for?

145
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,279
I thought you looked cool
when I saw you playing,

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,279
so I want to play too.

147
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay.

148
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,919
You can borrow it.

149
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm sick of a person here
who's trying to copy me all the time.

150
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,960
I don't love you that much
I just want to see your face

151
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,879
I don't like you that much
I just want to see your face

152
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,759
I don't miss you that much
I just want to see your face, that's all

153
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,840
DIAMOND SOUND

154
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,840
I don't love you that much

155
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,879
I don't like you that much

156
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,480
I just want to see your face

157
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,919
May I please speak to Earn?

158
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
Earn?

159
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,399
She is already asleep.

160
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,080
Don't you know what time it is?
It's bedtime.

161
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,960
When you call someone next time,
be sure to remember your manners.

163
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,600
By the way, who is this?

164
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,279
Who is this?

165
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,759
It's Koong, sir.

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Koong?

167
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,360
Koong, it's already late.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,960
We're about to sleep.

169
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Next time, don't call this late again.

170
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,399
You're late.

171
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,679
How can I not love you?

172
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,559
If I can't love you
What is the use of having a heart?

173
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,879
If I can't love you
What is the use of having a heart?

174
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Good job!

175
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
Very good.

176
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
Who's next?

177
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,440
Tuang, you're next.

178
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,120
I would like to dedicate this song
to the newest couple in our class.

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,039
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

180
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

181
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

182
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,279
Bang Earn! I'm here
Can you hear me?

183
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,399
-Ped.
-What?

184
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
Koong likes Earn. Spread the word.

185
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,480
I'm just really down to earth!

186
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,759
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

187
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

188
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,919
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,679
Bang Earn and Koong!

190
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,840
Koong likes Earn!

191
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,039
You got it all wrong. It's not true.

192
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,759
-We're just friends!
-Koong likes Earn!

193
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,519
You got it all wrong. It's not true.

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,159
Koong, I don't want anyone to like me

195
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,679
and I don't like it
when people do stupid things.

196
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,559
You got it all wrong. It wasn't me.

197
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,000
-What?
-Then who was it?

198
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,840
It's not me. You've all got it wrong.

199
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,600
It's not me.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's not true.

201
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,240
Hey, no. It's not true. It's someone else.

202
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,080
Bangkok, really?

203
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,679
You believe me, right?

204
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,559
That I didn't call Earn?

205
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,399
Yes.

206
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,799
Let's go home.

207
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,639
Let's go, Ped.

208
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,080
So often that my heart

209
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,080
Koong, where are you going?

210
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,879
I'm going to practice playing the guitar!

211
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,960
I will learn all the songs this summer!

212
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,600
I cry

213
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,200
For no reason

214
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,399
I am lost

215
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,080
Among all the people and chaos

216
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,039
I look for you and find no one

217
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,480
Since you walked away

218
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,519
20 MAY 2006
FAREWELL CHETTU CLASS 46

219
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,679
Summer is not the same without you

220
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,039
I look at the sky

221
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,319
Summer is not the same without you

222
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,279
Ped, I don't see any hotties.

223
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,200
Did you check the front of the stage?

224
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,839
Summer is not the same without you

225
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,279
You're so cool!

226
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,200
Let's go!

227
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,279
Thank you, everyone,

228
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,960
for having fun with us here tonight.

229
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
I would like to thank Kay as well.

230
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,839
-Where do we go next, Koong?
-I don't know.

231
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
Hey, look at that girl.

232
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,960
Which one?

233
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,880
That one.

234
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,599
Is she cute?

235
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,119
CHETTUPONBURANA SCHOOL

236
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,799
I would like to place a card here.

237
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,000
My turn is over.

238
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,240
Did you hear about the new student?
She's in Class Two.

239
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,519
She transferred in her last year.

240
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes, and she's cute, too!

241
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,000
The new semester just started
and you're already messing around?

242
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,319
Don't you want to see who the new girl is?

243
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,200
Can't you see what I'm doing right now?
Don't talk to me.

244
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,039
You are a senior,
yet you still play cards.

245
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,599
You don't know anything.
It's the era of card games now.

246
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,720
I guarantee that you'll be stunned
when you see her.

247
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,240
I'll smack your head if I'm not.

248
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,759
She is the girl
I told you about the other day.

249
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,119
Earn.

250
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,880
Ped

251
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,960
Tossapol Angkasetwittayakom
from Class One in sixth grade.

252
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
You still remember him?
What about this guy? Do you remember him?

253
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,920
He's the one who played
the guitar at the party, right?

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,359
I was there, too. It was awesome.

255
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,319
No, that was Kay, his twin brother.

256
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,480
This is Koong, the guy everyone teased
for liking you, which made you upset.

257
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Bang Earn! Bang Earn!

258
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,599
Oh, I remember now.

259
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,400
And this guy sang...

260
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,559
Hey!

261
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,039
Gosh, you still remember that!

262
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,839
Oh, I have to go.
I'll talk to you guys later.

263
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,519
Earn has grown up to be quite cute!

264
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,680
What kind of girl grows up to be so cute?

265
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,279
Everyone says she is really cute

266
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,039
What kind of girl grows prettier
The more you look at her?

267
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,240
The more I look, the prettier you get
Your beauty has no mercy

268
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,880
What kind of girl grows up to be so cute?
Why are you so beautiful?

269
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,519
Everyone says she is really cute
The more I look, the more stunning she is

270
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,359
What kind of girl grows prettier
The more you look at her?

271
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,839
Why are you so beautiful?

272
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,599
The more I look, the prettier you get
Your beauty has no mercy

273
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,400
With every glance, you get prettier
Your beauty has no mercy

274
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,400
I've been thinking all night.

275
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,200
I think we should form our own band.

276
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,279
What about your cards?

277
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,720
Card games are out.

278
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,920
It's now the era of music bands.

279
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
Do you realize how many times
you went from one thing to another?

280
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,599
It's now the era of the yo-yo.

281
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,680
Damn, yo-yos are lame now.

282
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,640
Hey, Ped!
The era of roller blades is coming!

283
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
Hey, why can't I get up?

284
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,400
The era of roller blades is over.

285
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
I think this is the year for dancers.

286
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
But I'm serious about this era.

287
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,720
This is my guitar pick.

288
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
You'll play the bass, okay?

289
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,839
I'll pass.

290
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,720
You know, girls love bass players.

291
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,039
You see that guy who's playing basketball?

292
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
He will be our drummer.

293
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,839
His name is Ex.

294
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
Just by listening
to how he dribbles the ball,

295
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,680
I can tell that he is really skillful.

296
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,759
Look.

297
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,160
He springs off his feet.

298
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,799
When he steps on the bass pedal,
it trembles.

299
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,839
Look at his powerful wrists.

300
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,680
He can pound the drums really hard!

301
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,759
Gosh! Look!

302
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Judging from how he plays,
he must be a drummer who is...

303
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,440
-Shit!
-Shit!

304
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,119
I think we should wait until Ex recovers
before we start practicing.

305
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
It's too late.

306
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,200
Attention, all students.
This Saturday, June 10th,

307
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,839
will be the debut concert
of the band Koong and Friend

308
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,839
at the first floor of Kad Suan Kaew
Central Mall at 3 p.m.

309
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,519
The band is composed of Koong and Ped
from Class Three, and Ex from Class Four.

310
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,240
Koong would like to inform everyone
that it will be an awesome event.

311
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,240
It will definitely be a wild party
where you can scream and let loose!

312
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,799
We can't let our fans down.

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,799
It's him instead of me

314
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,440
You just have to pluck the top string.

315
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,799
When you pluck the string,
just keep following this rhythm, okay?

316
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,079
-You have one hour, okay?
-Okay.

317
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,839
One. Two. Three. Four.

318
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,440
Okay?

319
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,000
Koong and Friend, ready!

320
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,400
Three. Two. One.

321
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,480
Why the hell did you take your shirt off?

322
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,160
I'm thirsty. I'll grab a Pepsi.

323
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,599
-Hey, get me some snacks, too.
-Okay.

324
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
-What about mine?
-What?

325
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,960
-I'm hungry.
-Here you go.

326
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,440
Three. Two. One.

327
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,160
Hey, wait. I got goosebumps.

328
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,599
Hey, no need to be nervous.

329
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,799
No, I need to take a shit!

330
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,440
Sorry, it's the cast.
Taking my pants off took a while.

331
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,000
Hello, Mom. I'm really busy now.

332
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,599
Why don't you tell Kay to buy it?
Soy sauce?

333
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,960
Which kind? What's the difference
between number one and five?

334
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,599
I've turned my mobile phone off.
Turn off yours, too. Such a waste of time.

335
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,319
Hey, Ped. Hurry up!

336
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,880
Koong and Friend, ready! Three. Two. One.

337
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,039
Time is up, guys.

338
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,960
Hey.

339
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,519
Are you sure about this?

340
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,759
Yes.

341
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
TEACHING SKILLS FOR JUNIOR ART MASTER

342
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,039
Hello, everyone.

343
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,559
Today, we will have Koong and Friend

344
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,880
from Chettuponburana High School
to play for us.

345
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
Please raise your hands
if you want to hear them.

346
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,559
Very good.

347
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,359
Please give them a big round of applause
as they kick off with "Busaba."

348
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,400
My name is Busaba

349
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,759
Busaba's birth came with joy

350
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,640
Her world is filled with blossoms
In her heart

351
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,319
Every day, she makes beautiful garlands

352
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,720
The world is beautiful due to her garlands

353
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,279
-Not "Busaba" by Nicole Theriault?
-No, not that one.

354
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,240
Various colors and types of flowers

355
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,000
And the smell is so tempting

356
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,759
Decorate this world and make it beautiful

357
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,000
It's blood!

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,119
She makes her garlands with all her heart

359
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,440
Always and every day

360
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,519
Never tired of making garlands

361
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,000
Hey, let go of me!

362
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,759
So lame.

363
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,599
How was it, Koong and Friend?

364
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,240
Oh, you look upset.
I better talk to Koong.

365
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,319
I heard that Hotwave Music Awards
will be accepting applications soon,

366
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,759
so will Koong and Friend apply?

367
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,440
Music is not for competition.

368
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,880
It's for making kids cry, right?

369
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,839
Right?

370
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,759
Let's go.

371
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,079
Where are you going? Don't be mad.

372
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,279
The band is upset now.

373
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,920
Hey, are you mad? Damn it!
You're mad at me?

374
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,519
When will we get to practice again?

375
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,319
I don't know. I'm starting to get bored.

376
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,680
Just an arm's length apart
But I feel so far away

377
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,160
You are like my best friend
So I can't risk telling you

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,400
Just an arm's length apart
But I feel so far away

379
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,599
You are like my best friend
So I can't risk telling you

380
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,119
That I love you

381
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,920
Tell Ex to meet us in the music room.

382
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,119
I told you, music isn't for competing.

383
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,559
It's for flirting with girls!

384
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,000
Sorry, I got carried away.

385
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,039
Amazing!

386
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,519
You should have told me you're this good,
so I could invite you to join the band.

387
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,160
Like at the Art Master event?

388
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,799
Hey, I think you guys really rocked there.
I could feel the vibe.

389
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,839
Hey, you've got good taste.
You can really see talent.

390
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,960
See, I told you. We're cool!

391
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,799
Hey, the school band will practice here,

392
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,319
so stop playing now.

393
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,079
Kay.

394
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
Didn't your band break up already?

395
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,160
Yes, this is my new band.

396
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,279
Hey.

397
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,319
We have to practice
for the Hotwave Music Awards.

399
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,680
If you guys just do this for fun,
then please play somewhere else.

400
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,440
We're not doing this for fun.
We're competing as well.

401
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,680
Are you?

402
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,720
Surprised, aren't you?

403
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,359
Now,

404
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,759
we have a really talented guitarist.

405
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,559
Your band can't compete with her.

406
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's go practice somewhere else.

407
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
Let the amateurs play here.

408
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,279
Wait!

409
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,839
Where are you going?

410
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,160
Oh, Mr. Surakiat asked me
to film Kay's new band.

411
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,039
What do you know about them?
Tell me everything.

412
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,519
Sure, listen.

413
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,519
After the senior band members graduated,

414
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,160
Kay started to gather
all the best musicians in our batch.

415
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
It started with the best bass player,

416
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,920
Ratchamung!

417
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,000
PLUCKING

418
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,039
Then came the drummer
who can hit like thunder, hence the name,

419
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,440
Dome Thunder.

420
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,920
BANGING

421
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,480
The lead singer with a high-powered voice
goes by the name

422
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,599
Tem Impact.

423
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
SHATTERING

424
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,119
And their guitarist,

425
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,799
Kay, who can make the audience cry.

426
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,559
SCREAM

427
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,760
They formed the band known as The Arena.

428
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,360
I think he reads too many comics.

429
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
Hey, Koong.

430
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,599
I think we shouldn't join the contest.

431
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,639
What the hell?

432
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,679
Why do we have to be scared of them?

433
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,199
We've already got Earn.

434
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,679
Wait a minute. Did you even ask her
if she wants to be in it?

435
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,679
I'm in.

436
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,679
When I was in Bangkok, I was in a band

437
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,760
that competed in the Hotwave Music Awards.

438
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,079
It's the biggest contest
for high school students.

439
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:00,519
The band that makes it to the final
might get to release their own album.

440
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,159
But my band didn't make it.

441
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,719
When I found out
that we had to move back here,

442
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,800
I accepted the fact that I won't be able
to compete this year.

443
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,719
But when Koong invited me,

444
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
I became hopeful again.

445
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
No worries, Earn.

446
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,440
When Ex gets better,

447
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,360
we will practice really hard

448
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,360
and make it to the final round together.

449
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,199
He just told me
that he is already bored with it.

450
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,119
What?

451
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,960
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

452
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,599
I'm leaving.

453
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
Let's pack up and go home.

454
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
What did you say?

455
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,440
-We're all booked.
-What?

456
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,000
All booked?

457
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,360
Let's go to my family's bakery.

458
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,559
-Is Dad here?
-He's gone out.

459
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Hey, are you taking us to Bakery Music?

460
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,320
Yes, something like that.

461
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,320
Where is your drum set?

462
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
It's somewhere here.

463
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,920
I think this place will do.

464
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,280
Only you

465
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,920
If you look deep into my heart
There is only you

466
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
Time stops for you

467
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,280
You ignite my soul with passion

468
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,360
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

469
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,239
Just looking at you

470
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Takes my heart away

471
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,320
My love has blossomed
During the time that has passed

472
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,840
If tonight, I have only you

473
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,559
Hold my hand, my heart quivers

474
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,079
There is only me and my love for you

475
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,840
I will love you forever with all my heart

476
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,199
Only you

477
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:39,400
Please let me stand by your side

478
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,880
At this moment, there is only you

479
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,360
Who is dancing with me

480
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,400
I think Earn made our band cooler.

481
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,559
Don't be silly.

482
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,840
The contest rules say

483
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,119
that all bands must play
one original composition.

484
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,000
How do we start writing a song?

485
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
Ped, can you write one?

486
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,199
No, I don't know how.

487
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,400
Yes, you do. You won a prize
for song composition in second grade.

488
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,519
Gosh, that was for a poem.

489
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,480
Shit!

490
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,800
"The song must be a love song
without the word 'love'."

491
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
A LOVE SONG WITHOUT THE WORD "LOVE"

492
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,000
How can it be a love song, then?

493
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,199
I don't think it will be hard.

494
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,719
All we need is to be in love to write one.

495
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,239
But I'm not in love.

496
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,039
So you didn't like me back in sixth grade?

497
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,519
What is with the two of you?

498
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
Tell me.

499
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Well, back then...

500
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,920
Hey, don't interrupt.

501
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,320
Go on.

502
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,079
Back then, everyone thought
that Koong had a crush on me,

503
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,159
but it was just Tuang
who started the rumor.

504
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,960
-So what happened?
-One night,

505
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:39,480
someone called me really late
and said his name was Koong.

506
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,199
Hey, Ped. Why are you playing it now?

507
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,480
But, really, I wasn't the guy
who called you that night.

508
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,920
So, I'm sorry

509
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,480
for accusing you back then.

510
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,480
No worries.

511
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,920
That was a long time ago.

512
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,679
Earn.

513
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,679
By the way, do you have a boyfriend?

514
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Why did you ask?

515
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,119
If you are in love,
then you can write a love song.

516
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,199
No, not yet.

517
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,599
Aren't you a lesbian?

518
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,000
You're crazy.

519
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,760
I just asked
since you seem to be quite the tomboy.

520
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,280
What about you, Ped?

521
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,599
Do you have someone you like?

522
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,199
Ped? No way.

523
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,320
How do you know?

524
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Ever since I've known him,

525
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,440
he has never hit on a girl.

526
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,559
Are you sure?

527
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,599
Yes, I haven't had a crush yet.

528
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,519
What about you, Ex?

529
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,599
Me? None.

530
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,760
He does!

531
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:43,920
Dad!

532
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,440
He likes a girl named Som.

533
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,239
You know, "Oh, Som."

534
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,280
Dad, no!

535
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,840
One day,

536
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
I heard him talking to himself
in his room.

537
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,800
Oh, Som...

538
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,159
At first, I thought something was wrong
with him.

539
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,119
It wasn't until I saw him

540
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,159
that I knew exactly what happened.

541
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,559
Gosh, even during the middle of the day.

542
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,960
You can borrow one of my DVDs next time.

543
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,760
Don't listen to my dad. The truth is,

544
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,679
I didn't dare approach Som.
All I could do was look at her photo.

545
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,440
I accidentally spilled orange juice on it
and cried out.

546
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,360
Som!

547
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,519
No...

548
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,800
I then got some tissue to clean it.

549
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,920
I was going to throw them away,

550
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,679
but I ran into my dad at the door.

551
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,760
That's all there was to it.

552
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,360
Hey, there's more.

553
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,880
Did he ever tell you about the doughnut?

554
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,760
-Shit.
-Please tell us.

555
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,599
-Customers are waiting downstairs, Dad.
-Well...

556
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,639
-No, Dad!
-I passed by the bathroom--

557
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,559
Leave, Dad.

558
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:10,039
-Come to me if you want to know anything.
-Leave now.

559
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,760
Hey, why don't we let Ex write the song
since he is in love right now?

560
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,119
You don't know anything.

561
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,320
The one in the love is usually
the most clueless one about it.

562
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,400
GREAT KNOWLEDGE
GOOD DISCIPLINE

563
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,320
You can observe how Ex flirts with Som.

564
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,320
Write down anything that works.

565
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,000
It's bright and sunny this morning.
She arrives early.

566
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,360
The weather is cold. I arrive early, too.

567
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,440
I walk straight to her, my dream girl.

568
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,039
I turn the faucet on.
The water is wonderfully refreshing.

569
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,400
I hammer the nails,
watching her move her arms.

570
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,599
She's beautiful when she kicks
her left leg and moves her right arm.

571
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,880
Oh, shit! She's coming my way.

572
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:33,880
I act brave and stand up...

573
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,000
Move out of the way!

574
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,400
...to shoot some hoops.

575
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,639
2009 CHETTUPONBURANA HOMECOMING

576
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,440
I've traded blows in this boxing ring.
There's no turning back.

577
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,559
A punch to the lower torso, the body,
followed by the one to the ears.

578
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,360
There she is.
She's headed this way, my darling.

579
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,679
Our eyes meet.

580
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,480
Oh, my God!

581
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,760
Stop!

582
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,719
Shit!

583
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I begin seeing stars.

584
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,920
How is it?

585
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,199
It's rubbish.

586
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,719
I didn't see him do anything.

587
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm shy.

588
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,079
If you like her, just tell her.

589
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,039
Really?

590
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,119
Yes?

591
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,000
It's nothing.

592
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,400
Otherwise, how will she know?

593
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:05,239
See, even a girl can speak her mind.

594
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,840
You are such a wimp!

595
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,039
If you are so skillful,

596
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,360
then show me how it's done.

597
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:12,920
All right.

598
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,800
After Som finishes her dance
in the event tomorrow,

599
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,440
bring her a gift and use that opportunity
to talk to her.

600
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:21,719
That's it. It's that simple.

601
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,679
If I did that, she would be mine already.

602
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,519
So cocky!

603
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,400
-Get him, too!
-Hey.

604
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,239
You idiot.

605
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,480
You guys are free, right?

606
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,880
Can you come help move some stuff?

607
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,199
MUSIC ROOM

608
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,760
What kind of gift should I give to her?

609
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:54,719
Well, it can be flowers, dolls,
or something similar.

610
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,119
If I can't use the word "love",
then which word should I use?

611
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,559
Well, you can use "like",

612
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,559
"miss",

613
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,760
"care."

614
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,440
Something like that.

615
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,079
I think we all have our own words for it.

616
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:16,440
For Ex, I guess it's probably the word
"wimp" or something.

617
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,360
I think "horny" suits him more.

618
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,400
What about you, Ped?
Which word would you use?

619
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,239
"Lovely..."

620
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,119
I guess.

621
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,719
Hey, you can't.
It still has the word "love" in it.

622
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,159
Don't cheat.

623
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,679
Oh, right.

624
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,639
DIAMOND SOUND

625
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,960
This should be enough for now.

626
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,079
I made you a list of songs
that don't have the word "love" in it.

627
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,440
It's in this bag.

628
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:16,880
Wouldn't it be better
if you write the song?

629
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Well, I don't know.

630
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,760
I think the song should be about
a guy's perspective.

631
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,000
Besides,

632
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:30,280
Koong will be the one singing it.

633
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,360
It's better if you write it.

634
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,199
Come on, it won't be that difficult.
Just write about your feelings.

635
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
My feelings?

636
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,800
Like how you feel when you like someone.

637
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,320
You have never liked anyone before?

638
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,000
EARN

639
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,920
SONG

640
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,000
What's up, Koong?

641
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:06,679
Be honest with me.

642
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,840
Do you like Earn?

643
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,199
No.

644
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,840
Are you sure?

645
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:17,480
Yes.

646
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
Why did you ask?

647
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,639
Are you sure?

648
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,840
I am.

649
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,719
I don't like her.

650
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,920
I knew it! Tuang is so full of it.

651
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:29,920
He said that he saw you guys flirting.

652
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,000
Plus, he said he saw you guys
holding hands, too!

653
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,760
We were carrying a drum.

654
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:40,159
Shit! I shouldn't have listened to him.

655
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,280
Is this what you came here for?

656
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,320
Are you writing a song?

657
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
How far along are you?

658
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,039
-It's not finished yet.
-Let me see.

659
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,360
Hey, Koong! Don't look at it.
It's not done yet.

660
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,000
"The song that you hear,

661
00:49:58,239 --> 00:49:59,920
do you know that I didn't write it?

662
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,760
I don't dare to confess, my darling.

663
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,639
Do you know who wrote this song?

664
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,920
Remember, that person is you."

665
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,280
-Did you write this yourself?
-Yes.

666
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:12,679
What's the title?

667
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
It doesn't have one yet.

668
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,280
It's not bad.

669
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,840
Man, it really hits home!

670
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,119
Damn! It's exactly how I feel!

671
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:28,800
Holy shit!

672
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,719
Damn!

673
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,320
I like Earn!

674
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,000
I like Earn!

675
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,920
You are the first one to know.

676
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,679
Remember that day
back in elementary school,

677
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,880
when everyone was teasing me
that I liked Earn?

678
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,559
I couldn't get her crying face
out of my mind.

679
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,559
When she moved to Bangkok,
I tried to forget her.

680
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,400
But who would have thought
that she would come back?

681
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,840
This made me realize how much I like her.

682
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,039
Look.

683
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,400
It's the paint she got on me.
I still haven't washed it off.

684
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:05,559
Here.

685
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:06,639
I won't bother you anymore.

686
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:08,599
I just wanted to let you know.

687
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:11,360
Hurry up and finish the song, okay?

688
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,440
So I can sing it
and let her know how I feel.

689
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,639
Good luck! Later!

690
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,920
SONG...

691
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,159
EARN

692
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,519
2009 CHETTUPONBURANA HOMECOMING

693
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,920
I'm standing alone

694
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,280
-It's so lonely inside my heart
-It's so lonely inside my heart

695
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,760
I'm all alone, can you hear me?

696
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,039
My heart is so lonely

697
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:14,400
Earn.

698
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,760
No, thanks. You can give it to Ped.

699
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:21,000
But I already bought it.
Please help me finish it.

700
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:25,119
I need someone
Who will take care of my heart

701
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,000
I've got sensitive teeth.

702
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,280
I can't really drink cold drinks.

703
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,360
Thanks.

704
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,280
I have love in my heart

705
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,920
Kay is really cool, right?

706
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:49,119
No way. You are much cooler than him.
He just likes to strike handsome poses.

707
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:50,840
He's not even that good-looking.

708
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:53,239
Then that applies to you, too.

709
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:54,679
Come on.

710
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,119
We don't look alike. Look carefully.

711
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:02,400
Yes, that's true.

712
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,000
Kay is more good-looking.

713
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,239
Earn!

714
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm all alone, can you hear me?

715
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:13,440
Hello, Dad?

716
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,280
My heart is so lonely

717
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:19,119
Ped.

718
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:20,400
What?

719
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,880
You can leave when the concert is over.

720
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,920
Why?

721
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,880
I need someone
Who will take care of my heart

722
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,679
I'm going to confess to Earn.

723
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,800
I can't take it any more
I just want to say something

724
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:35,280
Then, I better leave now.

725
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,440
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

726
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,360
I want to finish writing the song.

727
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,400
I have love in my heart

728
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,599
Thanks, dude!

729
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,960
YOU ARE THE ONE

730
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,599
Disappointment

731
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,719
Has already found its way to you

732
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,360
Right?

733
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,280
The defeat

734
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:46,199
Must be almost unbearable

735
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,320
When you are hurt, just cry out

736
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,840
Until you are left 

737
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:59,159
With only the tears

738
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,159
To fall back on

739
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:10,000
Let your tears flow freely
Don't hold anything back

740
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,920
Let it go

741
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,679
Let your tears help your heart remember

742
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,960
How much you were hurt

743
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:28,840
EARN

744
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
There is no one

745
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:36,280
Except your tears
To help you get through this

746
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,880
Remember

747
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,639
No matter how bad it hurts
Let the tears rub the pain away

748
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,320
Ped! Koong is calling you.

749
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:08,559
Ped.

750
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,800
What's up?

751
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,159
Can you come see me?

752
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,519
Where are you?

753
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,039
I'm on the train. I'm going to Bangkok.

754
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,039
Hey!

755
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,360
Why are you going there?

756
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:26,320
I have to go...

757
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,119
because I can't stay here.

758
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,480
You had better come now.
And bring some money.

759
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,800
I already bought the tickets.

760
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,960
Mom, I'm staying over at Koong's tonight
to study for an exam.

761
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,559
Liar!

762
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:04,559
So?

763
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:23,800
It's my first love
And my heart is broken into pieces

764
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,840
Is it too soon for this kind of sorrow?

765
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,159
After I finished watching Som dance,

766
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,079
I invited Earn to come over
to the tree people talked about.

767
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,400
They said that whoever confessed there
will have a happy ending.

768
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:42,760
Once I got there, I gave it my best shot.

769
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,719
Earn.

770
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,960
I'm not a smooth talker
But I love with all my heart

771
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,760
Whatever you like, I will find for you

772
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:03,960
I'm not a smooth talker...

773
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,519
Why did you let me listen to this song?

774
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,599
I like you, Earn.

775
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,320
Instead of accepting my love,

776
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,800
all she did was talk about the band.

777
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,199
I tried my best to persuade her,
but she said...

778
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,199
You should give up, Koong.

779
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,119
So I told her

780
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,519
that I don't want to play music anymore.

781
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,039
If you want to play,
then do it with someone else.

782
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:37,199
And?

783
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,440
She just walked away.

784
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:43,480
Shit! Why are you such an idiot?

785
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,559
I'm glad you came, Ped.

786
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,239
Did you invite Ex as well?

787
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,519
I called, but his dad picked up the phone

788
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:07,079
and said he would tell Ex that I called.

789
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,119
Oh, there you are.

790
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,039
Please take care of him.
It seems like he's in pretty bad shape.

791
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,840
What happened, Ex?

792
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,119
BOBBING FOR EGGS

793
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:33,519
Come on, Ex!

794
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,920
Ped, you know that I went bobbing for eggs

795
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:40,239
to win a stuffed bear for Som, right?

796
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,400
What did he get?

797
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,639
A pen!

798
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:49,760
Gosh!

799
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,559
I did that until I ran out of money
and my hands were all numb.

800
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,280
But I managed to win that bear for Som.

801
00:59:58,119 --> 00:59:59,039
Hey.

802
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,320
Look!

803
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,199
That tomboy's bear was bigger than mine!

804
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,679
I have orange juice, soda, and beer.
Cold drinks to refresh you.

805
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,320
Anyone want a drink?

806
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:41,360
How many cans of beer do you have, sir?

807
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,719
I have a lot.

808
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,480
I'm buying them all.

809
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,239
You drink beer, too?

810
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,800
Straws, please, sir.

811
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,400
You left without a word
I didn't get to prepare

812
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,840
I can't eat and I can't sleep

813
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:23,159
Even sugar tastes bitter to me

814
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:26,880
You hurt the one who loves you
You almost killed me

815
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,559
-I'm like an injured tiger 
-I'm like an injured tiger 

816
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,599
-Whose wound hasn't been healed
-Whose wound hasn't been healed

817
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,920
-If you don't mind...
-If you don't mind...

818
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,960
-Sorry, my friends are drunk.
-Bring him here with you

819
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,360
Let's openly talk

820
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,000
Hey! You're disturbing other people!

821
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,679
About you and that guy

822
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,840
-I have only one thing to ask of you
-I have only one thing to ask of you

823
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:55,559
-How could he take you away from me?
-How could he take you away from me?

824
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,880
-Let's meet at our usual place and time
-Let's meet at our usual place and time

825
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,000
-Please don't forget
-Please don't forget

826
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,679
Sending off the pain and sadness
That hurt me

827
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:13,400
Bidding you farewell
And wishing you a long-lasting love

828
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,000
Good luck to you as you distance yourself
From the man you don't want to be with

829
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:26,519
Let me ask for the check
So I can pay for all the sadness on my own

830
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,840
YOU SUCK

831
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,000
Hey, Koong.

832
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,320
You dragged us
all the way to Bangkok just for this?

833
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,800
For guys like us,

834
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,239
checking out an all-girls school

835
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,440
is as important as getting ordained
or drafted into the army.

836
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:40,480
Som.

837
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,400
Earn.

838
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,679
You girls! I'm going to punish all of you.

839
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,320
Where are you going this evening?

840
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,719
Shit! Something is wrong here.

841
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,159
Just wait and see.

842
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,199
I think these girls
all have good-looking friends.

843
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:22,159
Look!

844
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,880
Hey. Good-looking girls mostly have...

845
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,800
Crap!

846
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,199
Calm down! Close your eyes!
Don't look anymore!

847
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,039
Here we are.

848
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,079
What is this place?

849
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,199
This is where the final round
of the Hotwave Music Awards will be.

850
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,679
The era of music bands is not over yet.

851
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,480
I will forget about Earn!

852
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,119
From this point on,

853
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,920
I will only focus on this contest
and we will succeed together!

854
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,280
I will forget about Som, too!

855
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,119
But I will never forget that tomboy!

856
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,599
Let's shake on it.

857
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,079
Hey, Ped. Do you have anything to say?

858
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:04,400
-Like what?
-Anything you want to get off your chest.

859
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,800
I do.

860
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,039
-It's about the song.
-Gosh.

861
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,840
It's just one song. We've got each other.

862
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,719
We can all help write it.

863
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,880
All right.

864
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,119
From this moment on,

865
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,199
we're going to be reborn.

866
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,800
We will be rid of all our problems.

867
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,679
Soon,

868
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:42,920
our band will get to be in there.

869
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,400
ENTRANCE 1

870
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,800
The place behind those doors
is where our heroes had performed.

871
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,320
Kala.

872
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:07,159
Clash.

873
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:13,119
Labanoon.

874
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,719
-Bodyslam!
-Bodyslam!

875
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,880
I've been so tired, I've almost given up
I couldn't stand it anymore

876
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,760
I've walked until I could no longer do so
Because my dreams still seem so far away

877
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:41,559
Should I turn back
Because the road ahead

878
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:43,800
Is so difficult and cold?

879
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,400
My whole life, I believed in myself
But maybe I was wrong

880
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,360
Toon.

881
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,559
Bodyslam.

882
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:55,039
And now I'm the one who is lost

883
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,880
We have to follow our dreams

884
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,119
Hey, Koong!

885
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,559
No matter how many times we fall

886
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:07,159
Where will it end?

887
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:12,960
No matter how far you walk
You never get there

888
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,000
Promo for "Save My Life"
cut two, take two. End slate.

889
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,279
Who let this fair-faced boy in here?

890
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:29,079
Staff, please show them out.

891
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,800
The feeling isn't there yet, Toon.

892
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,560
Toon!

893
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,920
I'm Koong!

894
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,119
I will perform here one day!

895
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,920
That's right! And I'm Ex!
You will definitely see me!

896
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,399
Toon! I'm Ped!
Please don't mind my friends.

897
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,159
Help me, Toon!

898
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:48,560
Don't listen to them, Toon.

899
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,399
Nobody wants you here.

900
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:51,319
Please leave.

901
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,600
Toon!

902
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,000
Take my guitar pick.
I will make it here one day!

903
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Please remember me!

904
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,600
-We have to follow our dreams
-Toon!

905
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,760
No matter how many times we fall

906
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,960
Let me sing him a song first!

907
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,520
I love you, Toon! Don't forget me.

908
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,199
KOONG &amp; FRIEND

909
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:32,119
The era of sadness has already passed.

910
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,239
Starting today, our band will be reborn.

911
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,640
We freaking suck, man.

912
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,119
I got my heart broken.

913
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,439
JUST GIVE UP

914
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:13,319
TRY HARDER

915
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,319
Ex was heartbroken as well.

916
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,399
PSYCHOPATHIC BEAR

917
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:28,159
Ped didn't get his heart broken

918
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:30,600
because he has never hit on any girl.
Asshole!

919
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,119
PED RED SODA

920
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,880
We all suck.

921
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,920
LOSERS

922
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,640
But we won't give up.

923
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,079
We will form a band named SuckSeed,
which actually means "succeed."

924
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,199
This is for everyone
who has once failed like us,

925
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:58,760
so that they can stand up and be reborn.

926
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:12,239
It's going to be like the seeds
that will grow on this earth.

927
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,560
Now, I know why The Arena is really good.

928
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,159
It's because they don't waste time
on stupid things like you guys.

929
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:28,439
The Arena isn't even on my radar anymore.

930
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,199
It's just a typical band
that's trying to be cool.

931
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,960
It's nothing.

932
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:08,960
Well...

933
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,880
why are you sitting here alone?

934
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,840
Got your heart broken?

935
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,199
No, I broke someone's heart.

936
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,800
That's just Koong.

937
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,159
Don't mind him.

938
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,279
I don't, but I'm upset.

939
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,279
I want to say sorry for him.

940
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:47,560
Why are you saying sorry?
You didn't do anything wrong.

941
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:57,520
Don't you want to join us again?

942
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:02,039
No, I shouldn't.

943
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,920
I don't want to cause any trouble.

944
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,239
Are you waiting for someone?

945
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:16,119
No.

946
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,880
I should go now.

947
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,399
Earn.

948
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,520
I still want to see your face

949
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,159
on the cover of an album.

950
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,000
It's time to get serious now.

951
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,039
What about this one?

952
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,520
It's a signature model,
NC70 Model Pro Series.

953
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,359
Many famous musicians use this.

954
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,479
Can I have a look at that one?

955
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,319
It's a Flying V. You've got good taste.

956
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:21,760
Try it.

957
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,840
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

958
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,199
Can I have a look at that amplifier?

959
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,159
You really have good taste.
It has great sound.

960
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,359
A very clean sound. No hissing at all.

961
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,199
If the sound cracks,
it has a limiter and an equalizer.

962
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:41,960
Many famous musicians use this.

963
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,520
Do they usually step
with the right foot or the left?

964
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,800
I don't know. Left, I guess.

965
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,880
Good. I will use my right foot, then.

966
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,880
Salute!

967
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,720
Let me hear some noise!

968
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,439
Rockers!

969
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,199
I love everyone.

970
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
This is it.

971
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,880
You have decided? That one, right?

972
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,119
No, I want that bass.

973
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:21,680
You definitely have good taste.

974
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,439
Here.

975
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,560
Are you really buying this for me?

976
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,119
Hell no. I bought it for myself.

977
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:35,840
But I'll let you borrow it.

978
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,560
When people notice how cool the bass is,
they won't notice that you suck.

979
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:41,119
Carry it.

980
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:49,119
Believe me. We are like kings.

981
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,199
It's so cold

982
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:02,600
My heart is almost torn 

983
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,000
Because I am without the warmth
Of your love

984
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,119
I have written over ten songs

985
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,000
and he didn't like any of them.
I want to punch him so bad.

986
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:16,760
Hey, take it easy.

987
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:18,960
You know that he is really talented.

988
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:21,000
Talented, my ass. He sucks.

989
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:24,640
If I wasn't the lead singer of our band,
the girls won't go crazy over us.

990
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,079
Oh, come on.
At least, we've been playing together.

991
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:28,640
We don't need him.

992
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,119
Kay is an idiot.

993
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:33,640
He's really ugly, too.

994
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,760
I'm going to kick the shit out of him.

995
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,399
Damn it! Who the hell are you? Asshole!

996
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,880
What's going on?

997
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,159
Drench him, Koong!

998
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:44,560
Why did you say my name?

999
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:47,520
Oh, it's Koong. You asshole!

1000
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,920
Wait for me there.

1001
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:50,640
Don't run away.

1002
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,760
Hey, stop fighting.

1003
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,600
I'm not going anywhere.
Get your ass out here now!

1004
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,920
I will smack you with this!

1005
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:02,399
Don't! I'm not Koong!

1006
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,479
I'm Kay.

1007
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,720
Kay?

1008
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,319
You came just in time!

1009
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:21,239
Who did you get into a fight with?

1010
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:24,159
Forget it.

1011
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:27,640
I kicked Tem out of the band.

1012
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:31,199
Whatever. I don't care.

1013
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,119
Fine, then. I don't need
to tell you things anymore.

1014
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,359
We're dead!

1015
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,720
Let's go.

1016
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,840
Where?

1017
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,279
To practice, of course.

1018
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,600
Gosh!

1019
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,800
I'm here to return your CDs.

1020
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,680
There's no rush.

1021
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,560
I should return them now,

1022
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,119
in case you move away again.

1023
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:28,199
Don't be silly.

1024
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,079
How is The Arena doing?

1025
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,359
I happened to pass by the music room.
It looked like a lot of fun.

1026
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,319
Yes, I had a lot of fun,

1027
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,840
but I'm not used to it yet.
I often called Kay as Koong.

1028
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,600
Earn!

1029
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,720
How is your song coming along?

1030
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,279
I'm still working on it.

1031
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,520
Do you want to borrow these CDs first?

1032
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:06,319
No, it's okay.

1033
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,319
I'm leaving, then.

1034
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,119
7. JUST WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE

1035
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:46,079
I don't love you that much
I don't like you that much

1036
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,399
I just want to see your face

1037
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,880
I don't love you that much
I just want to see your face

1038
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,439
I don't like you that much
I just want to see your face

1039
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,239
I don't miss you that much
I just want to see your face

1040
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:12,840
That's all

1041
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,840
We're just neighbors and nothing more

1042
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,000
Nothing more, that's all

1043
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,000
I just want to see your face, that's all

1044
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,880
I HAVEN'T HEARD
"JUST WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE" IN A WHILE.

1045
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:07,760
DID YOU LISTEN TO IT?

1046
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,279
I DID.

1047
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,760
IS IT GOOD?

1048
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,880
Why don't you sound like Seak,
the singer of Loso?

1049
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:51,960
Go figure.

1050
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:00,319
Ped.

1051
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:04,079
Can I ask you something?

1052
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:08,800
What is it?

1053
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,199
How do you feel about me?

1054
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:22,279
What do you mean?

1055
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:28,359
Do you have a crush on me?

1056
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,479
I used to.

1057
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,479
What about now?

1058
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,479
Not anymore.

1059
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:56,920
All right.

1060
01:22:57,399 --> 01:22:58,479
I'm hanging up.

1061
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,960
Wait! Don't open it yet!

1062
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:34,199
Listen!

1063
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,399
The song that you hear

1064
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:41,840
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1065
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:45,840
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1066
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,000
Wait!

1067
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:50,159
Let me finish.

1068
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:55,319
Do you know who wrote this song?

1069
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,600
Remember, that person is you

1070
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,840
It's finished.

1071
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:25,960
The song that you hear
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1072
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,640
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1073
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,600
Do you know who wrote this song?

1074
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,960
Remember, that person is you

1075
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,920
Something like that?

1076
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:46,600
It's better than I imagined.

1077
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:48,119
You can write a song.

1078
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,560
Actually, I didn't write it for the band.

1079
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:04,920
Do you remember the phone call
when we were in sixth grade?

1080
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,840
Actually, Koong wasn't the one
who called you.

1081
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:16,079
It was you?

1082
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,079
So why did you lie?

1083
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:27,760
Because your dad sounded really mean
on the phone.

1084
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:36,039
So why did you call, then?

1085
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:01,279
I like you.

1086
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,399
I really like you.

1087
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:10,640
I still like you.

1088
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,000
I know.

1089
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:22,119
So what about you and Koong?

1090
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,479
No worries.

1091
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,439
Koong has been reborn.

1092
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:32,600
I mean, he said
he doesn't like you anymore.

1093
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,720
And...

1094
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,760
I also like...

1095
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,479
this song.

1096
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,960
What about me?

1097
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:53,199
Figure it out for yourself.

1098
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,159
Ped...

1099
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,079
What's going on?

1100
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:20,960
Hey, Ped.

1101
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:23,279
Where were you last night?

1102
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:27,159
Why do you ask?

1103
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:28,600
I called you all night.

1104
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:31,119
Your mom said you went out.
Where did you go?

1105
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:34,319
I went to find inspiration.

1106
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,439
I still can't come up with anything.

1107
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,800
Hey, don't worry.
I already thought of something.

1108
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,800
Our band's song can't be
about a hopeless romance

1109
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,680
because girls don't deserve

1110
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:46,960
our love.

1111
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,119
The song must be about friendship.

1112
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,720
The kind that women
won't be able to understand.

1113
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,439
Cool!

1114
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,600
Guys, isn't this a bit too much?

1115
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,159
You still don't get it, Ped.

1116
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,359
I have been with many girls.

1117
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:04,359
Listen to the hook of this song.

1118
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,479
Girls are bitches!

1119
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,840
You son of a bitch!

1120
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,760
What if no girls like our song?

1121
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,920
That's fine, Ped. You know why?

1122
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,079
Because all girls are selfish!

1123
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:38,640
Hey, your mom is a woman.

1124
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,640
Fuck you!
I was talking about teenage girls.

1125
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,159
They don't make sense!

1126
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,640
AMPHA CHICKEN RICE

1127
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,920
How come there is only chicken rice
and no duck rice?

1128
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,560
But I still like girls.

1129
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,479
You guys don't like girls anymore?

1130
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:00,039
I still do,

1131
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:03,760
but I hate girls who are sellers!

1132
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,199
This CD is very hard to sell.

1133
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,119
Can you buy one?

1134
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:12,960
Not only that, women are--

1135
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:15,039
Hey, enough already!

1136
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:16,880
I believe you now!

1137
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,800
There you go!

1138
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,319
Come on!

1139
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:22,800
Let's do it!

1140
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,359
One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1141
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:27,880
One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Go!

1142
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,159
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

1143
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,000
Yes! One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1144
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,600
One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1145
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,840
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

1146
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:41,680
EARN: CONCENTRATE!

1147
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:44,399
"Girls are nonsense!"

1148
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,000
Are we doing this for real?

1149
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,479
It sounds kind of shitty.

1150
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,640
Yes, it's really shitty.

1151
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:56,760
Come to think of it, we haven't done
anything meaningful in our lives.

1152
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,800
Heartache.

1153
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:00,119
A lot didn't make it.

1154
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:02,560
No one even remembers. No one cares.

1155
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,560
The only thing we can do
is endure the pain.

1156
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:07,840
Girls turned us down.

1157
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:09,399
We are always last.

1158
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:10,680
Whatever we do sucks.

1159
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,840
It's all over the place.

1160
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,920
We really suck!

1161
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,960
But it's okay, we still keep walking

1162
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:19,039
There is hope waiting for us

1163
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:22,720
We might be born to lose
But we aren't born to give it up!

1164
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,720
At least, we will succeed once

1165
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,680
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1166
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,159
At least we will go down together

1167
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:41,000
We should try at least once
We must succeed at least once

1168
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:43,880
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1169
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,159
At least we will go down together!

1170
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,640
EARN: KEEP IT UP!

1171
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,880
SuckSeed!

1172
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:52,680
SuckSeed!

1173
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,279
SuckSeed!

1174
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,560
And now, it's the moment 
 that everyone has been waiting for.

1175
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,720
It is a special day today.

1176
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:21,359
We will be announcing the bands
qualified for the regional semi-finals

1177
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,880
of the 2006 Hotwave Music Awards

1178
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:27,319
The first band that made it
to the semi-finals is

1179
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,720
from Chettuponburana High School!

1180
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:36,279
It's The Arena!

1181
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:39,640
They're so great today.

1182
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,880
No surprise there.

1183
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:43,920
Don't be excited. There are 19 bands left.

1184
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,720
Who's next? We are now on the fifth band.

1185
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,640
The competition is really fierce.
The tenth band is...

1186
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:54,840
And the 13th band is...

1187
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:56,399
GGR!

1188
01:31:56,479 --> 01:31:57,640
Don't worry, guys.

1189
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,479
Chill, I know we will make it.

1190
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,840
And this band has the initials "S.S."

1191
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:20,439
Let's hear it for the band
who goes by the name

1192
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:24,840
So Sad from Lampang Kanlayanee
High School.

1193
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,119
Congratulations!

1194
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:30,920
Let's move to the next one.
The 15th band is really cool.

1195
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,319
There are three members in total.

1196
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:36,560
It's Uncle's Condominium

1197
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,479
from Montfort High school.

1198
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,560
Oh, sorry. I made a mistake.
Actually, the band consists

1199
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,399
of four members, not three.

1200
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:51,319
If a band with that name can make it,
then we can make it, too!

1201
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,760
Dumbass!

1202
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,760
And now, we're at the last band.

1203
01:32:58,199 --> 01:32:59,319
The last band is...

1204
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:02,399
-SuckSeed...
-SuckSeed...

1205
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:03,399
...is...

1206
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:09,640
I am so excited to announce the last band.

1207
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:12,119
Congratulations to...

1208
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,600
to...

1209
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,800
to...

1210
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,720
to...

1211
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,800
to...

1212
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:28,079
to...

1213
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:29,359
What the hell are you doing?

1214
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:30,560
I don't want to know anymore!

1215
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,199
Damn it! Let it go!

1216
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:34,119
Koong!

1217
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,319
Turn it on, Ped!

1218
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,920
Don't turn it on!

1219
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:42,319
We have announced the 20 bands
 that made it to the semi-finals.

1220
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,000
That must have been nerve-racking.

1221
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,840
Koong, you asshole.
What the hell have you done?

1222
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:49,399
I got too excited!

1223
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:52,720
So now, how will we know if we made it?

1224
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,640
I don't know! That DJ pressured me!
He talked too much.

1225
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,920
Congratulations for making it, Earn.

1226
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,560
Gosh! He just kept going on and on!

1227
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:06,760
Congratulate me for what?

1228
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,800
What are you happy about, Earn?

1229
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:11,960
We are the last band!

1230
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:15,920
Earn said SuckSeed made it as well!

1231
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,720
Koong, are you ready?

1232
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:37,079
-Are you ready?
-Okay.

1233
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:38,399
Three.

1234
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,640
Two.

1235
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,840
One.

1236
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,840
SuckSeed!

1237
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,760
Fuck it.

1238
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:52,520
That's awesome!

1239
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:55,520
I think we should do it again.

1240
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,479
Let's go.

1241
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:58,039
Hey.

1242
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:01,359
We don't have time to mess around anymore.

1243
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,640
If we want to win,
we need some special moves.

1244
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,720
If nobody laughs at this,
I'll become a monk.

1245
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,199
That was almost perfect.
Let's try it one more time.

1246
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,159
Shorty, you need to froth
at the mouth more.

1247
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:40,119
Fatty, add more of this.

1248
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:50,279
Thank you.

1249
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,279
What is" EPED"?

1250
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,760
It's my guitar's name.

1251
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,520
That's cute.

1252
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,359
Yes, I think so too,

1253
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:05,960
but I was going to make it
look fiercer at first.

1254
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,720
It's not the guitar.

1255
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:09,239
I meant her.

1256
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,840
Silly.

1257
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:16,439
-They're flirting.
-Yes.

1258
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,000
Hey, have you listened to my band's song?

1259
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,199
What?

1260
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,199
They played my band's song on the radio
after the announcement. Do you like it?

1261
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,560
Yes, I like it. It's cool.

1262
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,880
It's very beautiful and catchy.

1263
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,079
-You haven't listened to it, right?
-I like it a lot.

1264
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,680
Sorry. I haven't.

1265
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:56,479
You can play it for me after this.

1266
01:36:57,039 --> 01:36:58,279
Don't.

1267
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,279
Are you mad? Just for this?

1268
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:10,760
Hey, be careful!

1269
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:31,720
-I'm leaving, Mom.
-Good luck, honey.

1270
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:49,199
Let's rock it!

1271
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,399
UNCLE'S CONDOMINIUM

1272
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:08,279
How is it?

1273
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,159
We will play after The Arena.

1274
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,680
That's good, so we can compete closely.

1275
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,000
Where are the guitar and bass?

1276
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:26,960
Oh, I was too lazy to carry them around,
so I put them...

1277
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,640
Ped.

1278
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,479
Can you get the guitar for me?

1279
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,239
So did you get some sleep last night?

1280
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,680
Yes, right after I hung up.

1281
01:38:54,279 --> 01:38:55,520
Do I look tired?

1282
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,640
No.

1283
01:38:57,479 --> 01:38:58,359
Ped.

1284
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,640
Hurry up.

1285
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:24,840
The Arena, please stand by
beside the stage.

1286
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,279
GIVE IT YOUR BEST

1287
01:39:57,279 --> 01:39:59,600
Please give a round of applause to So Sad!

1288
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:05,840
-Hello!
-Yes?

1289
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,760
Kids these days are so talented.

1290
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,399
-They really are, right?
-And the next band is

1291
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:15,239
-The Arena!
-The Arena!

1292
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:25,600
Hello, we are The Arena!

1293
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,560
Damn good!

1294
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,880
This song might not be
As beautiful as other songs

1295
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,520
But it is so meaningful to me

1296
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:56,640
Every word that is written here

1297
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,319
Is from the smile I got from you

1298
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:06,479
It forced the pen to convey the meaning

1299
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,359
-Earn is the freaking best.
-They're the words that speak for my heart

1300
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,840
-Goddess.
-Do you know

1301
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,359
-I didn't mean that.
-Why I can do this?

1302
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:16,359
I think

1303
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,039
I still can't forget Earn.

1304
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:25,479
The song that you hear
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1305
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,319
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1306
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:34,880
Do you know who wrote this song?
Remember

1307
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,159
The song that you hear
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1308
01:41:41,239 --> 01:41:45,079
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1309
01:41:45,159 --> 01:41:50,680
Do you know who wrote this song?
Remember

1310
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:54,039
That person is you

1311
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:10,439
Do you know why I can do this?

1312
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,520
You...

1313
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,399
wrote this song for Earn?

1314
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:20,520
The song that you hear
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1315
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,039
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1316
01:42:22,119 --> 01:42:23,079
You...

1317
01:42:24,199 --> 01:42:25,359
like Earn, right?

1318
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,840
Remember

1319
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:36,319
The song that you hear
Do you know that I didn't write it?

1320
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:40,239
I don't dare to confess, my darling

1321
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:45,800
Do you know who wrote this song?
Remember

1322
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,840
That person is you

1323
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,840
Please give a round of applause
to The Arena!

1324
01:42:58,279 --> 01:43:01,960
Wow! That was really amazing!

1325
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:05,119
We were dancing so hard backstage.

1326
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:07,560
Who wrote this song?

1327
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:10,920
We'll have to ask our lead singer.

1328
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:12,920
He said to ask you.

1329
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,439
So are you smiling because of
someone special or a personal experience?

1330
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,079
I know just from your smile.

1331
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,239
I'm sure it came from her experience.
She's probably feeling shy.

1332
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:28,560
All right. We won't dig any deeper.
Please give a round of applause to them!

1333
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,000
Thank you very much, The Arena!

1334
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:32,760
You teased her
until she didn't know what to say.

1335
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,680
Hey.

1336
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:35,199
Let's give it our all.

1337
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:37,600
She's blushing.

1338
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,439
I won't talk anymore.

1339
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,600
Rock it, Ped!

1340
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,560
-Let's meet the next band.
-Yes.

1341
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,319
Please give a round of applause
to SuckSeed!

1342
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,520
Brokenhearted repeatedly
And hurt again and again

1343
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:19,840
No one remembers
No one cares

1344
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,960
We have to endure the pain

1345
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,079
We failed badly at getting girls

1346
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:30,520
We are always the last
And we suck at whatever we do

1347
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:35,760
But it's okay, we still keep walking
There is hope waiting for us

1348
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:40,439
We might be born to lose
But we aren't born to give it up!

1349
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:47,199
Hey, where are you going?

1350
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,680
Koong, what's the matter?

1351
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:11,439
I know you are mad
that I wrote the song for Earn,

1352
01:45:14,119 --> 01:45:16,119
but I didn't know that The Arena
would use the song.

1353
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:18,319
What song?

1354
01:45:20,119 --> 01:45:22,119
And I thought
you didn't like Earn anymore.

1355
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:27,159
Just say whatever you want.

1356
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,239
Fuck you! You've always been like this.

1357
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:38,479
-Hey, calm down.
-You never care about how others feel.

1358
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,840
You always did whatever you wanted
and invited people in whenever you wanted.

1359
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,039
When you were not happy,
you kicked her out.

1360
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,319
Just like how you stopped playing now.

1361
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,119
And you're so great?

1362
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,319
You had been waiting
to snatch her away, right?

1363
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,279
I liked Earn way before you did.

1364
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:07,119
Why didn't you say a word
after all this time?

1365
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:53,520
When is the final round?

1366
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,760
It's after the exam.

1367
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,600
That's cool.

1368
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,039
If you make it to the final round,
you will definitely become famous.

1369
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,720
I'm so jealous. I want to play
on a big stage like that too.

1370
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:19,720
Just say what is on your mind, Ped.

1371
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:30,239
I'm so sorry, Earn.

1372
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:35,760
I don't know.

1373
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,640
I still feel the same for you,

1374
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:43,920
but...

1375
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,680
I don't know.

1376
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:50,520
I think I understand.

1377
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,279
We can go back to the way we were before.

1378
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,039
Koong is lucky.

1379
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,840
This is not about Koong.

1380
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,319
Are you gay?

1381
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:16,119
Are you crazy?

1382
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:36,560
Good luck then, Ped.

1383
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,600
I LOVE EVERYONE

1384
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,720
WE ARE FROM CLASSROOM 6/3

1385
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,000
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

1386
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,359
CHETTUPON SCHOOL
CLASS 47, CLASSROOM 6/3

1387
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:10,960
WE WILL MISS EACH OTHER

1388
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:12,720
I remember sitting next to you and...

1389
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,359
You went to poop.

1390
01:49:22,199 --> 01:49:25,520
-You went to poop.
-You went with me.

1391
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,319
Brokenhearted repeatedly
And hurt again and again

1392
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,319
No one remembers
No one cares

1393
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:33,960
We have to endure the pain

1394
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:36,439
We failed badly at getting girls

1395
01:50:37,159 --> 01:50:42,680
We are always the last
And we suck at whatever we do

1396
01:50:43,479 --> 01:50:47,760
But it's okay, we still keep walking
There is hope waiting for us

1397
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:52,079
We might be born to lose
But we aren't born to give it up!

1398
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:57,079
At least, we will succeed once

1399
01:50:57,319 --> 01:50:59,880
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1400
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,439
At least we will go down together

1401
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:07,319
We should try at least once
We must succeed at least once

1402
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,159
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1403
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,960
At least we will go down together!

1404
01:51:15,079 --> 01:51:16,560
SuckSeed!

1405
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,840
GET READY FOR THE LATEST SINGLE
FROM THE COOLEST ROCK BAND, THE ARENA

1406
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,079
REUNION PARTY, CHETTU CLASS 47
MEET THE ARENA

1407
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,560
Ped!

1408
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,319
Why are you spacing out over there?
Why don't you go drink inside?

1409
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,199
-Okay, I will be there.
-Hurry up then.

1410
01:52:26,279 --> 01:52:28,199
-Miss you, Ped!
-Come quick.

1411
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:30,760
-See you inside.
-Hurry up, okay!

1412
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,640
How is love?

1413
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:45,760
How is love?

1414
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,720
We used to promise things together

1415
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:50,039
Back then when we were apart
Do you remember?

1416
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:52,000
-Ped!
-The sky always changes

1417
01:52:52,119 --> 01:52:54,079
-Am I right?
-I still remember that promise

1418
01:52:54,279 --> 01:52:56,920
Ex! I almost didn’t recognize you!

1419
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,600
-Shit! I miss you, asshole!
-How is our true love?

1420
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:02,199
-Come here.
-I've been missing you

1421
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,600
The world looks so cold

1422
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,600
When I don't have you here

1423
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:16,279
Whenever you are right now

1424
01:53:16,359 --> 01:53:20,119
Could you please come back to me?

1425
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:38,319
I've been missing you

1426
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,640
And that was The Arena!

1427
01:53:54,359 --> 01:53:55,439
You want one more picture?

1428
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,720
-Thank you, Earn.
-It's okay.

1429
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,680
Hey, Ped!

1430
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,840
You arrived so late.

1431
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,079
Can I have your autograph, please?

1432
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:12,840
I thought you would download it.

1433
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:18,520
If anyone buys the CD at your shop,
they would probably get confused

1434
01:54:20,039 --> 01:54:22,359
because the girl who sells the CD
looks like the one on the cover.

1435
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,520
Earn, can I have a photo with you?

1436
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:53,960
MISSING OLD DAYS, EARN.

1437
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,319
How was it?

1438
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,359
I thought it was very beautiful
and catchy.

1439
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,600
You haven't changed at all.

1440
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:26,239
Really?

1441
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:30,840
But I think things have changed,

1442
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,760
except for the fact
that I'm still a loser.

1443
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,319
But I feel that nothing has changed.

1444
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,039
So do you have anyone special yet?

1445
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,560
Not yet.

1446
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,239
I am still the same, Ped.

1447
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,880
Can you sign this for me?

1448
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:40,840
All right. We are now nearing the end
of tonight's reunion party.

1449
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:44,399
-Whoever is sleeping, please wake up now.
-Ex, wake up!

1450
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:48,479
Whoever is going to the after party,
please be patient,

1451
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:52,560
because today, I have prepared
something for you all.

1452
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,279
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER?

1453
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,760
Oh, my god. How could we do that?

1454
01:57:19,079 --> 01:57:20,359
It's embarrassing.

1455
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,600
Actually, SuckSeed's song is awesome.

1456
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:09,840
I'll be right back.

1457
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,520
Hey, do you still play music sometimes?

1458
01:58:58,840 --> 01:58:59,960
I forgot it all already.

1459
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:21,039
FOREVER CHETTU CLASS 47

1460
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:28,920
We have come to the end
of the reunion party.

1461
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,439
Thank you very much, everyone.

1462
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,039
See you next year!

1463
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,439
HOMECOMING
23 OCTOBER 2010

1464
01:59:40,279 --> 01:59:42,760
Ped, why are you on the stage?

1465
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:44,560
Come down.

1466
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:46,319
Come down.

1467
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:48,800
Hey, that's mine.

1468
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,319
Brokenhearted repeatedly
And hurt again and again

1469
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:05,960
No one remembers
No one cares

1470
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:08,479
We have to endure the pain

1471
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:11,319
We failed badly at getting girls

1472
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:18,520
We are always the last
And we suck at whatever we do

1473
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:25,279
But it's okay, we still keep walking
There is hope waiting for us

1474
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,600
We might be born to lose
But we aren't born to give it up!

1475
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:35,920
At least, we will succeed once

1476
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,880
Hey, Koong!

1477
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:39,840
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1478
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,560
At least we will go down together

1479
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:47,560
We should try at least once
We must succeed at least once

1480
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,600
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1481
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:53,319
At least we will go down together!

1482
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,560
Hey!

1483
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:07,479
Brokenhearted repeatedly
And hurt again and again

1484
02:01:09,399 --> 02:01:10,319
Kay.

1485
02:01:12,039 --> 02:01:13,399
Can I borrow your pick?

1486
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:33,560
It would take a real jerk
to forget a loser like you.

1487
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,159
But it's okay, we still keep walking
There is hope waiting for us

1488
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,640
We might be born to lose
But we aren't born to give it up!

1489
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:59,520
-At least, we will succeed once
-At least, we will succeed once

1490
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,840
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1491
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:05,439
At least we will go down together

1492
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,880
We should try at least once
We must succeed at least once

1493
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,600
Even though we really suck
And our lives suck even more

1494
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:15,600
At least we will go down together

1495
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:19,079
-SuckSeed!
-SuckSeed!

1496
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,680
-SuckSeed!
-SuckSeed!

1497
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,479
-SuckSeed!
-SuckSeed!

1498
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:30,239
You really suck!

1499
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:38,079
SuckSeed!

1500
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,560
Asshole!

1501
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,159
-Shit!
-Shit!

1502
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:55,720
-Shit!
-Shit!

1503
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:24,640
One day, The Arena became the opening band
for Bodyslam.

1504
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,920
Congratulations!

1505
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,680
Toon remembered me,
but he thought that Kay was me.

1506
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,439
Are you ready?

1507
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:00,640
Do you know what's trending now, Ped?

1508
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:03,840
It's organic farming.

1509
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,399
Chemical farming is completely gone.

1510
02:04:07,479 --> 02:04:09,800
FARMER MARKET
CHAING MAI, 2011

1511
02:04:10,199 --> 02:04:13,079
Next, please welcome a band

1512
02:04:13,159 --> 02:04:17,640
that I have invited
for all of you to enjoy.

1513
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:20,079
Please welcome...

1514
02:04:22,439 --> 02:04:23,880
SuckSeed!

1515
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:35,279
It's unplugged.

1516
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:07,880
This is the melody of our past

1517
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:12,119
When I hear it, I miss those old days
No matter how much time has passed

1518
02:05:12,199 --> 02:05:13,079
I'm telling you, Ped.

1519
02:05:13,159 --> 02:05:15,840
Our song...

1520
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,159
This is our era!

1521
02:05:17,239 --> 02:05:19,560
...is in our heart!
