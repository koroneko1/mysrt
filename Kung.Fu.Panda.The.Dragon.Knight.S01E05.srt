No, just Weimin.

And I'm sorry.
I don't need a yes-man like Weimin.

I'm so glad we can work together again.

Po! There's
a deadly sandstorm in front of us

423
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,903
and a person behind us
who wants to kill us.

424

Should we really be
talking about this right now?

425
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,116
So there's a "we" again?

426

that little girl from the village?

Perhaps I can't do everything on my own.
