1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,644
Tin said I accused him
of taking drugs, right?

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:03,666
Tin...

3
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:04,819
Let me ask you something.

4
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,021
Have you taken drugs before?

5
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:07,133
You believed him right?

6
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,784
How many times do I have to tell you...

7
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:10,786
that you're the only one I'll listen to!

8
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,370
Sorry.

9
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,290
What...

10
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:18,392
I can't stay calm anymore!

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,275
Do you think I'll believe you?

12
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,678
Who can tell me what's going on here?

13
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,181
Is Can home?

14
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,221
He said he was going to murder someone
at your house!

15
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,538
I need to go.

16
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:30,996
Tin!

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,934
Don't do something stupid, Can.

40
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,321
Where is Can?

41
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,593
Can is in Mister's room.

42
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,715
He didn't do something stupid, right?

43
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,159
Can punched Tul's face.

44
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:39,111
You're finally here.

45
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:43,087
This?

46
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,091
It's nothing.

47
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,970
I only got punched a few times.

48
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,159
Your friend packed quite a punch.

49
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,590
Where is Can?

50
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,180
Talking to dad.

51
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,026
Do you think it'll end here?

52
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:06,429
It doesn't matter how it's gonna end.

53
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,406
I won't let you lay a finger on Can.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,354
In the end,

55
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:17,994
you are the one who is the happiest.

56
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,733
I wish you luck.

57
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:33,763
Why are you so biased?

58
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:36,351
Tin is also your son.
Why did you do this to him?

59
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,814
Do you know what your eldest son
has done to him?

60
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:40,696
All you do is work, work, work.

61
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,369
Do you have any idea how sad he feels?
How much he got hurt?

62
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,363
Do you know anything at all? Do you know?

63
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:53,093
Do you know what Tul sent me?

64
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,750
He sent me a video of someone
who looks like Tin having sex with a girl,

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,053
and taking drugs.

66
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,739
Do you think I won't be able
to remember my own boyfriend?

67
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,943
How can he do this?

68
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,870
Tin,

69
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,560
let's have a talk.

70
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,114
Tin, why are you so late?

71
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:15,525
I arrived a long time ago.

72
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,098
I only managed to get a few punches in.

73
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:20,430
Someone like him
deserves even more of a beating.

74
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,166
Too bad someone stopped me.

75
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,210
Why?

76
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,351
Does nobody know that
he's such a son of a bitch?

77
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,576
Stop it, Can.

78
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:27,805
I won't stop.

79
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,887
I will let everyone know
what your brother has done.

80
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:32,619
Can.

81
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,471
Tin!

82
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:38,406
Why didn't you tell your father
about what Tul's done to you?

83
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:42,105
That's enough.

84
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,719
I'll drive you home.

85
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,088
I'm not going anywhere.

86
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,512
Not until we've cleared this up.

87
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:47,651
Cantaloupe.

88
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,478
Let him go, son.

89
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,407
Go on.

90
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,572
I also want to know
about the things my eldest son...

91
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:57,856
has done.

92
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,111
Dad...

93
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,953
I've never gotten the chance
to talk to you...

94
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,308
or to your brother.

95
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,385
This time...

96
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:09,183
Maybe it's time I listen.

97
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,774
Yes.

98
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,104
You should listen.

99
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,840
Stop being one of those stupid adults...

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,957
that are only biased
towards one of your own son.

101
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:18,464
Go on.

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,582
Tell me, an adult that
doesn't equally love his own children,

103
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,003
about what happened.

104
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:27,835
Tul sent a clip of someone
who looks similar to Tin...

105
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,510
doing drugs, having sex,

106
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,265
and he also back-stabbed Tin.

107
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,924
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

108
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,109
It's okay.

109
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,287
Tul, I don't understand at all.

110
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:59,135
Why do you purposefully do
all these things to make Tin hate you?

111
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,951
I've never done anything like that at all.

112
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,588
Tul...

113
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:09,711
I've looked after you
since you were just a baby.

114
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,209
Why won't I know?

115
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:17,675
The reason why you're doing this
is to make Tin hate you, right?

116
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,490
I have to do this.

117
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,159
And everyone should know the truth.

118
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:27,299
I shouldn't get all these praises
that I didn't deserve...

119
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,410
from my little brother.

120
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,945
Come on, Tul.

121
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,583
And that's the reason
why you punched Tul, right?

122
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:38,821
Obviously.

123
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,908
How can I not get angry?

124
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:44,006
He's sneaking around and doing things
behind Tin's back..

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,039
Is this true, Tin?

126
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,308
Even if I tell you,
you wouldn't believe me.

127
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,092
Why didn't you give it a try first?

128
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:04,040
If I told you that he's hurt me
since I was young.

129
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,258
I'm sorry...

130
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,172
for hurting you without knowing it.

131
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:15,266
I'm sorry
for staying silent all this time.

132
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,557
Even though all this time,

133
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,556
I thought that
I was doing what you needed me to do.

134
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,312
I am indebted to you...

135
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,465
and Tul, aren't I?

136
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:31,450
What does that bastard
have to do with anything?

137
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:38,611
What do you mean by what I needed?

138
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,060
Freedom.

139
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:46,488
Freedom?

140
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,619
That's right.

141
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:50,589
The freedom to do anything you want.

142
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,604
The freedom
to choose how to live your own life.

143
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:54,770
The freedom...

144
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,248
that your brother and I would never have.

145
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,292
I've never told you before, right?

146
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,334
That's right.

147
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:07,737
I've never told you.

148
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,188
Freedom...

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,060
that I've had before
when I married Tul's mom.

150
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,090
The only freedom that I chose.

151
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,421
Even if people were against me,
I didn't care.

152
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,224
And it ended in a failure.

153
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,460
It left me with only a boy
who had to receive all the misfortune.

154
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,038
Tin.

155
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,063
I admit...

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,627
that I didn't try to stop your mom
and your brother...

157
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,641
sent you overseas.

158
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:46,315
I am even thankful that that happened.

159
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,694
How can you say that?

160
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:54,817
Tin.

161
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:56,497
For me,

162
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,863
having no one
placing any expectations on you...

163
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,266
is the best thing.

164
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,797
You'll have your own life.

165
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,494
You can choose anything.

166
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,402
Everyone
will not place expectations on you.

167
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,286
Because that will slowly kill you.

168
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,003
That's why I said...

169
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,039
that I've given you
the best thing I could.

170
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,235
What are you talking about?

171
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,503
I don't understand anything.

172
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,452
Explain it to me.

173
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:36,468
That child has gone through more things
than everyone can imagine.

174
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,512
Your brother
has faced many things through his life.

175
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:41,866
He's never been happy.

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,578
And you...

177
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,118
who I thought
I've given the best thing possible to.

178
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,078
Who would've already find
his own happiness.

179
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,847
Tin.

180
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,050
I beg you.

181
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:02,627
You can hate me however you want.

182
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,800
You can be angry at me however you want.

183
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,415
But please, forgive your brother.

184
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,818
You are so biased.

185
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,646
Okay.

186
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:19,289
Tin!

187
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,180
Your brother has caused you pain
for so many years.

188
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:27,274
I will forgive him.

189
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,461
But you have to promise me first...

190
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,914
that you will give me the freedom...

191
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,693
to love whoever I want.

192
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,372
I promise.

193
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,548
No one will be able to stop you
from walking on the path you chose.

194
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,412
Even if that person is your mom.

195
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,203
Please take care of my son.

196
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:59,734
Please look after him...

197
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:03,402
in place of this old uncle
who never got the chance to do it.

198
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,428
Oh, right.

199
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,983
Tul is going to get a divorce.

200
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:17,860
Does this make you happier?

201
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,345
You've always been a good child, Tin.

202
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:36,854
Where are you going?

203
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,107
I'm still going to prove...

204
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,846
that I am also capable of doing things.

205
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:49,665
That's good.

206
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,245
If I have another talented son
who can help me,

207
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,127
I'd be very happy.

208
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,795
Tin, we haven't finished talking yet!

209
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,078
Tin, why did you drag me out?

210
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,931
We still haven't cleared up everything.

211
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,366
I despise your brother so much, I still...

212
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,484
Let go of me, Tin.

213
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,307
I still haven't finished
talking to your dad.

214
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:56,198
It's already finished.

215
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,937
You're the one with a slow brain.

216
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,279
How is it finished?

217
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,723
I still haven't finished telling your dad
about your brother.

218
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,933
Whatever, I will take revenge for you!

219
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:14,016
Don't you realize that you already did?

220
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,166
Huh? How?

221
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,497
Can you explain it to me? I'm stupid.

222
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,700
Promise me first,

223
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,709
then I'll tell you the best way
to take revenge.

224
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,931
Okay, I promise.

225
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,460
Tin, it hurts!

226
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,827
Stay by my side.

227
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:58,695
Make me the happiest man alive on earth.

228
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,086
The kind of happiness
that my brother can never have.

229
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,225
That...

230
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,734
is the best kind of revenge.

231
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,749
Sure.

232
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,266
I'll make you the luckiest man on earth.

233
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,306
So lucky that your brother
will be jealous of you.

Who cares about anyone else.

241
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,612
You don't have to act so strong
in front of me.

242

Yeah, I'm about to leave.

252
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,280
I won't take long.

253
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:38,734
Gotta go.

254
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,738
Techno.

255
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,019
I know that you don't want to see my face.

256
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,587
You don't want to pick up my calls.

257
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,632
But I have many things I want to tell you.

258
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:09,560
I know that I was wrong to make a move
on you while you were drunk.

259
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,456
But it's because I've liked you
for a long time.

260
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,566
For many years.

261
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,303
From the first time we met,

262
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:21,069
you're one of the few
that didn't care about my looks.

263
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,335
You didn't care
about my family background.

264
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:27,000
You make me feel good
every time we are together.

265
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:28,939
Shit!

266
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,960
He wrote me a whole letter?

267
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,709
Doesn't he know I also get embarrassed?

268
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,984
No! I shouldn't be soft-hearted now.

269
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,713
Techno.

270
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,333
I...

271
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,510
Shit.

272
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,707
He wrote me a letter...

273
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:08,300
and wait for me in front of my house.

274
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:11,736
Also, he became more handsome.

275
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:14,809
No! I can't go feeling soft-hearted now!!

276
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,372
How long are you gonna stand there?

277
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:47,581
Come take a seat.

278
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,214
No.

279
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,436
Cantaloupe is waiting for me.

280
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,316
He's probably screaming
about how hungry he is right now.

281
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,020
You guys played pretty hard, huh?

282
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,090
In the end,

283
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:07,169
you're the one who is happy.

284
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,723
No matter what I do,

285
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,700
you'll still be happy.

286
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,654
Dad told you, right?

287
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,332
That I will get a divorce.

288
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,057
Why?

289
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,426
Why what?

290
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,478
Why would someone like you,
who needs success,

291
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,351
decide to get a divorce?

292
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,729
When Vadee and Phupha went to France
a few months ago,

293
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,567
Vadee met someone new there.

294
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,580
But I won't blame her.

295
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,820
Since I was the one
who never spent time with her.

296
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,976
But Vadee and I talked about it
for a while.

297
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:05,340
It's time to give each other freedom.

298
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:08,758
What about Phupha?

299
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:11,059
Phupha will stay here.

300
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,376
As soon as we get a divorce,

301
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,720
Vadee will go to France.

302
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:18,927
Go on and mock me.

303
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,258
In the end,

304
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,645
your brother is just another failure.

305
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,795
Everyone leaves me in the end.

306
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,612
Even my own mother.

307
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:39,953
In the end,

308
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,957
like dad said, you're such a good child.

309
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:47,029
Never mocking anyone else's failure.

310
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,181
Even if that person is someone like me.

311
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,904
Why are you stopping now?

312
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,708
Even though
there's so much more you could do.

313
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,130
You could make Can hate me.

314
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:12,068
So why did you only send one clip?

315
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,641
Like a silly child's game.

316
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,264
I already promised him.

317
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,151
I just...

318
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,420
wanted to know if he really loves you.

319
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:33,002
But I'm stopping now.

320
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,725
Since I already lost.

321
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:52,883
Look after him carefully.

322
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,734
Don't make a mistake like me.

323
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:04,710
What took you so long!

324
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,924
If not because I hurt...

325
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,747
What are you laughing at?

326
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,615
I know now,

327
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:37,875
why your cheeks are so soft.

328
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,021
It's because you love eating this.

329
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,752
Tin.

330
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,879
Even if my cheeks are soft,
it still hurts.

331
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:46,858
You pinched so hard.

332
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,043
Do you want some?

333
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:09,830
Are you finished?

334
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,439
Go get a new one!

335
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,130
Won't you feel shy at all?

336
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,616
Shy about what?

337
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,229
An indirect kiss through the straw?

338
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:24,080
We're already past that point!

339
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,191
You...

340
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,063
What?

341
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,426
Fine, take it if you want.

342
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,900
I'll give it to you.

343
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:35,651
Really?

344
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:36,894
Yeah.

345
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,313
You are...

346
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:43,278
so cute.

347
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:45,399
How cute?

348
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,750
So cute.

349
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:57,235
Eat slowly.

350
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,179
I love my dad, and I love my name.

351
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,954
Because my name means...

352
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,963
The love that I gave to someone.

353
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:40,604
Why did I just figure it out?

354
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,251
Gonhin.

355
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,225
You thought this through carefully, right?

356
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,662
About this decision.

357
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,458
Yes.

358
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:40,890
I know this might seem ungrateful,

359
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:43,225
-But I...
-No.

360
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,400
It's not like that.

361
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,869
When I hired your family to work for me,

362
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,228
I've never thought...

363
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,463
that you are indebted to me.

364
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,403
Your family...

365
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,600
is the one who has been helping me
for many years.

366
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:05,760
But if you've already decided,

367
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:08,376
I won't hold a grudge against you.

368
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,228
Yes.

369
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,760
I've already made my decision.

370
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:17,270
Does Tul know yet?

371
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,525
Tul already has Vadee...

372
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,617
and their child
who is going to be born soon.

373
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,624
And what about you? Who do you have?

374
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,317
I have memories...

375
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,220
of the last 10 years.

376
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,080
I am sorry.

377
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:03,818
I am sorry that I won't be able to stay
and protect Tul anymore.

378
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:06,399
I can no longer do that.

379
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,713
I want to keep protecting Tul,

380
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,724
but I can't stay any longer.

381
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,080
I can't destroy the family
that Tul has wanted for so long.

382
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:28,502
Gonhin.

383
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:30,728
Just calm down first.

384
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,258
I have to get out of this house.

385
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,458
You know, right?

386
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,265
That you can always...

387
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,750
come back to this house.

388
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,391
You know it, right?

389
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:48,988
That Tul will always need you.

390
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:53,829
Yes.

391
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:56,007
But not now.

392
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,479
Not now.

393
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:05,706
I really cannot help any of my sons.

394
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,785
Tul.

395
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,774
I don't want to hear it.

396
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,062
I have something I need to tell you.

397
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:42,104
I said I don't want to hear it!

398
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:46,497
Please.

399
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,144
Listen to me.

400
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,075
I don't want to hear it.
I won't listen to it!

401
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:04,917
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

402
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,990
I told you that I'm not letting you leave.

403
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:17,133
But I have to go.

404
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:34,867
Tul.

405
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,960
We both know that
there's no better solution than this.

406
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:46,840
Vadee is pregnant with your baby.

407
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,002
The baby that I don't want.

408
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:56,851
Of course, you do.

409
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:58,700
You want him.

410
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,320
You've always wanted a family.

411
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,340
Someone who will love you.

412
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:10,251
And Vadee is going to give birth
to that person for you.

413
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,106
Something which I cannot give you.

414
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:18,860
Please don't say that you don't need her.

415
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:24,123
Because you know it best that you do.

416
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,030
No.

417
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,200
The one that I need is you.

418
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:36,880
I can no longer stay by your side.

419
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:40,485
I have to go...

420
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,640
so your world will be complete.

421
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:50,440
You are my world.

422
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,340
I am just another rock.

423
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,627
Please just throw me away.

424
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:07,735
I am not worthy to be your whole world.

425
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,900
But you promised me
that you won't ever leave me.

426
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,640
After this,
you probably won't need me anymore.

427
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:21,037
I love you, Hin.

428
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,700
I love you.

429
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,840
But your child needs a father.

430
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,800
That child...

431
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:36,780
Please give him a lot of love.

432
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,762
Don't let him grow up to be like you...

433
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:42,640
or Tin.

434
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,513
If you have no reason to keep on living,

435
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:51,145
think of it as a request from me.

436
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,600
Please keep on living for your child.

437
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,220
This is my last request.

438
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,232
Can you promise me?

439
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:16,761
That you'll be happy.

440
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:20,500
You're asking me the impossible.

441
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:27,620
I hope you'll be happy.

442
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:30,293
Hin.

443
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,028
Hin!

444
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,537
♪I still have hope
even I know that it's hopeless♪

445
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:50,063
♪I've been hopelessly
wishing for the impossible.♪

446
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:54,522
♪I'm asking just for once♪

447
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:58,825
♪Just for once♪

448
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:02,249
♪Give me just a few seconds♪

449
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:07,858
♪So that I will no longer be lonely♪

450
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:18,264
I am repenting my own sins now,
right, Gonhin?

451
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,192
In the end, I'm left with nobody.

452
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,274
And then,

453
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:35,460
I punched Tin's brother
until he flew into the wall.

454
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,777
-Is that so?
-Of course!

455
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:39,457
He dares to mess with my Tin.

456
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,725
He doesn't know me well enough.

457
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:45,582
Now you can say, "my Tin"
without feeling shy, huh?

458
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,045
You're the one who taught me...

459
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,363
that we need to have confidence
in what we do.

460
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:54,121
So now, I'm brave enough to say
that Tin is my boyfriend.

461
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,487
Wow.

462
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,493
That's so brave of you.

463
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,843
Now, I'm gonna go sell this video
to your boyfriend...

464
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:03,332
and see how much money
I can get from this.

465
00:34:03,704 --> 00:34:05,042
Fuck you, Pond!

466
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,100
What's the matter?

467
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,271
Don't send it to Tin.

468
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,279
I can also get embarrassed.

469
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,573
Don't be so touchy.

470
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,456
Is there a whole watermelon in your mouth?

471
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,325
Your cheeks are so puffy.

472
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:23,647
Ever since you've got a boyfriend,

473
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:26,328
and have been kissing each other
in the middle of campus,

474
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,131
You've become a lot more showy.

475
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:29,636
Stop it! Give me the phone!!

476
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:31,808
No, I won't give it to you.

477
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,276
What are you doing here?

478
00:34:34,515 --> 00:34:35,968
What's up, shorty.

479
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,006
That loud mouth over there told me
you're going to release your own song.

480
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,069
Hey!

481
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,119
I didn't go around telling everyone
about that.

482
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,581
It's not my song.

483
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:45,976
A senior is going to write a song,
so I'm just helping him out.

484
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:48,454
Same thing.
So when will I get to hear it?

485
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,375
Next month,
at the university's music festival!

486
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,307
He really knows every little detail,
that bastard.

487
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:54,851
Ouch! Can!

488
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,943
Stop taking out your embarrassment on me!
Ouch!

489
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,345
That's enough!

490
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:01,043
Look, your boyfriend's here
to pick you up.

491
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:02,922
You should get going!

492
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,847
Okay, then I'll be leaving first.

493
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,631
Ae, I'm going first!

494
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:12,091
-See you!
-Bye.

495
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,120
You're such a nuisance...

496
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,295
Who said he's a monkey?

497
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,203
He's clearly a dog.

498
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:24,148
Am I gonna catch rabies?

499
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:27,662
Then next month
I'll come and listen to your song.

500
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:30,334
Hey! Listen to me first!

501
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,382
Do I have to?

502
00:35:32,462 --> 00:35:34,034
Do you think you're worth my attention?

503
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,368
Ouch, that's pretty harsh.

504
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,027
Tin, what's wrong?

505
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:48,970
Tin.

506
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:54,633
Are you mad at me
because I was fooling around with Pond?

507
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:06,665
Here.

508
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,643
Stop being mad.

509
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:20,143
I'm making up with you, so smile!

510
00:36:22,277 --> 00:36:23,950
Why do I have to smile for you?

511
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,137
Because you have such a cute
and handsome boyfriend!

512
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,108
Also, me and Pond? Together? No way.

513
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,255
I get the chills just thinking about it.

514
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,087
I'm not mad at you anymore.

515
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,659
Good!
That's the right decision, very good!

516
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:58,112
I'm planning to go overseas
for about a week.

517
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,616
What?

518
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:01,295
Where are you going?

519
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,663
Tin, I'm talking to you right now.

520
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:08,109
What are you looking at
while smiling like that?

521
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:12,716
Hey!

522
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:15,061
That we need to have confidence
in what we do.

523
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:17,771
-So now I'm brave enough to say...
-You're kind of cute.

524
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:20,492
-that Tin is my boyfriend.
-Pond, that asshole!

525
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,169
That's so brave of you.

526
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,761
Now I'm gonna go sell this video
to your boyfriend...

527
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:28,192
Give that back.

528
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,247
I'm not giving it to you anymore.

529
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:33,959
You already kissed it, so it's mine now.

530
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:42,649
Fine, take it back.

531
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:48,102
Tin!

532
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,370
I'm returning the kiss too.

533
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,998
Stop making me embarrassed!

534
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,832
But in the video, you said...

535
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,833
you're not the shy person
you used to be anymore.

536
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,748
That's right!

537
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,397
I'm not embarrassed at all.

538
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,942
Because you're mine.

539
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,455
I just said the truth.

540
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:19,503
That's right.

541
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,216
I'm yours.

542
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:54,306
What are you doing?

543
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:55,619
Hang on.

544
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:57,500
Slow down.

545
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,840
Calm down!

546
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,380
Here, have some.

547
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,257
You'll get hungry later.

548
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:24,272
Are you okay?

549
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:28,325
It'll come to you soon.

550
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:30,857
Eat this first.

551
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,568
Great!

552
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:38,211
Have some first,
and then you can continue working.

553
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,198
You can do it!

554
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,526
Thanks.

555
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,006
Where are you up to now?

556
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,152
Nowhere.

557
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:21,500
You got it?

558
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:25,540
Let me see.

559
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:30,147
See? You can do it if you try.

560
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:51,519
How is it?

561
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,731
I think this part is okay.

562
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,645
No matter where, you are...

563
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:00,827
Like this?

564
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:02,447
Yeah, this part is good.

565
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:13,694
Why are you hugging me?

566
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:17,612
Keen.

567
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,880
Look, I've finished writing this song.

568
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,343
Look!
I've never felt this confident before.

569
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,223
Do you like it?

570
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:32,226
Hurry! Tell me, do you like it?

571
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:34,086
Of course.

572
00:41:36,096 --> 00:41:37,352
Right?

573
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:38,857
I like it too.

574
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:41,199
I've never felt this good
about a song before.

575
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,002
Tin, wait!

576
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:58,021
So tiring.

577
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,845
Good thing I have this drink.

578
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,755
-Why are you here?
-You're asking me why!

579
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:10,191
You forgot something.

580
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:11,935
What?

581
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:13,697
This!

582
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:16,530
I love this. It's so good.

583
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:20,736
It's that good?

584
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:22,131
Of course.

585
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:24,673
I'm still chewing on the coconut jelly
with vitamin C in it.

586
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:25,793
Wanna have a try?

587
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,928
Okay, then let me try some.

588
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:31,032
Here, you can try mine.

589
00:42:37,332 --> 00:42:38,414
Are you crazy?

590
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:41,684
I'm talking about this drink.

591
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:43,921
I want to taste it from your lips.

592
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,884
You should go.

593
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:51,151
See you later.

594
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:53,402
I'll send you off.

595
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:04,896
Who is this?

596
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:07,588
Tum's friend?

597
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,004
Tin!

598
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,470
How did you come here?

599
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:09,189
Who said I miss you?

600
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:11,157
We haven't seen each other
for only a few days.

601
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:12,657
You're too obsessed with me.

602
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,036
Tin!

603
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:15,442
I'm done here.

604
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:18,082
I already know what I should know.

605
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,768
Tar!

606
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:24,104
Since when did you come back?

607
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:25,548
Mom didn't tell me anything.

608
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,524
I asked her not to tell you.

609
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:29,567
