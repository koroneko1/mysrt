1
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,469
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,388
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,434
Sae-bom's here, right?

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,564
I'm a little busy right now.

5
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,567
She'll be out soon. Hang on.

6
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,530
Did you take the drugs?

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,450
The ones you bought at the gym?

8
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,370
If you messed with Sae-bom,

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,873
I'm going to kill you.

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,880
I think you're mistaken about something.

11
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,840
Then open the door!

12
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,072
Where's Sae-bom?

13
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,198
Sae-bom!

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,408
What?

15
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,455
Yi-hyun, are you hungry too?

16
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,040
What?

17
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,098
No, I'm here because I missed you.

18
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,559
-Help me.
-What?

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,477
-I said, help me. Get up.
-What?

20
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,772
We're newlyweds.

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,108
And I missed her so much.

22
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:39,242
He says he's worried
even if I'm away for a moment.

23
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,162
You must…

24
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,373
love her very, very much.

25
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,877
Of course.

26
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,682
What is it? What's going on?

27
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,809
Want some?

28
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,980
There are so many amazing things
in this place. Look.

29
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,940
There's a lot of food too.

30
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,901
Didn't anything happen?

31
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,371
Bye.

32
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,915
Thank you for the food.

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,962
Why did you do that?
He seems like the type to hold grudges.

34
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,049
The gym sold Next to him.

35
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,427
Don't look back.
He might be watching us right now.

36
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,389
No way. He's not a spy or anything.

37
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,190
Let me see. Did you get hurt?

38
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,277
Did you get scratched or feel a sting
on the back of your neck or anything?

39
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,951
This isn't healing well.

40
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,954
It's all healed now.
It's not even that visible.

41
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,334
More than that,
wasn't there anything weird in there?

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,835
Aside from the interior design…

43
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,630
His father is a diplomat,

44
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,132
so he's been to Africa
and the Middle East and stuff.

45
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,426
That's when he realized
that doomsday is approaching.

46
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,220
He is weird.

47
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,805
Still, he's nice.

48
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,765
He gave me these too.

49
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:30,061
These are really delicious
when you're hungry.

50
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,856
Everything's delicious when you're hungry.

51
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,574
Who is it?

52
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,025
Hi.

53
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,822
Kid, are you alone?

54
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,033
Who are you?

55
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,036
Don't you know me?
I'm a friend of your mom.

56
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,997
Can you open the door, please?

57
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,999
This…

58
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,048
Kid, what are you doing?

59
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,966
I hurt my arm.

60
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,679
I'm sorry. Can you open the door?

61
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,306
I'm not a bad guy.

62
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,143
Are you listening?

63
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,230
Do you have ointment?

64
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,025
How did you get hurt?

65
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,825
How did you get in here?

66
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,082
The door to the first floor was open.

67
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,085
I wasn't trying to do anything bad.

68
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,464
I didn't even bite anyone.

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,051
I was just so lonely and frustrated.

70
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,513
Why don't you wipe
the blood off your mouth first?

71
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,017
Who did you bite?

72
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,897
It was just a slight bite…

73
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025
I didn't bite him hard.

74
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,197
And he survived and ran away…

75
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,964
Get out before I count to three.

76
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,301
One,

77
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,178
two,

78
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,763
three.

79
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,940
Seo-yoon, it's me.

80
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,989
Seo-yoon. It's me, Sae-bom.

81
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,329
Is he gone?

82
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,331
Yes.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,669
-Where's Mr. Jung-kook?
-The second floor.

84
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,839
He went down because we were
out of dish soap and toothpaste.

85
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,007
Okay.

86
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,720
I'll be back soon,
so don't open the door to anyone,

87
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,221
just like you did now. Okay?

88
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,432
Seo-yoon, you did great.

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,352
Eat this and calm yourself down.

90
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,147
-I'm going now.
-Okay.

91
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,773
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

92
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,825
How did he get in?

93
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
There may be more inside.
We have to search for them.

94
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,590
More than that, whose blood did he drink?

95
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:34,305
Ma'am, I'm not infected.

96
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,015
I'm really not infected.

97
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,183
You see, I came here

98
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,936
because the lady at Unit 1202
said she would pay me.

99
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,272
But a lockdown and infections?
What is all this?

100
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,820
Ma'am, I will help you.
I'll help you so we can get out together.

101
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,490
Think about it. Did I do anything weird?

102
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,660
I didn't, right?
I've just been staying here quietly.

103
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,911
Aren't you thirsty?

104
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,496
No. Look.

105
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,706
I'm fine, right?

106
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,961
I'm totally fine.

107
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,880
I look fine, don't I?

108
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,008
I promise I'll help you. Ma'am!

109
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,512
You can never get out of here alone.

110
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,389
Ma'am, please help me once.

111
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,565
Thank you.

112
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,900
I'll trust you just this once.

113
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,462
Are you okay?

114
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,844
What…

115
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,432
What am I supposed to do when I am
still thirsty after drinking water?

116
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,127
Ma'am, I'm all better now.

117
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,631
Come here. We should go up together.

118
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,509
Are you going to stay there…

119
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,137
until the infected come here?

120
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,224
Ma'am, just trust me!

121
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,597
Yi-hyun.

122
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,230
Let's hurry.

123
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,412
It's Na Soo-min's phone.

124
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,094
MUIL GROUP CONSTRUCTION

125
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,944
Even after drinking this much water…

126
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,448
my throat is dry.

127
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,825
Where are Na Soo-min and Na Hyun-kyung?

128
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,618
I don't know, either.

129
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,207
Mr. Kim, take a deep breath
and breathe out.

130
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,126
If you just breathe well,

131
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,212
your desires will settle down.

132
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,926
Do you know how hard it is
to feel thirstier and thirstier

133
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,888
the more I drink water?

134
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,518
Even though I know
what I should drink to quench my thirst.

135
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,105
What do you think
would quench your thirst?

136
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
Human blood?

137
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,617
But how did you know that?

138
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,578
Who told you about it?

139
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,829
I just know.

140
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,210
When I see a pale neck,
my thirst gets worse.

141
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,904
We weren't using our guns for a reason!

142
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,288
Why are you here?

143
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm here to help you two.

144
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,721
Where's my brother?

145
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,099
We'll go look for him.

146
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,646
For now, just get some rest.

147
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,858
I'm sure he's blaming me now.

148
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,444
I volunteered to do it…

149
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,696
It's just a disease.

150
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,200
He just needs to endure it
until the cure is out.

151
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,663
Lieutenant Colonel,
the cure is almost complete, right?

152
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,261
These are sleeping pills.
Take one when you need it.

153
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,189
Take one now and get some rest.

154
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,634
We should go outside and talk.

155
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,521
Couldn't you have just comforted her?

156
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,317
Why did you shoot Mr. Kim?

157
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,446
He was capable of having conversations.

158
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,948
The outside is full of people
who lost their families.

159
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,492
Mothers bite their kids,
and husbands bite their wives.

160
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,413
If you don't want to lose someone
close to you, then don't hesitate.

161
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,543
Why won't this heal?

162
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,088
I know you looked at me
when I gave her water, so be honest.

163
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,217
The virus is still lingering in your body.
It's like the remains.

164
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,511
Then I can end up biting people?

165
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,097
That's why we need
to keep collecting your blood.

166
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
We have to keep checking.

167
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,100
Is that why you're here?

168
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,728
Because you want to collect my blood?

169
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,817
About Seo-yoon's parents…

170
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,402
Did something happen?

171
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,321
Her father has been infected.

172
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,906
Her mother is still fine,

173
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,825
but she misses her daughter badly.

174
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,744
So you're here to take Seo-yoon?

175
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,579
Mad Human Disease is getting worse.

176
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
Not only in here
but also in the entire world.

177
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,209
I have to announce
some follow-up measures,

178
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,253
so let's gather the residents
after making sure this area is safe.

179
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,354
Lord…

180
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,563
Isn't it over?

181
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,319
They turn back to normal and switch
back and forth if they drink blood, right?

182
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,155
Maybe they bit someone,
turned back to normal, and went home.

183
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,991
Is everyone okay in there?

184
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,577
Open the door.

185
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,539
Anyone in there?

186
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,337
Yi-hyun, are you okay?

187
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,507
You're not tricking us
after you got bit, are you?

188
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,052
This is not something out of
The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats!

189
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,596
Stop being ridiculous
and open the door now!

190
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,056
He may be lying.

191
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,057
That's a lie.

192
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,017
Never be deceived by a handsome face.

193
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,102
Lord…

194
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,603
Sir, I can hear you.

195
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,691
-Open the door, Jung-kook!
-Don't.

196
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,653
What's taking you so long?

197
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,573
-Yi-hyun.
-What's your problem?

198
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,616
I almost got killed!

199
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,826
Hey!

200
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,038
Damn it!

201
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,331
This is crazy.

202
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,583
By the way, Jung-kook,

203
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,711
what in the world is going on right now?

204
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,004
You see,

205
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,590
I came here to get
dish soap and toothpaste,

206
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,468
and some guys with white eyes
suddenly attacked us.

207
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,595
Is anyone hurt?

208
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,973
No, thanks to the pastor.

209
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,976
He has spiritual powers.

210
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,585
-Now what kind of nonsense is that?
-It's true.

211
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,711
No way.

212
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,172
I didn't have a gun at that time…

213
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,883
Right, where's my gun?

214
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,219
Jung-kook, just calm down first.

215
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,388
Who opened the door to the first floor?

216
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
You see…

217
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,725
The guy upstairs.

218
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,728
He left the door open
with the supermarket lady and went up.

219
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,731
Yi-hyun.

220
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,860
Who locked the door earlier?

221
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,541
Would the people downstairs be okay?

222
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,418
If someone got hurt…

223
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,837
Then we just need
to get our stories straight.

224
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,924
We can just say that we ran away
when we saw the infected.

225
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,842
Then no one can hold us responsible.

226
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
Hi.

227
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,978
Oh, my.

228
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,482
You're such a beautiful young lady.

229
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,651
What's your name?

230
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,319
I'm Lee Bo-ram.

231
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,863
Thank you for the treat, ma'am.

232
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,616
Mom, here.

233
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,495
We're busy. Get out.

234
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,330
Fine.

235
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,666
Tell me if you need anything.

236
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,625
Okay.

237
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,460
Bye.

238
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,557
Don't they look cute together?

239
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,185
Don't get your hopes up.

240
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,023
Who would like a jobless loser like him?

241
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,317
Who cares? I married you too.

242
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,279
What?

243
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,785
I think someone's here.

244
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,829
Remember, just stick to our story.

245
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,374
Don't say anything stupid.
I mean it, okay?

246
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,336
We will talk on our own,
so just do your thing.

247
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,469
You two opened the apartment door, right?

248
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,637
What door?

249
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,389
We've been here this whole time.

250
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,144
It's a misunderstanding!

251
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,023
We went to the first floor,
and the door was already open,

252
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,525
so we got scared and ran away.
It's the truth.

253
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,694
Did you get bitten or scratched?

254
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
We just got scared and ran away.
That's all.

255
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
I'm fine, too. See?

256
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,582
Why did you go to the first floor?

257
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,933
Did you go outside because of this?

258
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,812
Give me that, I have to stream with it.
I risked my life to get that back.

259
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,321
One person went missing because of you.

260
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,491
If you're a human being,

261
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,702
you should have responsibility
at the very least.

262
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,834
Are they all okay?

263
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,043
Well, for now.

264
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,922
I really wanted to punch him a few times,
but I held back.

265
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,174
Where's Han Tae-seok?

266
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,884
At the rooftop.

267
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,719
He's going to look for the infected.

268
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,432
Is something wrong?

269
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,143
Seo-yoon's father

270
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,228
is infected.

271
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,439
That's why Han Tae-seok came in here.

272
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,906
I'm here to help, so don't worry.

273
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,242
Yes, it does seem so.

274
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,579
Haven't the infected come up here?

275
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,832
Two of them came up,
but I told them to go down over there.

276
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,468
I smashed that.

277
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,780
Did they just go down
when you told them to?

278
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,756
There aren't any infected
inside the building.

279
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,676
And it seems like Na Soo-min
went outside, infected.

280
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,595
You know their names too.

281
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,847
You must've done your homework.

282
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,476
Why did you come in here?

283
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,938
I'm sure you heard it from Ms. Yoon.

284
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,105
Yes.

285
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,942
I heard you're taking Seo-yoon.

286
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,652
But isn't it weird?

287
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,988
The Han Tae-seok I know
isn't that humanitarian.

288
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,492
You shot and killed someone a moment ago.

289
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,577
I don't know what you're thinking,

290
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,288
but I'm doing this to stop
the Mad Human Disease situation.

291
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm sure…

292
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,085
you agree with me on that.

293
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,763
Is Sae-bom really okay?

294
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,182
Her wound won't heal.

295
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,603
There's no need to worry
unless the wound changes color.

296
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,356
Mad Human Disease is harmless
until it reaches the brain.

297
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,693
Besides Sae-bom,

298
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,029
there are a lot of people
who recovered from that state, right?

299
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,039
There were four of them.

300
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,625
They were confirmed to be infected
through recent tests.

301
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,547
It's just a matter of time.
They couldn't avoid the disease after all.

302
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,008
When will the cure be out?

303
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,262
We're looking for antibodies
that can get into the brain.

304
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,141
We can't develop the cure
until we find that.

305
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,727
So that means…

306
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,853
The situation…

307
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,732
will keep getting worse…

308
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,192
until we find the antibodies.

309
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,656
What are you doing?

310
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,742
We gathered the residents, so come down.

311
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,085
I'll tell Seo-yoon first.

312
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,296
There's a message from Seo-yoon's mother.

313
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,922
Can I talk to her alone, please?

314
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,978
You're Seo-yoon, right?

315
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,690
You're the man who was on TV, aren't you?
You talked about Mad Human Disease.

316
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,192
Yes, you're very smart.

317
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,860
I get that a lot.

318
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,280
Can I talk to you for a second?

319
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,301
Would you like something to eat?
We have combat rations.

320
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,560
Mister?

321
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,563
Yes?

322
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,485
Let's eat that next time.

323
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,238
I'm just here to check on you.

324
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,073
I made a promise to your parents.

325
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,784
Do you know my mom and dad?

326
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,328
Park Yong-chul and Kang Eun-ji.

327
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,746
I saw them this morning.

328
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,331
Do they miss me?

329
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,255
A lot.

330
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,507
Do you want to see them?

331
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,474
You can get out if you want.

332
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,602
Can Sae-bom go out with me too?

333
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,440
Of course. Ms. Yoon's mother
is outside too.

334
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm sure she misses

335
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,279
her mother a lot, just like you.

336
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,089
You make the decision. I'll help you.

337
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,762
-Yi-hyun, you--
-If Seo-yoon gets out…

338
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,599
You go first.

339
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,105
What would you do if you get the disease?

340
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
What disease?

341
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,404
Mad Human Disease.

342
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,619
You know, you could get infected too.

343
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,663
Of course.

344
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,750
Of course, I can get infected too.
It's not like it's a crime.

345
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,882
If I get infected

346
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,471
and feel thirsty and want to bite people,

347
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,097
then I will make sure to tell you.

348
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,057
So…

349
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,977
you should also tell me
if anything happens.

350
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,817
I will.

351
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,158
I'm done talking to her.

352
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,952
Let's go meet the residents.

353
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,663
Old man,
your son could've gotten us all killed!

354
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,374
How dare you look at me like that?
You little brat!

355
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,835
Aren't you infected?

356
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,336
Does it look like I'm infected?

357
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,546
Stop it already!

358
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,464
-You rude brat…
-Who did this?

359
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,761
Who told you to gather without
the building representative's permission?

360
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,723
I heard someone came in from the outside.

361
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,642
Has anyone seen that person?

362
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,688
Have you? Who is it?

363
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,189
He's a military man.

364
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,150
Are you sure you saw it right?
You look like you can't see well.

365
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,610
Are you kidding?

366
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,029
Can you please get out of the way?

367
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,367
He was on TV.

368
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,122
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok
from the Crisis Management Center.

369
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,584
Sir, is the lockdown over?

370
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,960
-Really?
-It's over, right?

371
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,381
-Can we get out?
-When can we get out?

372
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,676
The whole city will be in lockdown…

373
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,887
and the electricity
will be cut off tonight.

374
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,140
Why would you cut off the electricity?

375
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,392
Are you trying to get us
all killed or what?

376
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:38,062
We're planning to fix it
as soon as possible.

377
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,607
Then you should lift
the lockdown at least!

378
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,734
You should let
healthy people out, at least!

379
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,321
-This is a violation of human rights!
-We don't even live here!

380
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,531
You should let us go home at least!

381
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,699
Lieutenant Colonel.

382
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,534
People are exhausted.

383
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,536
Locking us up in here won't do anything.

384
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,625
I have a friend who's a one-star rank.

385
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,585
Give me your phone. Let me make a call.

386
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,878
Sir…

387
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,297
It'll be over when I call him.

388
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,924
That's not what's important right now!

389
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,680
What?

390
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,766
What the heck?

391
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,142
What's going on?

392
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,855
This is not a drill.

393
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,484
Citizens, this is not a drill.

394
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:29,322
As of now, Martial Law
has been declared all over Seyang.

395
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,823
Martial Law?

396
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,116
This is not a drill.

397
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,453
Citizens, this is not a drill.

398
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,123
I'll go check on Seo-yoon.

399
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,584
-I'll go to the gym.
-Want me to go with you?

400
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,836
No, I'll go with Jung-kook later.

401
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:48,967
Be careful.

402
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,761
If it's dangerous,
you shouldn't hesitate either.

403
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,764
If something happens,
I'll take responsibility.

404
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,018
Don't worry.

405
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,531
The spread of Mad Human Disease

406
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,908
also brought the spreading
of false rumors,

407
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,618
crimes such as panic buying, theft,

408
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,247
and assault, as well as other forms

409
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,791
of extreme disturbance in society.

410
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,752
Therefore, to restore public order,

411
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,588
to protect the lives
and properties of the people,

412
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,009
and to end the crisis and maintain order,

413
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,553
the government
has declared Martial Law in Seyang.

414
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,637
Sae-bom.

415
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,267
From this point onwards, we ask citizens…

416
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,768
It's okay.

417
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,563
They're just trying
to make it sound scary.

418
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,405
As you heard,

419
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,074
it is also dangerous outside.

420
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,870
Just four days.

421
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,747
In four days,
the Martial Law will be lifted

422
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,583
and the lockdown level
on the apartments will be lowered.

423
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,835
Why cut the electricity, though?

424
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,129
Some people in
the power plant got infected also.

425
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:13,384
Except for a few necessary places,
it'll be cut off everywhere else.

426
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,261
-What?
-And the entire city

427
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,265
will have restrictions on going
out of the house, like this place.

428
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,268
Is the situation outside
that bad right now?

429
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,688
There's an overall shortage
of necessities and drinking water.

430
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,484
And violence is breaking out
around the city as well.

431
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,196
Well then, it might be safer inside.

432
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,365
Come on, we've been enduring it
quite well until now.

433
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,408
Four days?

434
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,244
That can actually be pretty short,
don't you think?

435
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,872
Trust me, and let's endure it
just a bit longer.

436
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,584
About Mad Human Disease…

437
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,381
I heard that there's a drug
that causes it if you take it.

438
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,385
Is that true?

439
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,140
We're still checking
on its relations to the disease.

440
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,192
So it is true.

441
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,073
Now, go home and charge
what you need to charge,

442
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,659
and fill your sinks
and bathtubs with water.

443
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,077
Once the electricity is off…

444
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,622
the water will be off too.

445
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,381
Don't worry.

446
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,926
Koreans are known for being able
to overcome national crises quite well.

447
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,096
Thank you, Mr. Kook.

448
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,358
I'll fill the bathtub at my house too.

449
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,239
Seo-yoon.

450
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,742
You talked to that military man, right?

451
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,621
I don't know how
the outside world is, either.

452
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,749
It may be better than here,

453
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,419
or worse than here.

454
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,506
Seo-yoon, do you want
to see your mom and dad?

455
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,928
I don't drink water that much.

456
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,644
It's not because
I think of you as a burden.

457
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:34,901
But if you want to stay here,
I will do my best to protect you,

458
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,320
and help you meet your parents.

459
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:42,617
I'm only asking you how you feel.

460
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,493
I want to see them…

461
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,705
But that military man is a bit weird.

462
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,831
Why? How?

463
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,586
It's just… he seemed like
he was interested in you.

464
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,130
He asked me how you were

465
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,008
and if you were sick.

466
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,154
Would this be enough?

467
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,457
It may be dangerous outside.

468
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,875
I'll be right back.

469
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,431
What about Seo-yoon?

470
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,896
She wants this given to her mom and dad.

471
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,362
If you're worried
about Seo-yoon going out alone,

472
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,656
then you can go out with her.

473
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,907
We don't know when

474
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,368
-she will be able to meet--
-Why are you here?

475
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,291
I'm here to find even the smallest
possibility of solving this situation.

476
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,129
It looks like you're here to take me,
but I don't know why.

477
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,343
Does it have to do with this?

478
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
I guess I can say that.

479
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,686
We found an antibody in your blood.

480
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,274
We must check
if that antibody is effective first.

481
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,275
Even if it means…

482
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,361
getting you bitten by the infected.

483
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,512
Don't shoot!

484
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,766
What?

485
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,393
Didn't you just hear the sound of gunfire?

486
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,232
Martial Law was declared.
I guess that was a warning shot.

487
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,194
Hey, Yi-hyun.

488
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,739
You're close to Han Tae-seok, right?

489
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,575
-No.
-Hey.

490
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,121
Can you please tell him
to take me with him when he leaves?

491
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,709
I'm having a hard time.

492
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,172
Is it because you're worried
about your wife?

493
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,384
Okay. I'll talk to him about it.

494
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,970
I'm sure your wife is fine. Don't worry.

495
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,439
Didn't you say Kim Seung-beom is dead?

496
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,357
He's there…

497
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,372
What the…

498
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,211
They cut his brain open.

499
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,506
Why would they do that to a dead person?

500
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,427
We're looking for antibodies
that can get into the brain.

501
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,762
We can't develop the cure

502
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,140
until we find it.

503
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,142
This isn't healing well.

504
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,145
There's no need to worry
unless the wound changes color.

505
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,148
Mad Human Disease is harmless
until it reaches the brain.

506
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,108
He's here to take Sae-bom,

507
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,026
to find the antibody.

508
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,368
You stay here.

509
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,081
If Han Tae-seok comes,
stop him, no matter what.

510
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,273
Seo-yoon, why are you outside?

511
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,192
It's dangerous. Stay inside.

512
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,695
I heard the sound of a gun.
Is Sae-bom okay?

513
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:33,157
She went outside with scissors in her hand
to deliver my letter.

514
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,117
Let's go inside first.

515
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,999
She's a better fighter than I am.
You know that, right?

516
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,294
So you don't need to worry.

517
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:49,298
Go inside and lock the door.
I'll be right back, okay?

518
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,203
Sae-bom!

519
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,331
Ms. Yoon is in pain. Get out of the way.

520
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,359
Sae-bom is injured.

521
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,568
Han Tae-seok took her.

522
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,487
Damn it!

523
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,041
Target secured. Going up.

524
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,214
Don't pity the infected too much.

525
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,758
They can control their thirst

526
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,468
if they have the will.

527
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,406
Hey!

528
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,599
If you messed with Sae-bom,

529
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,393
I'm going to kill you.

530
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,568
Don't move, if you don't want to die.

531
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,114
That tranquilizer was strong enough
to knock an elephant out.

532
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,075
I guess I'm better than an elephant.

533
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,953
I'm going easy on you
because you didn't kill that guy.

534
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,138
Sae-bom, are you hurt?

535
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,516
I'm fine. Totally fine.

536
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,433
Calm down.

537
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,063
Long time no see, First Lieutenant.

538
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,065
Tell them to lower their guns

539
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,442
if they don't want
anything ugly to happen.

540
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,656
Lower your guns.

541
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,214
Ms. Yoon,

542
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,968
what should we do to get you tested?

543
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,595
You jerk!

544
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,641
Hey.

545
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,080
I'm not doing this
because I like you people.

546
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,416
I'm doing this
because it'll help with the cure.

547
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,253
Thank you.

548
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,304
Wait.

549
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,184
Prepare boxed lunches
for the apartment residents,

550
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,727
with lots of meat.

551
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,396
And I heard you took…

552
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,733
Kim Seung-beom's body.

553
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,695
I know you will need to handle it
as part of the procedure,

554
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,073
but at least let his family know.

555
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,163
The situation is bad outside,
so it will take time to contact them.

556
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,667
And my mom…

557
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,878
Your mother is doing fine
at the nursing home.

558
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,673
Lieutenant Colonel took care of it.
Don't worry.

559
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,972
But why did you cut Mr. Kim's brain open?

560
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,682
Are you looking for antibodies?

561
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,979
I told you that Mad Human Disease
works on the brain.

562
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,315
We sometimes find antibodies

563
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,776
in the blood of dead infected people.

564
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,654
But they can't penetrate the brain.

565
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,448
The body has the antibodies,

566
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,534
but they can't get into the brain.

567
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,245
So you cut the brains
of the infected open?

568
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,206
To see if they have
antibodies in their brains?

569
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,500
Then what about Sae-bom?

570
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,170
Were you trying to cut
Sae-bom's brain open too?

571
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,217
No.

572
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,470
I must collect her blood.
The test can be done with her blood.

573
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,226
Can you make the cure

574
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,104
with Sae-bom's blood?

575
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,612
A new kind of monoclonal antibody
was found from Ms. Yoon's blood.

576
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,156
We'll have to do more tests.

577
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,992
It may be able to penetrate

578
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,286
the blood-brain barrier
and enter the brain.

579
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,789
That means Sae-bom is very important
to the Republic of Korea.

580
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,292
It is possible.

581
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,668
Then give me a few weapons

582
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,920
so I can protect Sae-bom.

583
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,591
Will you be okay?

584
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,552
What do you mean?

585
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,348
We're not sure about her antibodies.
Her disease can occur at any time.

586
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,393
That's why I should be by her side,
so I can watch over her.

587
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,399
Yi-hyun!

588
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,361
Hey, I'm done!

589
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,823
The blood has been collected.

590
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,618
Let's go. I'll get you the items you want.

591
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,288
But why are you going so far for this?

592
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,248
Even sneaking into the apartments.

593
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,211
Don't say nonsense like
you want to save the infected.

594
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,137
It's because of money.

595
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,016
Many rich and powerful people
got infected too.

596
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,435
That's why we're handling
all this in secret.

597
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,686
If they hear about it,

598
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,856
they're going to have
themselves cured first,

599
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,317
even if it means taking
all of Ms. Yoon's blood.

600
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,943
Then the development of the cure,

601
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,030
which will make the real money,
will get delayed.

602
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,079
You care about money,
and I care about Sae-bom.

603
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,207
Don't mess with us ever again.

604
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,709
And when this is over,

605
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:27,130
I will reveal what you did,
so keep that in mind.

606
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,259
Go ahead.

607
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,471
I'll take responsibility
for everything I've done.

608
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,449
Mr. Kim, no smoking.

609
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,034
Open the door.

610
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,842
Jung-kook, are you okay?

611
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,884
Yes.

612
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,179
The blood on Sae-bom's face…

613
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,765
That wasn't Sae-bom's blood.

614
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,393
Don't worry.

615
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,487
-Yi-hyun.
-Yes?

616
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,614
My gun.

617
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,158
Right.

618
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,411
Thank you for this.

619
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,421
I heard something serious
happened at the gym.

620
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,882
Is the woman from the fourth floor okay?

621
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,968
I will tell you if we need help.

622
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,484
I'll take these.

623
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,991
I told you to just take it
and shove it in your mouth!

624
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,827
I'm checking the expiration dates, okay?

625
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,745
Jeez.

626
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,836
I thought he'd kill him,

627
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,713
but he just shot him on the shoulder.

628
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,216
And he didn't wait
until I got bitten, either.

629
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,724
Don't shoot!

630
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,310
Still, he's a bad guy.

631
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,855
I know that, but…

632
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,025
he seemed desperate too.

633
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,178
Four days. We just need
to endure it for four days.

634
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,389
Then everything will be back to normal.

635
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,198
Are you going to cooperate…

636
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,284
with that weirdo on the sixth floor?

637
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,664
No, he's totally hopeless.

638
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,917
We need someone.

639
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,129
Someone who has power,
but will follow our orders.

640
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,176
Where would we find someone like that?

641
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,187
Hello?

642
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,233
Is the pastor inside?

643
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:45,031
I want to thank him
for saving my life and pray together.

644
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,579
Hi.

645
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,207
Come in.

646
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,834
Okay.

647
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,756
Are you just going to keep watching that?

648
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,801
Then what else can I do in here?

649
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,761
Go take out the trash.

650
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,973
You said you hate it when it stinks.

651
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,600
Jeez.

652
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,407
There's no other husband like me on Earth.

653
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,886
Hi, Mr. Kook.

654
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,012
Hi.

655
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,515
You must be here to take out the trash.

656
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,267
Yes.

657
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,146
Mr. Oh shouldn't be making
his guest do something like this.

658
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,523
Give me that.

659
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,460
We can't take them out properly
until the lockdown is over.

660
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,881
What is it?

661
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,425
Should I take them downstairs?

662
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm just so scared.

663
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,646
What happened?

664
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,401
Is Mr. Oh harassing you?

665
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,157
Please help me, Mr. Kook.

666
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,255
What should we do with the food waste?

667
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,258
Should we put it in the freezer?

668
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,237
The freezer isn't a trash can.
Give me that.

669
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,197
Is there a place to throw it away?

670
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,454
You must be out of your mind!

671
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,542
We pay the maintenance fee.

672
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,772
Oh Joo-hyung killed Director Park.

673
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,733
Really?

674
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,319
He told me.

675
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,614
I'll be dead too if you don't help me.

676
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,325
I thought I'd just wait until I got out,

677
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,327
but Martial Law has been declared.

678
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,872
Of course, I must help you.

679
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,917
I'll protect you, Ms. Woo.

680
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,176
I knew you would help me out.

681
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,640
Everything's okay…

682
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,312
What were you doing outside?

683
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,065
I took out the trash.

684
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,483
Dressed like that?

685
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,944
This is how I'm always dressed.

686
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,947
I can't wear
Director Park's clothes all the time.

687
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,159
Are you thirsty?

688
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,246
I'm not infected, so don't worry.

689
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,201
What should we do with Ms. Yoon's blood?

690
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,705
Test it only at the labs
with Biosafety Level 3.

691
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,709
Yoon Sae-bom got up
after being injected with a tranquilizer.

692
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,548
That wasn't a quantity
a human being can handle.

693
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,551
Perhaps the virus is in her brain already.

694
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,846
Fast recovery is
a characteristic of the infected.

695
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,557
But the test result was clean.

696
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,561
Maybe the antibody has formed perfectly.

697
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:51,606
Be careful so the higher-ups don't notice.

698
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,942
No one can get their hands on her
until we get something. Okay?

699
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:55,985
Yes, sir.

700
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,030
How are Park Seo-yoon's parents?

701
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,950
The father is now a severe patient,
and the mother still has minor symptoms.

702
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,262
Show this to them
when they're in a better condition.

703
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,267
TO MOM AND DAD

704
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,311
It'll help them a bit.

705
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,083
Seo-yoon.

706
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,668
Yes, I'm coming.

707
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:11,269
Is this okay to eat?

708
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,813
Will the electricity really be cut off?

709
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,648
Yes, it will.

710
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:25,742
This refrigerator was treated
like a priceless heirloom.

711
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,994
It's useful in times like this.

712
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:33,207
Is the soybean paste
in the veranda okay to eat?

713
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,876
I'm the one who made it.

714
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,503
It's better than the ones sold in stores.

715
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,638
Why?

716
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,683
Ma'am, sir, I must get going.

717
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,685
Why?

718
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,854
Dong-hyun isn't coming out?

719
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,692
Do you have a place you can go to?

720
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,486
I should go down to the second floor.

721
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,947
But I heard you caused trouble there.

722
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,784
Is it okay for you to go there?

723
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,999
Then, take care.

724
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,584
But…

725
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,381
Okay, then. Goodbye.

726
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,553
You're just so heartless.

727
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,472
Dong-hyun takes that after you.

728
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,521
Young lady.

729
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:43,152
We have an empty room,
so stay here if you want to.

730
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,113
Really? Thank you.

731
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,783
Thank you so much.

732
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,755
Soo-min!

733
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,174
Hey, Hyun-kyung.

734
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:11,389
I'm fine. I'm here to tell you that…

735
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,810
Do you have a place to sleep at?

736
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:21,399
I'm a bit scared, but…

737
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,694
I can't go inside your house.

738
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,488
I don't know what I might do to you.

739
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,410
Soo-min,

740
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,204
I'm sorry…

741
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,373
Hey, don't be.

742
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,251
Why are you sorry?

743
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,587
It was my fault.

744
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:49,093
Hyun-kyung, can I…

745
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,512
ask you a favor?

746
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,142
If something terrible…

747
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,688
happens to me…

748
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:05,943
please take care

749
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,405
of my family.

750
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,660
Soo-min,

751
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,204
you'll be fine.

752
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,499
They said the cure will be out soon,
so just wait…

753
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,752
Soo-min.

754
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:45,775
WIFE: COME HOME SOON

755
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,736
I HAVE TO MAKE A HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT
BUT I'M SCARED TO GO ALONE

756
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,279
JUST WAIT A BIT, OKAY?

757
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,532
Just wait a bit, okay?

758
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,791
It's delicious.

759
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,045
Really?

760
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,339
Let me take a bite too.

761
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,512
It's not bad.

762
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,807
See? Trust me when it comes to food.

763
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,629
Seo-yoon, be careful with your hands.
It's still hot.

764
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,133
You eat so well.

765
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,802
-Isn't it delicious?
-Yes.

766
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,947
There may be more infected people inside.

767
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,824
I saw something weird.

768
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,409
Where did you find this?

769
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,911
I saw a wound on her hand.

770
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,997
Dad, you know something's wrong
with Mom, don't you?

771
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:09,502
Someone infected
is hiding in there, right?

772
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,254
It's better to get rid of those
who may cause problems.

773
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,007
Did you spike the drinks with this?

774
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,344
I just need you two dead.
The rest are just bonuses.

775
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,598
How could you come up
with such a crazy idea?

776
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:31,524
