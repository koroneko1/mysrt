1
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,280
Those who understand life

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,200
to the point of finding humor
in bad situations

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,599
will live a long happy life
without clinging to it.

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,120
These kind of people are rare.

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,480
Wherever they are,
they make people happy.

6
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,560
-More! More!
-More! More!

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
Hi, everyone!

8
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,520
We are...

9
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,879
Ladies and gentlemen...

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
Can you keep it short?

11
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,759
Please keep it short.

12
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,759
I'm standing here
with a microphone in front of me.

13
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,439
I'm standing here naked... I mean...

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm standing here waiting
in front of a microphone.

15
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,319
Talking about Bangkok,
I really wanted to go...

16
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,479
So I got dressed and ready to roll...

17
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,360
I went to the south pier,
but the boat was not there...

18
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,800
Why didn't you go to the north pier?
The boat might be there.

19
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,759
Docking it there was way too hard.

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,039
Upon arrival at Bangkok,

21
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,159
I found people peeling bananas

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,439
so I pull out my...

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,439
bananas to peel.

24
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,400
-What are you doing?
-Combing my hair.

25
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,840
Who use bananas as a comb?

26
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,080
My hair and bananas
have something in common.

27
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,719
What? You and bananas are bald?

28
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,520
All right, go home.

29
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,400
Why can't you say, "I have split ends,"
so we can have a laugh?

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm so scared!

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm so petrified!

32
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Mom.

33
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,279
-What's this?
-My ear.

34
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,560
-You still want it?
-Of course.

35
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,800
-How many do you want?
-Both.

36
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,680
You want them gone both?

37
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey!

38
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,040
-Just one cut off?
-Hey!

39
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,399
No!

40
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,199
-Cut off both ears.
-Hey!

41
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
-Keep both ears intact.
-Hey!

42
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,040
-That's correct.
-Right.

43
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,759
-Why stopping now?
-Right.

44
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,079
You should've cut more.

45
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,680
To be honest, I'm so stressed
because I picked the wrong husband.

46
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,399
Then how could you have a son with him?

47
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,879
What happened inside my bedroom
is none of your business.

48
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
-What?
-Hey!

49
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,720
Did you have an affair with my wife?

50
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,240
What? No! Look at me. I'm your friend.

51
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,920
That's why you use lip balm every day.

52
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,319
Come on! Shave off his hair nicely.

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Hey! Are you crazy?

54
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,800
-Why's that?
-Your son's right here.

55
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,920
This is Santisuk.
I'm not the one getting ordained.

56
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,399
-I don't have a wife yet.
-Let's cut.

57
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,839
-Put his hair here.
-Careful with the scissors.

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,199
All right.

59
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,519
My son.

60
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,519
Papa, your turn.

61
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,279
-Your turn.
-Bathe him.

62
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,720
Hey!

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,879
For mom! For mom!

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,879
What are you doing? Come on, help him up.

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,839
-Come on up, my child.
-At the same time.

66
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,279
For mom! For mom!

67
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,560
He does it for his mom.
He rolled down like a ball.

68
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
After bathing Naga, the next step...

69
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,360
is to apply turmeric and marl powder.

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,839
Please call me Search.

71
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,920
Search. Search...

72
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,360
After coating him with all this flour,
let’s deep fry him.

73
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,720
Come here and listen

74
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,920
The story of Naga's father and mother

75
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,439
How they met

76
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,079
Please, Naga

77
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,199
Listen to this story

78
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,839
Naga

79
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,839
Before you enter monkhood

80
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,399
Did you know the story

81
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,000
Of your father and mother?

82
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,519
That your father and mother

83
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,120
They were wicked and vicious

84
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,800
Did you know?

85
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,279
Your mother was good for nothing

86
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,399
And your father was up to no good

87
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,759
Our whole community

88
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,680
Was well aware of it

89
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,920
O Naga

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,159
Before your mother met your father

91
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,360
She granted favors to any man

92
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,159
I'd be hard to count
How many partners she had

93
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Your mother made merits with her buttocks

94
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,960
She had virtue in promiscuity

95
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,240
O hear me, Naga

96
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,799
Immorality did not only plague
Your mother

97
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
But also your father

98
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,399
He chased skirts
No matter who

99
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,360
Even an unfortunate one with no limbs

100
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,960
He still failed to see it as a sin

101
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,320
Hear me, Naga

102
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,879
It's uncertain who you are

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,360
As you might not be this man's son

104
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Excuse me, masters.

105
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,000
Your song's very touching. It's beautiful.

106
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,120
I almost teared up.

107
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,000
But I'd like to ask you something.

108
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,960
Who exactly is my father?

109
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,919
Who's your father is still unclear

110
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,799
It could be any of us masters sitting here

111
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,440
This’s not how to chant a send-off.
People will misunderstand his parents.

112
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,639
Just kidding!

113
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,720
-We haven't started yet.
-True.

114
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,200
Mahori, let's do it!

115
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,480
Namaskar.

116
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,080
Bless you all.

117
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,159
Are you tired, Mom?

118
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,879
Seeing you in this robe,
I even forget about feeling tired.

119
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,039
What's your name?

120
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,960
Where are you from?

121
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,840
Why do you want to be ordained?

122
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,240
My name's Noi. What about you?
Why were you ordained?

123
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,919
We just met
and he made me speechless.

124
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,559
I became a monk

125
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,840
because I wanted to study
the Lord Buddha's Dharma.

126
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,519
Then I found peace.
So I remained a monk.

127
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,639
Yeah. That's my reason too.

128
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
I hope things will get better.

129
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm tired of this world,
tired of how divided we are,

130
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,440
tired of politics,
tired of student gangsters,

131
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,840
tired of life,
tired of the rise and fall of fame,

132
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,960
of everything that's going on and on,
like it never stops, never goes back...

133
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,159
tired of love that's not yet to be found,

134
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
tired of the fact that she left,

135
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,559
tired of those politicians
who never keep their words,

136
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,519
-and abuse our taxes--
-Enough!

137
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,759
-Enough! Enough!
-Sorry.

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,000
Enough.

139
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,919
Well, I'm just afraid
that if you get tired of this temple,

140
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,240
us monks would be thrown in jail.

141
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,960
But at least it's a good reason,
better than getting ordained just to chill

142
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,600
or just because it's what people do.

143
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't want the type
who's sleepy at dawn

144
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,919
because he stayed up
until five in the morning

145
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
watching TV and eating ramen
and French fries.

146
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,159
That was a joke. I'm kidding.

147
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,360
Entering monkhood

148
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,240
may not make all your wishes come true.

149
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,600
Our lives, our destinies.

150
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,600
This is an auspicious moment.

151
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,200
Bring me the head
of that Buddha’s statue.

152
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,360
You know which one, right?

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,080
You know where the hell it is.

154
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,720
I can't say that. It's a sin.

155
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
You know where the statue is, right?

156
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,360
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

157
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
That's good! Loud and clear!

158
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,000
Dad, this is wrong.

159
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,120
You've been doing it for so long.
You can stop now.

160
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,000
We have so much money already.

161
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,720
Monks have 227 rules to follow.

162
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,159
If you can follow just five,
that would be great.

163
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,919
Son of a bitch!

164
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,080
How dare you lecture me?

165
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm your father!

166
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,080
Your mother lived right next to a temple.
I still had no trouble screwing her.

167
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,960
I screwed her on a long-tail boat,

168
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,399
on land and in water,
and the noise was like...

169
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm way worse than you think.

170
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
You don't have to teach me. Just listen.

171
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,759
The five precepts?

172
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,480
I can tell you right now.
Listen and keep in mind.

173
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
It's good for you if you remember.

174
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,039
Pana Panu.

175
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,759
Kill no goose, no fish.

176
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
If you find a giant snake-head fish,

177
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,000
smash its head,
then make some soup out of it.

178
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,840
This is just the first precept.

179
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,200
Adinna.
Abstain from taking what is not given.

180
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,879
If the abbot is sleeping,

181
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,240
carefully search for his belongings.

182
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,559
That will do.

183
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,440
You still don't get it, you idiots.

184
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,600
Kamesumiccha.

185
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't steal people's wives.

186
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,799
If they want it,

187
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,120
let them get some.

188
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,559
How did I come up with this?

189
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,679
Musa. Don't lie,

190
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,919
or else you'll go to hell for sure.

191
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,799
If your lies make you rich,

192
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,120
then keep doing it.

193
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,679
Sura. Refrain from drinking
and using drugs.

194
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,480
If you don't have money,
you can't have fun.

195
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,000
If you do, my brothers,
run for it. Don't be afraid.

196
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,639
Make it the best day of your life.

197
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,799
Come on, let's go find him!

198
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,120
Fuck yeah!

199
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
Fate makes plans for idiots.

200
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,120
Idiots follow without question.

201
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,039
Idiot meets idiot, they're doomed.

202
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,440
One's gone.

203
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
One remain.

204
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,720
-Bros for life!
-Bros for life!

205
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,960
-Damn cool!
-Damn right!

206
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,600
Do you like it?

207
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,519
-Who's that?
-Who's that?

208
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,240
You did this, didn't you?

209
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Why did you paint a monk's bowl?

210
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,840
-Yeah, we did.
-Ood!

211
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,879
At least Ood knows
that lying to a monk is wrong.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,559
Father, you've been ordained for so long.

213
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
-Have you seen what does a vice look like?
-No.

214
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,039
Vice's mouth is like smiley.

215
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,399
While virtue...

216
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,759
-Yes?
-Its mouth is like kissy.

217
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,759
Virtue... Virtue...

218
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,160
Repeat after me.

219
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,039
-Repeat what?
-Vice.

220
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,039
-Vice.
-Virtue.

221
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Virtue.

222
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,799
-You're doing good.
-Isn't that so?

223
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,799
Nope! Can you try like...

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
purse your lips while saying it.

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
-Please do it, Father.
-Yes, yes, Father.

226
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,839
Vice.

227
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:29,839
Vice.

228
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,119
That's good!

229
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
-How about this?
-Almost got it.

230
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,759
Say virtue while smiling.

231
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,720
Virtue.

232
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:38,920
Virtue.

233
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,920
What now? You guys want me
to jump in the water with you?

234
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Stop fooling around and get out!

235
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,759
You must prepare Kuti for the new monk
who's getting ordained today.

236
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,279
And you'd better take care of this too.

237
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
Sure.

238
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Vice.

239
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,599
Virtue.

240
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,559
What?

241
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,039
Hurry up!

242
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
This is peace.

243
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,119
This is what I've been searching for.

244
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,319
I wish to be a bridge between material
and dharmic worlds

245
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,920
to help Thais find peace
with each other again.

246
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,960
I promise.

247
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,759
Really?

248
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,680
Hello.

249
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,519
I'm human.

250
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,640
Please don't be afraid. I'm human.

251
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,680
How are you doing?

252
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,480
No, please don't bow to me, Venerable.
Otherwise, I'll be damned.

253
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,640
-No need to bow back.
-All right.

254
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,960
And don't be afraid.

255
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,160
-I live in this temple.
-Right.

256
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,599
-My name's Song.
-I'm Phra Noi.

257
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,519
Some people call me...

258
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,079
Boonsong. Others call me Goonsong.

259
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm so amused by my own name.

260
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,480
-Venerable, you're just ordained, right?
-Yes.

261
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,039
Em and Ood were ordered
to prepare living quarters for you.

262
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
-Please come with me.
-Okay then.

263
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
-Thank you.
-Yes.

264
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
Em. Ood.

265
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:48,519
Who did this?

266
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,200
You vicious sinners!

267
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,960
How can you do this to a piteous monk?

268
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,359
Hey.

269
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,960
Is he a monk or that guy from Avatar?

270
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,759
He's a monk, Venerable.

271
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,960
Tell me who did this.

272
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,599
-It was Em.
-No, it was Ood.

273
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,519
-Traitor.
-I just bought the colors.

274
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,799
All right, it was me.

275
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,359
They're new here.
Phra Noi and Phra Search.

276
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,440
Father wants you to guide them.

277
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,720
Phra Search can stay
in the room next to yours.

278
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,519
Phra Noi can stay in this room.

279
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,759
Sure, I'll take care of them.

280
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
-All right.
-By the way,

281
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,359
is this washable?

282
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,359
It will take months.

283
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,279
What a relief.

284
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh...

285
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,720
how can I walk outside?

286
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,279
Hey! Stop!

287
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,359
Hey!

288
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,720
Stop!

289
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,079
Hi, everyone!

290
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,680
What do you think about your audience
fighting again?

291
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm very concerned,
but I'll continue doing my best.

292
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,440
I want everyone to have fun
and have a good time.

293
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,400
But what's your opinion
about this incident?

294
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,559
And are your next shows still confirmed?

295
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,400
I hope so. I hope people still want
to come and have fun with us.

296
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,759
Your audience always becomes aggressive.

297
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,720
There's criticism that your shows
divide people and incite violence.

298
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,119
Your thoughts?

299
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,759
-Do you think it will happen again?
-Is it because of the dance moves?

300
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,599
-Yeah, too aggressive.
-No!

301
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,519
This is ridiculous!

302
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,559
People were screaming.

303
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,359
Not far from that big tall fella
who was hurting...

304
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,519
But why? Why?

305
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,480
Why no one helped?

306
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,200
Don't think too much.

307
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
Don't think too much. Just stop.

308
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,720
Do you see that hose?

309
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,000
When you turn on the water full volume
without people holding it,

310
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:51,599
the hose will swerve uncontrollably.

311
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,599
Our hands are like Dharma
that calm our minds,

312
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,039
not to be distracted
by uncontrollable thoughts.

313
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,079
Okay. Let go.

314
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
Let go.

315
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,359
Let go

316
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,680
Forget it

317
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
Let go

318
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,759
Forget it.

319
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,119
Let go
Forget it

320
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,839
For-get-it

321
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Where?

322
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,480
Why are you barking at me?

323
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,799
If we go back empty-handed,
our boss's going to kill us.

324
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,359
Hey! I got an idea!

325
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,440
We should take something back with us.

326
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,920
Ter, don't tell me
you're going to steal the whole church?

327
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,160
Stop it, Ptooey!

328
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,480
-Look behind you.
-Behind me?

329
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
A big bell, chiming, chiming.

330
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
Everything happens
as a result of karma and samsara.

331
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,759
Yet, our bell was stolen.

332
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,240
And look at all these poor dogs
running around

333
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,200
without anyone bothering to pick them up.

334
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,440
People these days.

335
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,079
Oh, a scarecrow.
I thought it was a person.

336
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
Who wants to be rich?

337
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,160
-I do!
-I do!

338
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,680
They all knew this joke.

339
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,000
Everyone, please follow me.

340
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,839
We have to bless them with age, beauty,
and no harm from smoking cigarettes.

341
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,279
Oh, my God!

342
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,440
Here they come with their bright
orange and yellow robes,

343
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,599
including your lover. I know,
the one with the mole on his forehead,

344
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,240
This way, please.

345
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,680
You think that I didn't know,
that I had forgotten?

346
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,400
-What?
-You want to give alms, right?

347
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,160
-Yes.
-Then get it over with, so they can leave.

348
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,039
I don't want to have problems with anyone.

349
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,480
If you want to ask about love...

350
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,359
Here comes poetry.

351
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,119
...it's hard to answer it with reason.

352
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,079
I can see you stealing a glance.

353
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,559
I just know if I ever love anyone...

354
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,319
Don't deny it.

355
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,119
...I'll be in deep water with my husband.

356
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,200
Forget about deep water.
I'm going to kick your ass right here.

357
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,759
Open your bowl lid, I'm giving you alms.

358
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,039
Don't forget, you're a monk.

359
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,240
Starring at a woman is a sin.

360
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,200
If you're uncomfortable, don't do it.
The poem, I mean.

361
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,839
Are you warning me?
Out of your good heart?

362
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,240
I know what you think.

363
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,799
Though you renounced the secular world,
can you cut it off completely?

364
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,440
-It's water under the bridge.
-Yeah. Right.

365
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,839
Here are our offerings.

366
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,519
Do you still get jealous?

367
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
It just happens, you know?

368
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,359
I renounced that life.

369
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,720
Renounce what,
your robes, perhaps?

370
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,960
Come on, give me a break.

371
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,359
It's like this every morning.

372
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,079
Not every morning.

373
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,960
When he's not here, we're fine.

374
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,400
But when certain someone comes,
we get into a fight. It just happens.

375
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,680
Why fight?
Don't you feel bad for your country?

376
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,960
We, as a nation, are wounded enough.

377
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,799
Do you know the word "unity?"

378
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,160
He's right. Family as an institution
is in a fragile state.

379
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,559
If you can't make your family happy,

380
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
what can you do for your country?

381
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
You gave me goosebumps!

382
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,480
-Ayu--
-No need!

383
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,720
Today seems like it's not a good day.

384
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,039
You should've not treated them that way,

385
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,240
-and you know it.
-Shut up!

386
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,400
Father, this way please.

387
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,000
-Father.
-Yes?

388
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,559
If I don't give you food,
what will you eat?

389
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,039
Then I won't eat.

390
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,640
Why don't you cook in your temple?

391
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,480
Nobody gives us a gas stove.

392
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,039
Father... Oh! Father!

393
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,319
What's on your forehead?

394
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,160
A fly, maybe? Slap it.

395
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,960
Please open you lid.

396
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,519
-Father.
-Yes?

397
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,400
Is he new?

398
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,559
His name's not New.
It's Search.

399
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,799
He used to be a comedian.

400
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,079
Please call me Phra Search.

401
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,319
Phra Search.

402
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
That's funny!

403
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,839
Who wants to be rich?

404
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
I do. I do.

405
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,119
He's funny!

406
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,839
Don't want you to get hungry.

407
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
Long life, beauty, happiness, strength

408
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,000
Sadhu.

409
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,440
You should bless him.

410
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,559
May you live your life long,

411
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,880
in good health,

412
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,200
and be tall,

413
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,359
happy and handsome,

414
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,319
please.

415
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,039
Thank you. You too.

416
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,799
Let's go. It's almost noon
and we haven't eaten.

417
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,480
Bye-bye!

418
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,720
When are we arriving?

419
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,200
It's so hot and this bowl is heavy.

420
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,319
It's hot and heavy, but we'll be fine.

421
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,240
This is nothing compared to your mother
carrying you in her womb for nine months.

422
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,279
It's heavy and uncomfortable.
She had to stop eating sour, sweet,

423
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,599
fatty, spicy,
or spicing things up with your father...

424
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,640
I mean cooking something spicy
for your father.

425
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,599
She couldn’t even do that.

426
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,480
We were so absorbed with what you said

427
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,279
we walked pass our temple.

428
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,839
Wait! This is our temple.

429
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,160
It's probably the work
of those two nitwits.

430
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,599
Well, I think it's beautiful.
It can attract people.

431
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,599
Everything is a result
of karma and samsara.

432
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,039
-Isn't it so?
-You remember that well.

433
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
Oh...

434
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,119
it's beautiful.

435
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,880
Pure art.

436
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,279
A fine line between heaven and hell.

437
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,279
What are you looking at?

438
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,759
We eat to live, not live to eat.

439
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,359
Eventually everything
goes down to our stomach.

440
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,759
Strange.

441
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,599
I haven't seen a new monk
like him in quite a while.

442
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,200
Strange?

443
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't think this strange.

444
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,079
Strange is those who swallow bricks,
sand and dirt.

445
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,519
Or in the worst case,
the whole mountain.

446
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,119
And if you're not careful,
someday they'll swallow this temple too.

447
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,880
Those capitalists who want to sell
this land to make a golf course.

448
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,000
Em!

449
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,839
Em!

450
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
Em!

451
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,400
Father, why are they being punished?

452
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,760
-They're grown men.
-Airbrushing the whole temple like that?

453
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
-Did you think it was right?
-They're grown-ups...

454
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,800
-It's not because I'm mad.
-...but acted like a child,

455
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,360
-and must be punished.
-You caused troubles for the monks.

456
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,159
They couldn't think like grown-ups.

457
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,679
You troublemakers!

458
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,760
-You deserve this!
-However, violence is never an answer.

459
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,840
This is just for them to remember
that what they did wasn't right.

460
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Let's eat.

461
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,000
He's so damn stupid.

462
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,719
Genius!

463
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,280
-He's a fool.
-He's never going to catch us.

464
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,159
Can you eat that?

465
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,800
Well...

466
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,480
he's eating it.
I want to give it a try.

467
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,679
Let me try.

468
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,079
-I'll try it.
-Yeah, try it.

469
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,480
-Try it.
-Do you want to mix it with mine?

470
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,519
That's all right.
Just eat in your own plate.

471
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,920
That's it.

472
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,119
Oh...

473
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,880
it tastes like an enzyme Ionic plasma.

474
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,880
Hey! Anyone!

475
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,639
Pull me out of this chair,
so I can distinctly scold you guys.

476
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,639
-Come on!
-Help!

477
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,159
-Why didn't you step on my head?
-Gotcha.

478
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,719
Asshole! That was sarcastic.

479
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,320
Why did you steal a goddamn bell?

480
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,679
I told you to bring back the head.

481
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,480
Dad, dogs were everywhere,
barking and howling.

482
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,519
Why didn't you kill them all?

483
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,719
That's a sin, Dad.

484
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,760
Sin? Or you can just sedate them.

485
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,159
Whatever, I don't give a damn.

486
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,880
But you have to bring me
the head of the Buddha's statue.

487
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
I got an order from abroad.

488
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,480
Em, can you buy some medicine for me?

489
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,800
I don't feel well.

490
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,719
What medicine? It's pretty late.

491
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,960
I have some traditional remedy.

492
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,679
Please wait here.

493
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll be right back.

494
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,920
-Here you go.
-Can I have that? What is it?

495
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,599
Of course you can.

496
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,199
This is rancid urine medicine.

497
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,119
Try it, you'll feel better.

498
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,400
Venerable, it's mostly alcohol,

499
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,400
but you can mix it up
to use it as medicine.

500
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,519
But according to the Vinaya,
it's rancid urine with yellow myrobalan,

501
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,360
or alcohol.
It's against the precept.

502
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,519
-See?
-Yeah.

503
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,199
I told the Venerable Father,
but he didn't listen.

504
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,840
He's not healthy.
But after he tried some of this,

505
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,119
he can walk ten klicks just fine.
He's very strong now.

506
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,000
-How about running?
-Running's even faster than walking.

507
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,960
You can have it, Venerable.

508
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,559
Pour just one finger in a cup.

509
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,880
-You can drink it.
-Really?

510
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,199
Oh...

511
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,840
is it going to explode?

512
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,960
Phra Search couldn't even
join us for breakfast.

513
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,000
And who's to blame?
You two idiots!

514
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,320
Just one finger?

515
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,920
One finger in a small cup
or a shot glass, yes.

516
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,760
But you poured it in a water jar lid.

517
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,960
The depth’s right but the lid's wide.

518
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,079
That's like a whole bottle.

519
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,079
-God forbid!
-What?

520
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,960
Are you Sri Thanonchai reborn?

521
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,599
Oh...

522
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,880
I think Phra Search
is not going to be sober tomorrow.

523
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,920
-Then give him a fix!
-Seriously?

524
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,760
-You think you're funny?
-What?

525
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,000
-You're so funny.
-What? Get out of my face.

526
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,199
-They're monks. Show some respect.
-What's your problem?

527
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,719
-Are you trying to kiss his ass?
-Hell awaits you.

528
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,679
What's hell?

529
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,639
-Hey!
-Yes?

530
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,960
You know we are monks,

531
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,320
so learn to be more respectful,
Ood and Em.

532
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,880
Why? Yes I do know.

533
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,400
-Know what?
-Venerable Father. Venerable Brother.

534
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,960
Oh, poor me!

535
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,800
I really want to send
you back to your parents.

536
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,800
-Alas!
-Go!

537
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,480
If you do that, they will
send me to another temple.

538
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,079
But I like it here.

539
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,519
-Why?
-The monks are friendly.

540
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,519
I don't want to be friendly towards you.

541
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,719
Why are you walking in the front?
You know their house?

542
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,320
Stop touching me.
My father's not dead.

543
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,960
Careful, boss.

544
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Careful.

545
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,320
Careful.

546
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,559
Careful.

547
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,719
Good job!

548
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,079
We have to cut this off.

549
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,920
Careful!

550
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,239
You want the whole world to know?

551
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
How about this?

552
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,239
Let’s play some music
so nobody hears what we're doing.

553
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,159
It's so loud!

554
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,519
Let's get the party started!

555
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Yeah, good work! Keep going!

556
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,880
Come on!

557
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,800
-Faster!
-You'll wake up the whole village.

558
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,679
The monks won't know.
It's late. They're all sleeping.

559
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,119
If we don't camouflage ourselves,

560
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,000
people will know who we are.

561
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:56,480
-Keep going, so you can enter.
-Do it faster!

562
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,920
It's this big? How can we carry it?

563
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,679
You idiot!

564
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,239
-We just need the head.
-Yeah?

565
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,920
-Yeah.
-Are you done talking?

566
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,480
Why are you screaming?

567
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,519
-I thought you were a monk.
-No, it's me.

568
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,000
I just came to tell you
I finished sawing.

569
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:31,960
Well done.

570
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,039
-Can you stop talking and get to work?
-Yeah, get to work.

571
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,039
Hurry up!

572
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,360
Come on!

573
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,559
Come on! You want people
to find out what we're doing?

574
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,800
-I know.
-Hurry up!

575
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,599
I'm looking for a power socket.

576
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,639
Someone's coming.
Take whatever you can!

577
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,599
What's with the noise?

578
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:54,000
-Can you be considerate to the monks?
-Come on! Let's go!

579
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,880
It's late and nobody's come yet.

580
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,679
See?

581
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,000
It's your fault.

582
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,920
You trash-talked too much, you know?

583
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,880
I said nothing.

584
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,679
They're not coming here today.
I don't know where they went.

585
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,239
Come on out.

586
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,000
Hey!

587
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,039
Where are all the monks?

588
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,280
This temple is strangely quiet.

589
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,119
Maybe they're praying.

590
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,800
Let's go check it out.

591
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,920
This temple looks...

592
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,360
creepy. I'm scared.

593
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,800
-But I think…
-Come on.

594
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
...it is the perfect setting
for our movie.

595
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,400
Anyway,

596
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,519
we have to thank you

597
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,400
-for driving us up here.
-Thank you.

598
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,559
Would you park the car
somewhere cool and shady?

599
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:16,079
Then come and meet us.

600
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,639
Okay.

601
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,960
-Let's go.
-Come on.

602
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,360
Why is it so quiet?

603
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,519
-Is it deserted?
-Not really.

604
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,840
If it was, you'd see cacti.

605
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,960
Very funny.

606
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,599
Look!
What happened to him?

607
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,440
-Venerable?
-Venerable, sir!

608
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,960
-Wake up!
-Venerable!

609
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:45,440
There's a novice underneath him.

610
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,599
-Venerable!
-Venerable!

611
00:43:50,737 --> 00:43:52,400
-Venerable, sir!
-Venerable, please wake up!

612
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,360
Venerable!

613
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,159
What's going on?

614
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,079
Namaskar, Venerable.

615
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,960
-What happened?
-Bless you.

616
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,440
Ood! Ood!

617
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:13,239
Are we dead?

618
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,440
-What are you talking about?
-We're in heaven!

619
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,760
What heaven? This is a pavilion.

620
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,599
I think it's because of our merits.

621
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,559
Who are they?

622
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,639
They're angels, Ood.

623
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,360
What? Another one?

624
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,360
-Venerable!
-Venerable, sir!

625
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,679
Venerable!

626
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,119
Venerable!

627
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,039
Shit!
Who are you people?

628
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,559
M-I-D-O-A-B-W-J

629
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
A monk is dead on a big water jar.

630
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,599
Help! A monk is dead!

631
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,840
Anybody, help!

632
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,880
He's dead! Come on!

633
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,679
Hurry up! This way!

634
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,559
Instead of helping,
you're making me deaf.

635
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,760
-Father! Father!
-What happened?

636
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,440
Father, are you all right?

637
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,280
Are you safe? Father?

638
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,320
I'm all right. I almost died.

639
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,559
Hey!

640
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,800
What's going on?

641
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,320
-Is everyone all right?
-No!

642
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,760
Everyone was completely knocked out.

643
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,880
-Really?
-Yes.

644
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,320
And the marble Buddha statue?

645
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,920
-Have you checked?
-No.

646
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,199
-Let's go.
-Hurry, Father!

647
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,599
Phra Search!

648
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,480
-Venerable!
-Phra Search!

649
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,679
Phra Search!

650
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,199
Phra Search! Phra Search!

651
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,599
Come on, let's help him!

652
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,880
-Venerable!
-Those devils!

653
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,199
We'll see about that!

654
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,400
-I'll make them pay!
-Calm down.

655
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,320
We're monks. We should understand love,
greed, anger and lust.

656
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,519
Everything is a result
of karma and samsara.

657
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,159
How can you be this stupid?

658
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,280
I told you to sedate the dogs

659
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
not the monks.

660
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,960
If they all die, what will happen?

661
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,360
A massive funeral ceremony.

662
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,519
How can you be so dumb?

663
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,760
What a waste of time!

664
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,559
You morons!

665
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
Stupid assholes!

666
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,599
That monk who stopped you, who is he?

667
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,719
He's new, boss. He's just ordained.

668
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,599
How did he know?

669
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,519
You'd better find out about this monk.

670
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,519
"Thus, indeed, is the Exalted One,
a Worthy One,

671
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,079
a Fully Enlighted One,
endowed with wisdom and conduct,

672
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,039
an Accomplished one,
knower of the worlds,

673
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,880
an incomparable Charioteer
for the training of individuals,

674
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,239
the teacher of gods and men,
Omniscient and Holy.

675
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,519
Well expounded is the Dharma
by the Exalted one..."

676
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,079
-Namaskar, Venerable.
-May Buddha bless you.

677
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
I heard that by making merit
for a new monk,

678
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:03,199
we receive more good karma.

679
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,000
I also have great respect for you
for protecting the marble Buddha,

680
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
It's nothing really.

681
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,639
I mean, it's nothing. Just a coincidence.

682
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:15,599
What did you do before becoming a monk?

683
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,920
I was a Naga.

684
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,559
You're a real comedian.

685
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,800
Yes, I was really a comedian.

686
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,239
Really?

687
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,719
Venerable, we want to be comedians.

688
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,840
Can you please teach us?

689
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:37,920
You need no training
because your face's a joke already.

690
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,800
And you're all dressed up.
Back in the day,

691
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,920
we called it costume comedy.

692
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
The jokes are on your clothes,
not on your words.

693
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,239
But if you really want to learn,

694
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,000
I'll give you something.
Everybody loves it.

695
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,199
Whatever I ask,
you answer with "I do. I do."

696
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,760
-All right.
-Try this.

697
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:59,800
-Who wants to be rich?
-I do. I do.

698
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,800
-Who wants to be on a bus?
-I do.

699
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,079
-Who wants to be famous?
-I do

700
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,679
-Who wants a gold touch?
-I do. I do.

701
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,039
-Who wants to be a mutt?
-I do. I do.

702
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,440
-Listen carefully!
-I listened...

703
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:17,000
How was it? Funny?

704
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,840
-Yes.
-We had a good laugh.

705
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,519
Right.

706
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,360
So that's it for "to die."

707
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,480
"Today."

708
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,280
You're a quick learner. Well done.

709
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,480
We have to go now.
Goodbye, "vulnerable."

710
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:31,480
"Venerable!"

711
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,159
You keep saying "thongs wring."

712
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,320
-"Things wrong."
-You're not going to stop?

713
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,000
-Goodbye.
-May Buddha bless you.

714
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:38,519
Come on.

715
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,800
I do. I do.

716
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,440
Amazing.

717
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,800
It is not always
necessary to make merit

718
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,480
only on ceremonial,
or religious occasions.

719
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:53,679
You have to look inside your hearts

720
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,480
and see that every day
is actually the day you can give.

721
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,679
Who can understand?

722
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,840
-Moments like today, though special...
-What did he say?

723
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
...they're actually not
the most important thing.

724
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,400
What is important is that every day
in the morning,

725
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,880
you wake up with tolerance, understanding,
kindness, forgiveness,

726
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,039
and knowing that
you can do something good

727
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,800
for those who live next to you

728
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,960
even though they may be strangers.

729
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,320
He probably thinks this is America.
Song, translate.

730
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,079
Oh...

731
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,639
I don't know.

732
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,599
I saw you nodding throughout it.

733
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,519
-I know Korean, though. Like bonjour.
-His lips drooping down low.

734
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,239
Excuse me, Venerable.
Please translate it into Thai.

735
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,039
We don't necessarily need to make merit
only on religious occasions.

736
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,960
Because you actually can give everyday

737
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,559
if it's in your heart and soul.

738
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,800
You can make merit anytime and anywhere.

739
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,440
Don't pay too much attention
to ceremonial occasions.

740
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,519
Look at it this way, everyday
is the day you can do good.

741
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,599
The word "friend," as in friendship,

742
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:53,239
is so easy to write.

743
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,039
F-R-I-E-N-D. Friend.

744
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,360
But its meaning is much more profound.

745
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,400
Friends have to be dependable.
Friends have to be trustworthy.

746
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,519
Friends have to be respectful.

747
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,800
Unlike friends who help
each other abuse power

748
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,880
for personal gains in Thailand,
who take advantage of each other,

749
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,400
fight and harm each other.

750
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,480
We are all Thais.

751
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,119
We are a democracy, under a constitution.

752
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,639
One's freedom is not more important
than others'.

753
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,159
Everyone in this country
is just as Thai.

754
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,719
So please bear that in mind.

755
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,320
I'm sorry. I thought I was...

756
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,840
Lady Liberty.

757
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,840
Sadhu.

758
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:10,800
Why always me?

759
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,920
Em, did you knock the clock down?

760
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,039
Finish up.

761
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,840
Let's welcome the newbies
before I welcome them myself.

762
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,960
Have fun with that!

763
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,960
New monks?

764
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,800
New toys more likely.

765
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,360
God! Is it morning already?

766
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:42,840
I'll be late for alms-collecting.

767
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,440
I'm so late today.

768
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,880
They've probably been waiting.

769
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,840
It's my fault I woke up late.
Now it's eight o'clock.

770
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,239
Up by eight, down by six.

771
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,480
This is six in the evening!

772
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:17,800
Phra Noi,

773
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,360
where have you been?
Why are you back so late?

774
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,800
I was out for alms-collecting,
but I mistook the time.

775
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,159
I thought it was morning,
but it's actually evening.

776
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:27,920
What did you get? So we can have dinner.

777
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,119
Phra Search!

778
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,840
I'm not going to eat everything.
I'll share it with you.

779
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,239
Stop joking,

780
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,599
I think those two idiots did it again.

781
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:42,880
It could've been worse. Don't be angry.
Hey, that's the wrong turn, Phra Noi.

782
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,119
Oh, poor you.

783
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,960
When you're angry,
you don't know what you're doing!

784
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,360
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

785
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,840
You're always joking!

786
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,760
-Who wants to be rich?
-I do...

787
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,440
I don't care how funny he is.
You still have to get rid of him.

788
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:02,559
Get rid of him?

789
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,440
Because he prevented us
from stealing the Buddha's head. Right?

790
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,599
-Let's brainstorm.
-Okay.

791
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,360
Well, Phra Noi,

792
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,760
you told the villagers not to make merit,

793
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,920
so nobody showed up.

794
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,360
I told them that they can do it every day,
not just on religious holidays.

795
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,079
Right?

796
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,400
Yes.

797
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:35,159
It's all right.
We eat to live, not live to eat.

798
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:37,440
So this... one egg...

799
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:39,239
we make it into quarter.

800
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:43,440
We probably have to eat shells.

801
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,480
I'm kidding, Father.
I'll take care of this.

802
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:48,400
I'll be right back. Let's go, Ood.

803
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,960
I'll find something
in the offering buckets.

804
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,639
-I'll pick mangoes from the trees.
-No, I pick mangoes, you find buckets.

805
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,159
Just don't steal other
people's mangoes, all right?

806
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,159
Okay.

807
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,039
What you looking at?

808
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:05,760
The egg.

809
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,599
You’ve never seen one?

810
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,760
-I have.
-Why are you staring then?

811
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,639
I've just never seen one egg.

812
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,440
Did you find anything in the buckets?

813
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:20,480
They're not really edible.

814
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:22,639
Ood, give me some leeks.

815
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,679
Come on.

816
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,000
Hurry up!

817
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,639
Hey!

818
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,159
Why are you turning your cheek?

819
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,079
Didn't you ask me for my cheek?

820
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,079
How about I give you this?

821
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,000
I said leeks.
Pass them over.

822
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,320
-Silly!
-Leeks.

823
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,719
I thought you wanted
to kiss me on the cheek.

824
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,639
That's for the Venerable Father only.

825
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,280
You're bound to hell for real.

826
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,599
Is there anything edible at all?

827
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:53,880
I found it!

828
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:55,079
Ood.

829
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,360
Looks yummy!

830
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,360
It's all foamy.

831
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:07,960
Smells tangy.
We don't have to add lime juice.

832
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,559
Top it with chopped coriander
and sliced shallots

833
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,920
There! There!

834
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,480
Garnish it!

835
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,800
A little lime juice just in case.

836
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:25,119
Your spicy mackerel tastes so good.
Here, you can have it.

837
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,920
Here you go, Ood and Em.

838
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,840
-I did my best.
-Tasty.

839
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,880
That means I'm a good chef.

840
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,239
-They said it's yummy.
-Why don't eat it on a plate?

841
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,559
A monk with no etiquette?

842
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,760
We're eating, for heaven's sake.

843
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,039
Oh...

844
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,159
Sadhu.

845
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,639
How can you bow down
to a monk like that?

846
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:37,800
He has a lover.

847
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,920
Why are you looking at me? It's not me.

848
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,920
A pregnant lover.

849
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,840
And he doesn't take responsibility.
He knocked her up and left.

850
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,320
You look like you don't believe me.

851
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,519
I have proof.

852
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,840
Come on, show them your belly.

853
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,119
Tell us who got you pregnant

854
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,519
before fleeing to the temple. Which one?

855
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:16,119
Phra Search is the father of my baby!

856
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,519
That one?

857
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:20,039
You almost gave me a heart attack.

858
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,679
I thought it was the last one.

859
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,159
If that's the one,
you could have died, you know?

860
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,280
How did you get knocked up by a monk?

861
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,199
I don't remember.

862
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,199
Think about it, people.

863
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,199
He got her pregnant,
and then he became a monk?

864
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,960
Calm down. Calm down.

865
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,000
How can you call yourself a man?
You take no responsibility.

866
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,440
You think this is right?
Running away to be monk?

867
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,679
I won't let you get away so easily.

868
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,679
My child, I've been taking care her...

869
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:55,519
-Is this real or fake?
-It's fake.

870
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,719
Snake! Snake!

871
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:05,800
Get out!

872
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,320
I'm not enlightened yet.
I still have fear.

873
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,400
Go away, bastards!
You scared the monks.

874
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
-What the fuck did you guys do?
-Go and do it at your father's house.

875
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,079
My apologies, Venerable.

876
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,199
It was a misunderstanding.

877
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,239
How about tomorrow
I'll come back with offerings?

878
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,599
Please don't. Leave now.

879
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,320
-Dammit.
-That's a spittoon, Father.

880
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,760
-Why are you standing here?
-Go!

881
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,000
-Go!
-Go!

882
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,480
-Shall I spray on him?
-Yes, Venerable.

883
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,760
My boxer has a big match tomorrow.

884
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Please bless him with holy water.

885
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,360
Come closer.

886
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,280
-There's going to be100,000 people.
-When is his fight?

887
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,639
-Tomorrow.
-Right.

888
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,920
-You idiot!
-What?

889
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,159
Turn it to the front.

890
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,400
Why didn't you tell me, asshole?

891
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:05,920
-Who? Me?
-Him.

892
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,639
Turn it to the front.

893
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,159
I apologize, Father.

894
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:12,760
Right in my mole.

895
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,599
Fight clean.
Separate means separate.

896
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,760
No under-belt punches, no fouls.
Go to your corners.

897
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:25,159
He's not that scary. Come here.

898
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,639
I pay homage...

899
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,079
To the Exalted One, the Worthy One...

900
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,559
Hey! Get back in here.
What are you afraid of?

901
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Come on! Fight him with all your might!

902
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:43,679
Yeah! Like that!

903
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,159
First Round! Go!

904
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,199
Are you crazy? Are you a boxer?

905
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,519
You got a chance, just take it.

906
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:58,440
How can you always miss?

907
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:00,840
Don't be afraid.
You're blessed with holy water.

908
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:34,079
What the heck?

909
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,159
What's going on out there?

910
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,519
Namaskar, Venerable.

911
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:46,960
I came with unlimited faith.

912
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:50,519
One hook says it all.
Killer right hook, formidable left hook.

913
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,440
Not a single one hit the target.

914
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:54,159
Your boy dodged all the punches?

915
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:55,800
My boy took all the punches.

916
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,480
What? How could you win?

917
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:01,440
My boy got punched
and had his shoulder dislocated.

918
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,320
Here comes the champion!

919
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:06,000
How about that?

920
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,199
-Come here!
-I'm a champ!

921
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,920
-Come on! Come over here!
-Champ!

922
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,039
Come right here.

923
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,039
Come greet the Venerable Father.

924
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,440
Champ! Champ!

925
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,760
Seriously? Were you hit by a truck?

926
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,800
Right?

927
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,440
-I think you should turn off the music.
-All right.

928
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,480
Girls, turn it off!

929
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,119
Better.
What you did is not right.

930
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,719
This is a temple.
It's supposed to be peaceful.

931
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:34,880
Is it wrong to bring dancers in here?

932
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:38,599
Is it wrong? No, it's not.
But it's not appropriate.

933
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:41,320
Our religion is corrupted

934
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,320
because people like you.

935
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,039
Lokavajja.

936
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,440
Oh...

937
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:50,559
a common sin.

938
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,519
You're all such a waste of time and money.

939
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,599
You never get anything done.

940
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,719
My client is waiting.

941
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,039
Maybe we should stop now.

942
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:05,280
No, we can’t!
I already spent his money,

943
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,480
and took these imbeciles
to the whorehouse.

944
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,119
If we quit now, we're screwed.
We can do it.

945
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,559
Song, don't forget to invite sinsangs
to our grave-clearing ceremony.

946
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:22,239
Yes, Father.

947
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,320
Father, what's the purpose
of clearing graves?

948
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,480
We do it to take care of the bodies

949
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,000
that are the unidentified corpses.

950
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,960
Or basically,

951
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,480
we give them a funeral ceremony
according to our religion.

952
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,440
And then we have to clear
the graves for new bodies.

953
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,599
Whose new bodies?

954
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,239
Yours!

955
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:45,679
What about you?

956
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,320
I won't rot when I die.

957
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:52,000
Why? Cause you take cannabis?

958
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,480
-Ood.
-What?

959
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,039
Check out the van driver's daughter.

960
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,440
She's so cute.

961
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,960
He's not a van driver.
He's a film-making instructor.

962
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:17,320
-I'm sorry.
-We really didn't know.

963
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:26,719
Why are these guys dressed like that?

964
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:28,679
What do you think?

965
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,639
Damn! Why are you so hostile?
Do I pay you to growl at me?

966
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:36,679
Let's count to confirm they're all here.

967
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,440
One, two, three, four.

968
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,960
They're all here.

969
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,719
Father, where do we go after we die?

970
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,400
To the top of a skyscraper.

971
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,039
They bring you to a temple.

972
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,559
And after that?

973
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:53,400
They pray for you for three days
or seven days, it depends.

974
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:54,880
What’s next?

975
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,320
After that, they cremate you.

976
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,519
The soul will leave to heaven
if you're good, to hell if you're bad.

977
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,920
Father, I've been wondering.
What's in heaven?

978
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:08,920
Angels.

979
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,960
-What else?
-Celestial beings.

980
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:14,519
-What else?
-Indra.

981
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,039
What else?

982
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,679
Boxing rings.

983
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,480
Why are there boxing rings?

984
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,119
To fight.

985
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:24,639
-Who fights who?
-I fight you.

986
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,920
After heaven, what's next?

987
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,559
Phra Noi, I do not know
since I haven't died yet.

988
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,400
Oh...

989
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,159
you're this old and still haven't died?

990
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,320
You play with them too, Phra Avatar?

991
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,639
They're already dead.
Why do we have to dig them up?

992
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,960
This is important.

993
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,039
We all come together to dig up the bodies

994
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,920
so we can learn to let go.

995
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,199
Let go of the dead.
Accept the fact that we are mortal.

996
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,079
When we're young and alive,
we pamper ourselves with material things.

997
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,840
We value money and possessions.

998
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:09,360
But when we die,
we cannot take anything with us,

999
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,079
not even if someone places a coin
inside our mouth after we passed.

1000
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,719
Because after cremating,
everything turns to ashes.

1001
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,559
As the old saying goes,
we come from dust,

1002
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:22,400
and we turn to dust.

1003
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,400
What about scattering ashes over the sea?

1004
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,079
They want to go swimming.

1005
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,639
Phra Search, you've been ordained before.

1006
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,519
Are they happy after they die?

1007
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,639
I think they're quite happy.

1008
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:42,119
Otherwise they'll probably be back.

1009
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,719
You're funny. You think you're a comedian?

1010
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,400
Who wants to be rich?

1011
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:49,000
I do. I do.

1012
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,079
Father, I think I can do better.

1013
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:54,000
-What?
-When do gays die?

1014
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,199
When they are stabbed?

1015
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,079
-When they look amazing.
-How?

1016
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,880
Slay, girl!

1017
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,119
Are you done?

1018
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:07,199
Slay!

1019
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,559
Don't joke around with me again.

1020
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,039
It's improper.

1021
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:25,639
The ceremony's started. Stay focused.

1022
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,719
"Holit."

1023
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,280
-"Holit."
-Pardon?

1024
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:34,039
-"Holit."
-What?

1025
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:36,079
-Hold it.
-Right.

1026
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:49,159
"Yucadropi."

1027
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,000
-"Yucadropi."
-Pardon?

1028
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:53,960
-"Yucadropi."
-What?

1029
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,320
You can drop it.

1030
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,559
Why are you still holding it?

1031
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,000
"Brimesacrero."

1032
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,239
-"Brimesacrero."
-Pardon?

1033
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:03,920
Bring me the sacred rice.

1034
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,559
"Bring me sacred rice."
Can you say that?

1035
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,480
Not "brimesacrero, brimesacrero."

1036
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:11,760
Who can understand you?

1037
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,280
-Why are you so angry?
-What's the matter with you?

1038
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,400
Here you go.

1039
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:33,239
Bring me the holy water.

1040
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,480
-Slowly please.
-Yes.

1041
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,400
Talk to me slowly and clearly.

1042
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,320
Roll your "R" every time.

1043
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,079
-"L" is "L."
-Why did you roll it?

1044
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:43,639
The "L" is rolling.

1045
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,679
-There's no such thing.
-Shut up!

1046
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,320
This is the way we do it.

1047
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,840
-You're wrong and still argue?
-What's wrong with you?

1048
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,039
-The holy water!
-Yes, the holy water!

1049
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,199
Confused?

1050
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,000
How can I not?
You're having so much fun.

1051
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,440
I have my own chanting too.

1052
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,680
Are you nuts?

1053
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,439
Are we friends?

1054
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,079
I'm your master.

1055
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,439
Master is not my father.

1056
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,720
Next time I'm going to muzzle you.

1057
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:26,319
-Right there.
-Yes, master.

1058
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:34,399
Heck yeah!

1059
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,720
I'm rich now!

1060
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,760
I'm going to buy the whole temple.

1061
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,359
Em! Ood! Where are you?

1062
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,359
There's a map.

1063
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,279
A treasure map! I'll be rich!

1064
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,560
"I know you'll read this."

1065
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,760
Bastard!

1066
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,119
How did they die?

1067
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,880
It looks so familiar. I saw it on TV.

1068
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,720
Gecko, my ass! You idiot!

1069
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,720
It's a bomb!

1070
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,880
Bomb!

1071
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:32,840
Boss, what do I do?

1072
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,800
Boss!

1073
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,479
Boss!

1074
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:40,039
Dad!

1075
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,880
My dad!

1076
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,119
-How can they survive?
-It's not working.

1077
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,600
You think it's not working?
Didn't you see?

1078
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,800
It blew me up, idiot!

1079
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,840
Ghost!

1080
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:29,279
Em!

1081
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,840
Ood!

1082
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,600
I want to fart.

1083
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,399
Hey!

1084
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,800
They're those guys.

1085
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,640
-The temple boys?
-Yeah.

1086
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,239
I told you.

1087
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,600
We're men. We're not afraid of ghosts.

1088
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,199
Right?

1089
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,359
Stop playing!

1090
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,800
Why are you scared?

1091
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,159
Our teacher's face is scarier than ghosts.

1092
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:13,600
-Boo!
-Hey!

1093
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:15,119
What are you doing?

1094
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,279
Just kidding.

1095
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,920
Headless ghost!

1096
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:31,600
Headless ghost!

1097
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,720
Teacher!

1098
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
So cool!

1099
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,239
They all ran away. They're scared of us.

1100
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,560
Nailed it!

1101
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:47,960
Clever plan!

1102
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:50,239
-They ran away.
-Good job! I like it!

1103
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:52,640
Em?

1104
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,359
Do you smell a cigarette?

1105
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,840
Who smokes in the temple?

1106
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,920
Ood! It's a hairless ghost!

1107
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,640
Did he shave?

1108
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,039
Hairless my ass. That's a headless ghost!

1109
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,760
How can you get inside?

1110
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:11,680
Don't talk to him, dammit!

1111
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,760
I'm not staying!

1112
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,000
So scary! A headless ghost!

1113
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:30,079
What kind of messed up ghost
will smoke cigarettes inside a temple?

1114
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,960
What kinds of ghost do you want to see?

1115
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,920
What kinds of ghost?

1116
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:37,680
Lady Ta-khian?

1117
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,760
I prefer Tani.

1118
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,920
Lady Tani?

1119
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,199
I know a chanting for Tani.

1120
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,840
I call her for you.

1121
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,840
Bananas withered at the tips

1122
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:55,760
Gushing stream breaks them in halves

1123
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,359
She carries them around

1124
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,880
Bananas withered at the tips
Gushing stream break in halves

1125
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,840
One is left
She carries it around

1126
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,720
Bananas withered at the tips
Gushing stream breaks them in halves

1127
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,840
One is left
She carries it around

1128
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,279
Damn! This is the whole cluster!

1129
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,560
-You bananas!
-You withered!

1130
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,720
-You rot fruit!
-You bland!

1131
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
-You tasteless!
-Rot body!

1132
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,720
-Green bitch!
-Ugly banana!

1133
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,479
-Yucky!

1134
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:28,960
Stinky!

1135
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,119
Damn, you twats!

1136
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:32,680
I came here to scare you.

1137
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,960
Not for you to insult me
and leave me hanging, freaks!

1138
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,439
You called us freaks, bitch?

1139
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,840
-What's your problem?
-Come on, fat ass!

1140
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,840
I was a wife of a warrior, assholes!

1141
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:45,640
My plan as a headless ghost works!
They're all freaked out.

1142
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,560
-Em and Ood?
-They'll be here.

1143
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,880
Trust me. They're not going anywhere.

1144
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,880
They'll be scared shitless.

1145
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:55,920
Just wait for my headless ghost.

1146
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:59,439
Song, where are those two?

1147
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,760
Relax!

1148
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:07,760
-Where are they?
-Goatface!

1149
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,960
Song, you changed so fast.

1150
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:18,880
And this mask?
Do you think you can scare me?

1151
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:23,439
Hey.

1152
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,439
Give it to me straight.

1153
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,159
-Are you a ghost or a man?
-Ghost.

1154
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,000
What a relief! I thought you were a man.

1155
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,399
I'm screwed!

1156
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:40,399
Where are you going? We haven't talked.

1157
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:44,880
You're so stiff.

1158
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,119
You're so stiff.

1159
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,239
Hello, where you come from?

1160
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:07,800
Chatting in English.

1161
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,479
Why is it so hard?

1162
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,000
I can go now!

1163
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,640
Guava!

1164
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,399
All this ghost nonsense,

1165
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,239
we don't think it's real.
There's no such thing as ghost.

1166
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:33,359
-They don't exist?
-No.

1167
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:34,840
I'll catch one for you.

1168
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,479
-Whatever.
-Yeah.

1169
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:39,479
-“Taemybae.”
-Pardon?

1170
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,600
-“Taemybae.”
-What?

1171
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,159
-Take my bag.
-Dammit!

1172
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:47,880
You should have just said that!

1173
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,720
-It's the master's language.
-Then that's your business.

1174
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,960
You wait here.

1175
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,479
I'll catch you a ghost.

1176
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:59,079
So you'll know they're real.

1177
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,439
You're here. I've been looking.

1178
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,680
I'm going to catch you.

1179
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:20,960
You want to fight?

1180
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:23,720
Do you want to fight me?

1181
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,039
She's so strong.

1182
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:48,279
How dare you do this to a ghost?

1183
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,720
Damn!

1184
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,199
Embarrassing.

1185
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:03,439
Gosh!

1186
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,840
You scared all the pigments
out of my face!

1187
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,520
I'm not afraid of you, ghost.

1188
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,239
-“Immanogho.”
-Pardon?

1189
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,119
-“Immanogho.”
-What?

1190
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:14,640
I'm not a ghost!

1191
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:17,199
If you're not a ghost,
then what are you?

1192
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,439
-What?
-"Imyomasta."

1193
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,920
-Pardon?
-"Imyomasta."

1194
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,880
-What did you say?
-I'm your master!

1195
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,600
What master?

1196
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,600
-I'm your master, not a ghost.
-How dare you!

1197
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,359
I told you I'm your master.

1198
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,880
What master? You're not a master.

1199
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:35,439
You liar!
You're a ghost!

1200
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,640
Master!

1201
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,600
Why don't you just stomp me to death?

1202
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,800
Fine.

1203
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,479
I was being sarcastic.

1204
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,479
-Hold this.
-Careful.

1205
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,039
Careful!

1206
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,560
Come on! Your legs work fine.
Why don't you help?

1207
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,199
Stop complaining!

1208
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:19,960
You're so good.

1209
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,960
Father! Father!

1210
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:28,399
We're damned!

1211
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah, all those bowls are damned.
What's going on?

1212
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,560
We're damned! I came to tell...
I forgot!

1213
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,520
-What--
-I remembered!

1214
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,359
The marble Buddha's head was cut off.

1215
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,319
Hurry, Ood! He's here.

1216
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:48,079
Hello, detective.

1217
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,720
-Ood.
-Look!

1218
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,199
Hello, detective.

1219
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,239
Come sit here, fat ass.

1220
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,279
What bring you here, Venerable?

1221
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,039
I want to report a crime.

1222
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:03,760
What happened?

1223
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,720
I want to report that the marble
Buddha's head was cut off.

1224
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
When did that happened?

1225
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,720
-What time, Ood?
-Late at night.

1226
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:14,319
What time exactly?

1227
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:15,840
-Around seven.
-That was late?

1228
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,920
-Eight?
-Don't lie.

1229
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:17,960
-Nine.
-Don't...

1230
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:19,319
-Ten.
-Behave!

1231
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,640
Eleven.

1232
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,960
Well, I think

1233
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:25,880
you two should have a talk
before filing a report.

1234
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:27,760
My face's all wet.

1235
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:31,920
The marble Buddha's head was cut off.

1236
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:34,479
And we lost ten...

1237
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,279
Just ten Bahts?
You don't have to file a report.

1238
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:43,158
I can give it to you.

1239
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:47,399
May Buddha bless you.
You're so generous.

1240
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,239
But that's a lot of money.

1241
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,359
How is that a lot of money?

1242
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,239
Ten alms-bowls full of money.

1243
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,279
That's 75,000 Bahts in total.

1244
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,439
Yeah, they're all gone.

1245
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,800
Let's talk about the Buddha head.

1246
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,439
How many were cut off?

1247
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,119
Just one. He's not the great
serpent with eight heads.

1248
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,840
Hello?

1249
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:13,319
Yes. I'm sorry, my friend.

1250
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,039
You go to the warehouse.

1251
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,279
So we can exchange.

1252
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,199
Give me some time to prepare.

1253
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:24,039
Okay.

1254
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Bye-bye!

1255
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:41,920
This is Phra Noi.

1256
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:44,319
Yes.

1257
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,359
I need your help.

1258
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,359
I need you to find
the head of the marble Buddha.

1259
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,760
It's the least we can do
to protect our religion.

1260
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,159
And that's the way to fight back.

1261
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:02,199
May Buddha bless you.

1262
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:28,199
Phra Noi!

1263
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,159
Phra Noi!

1264
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,279
Why are you revving up
your motorcycle so loud?

1265
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,720
It's improper.

1266
01:22:38,199 --> 01:22:40,560
Hey! The fact that you're making noise,

1267
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,600
it means that your mind is not at peace.

1268
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:46,199
Do you understand?

1269
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:50,760
I'm telling you...

1270
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:53,319
This is peace.

1271
01:22:58,399 --> 01:22:59,279
Venerable!

1272
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,920
I need your help.

1273
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,600
What's the matter, Phra Noi?

1274
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,039
We have to bring back
the marble Buddha's head.

1275
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:08,600
Well, I'm in.

1276
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,920
Em and Ood too.

1277
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,399
I heard you take orders here?

1278
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,359
-What type of order?
-Buddha statues.

1279
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,920
Who told you?

1280
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,239
Lek, the owner of the drug called
Jiu Jeng Pushen Jiao Nang.

1281
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:05,319
-Do you know Master Tossaporn?
-Master Tossaporn?

1282
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,159
Go ahead.

1283
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,600
There's a newfound Buddha statue
floating up down the river.

1284
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,600
The locals call him Father Nim.

1285
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,279
I need the whole statue.

1286
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,800
Father Nim.

1287
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,319
My goodness!

1288
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,439
It's too big!
Can we cut off just the head?

1289
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,520
No! They want the whole statue.

1290
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:48,720
It's not that hard.

1291
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:51,439
We cut it into three pieces.

1292
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,119
Then put them back on.

1293
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,840
No! That means defects!

1294
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,840
Does it?

1295
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,880
What do we do?
It's too big for us to carry.

1296
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,439
I have a wicked idea.
Stuff like this, leave it to me.

1297
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,800
We singe it with a candle
to make it lightweight.

1298
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,239
Then we put a stick through the bottom
and carry it with no problem.

1299
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,479
This is a Buddha statue, not a corn dog.

1300
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,359
Believe me. I know the tricks.

1301
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,039
-Really?
-Try it.

1302
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:22,720
Trust me.

1303
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,680
Why is it so big though?

1304
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:31,399
Sadhu...

1305
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,600
There're a lot of mosquitoes.

1306
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,079
Oh...

1307
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,840
What's that?

1308
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:47,680
I think the abbot is fast asleep
and purrs in his sleep.

1309
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,199
So we have nothing to worry about!

1310
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,520
-Let's carry it.
-Yeah.

1311
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,520
-Put a stick through the bottom?
-No.

1312
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,199
Just carry it.

1313
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,159
Father Nim is so fleshy.

1314
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,600
Almost like human.

1315
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,640
Yeah!

1316
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,840
Oh...

1317
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,359
Let's go! The abbot's probably awake!

1318
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:10,199
Come on! Open the door!

1319
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:11,640
Why does he keep purring?

1320
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:17,319
Hurry up!

1321
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,199
Play some music.

1322
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:40,520
Father Nim!

1323
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,479
My dad's going to be so rich.

1324
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,960
-But he's really fleshy.
-That's why he floated.

1325
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,119
Why are you growling?

1326
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,079
Let's show it to my dad.

1327
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,279
Right.

1328
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:08,319
Hello, Phra Noi.

1329
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,760
This is me, Phra Yokyek.

1330
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,039
I'm not sure. It was dark when we left.

1331
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,840
But I know that they sang
Bualoi on the way here.

1332
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:22,600
I think you should sing Bualoi
when you leave the temple.

1333
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,720
I remembered which parts
they turned left and right.

1334
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,872
Okay?

1335
01:27:27,271 --> 01:27:28,119
Right.

1336
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,279
I have to go now.

1337
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,800
They're back.

1338
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,199
Where is Father Nim?

1339
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:42,800
It's so majestic!

1340
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:44,239
Father Nim.

1341
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:47,039
He's fleshy!

1342
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:48,800
Is this a statue or a bun?

1343
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,119
-Statue.
-Buddha statue?

1344
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,600
-Authentic one.
-Okay. Great.

1345
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,119
You did a great job.

1346
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,159
This is the first time
you accomplished something.

1347
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,920
-Close the door.
-Close it.

1348
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:01,039
Careful.

1349
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:12,680
Cross the bridge and go straight.

1350
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,319
Bualoi, my dear friend

1351
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:24,039
Why did you have to leave me so soon?

1352
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,920
Bualoi, where are you now?
Do know how I miss you

1353
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:32,920
Bualoi

1354
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:34,159
Bualoi!

1355
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,159
Wait for me!

1356
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,079
After "how I miss you, Bualoi,"
you'll see a roundabout.

1357
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:42,399
Keep to the right and straight ahead.

1358
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,920
Bualoi was a young lad with lazy eyes
A hunchback and awkward nature

1359
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,479
He might be far from beautiful
But he had a heart of gold

1360
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:59,319
He's with you when you're lonely
He cooked for you when you're hungry

1361
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:02,479
He took care of you when you're weary

1362
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,720
Bringing you medicine to ease your pain

1363
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,119
Bualoi was drafted

1364
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:11,439
Though handicapped
He's still can be a soldier

1365
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,000
Wait for me!
I'm going to out speed you, watch me!

1366
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,159
Go straight, Phra Noi.

1367
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:20,039
After the solo finishes, you'll be here.

1368
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,760
He could put up with anything

1369
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,319
He's helpful to those in need

1370
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:29,039
He shared your sufferings
Not just in for his happiness

1371
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,479
Okay.

1372
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,920
Bye-bye.

1373
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,439
Boss! Boss!

1374
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,520
We're going to be super rich!

1375
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,119
-They came to deliver the statue.
-Where?

1376
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:50,039
-Outside. Give me your hand.
-My hand is here.

1377
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:52,199
-No wonder it doesn't have nail.
-They fell off.

1378
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:55,640
-Sorry. That's why it's flabby.
-They fell off.

1379
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,600
Here comes the money!

1380
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,199
Money? That's prison! Let's go now!

1381
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:13,960
Who invited them?

1382
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,680
Wait for me, assholes!

1383
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:28,279
Hey!

1384
01:30:28,439 --> 01:30:30,079
Run! Father! Run!

1385
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:32,279
-What?
-Come on!

1386
01:30:32,359 --> 01:30:35,920
-You should stay there.
-Don't pull! We don't have undies.

1387
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,840
This way!

1388
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:55,760
Jerk!

1389
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,359
-What?
-You startled me!

1390
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,720
Got a rope?

1391
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:08,960
Damn! I'm so amazing!

1392
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,720
Take this!

1393
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:20,479
Do you want to fight?

1394
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:22,199
Come on!

1395
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:28,319
Damn!

1396
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,319
I still want to fly my kites!

1397
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,680
Back off!

1398
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,239
Come!

1399
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:44,319
I'll give you another try.

1400
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:46,439
Come!

1401
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:52,279
This is your last chance.

1402
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,279
I'm not going to let you walk away.

1403
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,960
Who hit me?

1404
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,039
Damn! That hurts!

1405
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,760
Carabao Daeng contains B12.
Drink it to nourish your brain.

1406
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,800
Spread out and search this whole place.

1407
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,439
What do we do?

1408
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,079
Here we go.

1409
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:10,000
Follow me if you don't want to get caught.

1410
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:18,279
-Look thoroughly.
-I found it.

1411
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,359
Unlimited faith!

1412
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,159
Your number one follower is here to help!

1413
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:26,279
Thank you. Well done!

1414
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,760
You're dead!

1415
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,720
Don't hit me.

1416
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,359
I didn't do it. You did it.

1417
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,880
Cool moves.

1418
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:52,159
Search! Search!

1419
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,560
What? You're not funny anymore?

1420
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,960
-Who wants to be rich?
-I do. I do.

1421
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,479
Gun me like this.

1422
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,520
If anything happens, nobody will laugh.

1423
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:05,520
Calm down.

1424
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,039
Don't come any closer, or I shoot!

1425
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:10,840
Killing is a sin.
It's against the first precept.

1426
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,600
This is a monk, not an animal.

1427
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,760
Please put the gun down.

1428
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:19,720
It's never too late.
You can still be forgiven.

1429
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:23,920
Angulimala is a ruthless murderer.
But he quits and turns to Dharma.

1430
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,800
He's ordained and becomes enlightened.

1431
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:28,439
That's nonsense.

1432
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:32,560
Have you ever heard the story
about a python and a chicken?

1433
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:36,880
A python coils around an egg
without knowing that it's a chicken egg.

1434
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,239
Finally a baby chicken
hatches out of the egg.

1435
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,279
The python, however,
doesn't eat the baby.

1436
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,079
considering the baby her own child.

1437
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:46,079
The baby is not afraid of the python,
considering her mother.

1438
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,199
They live together.

1439
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,000
One day, the python and the chicken
go separate ways to find food.

1440
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:54,159
The chicken runs into a fox.

1441
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,720
The chicken says, "May all beings
be free from exploiting each other."

1442
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,239
The fox doesn't listen.

1443
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:01,319
"Chickens are food. I must eat it"

1444
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:05,680
The chicken has an idea.
"Oh, my mother is a serpent!"

1445
01:35:06,119 --> 01:35:08,640
The chicken jumps at the fox
and coils it to death!

1446
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:22,920
And that is how things are.

1447
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,159
Everybody's so touched.

1448
01:35:25,239 --> 01:35:26,319
Phra Noi.

1449
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,560
How can a chicken coil up the fox?

1450
01:35:31,479 --> 01:35:33,079
Come!

1451
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:37,279
Hey!

1452
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,359
You're amazed, right?

1453
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,399
Amazed by me!

1454
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:45,279
Amazed at your accent.

1455
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:46,920
-Shut up!
-Venerable!

1456
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:48,239
Don't worry about atama.

1457
01:35:48,311 --> 01:35:49,199
No!

1458
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:51,039
Venerable, don't worry about me!

1459
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:52,760
How can I not, my friend?

1460
01:35:56,119 --> 01:35:59,439
Just shoot him! Don't worry about me!
Come on!

1461
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,479
-Shoot him!
-Stop struggling or I hit you in the head.

1462
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:07,880
Song! Let the police do his job!

1463
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:09,760
Why are you stuffing a Buddha statue?

1464
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,600
Shoot him!

1465
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:14,560
No!

1466
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:18,239
You not only look alike,
but are also stupid!

1467
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,359
Song!

1468
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,000
No! Ood!

1469
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,520
-Em!
-Em!

1470
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,439
Em!

1471
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,079
I'm screwed!

1472
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,159
Not dead, but close enough.

1473
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:55,199
Is this what you want?

1474
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,920
Damn! Every one of your bullets hit me!

1475
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,199
Such a good shot!

1476
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:02,680
I heard of spitting lies
with the amulet in a mouth.

1477
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:05,000
But you're spitting bullets!

1478
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:07,800
Song! You are so damn stupid!

1479
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,399
Hey!

1480
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,359
-Avenge him for me.
-Sure.

1481
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,399
-Is he dead?
-What's wrong with you people?

1482
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:27,800
Why are you handcuffing me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

1483
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:30,760
-You're caught red-handed.
-I did nothing wrong!

1484
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:32,640
-Let's go.
-You did nothing wrong?

1485
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,479
-Commander...
-Let me go.

1486
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,399
-...avenge him for me.
-Sure.

1487
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:38,319
-Thank you!
-I did nothing wrong!

1488
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:41,159
-Will they shoot me again?
-Let me go!

1489
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,520
Stop growling at us! Move!

1490
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:55,319
A Buddha statue in a distress posture.

1491
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,000
Father!

1492
01:38:03,079 --> 01:38:05,279
-Hello!
-I'm so glad!

1493
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:06,960
-Father!
-There! There!

1494
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,720
Thank you, Ad.

1495
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,279
-It's nothing, Venerable. We're friends.
-Right.

1496
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,720
Do you know the way out?
You can sing Bualoi backwards.

1497
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,720
What do we do?

1498
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,159
-You're funny, Venerable.
-Yeah, right.

1499
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:24,720
Loibua!

1500
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,560
I think we'd better not.
Let's go eat noodles!

1501
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,600
-And rice with pork too.
-Yeah.

1502
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:32,920
Thank you.

1503
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,880
Hurry up! We'll be late!

1504
01:38:58,479 --> 01:38:59,720
Please get in.

1505
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,279
Can I sit with you?

1506
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:04,239
-Come in, come in.
-Scooch over.

1507
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,720
Close the doors.

1508
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,800
Come on.

1509
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:09,960
Close the back doors.

1510
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,159
-We're ready. Let's go.
-Yeah.

1511
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:16,760
-Hey!
-What?

1512
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,600
-Are you really going to do that?
-I'm wearing a hat, I'm not joking.

1513
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,840
It's nothing to do with hat.
If you do it, I hit you real hard.

1514
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:26,680
Let's go. We have to pick up another one.

1515
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,760
You just hit me in the groin! You...

1516
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,319
-It's here.
-Stop grabbing mine.

1517
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,680
What?

1518
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,000
I don't think we should get in.
There are a lot of dogs.

1519
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:58,720
Dogs don't bite monks.

1520
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,279
They know who's good and who's bad.

1521
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:03,039
They don't bite monks, right?

1522
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:05,560
-Right.
-But I'm not a monk. What should I do?

1523
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,560
I'm not a monk.

1524
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:09,720
Tell them you're a temple boy.
They know that, they won't bite.

1525
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,039
-Follow me.
-Yeah, they won’t bite.

1526
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:16,039
Go!

1527
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:39,239
Oh...

1528
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:42,640
dogs really don't bite monks.

1529
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,800
True. They just chewed off our robes.

1530
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:48,520
Hey! Song! Song!

1531
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:50,800
Hey! Goonsong!

1532
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,800
Don't believe what you see.

1533
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:09,319
Don't believe what you hear.

1534
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,000
Don't believe that dogs don't bite monks.

1535
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,840
This is proof.

1536
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:16,640
So don't believe the things you see

1537
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,159
and don't believe the things you hear

1538
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,600
and don't believe
that dogs don't bite monks.

1539
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,840
May Buddha bless you.

1540
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:31,079
