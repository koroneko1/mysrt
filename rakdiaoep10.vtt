00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Kanom? / Yeah?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Have you revised the application's front page from Bank's notes already?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
Not yet, no pigeons come to receive my file.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Where have you been living? A stone age? Using pigeon to be carrier.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Stop messing with me. We still have tons of work to do. You revised it or not?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.000
Already did and sent.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.700
Sent already?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You need to call Decha and give him an earful.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.000
He let us two working while he's enjoying his time in Phuket.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.000
And tell Suttirak to deduct his salary

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and give his to us 10% each.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Calm down. It's hard for him to find a man to spend time with.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm gonna call Bank to check on something.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.000
Sure.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Hello?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Kanom already sent you the revised version, did you see it?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Are you okay with the changes?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.933
We'll take this version then.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.600
Okay.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I saw it yesterday that your kid was sick. How is he?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Glad to hear that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Bye. Talk to you later.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You needed to ask your co-worker about his life?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.000
Are you aiming to win URWISH Boy next year so you need to start gaining popularity now?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Nope. He was nice to Bank because he's afraid that he wouldn't make it through probation period.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Suttirak asked him to be nice to others.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
He wasn't only nice to humans, he was also nice to a dog too.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He even greeted a dog with a nice hello.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's exaggerating. I asked about Bank's kid and it wasn't because of Rak's order.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I was worried about his kid truly.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Are you in a beauty pageant? Why do you need to like children?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
That's right.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Look at you. Why did you dress up?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Don't tell me that you'll go on a date with a new guy?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Are you sure that he's a good guy?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.000
Of coure, I've taken a good look at him. Every inch and every corner.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.000
Dao!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm not going on a date with a man but I'll go to my school's reunion.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You need to dress up for that?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.000
There's a dressing code.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Excuse me.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Wait, the owners haven't let you in yet. How could you get in?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Come on in.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
See? Dao let me in.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Excuse me, house owner.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
My mom sent me this. So I want to give it to you.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Thank you so much. Your mom is so kind to her future daughter-in-law.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Please thank your mom for me.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Your mom gave me food like this

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but when will you bring a daughter-in-law like me to meet your mom?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Dao!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What? Dad?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Let's talk later. My dad's here today.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You need to cook your own food.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.000
Because I'm gonna go partying with my friends and sleep over at their house.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.000
Whose? Male or female's house?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You're a clone of dad.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's a female's house. I'd be in big trouble to stay at a male's house.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Don't wait up for me. I'm gonna sleep over at my friend's.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Am I your playmate? Stop being in my way.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm leaving.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Leaving now.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.600
See you later / See ya.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Do you want something to eat while working? I can cook it for you.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.600
No need to.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Don't be such a smart mouth. I'm about to tell him that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.000
I want to eat you. More of you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm sorry. But the house owner doesn't want anything to eat.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But thank you so much for working on the weekend.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Can you kiss my cheek instead?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Stop it already.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Fine.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Excuse me.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Get home safe.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What if one day Dao became Rak's girlfriend?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.000
Are you okay with that?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.000
Nope. I'm not.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You need to prepare for it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Let me tell you something. Flirty girl like Dao could snatch many guys.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.000
Like me and my boyfriend. We started as friendly flirting and look how it ended up.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
There's no way that's gonna happen. Dao knows how much I hate him.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
She won't date Suttirak for sure.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What should I write as a caption? Sleep over at my boyfriend's and he made me coffee.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Nope. My real boyfriend would be upset.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I should write 'Go with me free coffee'

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You're up, baby?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.000
Yes, darling. Don't play with fire cause I'm cool with that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
You should mind just a little. Otherwise, Lisa'd kill me.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Can you help me find a way to sleep over at Rak's room?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Make a copy of his house key.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When you get it, you should get into his house and steal his TV, fridge, all of them.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That's good idea to earn extra money.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I'm not a thief!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.500
Pae!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Pae / Yes?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.000
Can you take a look here with me one more time?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.500
What?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Why is Dao in Rak's bedroom and wearing his shirt?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Do you think they were….?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They go back to bed again? What? A second round?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If this was in a game, it should have been a baby coming out already.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You're here to delivery drinks?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That's right.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
What's going on? Why are you two looking like that?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Nothing. I was just wondering why you look good today.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm not. This is my normal look.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You want some coffee? You should come to the café, I'll make one for you.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That's okay. I can make it myself.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
You can have mine. You should enjoy your coffee over there.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.000
What? / Go over there.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.000
You should walk over there.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Sit down here / Sit

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Enjoy your coffee at the stairs.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Here? Enjoying my coffee?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
My dad used to tell me that sipping coffee here would make it taste better.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Fine.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You're up?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm up already. You've been up for long?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.600
That's right.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I should call you my baby after spending a night here.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Are you hungry? I cook you breakfast.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
If I knew that you would take a good care of me like this,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I would have slept in your room sooner.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Is there something going on?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.000
Nothing.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Then why did you drag me here to have coffee?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I told you that my dad suggested to drink coffee by the stairs in the morning.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It'll taste better.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Is that right?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.000
I'm not lying. I did it and it tasted better.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
You could smell wood and coffee. Good combination.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's like having coffee in New Zealand.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
If you say so.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Diao / Diao.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Rak's house will be ruined. What should we do?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Stop him! If he burnt the house down, we would be burning in flame for sure. Let's go.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
When did the curtain close?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Do you think Diao would see Dao in Rak's room?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I think we should play it cool and wait for his reaction.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:58.600
Okay.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
There's nothing going on. Why did they act strange?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Nothing.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What strange? You're overthinking it.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I just want you to enjoy your coffee time by the stairs.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I need to go back to the café. I start to miss my girlfriend.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm gonna go back home too. I miss my boyfriend.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
You said that your boyfriend's on a trip to Ratchaburi.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
He's coming back this evening and he'll want to have coffee with my by the stairs.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Your condo is made from mortar.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's giving the similar feeling.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Huh? / Let's go.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Wait.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.500
What?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You forgot your phone.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.600
Thanks.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
They act so suspicious. What's going on?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It's good that you close the curtain just in time.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.000
If Diao saw that I was in Rak's room, it would have been a big mess.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
That's right. He's overprotective.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.000
I'm often wondering if he's my younger brother or my father.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I'm hungry, are you?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm waiting for you.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
If you say so..

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
what're we waiting for? Let's come closer.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'm gonna wash clothes.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Dao!

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Why're you here in Rak's room? Why're you wearing his shirt.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.600
Dao was….

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You know that I have a crush on Dao. How could you do this to me?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.600
Rit!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I need to talk to him.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
This house is about to be on fire. I need to escape.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.000
If Diao knew that I slept here, my house would be on fire too.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I thought Dao was just being friendly flirty with him. I didn't know that they would actually do it.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.000
But Rak didn't show any sign of affection to Dao.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
He was so quiet about this but he got the girl.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
What? Rak and Dao were seen together?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.000
If you're gonna be this loud,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.000
you should use a microphone so everyone could hear.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
If you're gonna gossip about her, do it discreetly. Dao's story shouldn't be sharing around.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.000
We're just sharing tea on this topic privately.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:21.000
Pae and I saw Dao in Rak's room with our own eyes this morning.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.000
Maybe Dao forgot something in his room so she went to get it back.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Then why did she wear his shirt?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
She likes fashion. That could be a new trend of wearing oversize shirt.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It might not be Rak's.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Oversize shirt and men's shirt are totally different.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Believe me. I have a boyfriend.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I need to confirm something too.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.000
We can't think of anything else when we see a woman in a man's bedroom.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
When Lisa was first going to my room, she wore my shirt in the morning too.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We shouldn't spread the rumor. We didn't know the truth.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.000
If we keep talking like this and Diao hears about this, it would be a big mess.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Hey, listen to me.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.000
Nope. How could you do this to me? There're plenty of women out there.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.000
Why Dao? Why?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.700
Dao was super drunk last night.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So what? You took advantage of her?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Why don't you just rip my heart open?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.600
Hello?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.800
You're there?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Okay, I'm going now.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Do you believe me now ?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Rit knew about it but what about Diao?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I think I should get going. I don't feel safe here.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Diao could be angry and burn this place to the ground.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I'm leaving now. See you later.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I'm gonna go check on Rit.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.000
Good idea.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Did Pae and Kamom damage my home? They acted so weird.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Nothing's broken.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
It's Dao's earring. Why's it here?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
They both acted strange because….

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Hello, Tik. Can I sleep over at your place?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Som's gonna come over? Fine.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Someone said that having cold ice-cream could calm you down.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.600
Someone who?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.600
Me.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
It's good being you. You have nothing to worry about.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Who said that? I'm worried about something. It's that you having a crush on Dao.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You're signing off again? Checking your router, would ya?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Let's have some ice-cream. When you open the lid, you won't be able to stop smiling.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Thank you for this but I really couldn't smile right now.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
The picture of Dao sitting in bed in Rak's bedroom still haunted me. My heart is about to leave my chest.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
If your heart is leaving your chest, then how could you breath?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
I know that you're angry right now but what you saw maybe not what you think.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.000
How could it not be? Dao was in Rak's room and wore his shirt.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
She even talked softly and sweetly with him.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Maybe she wanted to be a cat?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.000
Pleng!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Come on, just sit down and have some ice-cream. I'll be here with you.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Can I come over?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.500
I can?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I need to borrow your clothes too.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
I'm leaving now

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
If you see Rak, please tell him that I'm not coming home tonight.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
To Saphan Kwai / Sure.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.500
Rit!

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Seeing you like this, my heart is about to leave my chest too.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Should I ask him directly if Dao spending a night in his room last night?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
But if I ask him directly, he would think that I make thing up

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I should beat around the bush.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Hey / Come on in.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
You told me to come on in but why didn't you open the door for me?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I'm not talking to you.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I'm talking to the technicians.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.500
This way.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
If you're done, can I have a word with you?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Okay.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
You need to clean all three AC, in my bedroom, and…

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
How could I ask him? What about if he's going to use the kitchen today?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
But it has nothing to do with Dao.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I need to come up with something related to Dao and her earring.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
You want to talk to me?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Do I need to ask a house owner about bring in AC technicians?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
You should. There's a woman in this house too.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
See? It's related to Dao.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
You need to let me know first because Dao is home by herself and it's dangerous.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I won't let the technicians come here if I am not around.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Why ? You brought someone home and they said your bedroom is too hot?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Don't say that it was Dao?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
That's right.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.500
Who?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
If you were a girl, I would have thought that you were jealous of me.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I was asking as a house owner, come on.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
It's Rit.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
That's a relief. I thought it was Dao.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Anything else?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Nothing.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
He keeps asking me all these questions. He must know that Dao slept in my room. Where did he get the idea from?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Where did I drop my earrings? Or in Rak's bedroom?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
You're cleaning your house?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.000
If you'd be so kind to honor me as your first wife,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
I'd help you clean your house all day.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I think that Dao starts to get suspicious of you sleeping in my room.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.000
How did he know?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I have no idea either.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.000
But he tried to get something out of me.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Like why I had technicians to clean my AC, if I had someone sleeping over.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Did he see my missing earring?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Diao is watching us from the kitchen.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
What should we do?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You should pretend to scold me for having technicians coming over and not telling your first.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
How could you do this? You can't just have someone over and not telling me first.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.000
What if the technicians took advantage of me? What am I gonna do?

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.000
If you're gonna have someone coming over, you need to tell me first.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
There's a new rule. If you're gonna have someone coming over,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.000
you need to let the owner knows first, got it?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.600
How was my acting?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
That's so terribly bad.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I think you should get inside.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I can't. If I go inside, Diao will be asking me hundreds of questions.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I'm gonna go shopping.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
She acted so suspicious. Was she really sleeping in Rak's bedroom?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Pae and Kanom must see something.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Come here.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Let me go, let me clock in first.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
If you won't tell me what you saw in the morning, I won't let you clock in.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I didn't see anything. I don't know what you want me to say.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.000
Enough with your lies. I saw you acted suspicious since yesterday. You kept telling me to enjoy my coffee by the stairs.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
What about in our chat group ?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You sent a sticker of Greeting on Monday, but in fact it was Sunday at 10:00 pm.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
When I asked you questions, you just typed 'Kanom left the chat room'.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And you said you saw nothing?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
How could I get out of this? Fine.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
You're gonna pretend to be a sculpture? Fine. I'll put mortar on you.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Wait. I have a cramp. I was trying unusual position with my boyfriend last night. Look, I couldn't even speak.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
You didn't believe me? Fine. What do you want to know?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
What did you and Pae see in my house yesterday?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You slept with my sister?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Please calm down. I can explain.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
There's no need to explain anything. Kanom told me about it.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.000
She saw you took Dao to sleep in your bedroom.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
That's right. She slept in my bedroom but it's not like what you think.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.000
How could it be something else?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Don't you feel anything? You just took my sister to your bed.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I think you need to get it together. If you don't care about me,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
at least you should think about your sister.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Because what's inside your head right now, you don't use your brain but use your shoes to think.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Let me go.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Calm down. There's nothing going on between me and Dao.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Nothing? Dao wore your shirt and slept in your bedroom.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.000
You're gonna say that you invited Dao to pray? Let me go.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
If you keep moving like this, you're just gonna ending up hurting yourself. Let me explain.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Nope, let me go.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I tell you to calm down.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Nope, let me go.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Hello? Uncle Jod?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
What? Okay. I'm leaving now.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
We'll talk later about your sister.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Calm down. Sit here and wait to talk to Rak first.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.000
I was grabbing my things when he's not around because I don't want to talk to him.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
If you're gonna go back home, you need to transfer to new school.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.000
It's gonna be complicated.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.000
It's better than seeing Dao and Rak are in love.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
My heart couldn't take it anymore. When I saw them in the room together,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
my heart is about to leave my chest.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Now I know why he doesn't like city girls.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.000
He's truly a country guy.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
My heart is hurting so bad.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.600
I'm leaving.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
And you all need to remember that I can't be here anymore because of Rak.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Wait.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Rit, calm down.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
You stole Dao from me and you told me to calm down. How could you say that?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
I can't wait for you at work. I'm gonna go home now.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Hurry up and finish this so we can talk.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Move. I'm going back to mom and dad.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Stop it. Follow me so I can explain it at once.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
No need to explain. / Come here.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I don't want to get into young people's business but I'm still young at heart.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Let me hear about this.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000
How could I dodge Diao this evening? I know. I could pretend that I have a sore throat.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
No need to hide. I can see you.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Did you spend a night in Rak's bedroom?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Stop acting already.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Fine. We can talk about him later.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
My office orders your 70 lunch boxes, can you make it?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I can.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You can talk now.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
I don't want to hear any excuses that you didn't spend a night there.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Because Kanom saw you in his bedroom.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
And I saw your earring dropped in front of the door.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Or you're gonna pretend that this is not yours.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.500
That's right.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
You don't have to find an excuse. I told Diao that you slept in my bedroom.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Hello.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Rak.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
This is the story.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
When are you gonna accepting my love?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Where's the key?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I'm gonna call you, my key.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
There's no sign of the number you dialed.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Are you looking for your house key?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I can't find my key but my true love is right in front of me.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Are you alright?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
You're ruining it. We supposed to kiss earlier.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I'm gonna fall down for you again.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
That's fine. If you can't find your key,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
why don't you call your brother?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000
My brother? He was asleep already. He told me that

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
if he's sleeping, then his phone is sleeping too.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.000
I used to call him in the middle of the night for hundreds of times and he didn't pick up.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I think I'm gonna sleep outside tonight.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
You can sleep in my room.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I'm waiting for your invitation. Let's go.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I'm a wiggler so please hold me tight.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I'll be sleeping on the couch.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I think I should sleep outside.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
That's okay. You can have my room. I can sleep on my couch.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Okay, thanks. Can I borrow your shirt? I'm gonna wear it to bed.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
That's fine.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Can you help me? I can't walk properly. I feel weak.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
This way please.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Why do you hold me like I'm sick?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
This was how it went. You're overthinking it.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And you're not? You were about to go home.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I'm not.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
This is pretty too.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Are we clear?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Are you lying?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I'm not.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Then why did you have to act suspicious? It's nothing.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Because you don't like my boyfriend.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And if you knew that I slept in my boyfriend's bedroom, you would be mad at us.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
So I think I shouldn't tell you.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
This is too close.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
If there's something going on between me and him, it won't be a secret.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.000
I'm gonna put it in billboard in the heart of Bangkok.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.000
People'd know that we're couple.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
So the other girls that have a crush on Rak would know.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Please don't say that. My heart hurts.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Rit! / Yeah?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
You need to calm down about this.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Okay, dad.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
You're not mad at me anymore?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Who's mad at you? I was just asking to be clear.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I told you to think before you speak. But I think I should add that.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
You should be more critical thinking because speaking too.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:35.000
I totally agree with you. Our thought is too scary.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
If we let our thought out loud,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
at least people can say if this is true or this is not true.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.000
But if we keep our thought inside of our head,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
we could do something wrongfully.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Like when Diao yelled at Rak?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Like when you were about to go back home?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
If everything is okay, then I'll go back to my café.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.200
Okay / See you later.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Thank you, Uncle Jod / Bye.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I'm gonna put my things away.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Let's go / Okay.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I need to clean my bedroom too. It's unlocked.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Fine, dad.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
What're you waiting for? Go back to work.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
You need to go back to work too.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
I'm going back to clear thing up about family

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I'm going back to clear thing up about family too.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
You misunderstood and tried to punch me during working hours.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
But everything worked out now so you need to kiss my cheek to apologize.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You're thinking about punching your boss? Be careful about your probation.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.600
Are you serious?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.500
I am.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Can you close your eyes?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.500
Fine.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
What're you looking at? I kissed your cheek? You want me to kiss your lips? I'm not doing it.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
You did this earlier.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Dao was drunk and couldn't find her house key so Rak offered her to sleep in his bedroom.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
That's the tea?

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.000
That's it?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
It's not fun.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.500
What?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I'm gonna get back to work now.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.500
Let's go.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Love Note. Chapter 7. A key to the heart.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
After Ryo and Ryu went through their most romantic dinner,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Ryu wanted to keep this happy memory as long as possible.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
So he walked very slowly.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Ryo didn't want this happy time to end as well.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Are you sleepy?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.500
Not yet.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Your couch looks good.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Yes.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Your plants look good.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:43.500
Yes.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
If you're sleepy and don't want to talk to me, it's fine.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Nope. I just run out of things to say.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Then we can just sit here on the couch and we don't have to say anything.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I just want to be with you as long as possible.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Sitting with your crush in silence could allow you to hear each other's heartbeats.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I need to tell you new rule about garbage bin.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
What is it ? / If you forget to close the lid, you need to…

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Who called him? Why didn't he pick up the phone in front of me?

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.000
If you can't pick up the phone, you want me to do it?

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Excuse me.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.000
I don't know. I'm searching for them.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
How long has he been standing here? What should I do?
