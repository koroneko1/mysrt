We're not gonna last here longer.

Where would we go?

995
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,892
The hose from earlier.

996
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,893
[Cheong-san] Gyeong-su.

997

Yeah?

00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,107
What?

What is it?

1000
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,321
Open it just a few inches.
Enough for the hose to fit.

1001
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,573
Isn't it better to wait
for the rescuers to come save us?

1002
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,283
We might all die by the time they arrive.

This will kill us faster.
It's just gonna be--

00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,705
Is waiting for someone to save us
the best thing we can do?

How do you want it?

1025
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,573
Wrap it and tie it.
So a hand or foot can fit.

You said big enough for a foot?

1027

Zigzag. Make it a zigzag.
Big enough increments.

-Zigzag.

I'll go down and check the empty rooms.
I'll call when it's clear, okay?

00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,441
Okay.

No. But you go first.

Then you go, okay?

No. You can do it.

-Man, you can do it.
-Fuck.

But why… why am I…

1055
