14
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,800
The bus is here.

15
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,210
You're acting so strangely today.
Walking me all the way here.

16
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,840
Are you going to ask me
for a favor or something?

17
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,050
See you. Good work today.

18
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,879
- Later.
- Bye.

19
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,210
Excuse me.

20
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,550
Hey, In Su.

21
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Don't forget to check the video
when you get home.

22
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
You might be really surprised.

23
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,419
Okay.

24
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,050
- Goodnight.
- See you.

25
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,379
(Wish You - The origin mix)

27
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,839
Everyone, you did a great job today.

28
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,259
Let's work hard on our project
that we're preparing right now.

29
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,459
- Okay.
- Got it?

30
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,379
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's drink.

31
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,339
- Cheers.
- Good work.

32
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,209
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,129
- Bottoms up.
- Please go easy on me.

34
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,920
Alright.
Let's punch in on time tomorrow!

35
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:27,129
- Come on.
- You're drunk.

36
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,759
I'll have my eyes on you.

37
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,379
Stop drinking so much.

38
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,420
That was a bit harsh.

39
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,959
- Let's just drink.
- Let's go crazy tonight.

40
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,550
Was I outside for too long?

41
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,339
Who is that in the video?

42
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,459
He's pretty good-looking.

43
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,420
His name is Kang In Su.
I'm totally addicted to him lately.

44
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,550
- Do you want to hear it?
- Sure.

45
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,089
- It's not bad.
- I know.

46
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,670
Can you send this to my phone?

47
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,170
Okay, I will.

48
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,589
Sang Yi,
do you want to know a secret?

49
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,709
You're really cute.

50
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,459
Gosh, teasing you is so fun.

51
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,050
I'll go inside now.

52
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,550
Let's go for a second round!

53
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,800
- Let's go!
- Follow me!

54
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,589
Come on, it's this way.

55
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,170
Let's find another place to drink.

56
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,339
Let's go.

57
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,170
- This way.
- Are you okay?

58
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,670
Come on, let's go.

59
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,129
- I think it's this way.
- Let's go.

60
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,509
Sang Yi, do you want to ditch them?

61
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,339
Really?

62
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,089
Why are you so surprised?
I was just kidding.

63
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,209
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,670
I think you work really hard.

65
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,170
When I worked part-time,
all I did was kill time.

66
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,420
I enjoy my work.

67
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,589
That's why I try harder.

68
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,959
Shall I ask them to hire you
as a regular employee?

69
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:52,509
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,550
Hey.

71
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,300
- Sang Yi. Sang Yi?
- Yes?

72
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,259
Aren't you going?

73
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,339
Oh, sorry.

74
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,460
Are we going for another drink?

75
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,799
- Sure.
- Come with me.

76
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,799
- Where are we going?
- Which way?

77
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,379
- This way.
- Where is Hyeong Sik?

78
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,340
- One more drink!
- Which way is it?

79
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,299
Ms. Lee.

80
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,049
I'm sorry, but...

81
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,299
The thing is... Well...

82
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,710
You can go.

83
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,129
I'll make up an excuse.

84
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,879
Go and get his autograph
or take a selfie.

85
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,509
It would be better
if you get his number.

86
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,460
Thank you.

87
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,919
Isn't drinking beer the best
when you feel frustrated?

88
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,169
Frustrated? What do you mean?

89
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,710
Hey. Didn't you see
how many views we got?

90
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Don't you ever feel bad or sorry
for your friend...

91
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,049
who's working day and night for you?

92
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,379
Hey, is that my fault?

93
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,090
It's because you make
such lousy videos.

94
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,419
How can you say that to a friend?
You're so mean.

95
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,840
Whatever.
Let's just drink, you jerk.

96
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,759
- Excuse me.
- We'll order later.

97
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,759
I'm sorry, it's not that...

98
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,759
I...

99
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,129
I think I left something here.

100
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:31,629
Excuse me.

101
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,090
(Wish You)
