00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,250
but it was too late.

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,541
Are you sure this is the right way?
How do you know where we're going?

183
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,583
I've been there before. Remember
when Abigail had her ring of fire?

184
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,500
[chuckles]

185
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,291
She was scratching like a dog
during Father's sermon.

186
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,750
Mother told me she'd lain with a demon.

187
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,458
The Devil's gift.

188
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,791
More like Mad Thomas's gift.

189
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Well, whoever she lay with,
Abbi made me go to the widow with her.

190
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,916
-And the widow fixed her with witchcraft?
-Yes, witchcraft.

191
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,000
And some foul-smelling paste
made for whores like Abbi Berman.

192
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,166
[dramatic music playing]

193
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
Are we sure about this?

194
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,208
[eerie music playing]

195
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Widow Mary?

196
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,291
Widow Mary?

197
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,791
-[fire crackling]
-[crow cawing]

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
She's not here.

199
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,125
Find the berries.

200
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,291
[ominous music playing]

201
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,166
[gasping]

202
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:15,958
Abbadon…

203
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,000
Azazel…

204
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,625
Beelzebub…

205
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
Moloch.

206
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,875
Satan.

207
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,375
[woman] Don't.

208
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,541
[gasps]

209
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,000
[Sarah] Widow…

210
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,083
The veil has grown thin
with the turn of the moon.

211
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,916
And with it,

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,875
the Morning Star rises.

213
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,625
Beware the Devil. He lives in that book.

214
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,125
He calls to you from it.

215
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,708
He senses you now.

216
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,541
And if you're not careful,

217
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,166
he'll bore himself beneath your skin

218
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,500
and he'll consume you from the inside out.

219
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,541
[gasps]

220
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,000
Sarah?

221
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Get out.

222
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,625
Get out.

223
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,500
Get out!

224
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,000
-[widow shouting] Get out! You get out!
-[crow squawking]

225
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,166
[Lizzie] Go! Go!

226
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,708
-[folk music playing]
-[laughter]

227
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,083
[chuckling]

228
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,208
[girls yelling]

229
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,666
Full moon rises.

230
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,416
To the fruits of the land.

231
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,833
[whooshing]

232
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,750
-[up-tempo folk music playing]
-[laughter]

233
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,291
-[screams]
-Come to the woods with me.

234
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,375
Entertain yourself with someone else.

235
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,708
-[man grunts]
-Get off of me! Stop!

236
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
[grunts] Caleb, stop!

237
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,625
Don't tease me, girl.

238
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,416
[Sarah] She's not teasing!

239
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,708
[Caleb] What, are you jealous?

240
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,166
Sarah Fier, you want a kiss too?

241
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,041
You know, maybe if you weren't
such a frigid bitch--

242
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,333
-[people gasping]
-[Sarah] There's your kiss.

243
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,625
And if you're still so eager,

244
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,416
I'm sure there's a mule tied up
who will overlook your flaws in the dark.

245
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
[crowd laughing]

246
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,000
[girls giggling]

247
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,958
[Hannah] You're completely mad.

248
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,791
[Sarah] No…

249
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,958
I'm just not afraid with you.

250
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,875
[both giggling]

251
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,625
We should go back.

252
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,000
Should we?

253
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,416
[Sarah] We can't.

254
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,916
This is wrong.

255
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,166
Doesn't feel wrong.

256
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,916
[Sarah breathing heavily]

257
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,708
Tell me to stop and I shall.

258
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,750
[heavy breathing]

259
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,500
[breathing heavily]

260
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,500
[twig snaps]

261
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,666
[gasping] What was that?

262
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,875
[twig snaps]

263
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,750
[ominous music playing]

264
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,666
[Hannah] Someone was there.

265
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,958
Someone saw us.

266
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,416
They couldn't.

267
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
What if it was the widow or Caleb?

268
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,916
Caleb can barely find his own member.

269
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,666
But if he saw us, if he tells--

270
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,750
That spoiled piglet doesn't scare me.

271
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,958
They'll hang us, Sarah.

272
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,041
Well, let them hang us then.

273
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,583
I was not alive before now anyway.

274
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,208
[Mad Thomas laughing]

275
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
Sinners, sinners.

276
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,458
[grunting]

277
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,375
[gasps]

278

[exhales slowly]

[laughing] Oh, damn you, Merryboy!

284
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,833
Get in, you brute.

285
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,458
[eerie music playing]

286
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,958
-[Henry] Sarah! It's half six.
-[gasps]

287
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,666
You've overslept.
I've done most of the morning work.

288
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,125
All right. [sighs]

289
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
I'm coming.

290
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,625
[Sarah sighs]

291
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,916
[chuckles quietly]

292
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,166
[Sarah] Merryboy!

293
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,958
Merryboy, time to eat!

294
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,541
Oh, where are you, dog?

295
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,333
Merryboy?

296
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,416
[suspenseful music playing]

297
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,583
-Merryboy?
-[Hannah] Sarah?

298
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,250
[gasping] Oh, heavens.

299
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,041
You scared me.

300
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,791
There's something wrong with my father.

301
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,958
[whispering] The voice shall sing.
Order's furnace beckons now.

302
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,791
To be freed, to be released.

303
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,125
What is he saying?

304
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,458
[indistinct whispering]

305
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,375
I don't know.

306
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,500
[whispering] The voice shall soon become.

307
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,625
[whispering voice] Cyrus…

308
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,625
[fly buzzing]

309
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,708
[Sarah] When did this start?

310
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,208
[Hannah] Just this morning.

311
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,708
He's distracted,

312
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,208
listening to things only he can hear.

313
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
Perhaps it is prayer?

314
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,666
[sighs] No.

315
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,166
No, something is…

316
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,708
wrong.

317
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,875
I look in his eyes and it's as if…

318
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,708
As if something crawled in from the night
and put on Father's skin.

319
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
It looks like him, but…

320
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,750
-[whispering]
-[Hannah] He's not himself, Sarah.

321
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,083
Mother's gone to the meeting house.

322
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,958
She says we must ask God,

323
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,000
but I don't know which Psalm,

324
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,375
what passage--

325
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,833
He needs proper medicine, Hannah.

326
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,083
-I will talk to your mother.
-No!

327
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,666
She can't know you were here.

328
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,541
I'm not to see you anymore.

329
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,500
[melancholic music playing]

330
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,125
Not to see me?

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,583
She suspects us, Sarah.

332
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,375
She suspects our…

333
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,750
wickedness.

334
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,291
And now Father is sick.

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,083
Do you think…

336
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,375
Did we cause it?

337
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,041
[Sarah] Hannah…

338
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,416
Everything will be all right.

339
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,333
[door bangs]

340
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,625
You! You!

341
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,416
You won't stop until you've
completely ruined her life, will you?

342
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,625
-Mother!
-You shut your mouth!

343
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,333
Thomas saw you last night in town!

344
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,583
He's telling everyone! How dare you
bring this filth into our home!

345
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,333
I see what you really are, girl.

346
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,000
An abomination corrupting my daughter.

347
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,833
Born of perversion!

348
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,583
Goody Miller, please!

349
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,500
[Sarah squeals]

350
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
God knows what you are, girl!

351
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,125
You'd better pray for mercy
on your damned soul!

352
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,208
[breathing heavily]

353
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:27,666
[father] Sarah, Thomas has been talking.
There something you want to tell me?

354
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,250
[gasps]

355
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,708
No.

356
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,000
I heard you come home late last night.

357
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,375
You were out
with the pastor's daughter, weren't you?

358
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,250
And Abbi.

359
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,416
And Lizzie and…

360
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,708
the others.

361
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,125
[father] If your mother was still alive…

362
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,208
You know, it was your mother
who convinced us to settle this land.

363
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,583
She was wise enough to understand
this land was special.

364
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,958
She said she could feel it in the air.

365
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:07,541
The lake.

366
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,375
The woods.

367
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,958
So we put down roots…

368
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,416
and made up our own Eden here.

369
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,041
She was a good woman.

370
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,875
And I fear in her absence…

371
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,250
I have failed her.

372
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,458
I have failed you both.

373
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Father…

374
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,166
There has always been
a strangeness in you, Sarah.

375
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,625
A streak…

376
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,916
Something perhaps
a mother could have rooted out,

377
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,416
but you were raised like a boy.

378
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,708
I gave you too much freedom,

379
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,708
and now it is too late.

380
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,291
It's my fault.

381
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
[Sarah] Father…

382
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,791
[flies buzzing]

383
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,208
[ominous music playing]

384
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,916
[flies buzzing]

385
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,666
[gasps]

386
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,666
[Henry shouts] Sarah!

387
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,125
[Sarah] What is it? What's wrong?

388
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,750
[pig grunting]

389
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,041
[Henry] The babes are gone.

390
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,916
She ate them.

391
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,541
She ate them all.

392
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,916
[pig grunting]

393
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,416
Bring me the ax, Henry.

394
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,375
Sarah…

395
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,500
The ax!

396
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,583
[dramatic music playing]

397
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,041
[pig grunting]

398
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,625
[pig squeals]

399
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,083
[retching]

400
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:25,041
[sighs deeply]

401
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,166
[Mad Thomas] The dark one has come

402
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,833
to harvest the bitter fruit
of the evil we have sown.

403
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,500
To feast on our misdeeds.

404
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,208
[whinnying]

405
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,791
[Mad Thomas] And yet you all smile,

406
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,000
blind to the horrors around us.

407
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,750
But you see it now, don't you?

408
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,625
He blocks our well,

409
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,583
clogs it with our sin.

410
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,958
[man 1] It's stuck!

411
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,000
He takes our water.
He takes our life blood!

412
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,458
[Sarah] What's happened?

413
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,250
-What's going on here?
-The bucket's caught on something.

414
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,333
[men grunting]

415
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,375
-[man 2] It rises!
-[man 1] Yeah. Let go.

416
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,500
It's coming!

417
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,083
It rises!

418
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,333
A dead dog in the well!

419
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,416
[screams]

420
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,875
-[man 1] Get it out!
-Our water! It's poisoned!

421
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,041
[Thomas] See? You have already drunk
from the cup of darkness.

422
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,333
[Sarah] Merryboy…

423
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,750
[gasping]

424
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,375
This is the work of the Devil.
He has come to stake our land.

425
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,041
Who among you has welcomed
the Devil to Union?

426
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Whose lust?

427
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Whose sin?

428
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,333
Oh, foolish Union.

429
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,583
The Devil has come

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,958
and cast his darkness over us.

431
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,291
And his darkness grows

432
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,500
within each of us

433
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,041
like a rot.

434
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,583
[chuckles]

435
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,791
[knocking on door]

436
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,750
[relieved sigh]

437
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,875
Solomon…

438
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:25,916
I didn't mean to stop by unexpected.

439
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,541
I have just a, uh…

440
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,875
a small thank you.

441
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:37,916
It's for Sarah.

442
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,958
What is it?

443
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,250
Can you keep a secret?

444
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,250
And that's when I saw
something in the trees.

445
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,708
A figure.

446
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,958
Who was it?

447
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,708
I don't know. It was so dark.

448
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,291
I thought it was Caleb or…

449
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,083
or the widow.

450
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,166
But now…

451
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,500
What?

452
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,708
Now we are tormented

453
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,583
and the pastor is sick and…

454
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,250
and I feel half mad, and now I wonder

455
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,625
if perhaps something is wrong with me.

456
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,208
-Sarah--
-And always has been, Solomon.

457
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,625
I was never normal. My own father said so.

458
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,041
Maybe I was born wicked

459
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,958
and strange.

460
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,791
Maybe it was the Devil in the woods.

461
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,875
[gasps]

462
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,375
Maybe the Devil is in me.

463
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,416
Stop! You sound like Mad Thomas.

464
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
Perhaps Thomas is right.

465
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,583
Thomas is a mindless drunk, nothing more.

466
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,916
Look around, Solomon.
There is blight everywhere.

467
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,583
I… I… I grant you that, but you…

468
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,833
Hannah was just a dalliance, Sarah.

469
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,625
And if it wasn't?

470
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,125
What do you mean?

471
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,500
That's why I'm so afraid.

472
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,916
Do you understand?

473
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,750
[Sarah gasps]

474
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,041
[crying] Because it was not
just a dalliance.

475
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,000
[melancholic music playing]

476
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,750
I see.

477
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,333
I can't breathe. [gasps]

478
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,291
Listen to me…

479
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,375
[Sarah breathes heavily]

480
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,083
Dalliance or not…

481
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,916
one does not summon the Devil by chance.

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,541
Even the weakest heart,

483
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,125
the most corruptible soul,

484
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,875
they must make the choice.

485
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,583
They must extend their hand,

486
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,541
which you did not do.

487
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,500
-No.
-No.

488
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,125
You can always come to me, Sarah.

489
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,625
My door is always open to you.

490
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,125
[girl screaming]

491
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,708
-Cyrus! Come out!
-[crowd shouting]

492
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Constance! Where is Constance?

493
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,750
-The Devil has locked himself in there!
-[man 1] Pastor! Pastor!

494
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,291
-Brother! What's happening?
-The pastor.

495
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,375
He's locked the children
in the Meeting House. A dozen at least.

496
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,958
Henry! Where is Henry?

497
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,625
[indistinct yelling]

498
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,916
Solomon!

-[grunting]
-[banging]

503
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,083
Keep everyone back.

504
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,458
Solomon, wait!

505
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,083
Let me in! No!

506
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,291
[man 2] Stay back.

507
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,708
[Sarah] Henry! Henry!

508
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,625
[Pastor Miller mumbling] Because they are.
We call upon which they call within.

509
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,041
Resigned to deficit.

510
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,875
-Where's my husband?
-[man 3] Hold them back!

511
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,750
What's happening in there?

512
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:47,708
-Let me go! Let me go! Cyrus!
-Constance!

513

[banging faster]

522
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,291
[Pastor Miller] I can see now.

523
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,958
I can see everything.

524
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,666
[door crashes open]

525
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,916
[crowd] Our children!

526
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,125
Our children!

[crowd shouting]

528
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,000

No!

Witchcraft! Witchcraft!

539
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,333
Evil! Show yourself!

00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,375
-Witchcraft!
-[Thomas] Show yourself!

[man 1] Hear ye! Hear ye!

544
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,916
Good people of Union, listen!

545
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,416
-[banging pulpit]
-There is a dark

546
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,666
and evil force at work here.

547
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,083
If we are ever to end this misery…

548
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,208
Aye!

549
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,833
…then we must root out the guilty.

550
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,916
-We must--
-[Solomon] Jakob! Please, Goodman Berman!

551
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,916
The man responsible is dead.

552
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,416
-Pastor Miller--
-[Jakob] The pastor…

553
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,958
Our pastor was a man of God.

554
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,500
-[crowd] Right.
-[Jakob] And this was not him!

555
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,458
-He was possessed by a darkness.
-[crowd] Yes!

556
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:15,958
My child, my dear Constance,
and many others…

557
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,166
are dead.

558
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,833
-Our futures…
-[crows cawing]

559
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:24,541
…many of our entire bloodlines
have been stolen from us.

560
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,166
Someone must pay!

561
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,666
[assenting]

562
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:35,416
I saw some little lambs of our town…

563
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,416
laughing, dallying on the full moon last!

564
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,541
[crowd shouting]

565
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,750
There were some of us in the woods,
but there was no…

566
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,083
We drank Apple Jack. We danced.

567
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,166
We are young. That is not a crime!

568
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,583
Heathens!

569
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,208
You have sinned! You have sinned!

570
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,750
Look upon your children!

571
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,000
For they will bear the Devil's mark!

572
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,541
[crowd shouting]

573
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,958
[Elijah] Witchcraft!

574
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,541
-Witchcraft!
-[crowd shouting]

575
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,541
[Elijah] Yes, witchcraft.

576
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,250
But just as my brother Solomon

577
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:16,416
heroically expelled the darkness among us

578
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,125
by killing our afflicted pastor,

579
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:22,666
we too will punish and surmount this evil!

580
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,041
Yes, we will!

581
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:29,541
As survivors, our faces always will remain
toward the sun.

582
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,750
[shouting] Hear, hear!

583
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,958
[watchman] I traced it on my patrol!

584
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:45,666
This scourge centers on Union proper.

585
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,583
[woman] He's right!

586
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,916
I've searched the woods.
It does not extend beyond the settlement.

587
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,083
[woman whispers] He's right.

588
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,791
[watchman] It's here! It's in Union!

589
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:59,750
We are being punished,
and I have a list of names!

590
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,708
Oh, then show it to us! Show it to us!

591
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,500
Enough! Enough!

592
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,458
Listen to yourselves!

593
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,875
Speculation!

594
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,375
Chasing shadows!

595
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,166
Imagined curses!

596
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,208
I ask…

597
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,833
do you have proof?

598
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,625
No. Or you?

599
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,083
Or any of you?

600
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,666
I have proof!

601
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:39,791
It was some nights back when the full moon
had risen just beside the sun.

602
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,500
As I lay sleeping,

603
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,833
she came to me.

604
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:49,291
She witched me and led me to the woods.

605
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,791
She was naked…

606
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,166
[gasping]

607
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,125
…and riding a red mule.

608
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,208
Yes.

609
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,625
[Hannah grunts]

610
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,666
-[Caleb] The red mule became a horned man.
-[laughter]

611
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,250
And she made me watch
as she lay with the Devil.

612
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,250
-Who?
-[man] Who was it?

613
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:09,833
As both of them lay with the Devil.

614
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,750
Both of them?

615
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,625
[Caleb] Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier!

616
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,541
-No!
-No!

617
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,458
Witches! Witches!

618
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,916
-Witches!
-Witches!

619
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,291
[all shouting] Witches!

620
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,083
Witches! Witches!

621
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,625
I saw Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier.

622
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,333
I saw Hannah Miller.

623
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,625
I saw Hannah Miller.

624
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,791
I saw Hannah Miller.

625
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,208
I saw Sarah Fier.

626
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,666
-I saw Sarah Fier.
-I saw Sarah Fier.

627
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,000
[shouting]

628
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,250
[crowd] Witches!

629
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,916
Witches! The witches!

630
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,958
The witches!

631
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,458
[indistinct shouting]

632
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,458
-We need to get away from here!
-And go where?

633
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,916
[Elijah] Here! They're here!
Witches over here!

634
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,625
Go! Go!

635
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,666
[Caleb] The Devil is in this

636
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,916
disgusting whore!

637
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,916
[Hannah] No!

638
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,750
Silence! Check her for marks!

639
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,708
No! No!

640
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,708
[Hannah grunts]

641
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,666
[Hannah] No!

642
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,666
No! No!

643
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,125
Be still, witch!

644
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,125
[both grunting]

645
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,166
[man 1] Got one!

646
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,916
[Mad Thomas cackles]

647
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:41,125
[Elijah] As sure as the sun rises,
we will purge Union

648
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,166
of this…

649
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,333
[man 2] Witch!

650
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,708
…wretched pollution!

651
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,708
[shouting, cheering]

652
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,666
[Elijah] We will search every house,

653
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,291
every inch of wood!

654
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,583
We will not rest
and we will not have mercy!

655
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,000
[all shouting] No mercy!

656
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:01,083
[Elijah] So help me, God,
we will be cleansed of these anathemas!

657
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,250
-[all shouting] Yeah!
-We will have our justice!

658
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,541
Yeah!

659
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:08,333
We will find Sarah Fier!

660
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,791
[all] Find her!

661
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,875
[man 3] Get up!

662
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,416
[man 4] Find her!

663
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,041
[man 5] Until we find Sarah Fier!

664
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,333
[man 5] Where are you, Sarah Fier?

665
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,541
[crowd shouting] Find the witch!

666
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:36,250
[panting]

667
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,458
[dogs barking in distance]

668
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,916
-[man 6 in distance] Find her!
-[Sarah gasping]

669
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,791
-Father!
-My fault…

670
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,500
-[George groans]
-Father!

671
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,583
[door opens]

672
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,000
[breathing heavily]

673
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,083
[Elijah] Did you look upstairs?

674
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,541
[Caleb] I did, there's no one there.

675
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,500
[breathing heavily]

676
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,166
[twig snaps]

677
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,958
Did you hear that?
The other side of the house.

678
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,000
[Caleb] We'll find her elsewhere.

679
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,125
[man 7] Open up!

680
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,166
[loud knocking]

681
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,166
[loud knocking]

682
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,375
[door crashes open]

683
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,875
[indistinct shouting]

684
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:55,625
[Caleb] David!

685
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,791
Take your musket round back
to the Fier house.

686
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,583
Keep an eye on George Fier.

687
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,125
Keep an eye out for that witch.

688
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,250
[indistinct shouting]

689
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,625
[panting]

690
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,583
[stick rattles]

691
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,458
[door closes]

692
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,625
Hannah?

693
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,625
[chains clanging]

694
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,208
[breathing heavily]
What have they done to you?

695
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,500
I am to hang on the morrow.

696
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,458
And if you don't flee, you will too.

697
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:17,416
[Sarah] No!

698
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,000
[Hannah] Listen to me.

699
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,208
You need to run.

700
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,750
-No, I won't leave you.
-You must!

701
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,458
-[Sarah sighs]
[chains clang]

702
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,500
This is my fault anyway.

703
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,750
-No.
-I led the Devil here.

704
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:40,208
That is not how it works.
You do not summon the Devil by chance.

705
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,208
You have to make a choice.

706
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,750
Don't you see?

707
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,250
It doesn't matter if we did it or not.

708
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,291
They think we're guilty, so we are.

709
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,833
[dramatic music playing]

710
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,916
You're right.

711
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,750
Everyone believes we've done it.

712
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,000
So what difference does it make
if we do now?

713
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,250
-What are you saying?
-I will go back to the widow.

714
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,625
I will make a deal with the Devil.

715
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,791
Perhaps that can save us.

716
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,375
But the Devil…

717
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,041
Are you mad?

718
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,583
I don't fear the Devil.

719
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,291
Hannah,

720
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,250
I fear the neighbor who would accuse me.

721
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,166
I fear the mother
that would let her daughter hang.

722
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,750
I fear Union.

723
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:43,791
They lead us like lambs to the slaughter
and expect us to just follow.

724
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,875
Well, they will see…

725
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,500
I am no lamb.

726
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,166
[man 8 shouting] Sarah Fier! Come out!

727
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:58,916
When this is over,
we will leave this place.

728
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,041
We will go far away

729
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,500
and we'll dance every night,

730
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,208
then kiss in the broad daylight.

731
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,041
[kiss]

732
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,083
I can't lose you.

733
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,750
[Sarah] You won't. [sniffs]

734
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,750
If they want a witch…

735
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,291
I will give them a witch.

736
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:34,250
-[bird cawing]
-[insects buzzing]

737
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,250
[ominous music playing]

738
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,375
[whispering] Widow!

739
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,125
Mary!

740
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,083
[sighs]

741
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,916
[breathing heavily]

742
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,958
-[crow squawks]
-[Sarah gasps]

743
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,708
[breathing heavily]

744
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:45,583
[crow cawing]

745
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,250
[screaming]

746
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,250
[gasping]

747
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:57,166
[dramatic music playing]

748
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,083
[rapid knocking]

749
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,541
Away, Elijah.

750
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:14,666
[rapid knocking continues]

751
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,500
-Elijah, I said enough!
-Please, you have to help me!

752
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,666
[Solomon] Sarah?

753
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,833
-We're innocent, Solomon.
-I know…

754
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,208
Hannah and I, we didn't do this!

755
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,833
-You're bleeding.
-It doesn't matter. Listen to me.

756
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,583
I went back to the woods, to the widow.

757
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:34,083
-Sarah!
-She's dead, Solomon! Someone killed her!

758
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,500
And there was this…

759
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,750
this book…

760
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,250
with a… a kind of instruction,
an incantation.

761
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,458
-An incantation? For what?
-Yeah.

762
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,750
[Sarah] I think…

763
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:50,125
I think someone struck a deal
with the Devil.

764
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,833
Offering our town.

765
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,041
-Our town?
-[Sarah] Yes.

766
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,791
In exchange, perhaps, for power?

767
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,166
Solomon, I swear it…

768
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,333
it wasn't me!

769
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,958
[gasping]

770
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,041
Sarah…

771
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,625
I believe you.

772
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,583
Who else knows about this?

773
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,833
No one.

774
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:28,708
[Caleb] Solomon!

775
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,291
[Sarah gasps]

776
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,625
-[Caleb] Solomon!
-Go! Go quickly! Hide!

777
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,666
[Caleb] Solomon!

778
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,041
[Caleb] Solomon!

779
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,208
[loud knocking]

780
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,208
Open up, Solomon!

781
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,750
[bang]

782
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,250
We're looking for Sarah Fier.

783
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,583
There's no one here but me.

784
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,208
Then we're free to search.

785
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,791
[Solomon] Of course you are not.

786
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,166
Do not try to intimidate me, Caleb.
I am not some child!

787
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,833
[man 1] Come out! Sarah!

788
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,708
[gasping]

789
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,625
[Caleb] If only your word was enough,
Solomon.

790
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,583
What's in the back room, Solomon?

791
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:18,916
[Caleb grunts]

792
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,958
[breathing heavily]

793
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,083
[man 2] Sarah Fier!

794
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:36,208
[distant shouting] Sarah Fier!
Come out, Sarah Fier!

795
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,333
[Caleb] If there's nothing there,

796
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,541
let me check.

797
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,000
What do you have to hide?

798
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,083
[gasps]

799
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,541
I'll tell you once more.
There's no one here, but me.

800
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:55,375
[man 3] Sarah Fier! Go around the back!
She's gotta be here somewhere!

801
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,875
[Solomon] Leave immediately,
or I'll make you leave.

802
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,875
Come on!

803
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:10,666
[Caleb grunts]

804
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,625
[Solomon] Go on…

805
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,000
All of you, go on!

806
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:16,875
[Caleb shouts]

807
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,875
[ominous music playing]

808
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,708
[ominous music intensifies]

809
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,166
[Solomon] Abbadon…

810
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,416
Ahriman…

811
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,500
Azazel…

812
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,666
Bael…

813
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,250
[choking]

814
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,416
You!

815
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,750
It's you!

816
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,583
[Solomon] Rimmon…

817
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,666
Samael…

818
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,000
Lucifer…

819
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,875
Gorgon…

820
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:07,791
[demonic chanting]

821
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,083
[Solomon] Beelzebub…

822
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,166
Morning Star…

823
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,625
[ominous music intensifies]

824
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,083
[Solomon] Satan.

825
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,875
It's you.

826
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,375
I'm still me.

827
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,083
I've always been me.

828
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:33,166
Only I've grown tired of watching fortune
turn a blind eye to me.

829
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,916
How could you?

830
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,166
How could I what? Take what we all want?

831
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,791
What we all came here for?

832
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,791
Power, prosperity, legacy.

833
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,333
Consider, Sarah…

834
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,833
a single soul…

835
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,666
Cyrus Miller.

836
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,083
Just one.

837
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,750
Pastor Miller.

838
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,041
[Solomon] And in return…

839
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,125
what no amount of praying
could ever bring.

840
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:07,833
One person every few years
seems a small price to pay.

841
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,125
One person?

842
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,666
The pastor slew 12 children!

843
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:18,083
-My brother! Innocents!
-[Solomon] Innocents.

844
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,000
Who's innocent?

845
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:25,375
Your neighbors hunt you,

846
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,875
forsake you, curse your name!

847
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,541
Everywhere is ignorance!

848
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,250
Dread!

849
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,958
Yet you resign yourself to it!

850
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:44,000
They're afraid
because they know you're different.

851
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,375
And you are.

852
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:55,833
Someone who refuses to settle
for the rules of these dogmatists,

853
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,041
who seeks more from the world.

854
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,541
You're like me.

855
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,625
I am nothing like you!

856
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:12,541
[Solomon grunts]

857
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,416
[panting]

858
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,583
[Sarah] No!

00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:20,875
-[Sarah whimpers]
-Argh!

[screams in pain]

864
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,541
Sarah!

865
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,250
Sarah!

866
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,000
Sarah!

867
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:03,916
Sarah?

868
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,666
Sarah!

869
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,375
Sarah, come back to me!

870
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:15,750
[flies buzzing]

871
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,458
[whispering voice] Sarah…

872
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:20,708
[flies buzzing]

873
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,500
[beating]

874
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,125
[Solomon] Sarah!

875
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,625
Sarah!

876
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,375

No! No, no, no, no!

-[Solomon] Stop, stop, stop!
-No!

889

-No, no!

891
00:55:56,625 --> 00:56:00,041
Please, do not make me hurt you!
I love you, Sarah! I love you!

892
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,333
Stop fighting! I don't want to hurt--

00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,500
No! No!

[Sarah sobbing]

920
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,666
[man 1] Told you she was a witch!

921
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,750
No, no!

926
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,333
[Elijah] The penalty
for practicing witchcraft

927
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,375
is death by hanging!

928
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,625
[crowd shouting] Hang them!

929

931
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,625
Confess!

932
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,375
Confess your sins or burn in eternal hell.

-[woman 1] Hang her!
-[Elijah] Confess!

No! No!

941
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,375
I confess!

942
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,416
-No! She's lying!
-I walked with the Devil!

943
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:54,500
I lay with him!

944
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,583
I bewitched the good pastor.

945
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,958
And I bewitched…

946
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,458
Hannah Miller.

947
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,833

948
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,458
I clouded her mind.

951
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,750

[muffled screaming]

953
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,833
[Sarah] It was me!

954
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:22,708
It was only me.

956
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,250

-[Solomon] Let her go.

959
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,458
[Hannah] No! [screams]

[screaming] No! No! No!

961
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,208
The truth will come out.

962
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,750
Maybe not today…

963
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,291
and maybe not tomorrow,

964
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,791
but it will.

965
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,875
The truth shall be your curse.

966
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,916
It will follow you for eternity.

967
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,750
I will shadow you forever.

968

let you go.

971
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,166
-Hang her!
-Hang her!

972
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,166
Witch!

973
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,375
Hang the witch!

978
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,833
The truth will come out.

979

Maybe not today.

980
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,083
Maybe not tomorrow,

981
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,625
but it will.

982
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,291
[Lizzie] We can't just leave her here,

983
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,208
alone underneath this tree.

984
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,000
[Abigail] She deserves a proper burial.

985
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,916
[Isaac] Let's move her,
bury her somewhere else.

986
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,333
So no one else knows where she is.

987
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,458
[all] Except us.

988
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:00,208

[Sarah] I will follow you forever.

993
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,083
And everything you take

994
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,625
and everyone you harm,

995
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,375
you will feel the grip

996
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,416
of my hand.

997
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,041

[Nick] Josh!

1028
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,916
Your sister is very confused.

[whispering] His dad and his grandpa
and his great grandpa!

1030
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:29,958
What?

1031
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,541
[Nick] She's clearly suffering
from some kind of a…

1032
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,833
a breakdown.

1033
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,958
She needs help.

01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,750
Josh?

1035
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,750

[tires screeching]

1041
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,625
I was back in time. I was Sarah Fier,
and Sarah Fier was innocent.

1042
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:30,291
She isn't turning people in Shadyside
into killers. She wasn't a witch!

1043
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,791
[woman over radio]
We have a 5150 in possession of car 961.

-Suspects on their way.
-Josh! Listen! Solomon Goode--

1045
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:38,250
Who?

1046
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,041
Nick Goode's Pilgrim ancestor

1047
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,500
made a deal with the Devil, then framed
Sarah to cover his own Puritan ass.

1048
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:44,625
Deena!

1049
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,958
The Goodes, they're trading us.
People from Shadyside.

1050
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:55,625
[Solomon] Lucifer… Samael… Satan…

1051
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,875
-[Deena] Goode gives a name to the Devil.
-Ryan Torres.

1052
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,125
-[Deena] The Devil takes over that person.
-[whispering voice] Ryan!

1053
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,208
What?

1054
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,333
Then that person kills and murders.

1055
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,625
[screaming]

1056
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:17,666
[Deena] And the Devil feeds on this blood
of dead Shadysiders.

1057
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,916
And Goode gets whatever he wants.

1058
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,916
He becomes Sheriff.

1059
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,791
His brother becomes mayor.

1060
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:38,708
All of Sunnyvale gets better and better.

1061
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,166
And Shadyside doesn't.

1062
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,666
And the Goodes do it over and over,
again and again.

1063
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:53,458
One Goode from every generation
passing down the evil.

1064
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,000
-[Deena] Solomon…
-Cyrus Miller.

1065
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,708

1071
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,375
[Deena] Right to today.

1072
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,875
-Abbadon, Ahriman…
-[Deena] Right to Sheriff Nick Goode.

1073
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,916
-So, Sarah Fier--
-He framed her!

1074
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,666
She's the only one
who's ever figured out the truth…

1075
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,916
until us.

1076
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,125
And the killers came after us
to keep us from uncovering it.

1077
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,875
Yes, to protect Goode's deal
with the Devil.

1078
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:34,000
But… but, Deena?

1079
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,625
Yeah, Josh?

1080
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,583
[Josh] If the killers
were after us before…

1081
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:44,333
now that we know the truth,
now we know about Goode's deal…

1082
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,750
-[flies buzzing]
-[beating]

1083
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,166

Oh, Jesus Christ!

1091

Look at her! I told you it wouldn't work!
There's no ending it.

[Deena breathes heavily]

1093
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,583
What is it?

1094
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,458
We need to talk.

1095
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,791
[gasps]

1096
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,000
[Ziggy] Thank you, King of Sunnyvale,

1097
