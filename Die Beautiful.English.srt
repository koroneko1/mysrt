1
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,393
Wave here!

2
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,644
Pose for the camera!

3
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,064
Yes! Just like that.

4
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,900
-Wave!
-What are you doing?

5
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,652
What's this?

6
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,195
Stop recording!

7
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,951
What foolishness is this, Patrick?
Why are you in a dress?

8
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,811
Barbs, make the lower lip bigger.

9
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,313
Jolie's upper lip is bigger.

10
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,731
Wait. Who is this?

11
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:10,941
Angelina Jolie.

12
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,693
I thought you said Jolina.

13
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,193
Angelina Jolie?

14
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,072
But both of them have big lips.

15
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,700
Would you both stop?

16
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,329
Don't they have an AC unit?

17
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,249
She might melt from the heat.

18
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,292
They only turn it on at night.

19
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,005
Have you heard from little miss orphan?

20
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,595
How frustrating.

21
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,223
That child was born with bad luck.

22
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,478
Both of her mothers are now dead.

23
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,663
Go ahead inside.

24
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,290
I'll pay for this.

25
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,212
Thank you.

26
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,714
Cover this chair.

27
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,928
Shirley Mae.

28
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,807
Where have you been?

29
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,267
Sorry!

30
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,105
Was your phone stolen?
We've been trying to call you.

31
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,193
I didn't know. I turned off my phone.

32
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,861
Why?

33
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,531
I didn't want Mama to find me.

34
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:47,746
I was shocked when I turned it on
and saw the messages...

35
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,570
Please take a rest.

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,459
Even chemo couldn't save her.

37
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,546
Did she refuse it?

38
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,840
With her salary?

39
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,218
What worries me...

40
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,720
is that one.

41
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,185
If I could, I'd adopt her myself.

42
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,730
Baby Adora is close to my heart.

43
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,068
I took care of her when Ella got sick.

44
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,738
But look at me.

45
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,740
This is my sixth.

46
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,869
And the father?

47
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,205
Never showed up.

48
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,832
Not even a shadow.

49
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,464
After Ella's burial,

50
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,386
her mother, Vangie,
will go home to Bulusan.

51
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,098
And she said...

52
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,767
that she plans to leave Adora behind.

53
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,481
She's never recognized her
as her granddaughter.

54
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,666
So you think raising that child
makes you a real woman?

55
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,669
God gave her to me.

56
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,129
How can I refuse?

57
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,797
Wow.

58
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,884
God also gave you a dick.

59
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,556
-But you still want to be a woman.
-Be quiet, she's sleeping.

60
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,894
Don't take God's name in vain.

61
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,313
You decided that on your own.

62
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,941
-Really now?
-Yes, really.

63
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,945
How about you praying to God
to get Gregory?

64
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,906
-That's nothing?
-Don't jinx it.

65
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:34,037
-I've prayed to God for a BF for so long.
-You started it.

66
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,885
Well...

67
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,887
Consider it an investment.

68
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,390
As they say,

69
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,266
us gays,

70
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:02,148
we should adopt a child
to take care of us in our old age.

71
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,901
I'm not like that.

72
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,366
What about the legalities of adoption?

73
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,868
She doesn't have a birth certificate.

74
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,538
She wasn't even born in a hospital.

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,915
It's your call.

76
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,671
I don't like her name though.

77
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,007
-What is it?
-Adora.

78
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,135
Sounds like a brand of rat poison.

79
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,055
-Let's change it.
-To what?

80
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,148
I believe in the saying,

81
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,276
"Having a flat tire
is better than having a flat nose."

82
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,196
My niece is brilliant!

83
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,449
You bitch, what was that?

84
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,659
But it's cute.

85
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,785
Flat nose?

86
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,828
She was cute.

87
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,639
She can afford wings!

88
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,185
The things you teach her.

89
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,436
It's cute!

90
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,443
You could have taught her a better saying.

91
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,570
Good kids go to heaven.

92
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,947
Naughty kids go to hell.

93
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,285
Blame it on the judges.
They favored the grandest costume.

94
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,829
Of course!
Her costume occupied the entire stage.

95
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,748
She even had minions.

96
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,959
Next year, Shirley,
I'll make your gown myself.

97
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,253
And we're going to put a long train on it.

98
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,173
It will cover the entire city.

99
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,260
-Yes, right up to the toll gate.
-For sure you'll win.

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,151
My mother is in Singapore.

101
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,738
She takes care of the sick.

102
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,867
She said I can visit her someday.

103
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,496
ABOUT MY PARENTS

104
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,581
Up next is Erica!

105
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,588
My father is a teacher
while my mother is a housewife.

106
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,592
She cooks our food and takes care of us.

107
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,139
Sometimes, my father helps me
with my homework.

108
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,729
The next one is Shirley Mae.

109
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,205
Let's pick on this girl.

110
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,711
Are you going home?

111
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,087
Yes...

112
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,922
Is your mama here?

113
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,258
What's your mama's profession again?

114
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,720
The real question is:

115
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,139
What is your mom?

116
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,975
Faggot.

117
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,144
Her mom's a faggot,
and she's just like her.

118
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,812
She's ugly, too.

119
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,439
She thinks she's so pretty?

120
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,233
Ouch!

121
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,278
You're ugly, just like your mother!

122
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,530
Yeah, you faggot!

123
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,619
My classmate said being a beauty queen
isn't a real job.

124
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,955
I told her, "Of course it is."

125
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,082
Ouch!

126
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,292
And then?

127
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,839
Then they started laughing
because they said you're a faggot.

128
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,426
And so you pulled her hair?

129
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,723
Then Miss Parco shut them up.

130
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,064
Aren't you a real mother?

131
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,983
I am.

132
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,152
I love you, right?

133
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,739
I'm just not a real woman yet.

134
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,660
But I am your mother.

135
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,163
Ouch!

136
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,833
So you don't have a vagina?

137
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,585
Hey, don't be nasty.

138
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,712
No, not yet.

139
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,507
But look, I have boobs.

140
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,592
Even bigger than yours.

141
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,553
Did you breastfeed me?

142
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,682
No, your first mother did.

143
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,767
My boobs don't have milk.

144
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,439
I don't get pregnant.

145
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,193
Another mother gave birth to you.

146
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,279
But,

147
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,242
I am your mother because
I take care of you.

148
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,540
There are women out there
who make lots of babies,

149
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,834
but it doesn't mean they are mothers.

150
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,588
That's exactly what Miss Parco said.

151
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,631
That's right.

152
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,095
When you see that girl again,
bring her to me, OK?

153
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,597
Why?

154
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,350
I'm going to tweeze her pubies!

155
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,312
She's such a bitch.

156
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,273
Being a beauty queen is hard work.

157
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,817
That hurts, Ma...

158
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,657
I turned on my phone.

159
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,536
I just wanted to know if she would call,
and then...

160
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,040
I wasn't able to tell her...

161
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,542
that I'm pregnant.

162
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,045
-What?
-Don't hit her!

163
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,092
Now, you won't be able to join pageants.

164
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,761
Why not?

165
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,347
Some were able to join
even though they had kids.

166
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,766
Just avoid getting stretch marks.

167
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,143
Why Angelina Jolie?

168
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,228
Was it her request?

169
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,397
There are seven looks.

170
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,399
Tomorrow will be a new one.

171
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,485
Awesome.

172
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,575
That guy...

173
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,911
Is he your boyfriend?

174
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,920
Fuck him!

175
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,839
He thought he could squeeze money
from me. Asshole!

176
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,091
Hey.

177
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,550
Language.

178
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,885
He wasn't even that handsome.

179
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,430
He's got nothing on Jesse. He's a jerk.

180
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,475
Jesse, again?

181
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
Can't you move on?

182
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,524
Just focus on your pageant.

183
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,443
It's only days before the finals.

184
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,571
Shirley Mae,
talk some sense into your mother.

185
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,116
She doesn't listen to me.

186
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,202
Don't think I didn't hear you last night.

187
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,621
You were fighting with someone
over the phone.

188
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,498
It was a guy, wasn't it?

189
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,585
Shirley Mae, don't be like me.

190
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,674
You're already menstruating.

191
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,510
Don't lose your future over a boy.

192
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,719
It's just a dick.

193
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,513
Girl, that's too much.

194
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,308
Let her experience it.

195
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,895
Make sure you don't get pregnant.

196
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,023
You can touch it, lick it,
or even suck it,

197
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,234
but no penetration.

198
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,445
Remember, you will be a beauty queen.

199
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,865
Is it a requirement to be a virgin
in pageants?

200
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,950
What if she gets pregnant?

201
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't want to join pageants anymore, Ma.

202
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,168
How can you say that?

203
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,045
After Little Miss Barangay,

204
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,175
and Miss Girl of the 21st Century,
and Miss Young and the Restless?

205
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,551
-How dare you!
-Stop it.

206
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,679
I've invested so much in you,

207
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,391
I even gave you beauty supplements.
Damn you.

208
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,768
I don't want to be a beauty queen!

209
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,145
It's not what I want.

210
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,735
Where are you going?

211
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,361
Let her be.

212
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,201
Foolish girl!
Your manicure isn't even done yet!

213
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,747
Bitch, guess who?

214
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,123
Let me see.

215
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,501
A Lego person?

216
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,377
What Lego person?

217
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,631
Guess who? Look at the mole.

218
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,466
A Lego person with a mole?

219
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,469
Bitch, you're so annoying.

220
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,011
-Tell me who already.
-Fine, here.

221
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,805
So annoying.

222
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:55,890
Here.

223
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,561
-Yes, there's a resemblance.
-Right?

224
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,190
Show off!

225
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,359
Can you guess who I'm impersonating?

226
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,945
Wow, yes!

227
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,905
-You look just like her!
-Really?

228
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,281
Yes! Regine?

229
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,742
-Yes!
-Regine Tolentino!

230
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,869
No!

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
It's Velasquez.

232
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,501
-You're crazy!
-Reg...

233
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,465
You think if Migs saw me
looking like this,

234
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,342
he would like me?

235
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,596
For horny boys, a hole is a hole.

236
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,223
Especially your hole, my friend.

237
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,724
They like it...

238
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,685
tight.

239
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,938
Does it really hurt?

240
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,731
Only at first.

241
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,941
But...

242
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,194
once it really hits the spot, and

243
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,530
you start to relax,

244
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,658
that's when you really enjoy it.

245
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,952
What was that?

246
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,662
You look a lot like Regine.

247
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,665
What spot?

248
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:07,503
Instead of explaining it,
I'll just let you experience it yourself.

249
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,087
I'll get you a rent boy.

250
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,423
They're everywhere outside.

251
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
I don't want that.

252
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,678
Your Migs is not going to happen.

253
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,973
Fashion show, like that.

254
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,559
Sway your hips more.

255
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,810
-Like that?
-Like that!

256
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,604
Sashay.

257
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,188
Sashay away.

258
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,857
Butterfly walk.

259
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,234
What have we here?

260
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,485
We're not friends with her.

261
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,655
What's the matter with you?

262
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,698
You're such a flirt.

263
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,408
There's the teacher.

264
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,497
-Where is he?
-Let's go that way.

265
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,542
Girl, let's go.
I don't like it here, it stinks.

266
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,961
Come on, let's watch some basketball.

267
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,840
Migs is playing.
The guy who will pop my cherry.

268
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,259
How scandalous.

269
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,428
Have some fun, will you?

270
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,889
There are lots of cute guys here.

271
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,350
They're not my type.
They look too wholesome.

272
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,312
Why are they stripping?

273
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,065
I told you so, let's stay here and watch.

274
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,817
-OK, fine.
-Look at this pervert.

275
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,945
I hope Migs misses.

276
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,490
What do you want him to remove?
Shirt or shorts?

277
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,162
-That gave me an erection.
-You horny bitch.

278
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,501
Look, there he goes.

279
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,795
Pray that he misses.

280
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,051
He's taking off his shirt.

281
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,388
What's with that armpit?

282
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,892
-That's his girlfriend.
-I hate her.

283
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,853
-She's so stuck up.
-She's got a water jug for him.

284
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,023
Girl, where's your water?
You're not prepared.

285
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,192
I don't care.
Her legs are just three inches long.

286
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,655
She's so small.

287
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,616
So stuck up.

288
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,453
Here he comes.

289
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,872
-Is he coming here?
-Behave yourself!

290
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,082
Is he going to hurt us?

291
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,875
Fuck him! He can try!

292
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,544
How do I look?

293
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,964
Move over.

294
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,215
He wiped it on himself.

295
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,057
Now it's dirty. Wash it.

296
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,652
This year's Miss Gay Philippines is...

297
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,331
Wow, your mom looks great!

298
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
Are you going to text her?

299
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,847
Tell her congratulations.

300
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,854
Why did you turn it off?

301
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,982
She'll still be excited.

302
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,985
She won't think of me until next week.

303
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,864
How long can we stay here?

304
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,825
Don't worry about Uncle James.

305
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,243
It's fine with him.

306
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,578
He's cool.

307
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,707
How about you?

308
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,084
How long will you hold a grudge
against your mama?

309
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,715
Just let us be.

310
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,723
Thank you.

311
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,575
Miss Iza Calzado, can we take a picture
of you with the winner?

312
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,118
Of course. Why not!

313
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,876
I feel dizzy.

314
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,628
Do you want water?

315
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,298
Oh my God! What happened?

316
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,095
A doctor, an ambulance, a medic!

317
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:31,600
-Move back! She needs some air!
-Water please!

318
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,020
Look girls, Pia Wurtzbach.

319
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,565
I like this one better.

320
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,275
Megan Young.

321
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,819
Pia is Miss Universe,
Megan is just Miss World.

322
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:46,240
But Megan is the first Filipino
to win the Miss World crown.

323
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,741
Right, Barbs?

324
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,911
I prefer Pia.

325
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,039
-No, Megan all the way.
-Miss Universe, Miss World, whatever.

326
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,583
Will you two stop?

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,834
Here.

328
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,216
Since she's the one who crowned Trisha.

329
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,972
Oh, Trisha.

330
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,016
My Trisha.

331
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,893
-Mother.
-Dear, how are you?

332
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,520
How are you?

333
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,439
Good.

334
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,025
Oh, Mother.

335
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,611
We're so glad you could come.

336
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,987
Girl.

337
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,371
Paula.

338
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,668
How fabulous.

339
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,545
Who's that?

340
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,714
It's Iza Calzado, Mother.

341
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,008
You're right.

342
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,801
I just saw her.

343
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,261
Really, Mother?

344
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,055
Does she have a new TV show?

345
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,807
No. She has a new movie.
And also a concert.

346
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,850
No.

347
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,434
Mother, trust me.

348
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,395
-I saw the trailer, she has a movie.
-No, really,

349
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,356
-I just saw her.
-Really now.

350
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,608
She's here.

351
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,986
Fuck.

352
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,988
It is her.

353
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:13,786
I sent her manager a message,
but I didn't think she would come...

354
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,122
Thank you so much for coming.

355
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,293
My condolences, I also feel so sad.

356
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,893
We thought so too, madam.

357
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,604
Thank you again for coming, madam,

358
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,773
We really appreciate it.

359
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,692
I feel really sad...

360
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,736
Of course, madam, this way.

361
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,490
Girls, behave yourselves.

362
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,163
You're the one she chose, ma'am.

363
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,708
Just for tonight.

364
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,710
To be her look-alike.

365
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,359
You're embarrassing.

366
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,072
Come here everyone, let's get our picture
taken with Iza Calzado!

367
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,531
Come here!

368
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,908
Shirley Mae, come here!

369
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,745
Come here.

370
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,247
Let's take a selfie.

371
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,382
Didn't I tell you to get that fixed?

372
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,593
I'll call maintenance, sir.

373
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,647
I need to meet my classmates.

374
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,487
We need to finish our thesis.

375
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,949
Bullshit.

376
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,036
You think I'm an idiot?

377
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,082
You were just hospitalized.

378
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,960
You think you can fool me?

379
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,839
But it's true.

380
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,760
We have a deadline.

381
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,594
And...

382
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,181
because I was hospitalized,

383
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,309
we're running late.

384
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,312
Patrick...

385
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,898
perhaps you...

386
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,942
should take it easy.

387
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,196
-But, Pa--
-Damn you.

388
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,247
Everything that comes out of it
is garbage.

389
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,296
I am this close...

390
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,883
to kicking you out of the house.

391
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,223
Shame on you for not only dishonoring me,
your father,

392
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,100
but the entire family.

393
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,270
Be thankful I'm still letting you
eat in my house

394
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,272
even though you disgust me!

395
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,703
Where are you going?

396
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,164
Where else?

397
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,836
What if Papa wakes up?

398
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,171
You don't need to scare me.

399
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,506
You're still going?

400
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,259
Didn't Papa say you weren't allowed?

401
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,094
I'll be back before he knows it.

402
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,891
Patrick... don't do this.

403
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,852
Papa might not forgive you this time.

404
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,106
I'm ready.

405
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,493
Try not to breathe!

406
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,621
Mother Celing, it hurts.

407
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,707
You want to be a beauty queen, right?

408
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,252
Since you don't have real breasts yet,
endure it.

409
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,629
Mother, she's ready for shipping.

410
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,756
Put her inside the box.

411
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,175
They're just joking.

412
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,927
I know, Mother.

413
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,366
Tonight, the third runner-up

414
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,451
gets 500 pesos.

415
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,953
Second runner up

416
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,371
gets 1,000.

417
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,333
First runner up

418
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,792
gets 2,000.

419
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,044
And the winner

420
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,170
gets 5,000 pesos.

421
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,837
-Five thousand?
-Wow, 5,000.

422
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,966
-What country will you represent?
-Bahamas.

423
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,218
Make your eyes bigger.

424
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,680
If you get Miss Friendship,
that's 200 pesos.

425
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,640
Two hundred? Barbs, 200!

426
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,310
But if you want to win a crown...

427
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,854
impress them with your beauty.

428
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,471
In life, there are many mysteries.

429
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,934
Questions that remain unanswered,

430
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,186
such as:

431
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,064
Why do we fart?

432
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,818
Why are some people poor?

433
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,487
Why...

434
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,656
are others poorer?

435
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,868
Tonight,

436
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,580
I will solve a mystery.

437
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,667
Which came first?

438
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,253
The egg...

439
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,797
or the chicken?

440
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:09,136
-Chicken!
-Egg!

441
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,180
Let me answer it for you.

442
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,447
It's the egg!

443
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,787
As you can see, the egg came first.
Thank you.

444
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,594
Patrick.

445
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,600
Come here.

446
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,160
How dare you?

447
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,870
You have no respect.

448
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,247
Get out.

449
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,128
Leave this house at once.

450
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,801
-I'll just get my things.
-You won't get anything.

451
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,055
Nothing in this house is yours.

452
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,473
Now leave.

453
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,683
-I need my things.
-No!

454
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,229
But they're mine!

455
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,605
You own nothing here!

456
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,734
You want to be a different person?

457
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,154
Then buy your own clothes,

458
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,240
get a new ID

459
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,200
and change your surname,

460
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,994
because I won't let you use my name
anymore.

461
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,163
-Pa.
-Papa, please.

462
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,415
-Don't you dare...!
-Papa!

463
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,878
Don't ever come back.

464
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,590
Stick that in your head, Patrick!

465
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,547
I am Trisha.

466
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,942
It was bound to happen.

467
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,653
I wish I had left earlier.

468
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,905
If only I'd had the money.

469
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,158
Aren't you going to eat?

470
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,162
I'm OK, Mama Ruby.

471
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:24,789
Who knows?

472
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,292
He might change his mind.

473
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,421
I am not going back.

474
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,256
What about your studies?

475
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:36,926
I think...

476
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,137
-Mama, I'm leaving.
-Where are you going?

477
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:43,350
I might as well stop.
I can't afford it anymore.

478
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,687
Barbs will have to stop too.
He failed all his subjects.

479
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,813
Ma...

480
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,444
I just need to find a job, and then...

481
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,238
I will look for a room to rent.

482
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,409
You just moved in
and you're already thinking of leaving?

483
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:06,081
It's going to be difficult finding work.
Barbs had to do odd jobs.

484
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,293
I do makeup at weddings, graduations...

485
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,923
You know those whores at casinos
and at Makati Avenue?

486
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,051
They don't know how to apply makeup.
Fucking is their only skill.

487
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,470
I still have 1,000 pesos. Please take it.

488
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,973
-What's the matter with you?
-No, you should keep it.

489
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,184
Sorry to trouble you.

490
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,479
Girl.

491
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,233
Are you ready?

492
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,113
Yes, I am.

493
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,073
Wherever this leads us?

494
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,282
Even if that's hell.

495
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,009
This is so exciting.

496
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,512
Reserve your energy, girls.

497
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,433
Don't push your limits.
We have more pageants to go to.

498
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,686
But, tell you what, the councilor here,

499
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,106
if a candidate pleases him,
he will give her a bonus.

500
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,649
So, do your best.

501
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,276
Is that clear?

502
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,409
Oh God, all this mud...

503
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,619
-Barbs, look.
-Girl, what the hell?

504
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,704
Look!

505
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,456
What?

506
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,253
-I have an idea.
-Girl, the things you come up with...

507
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,922
-A great idea in mind.
-What is it?

508
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,551
I'm going to buy these birds
and hide them in my costume

509
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,678
so that when I introduce myself,

510
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,598
I'll open my cape and let the birds fly!

511
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,099
Fabulous, right?

512
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,185
The birds could bite you!

513
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,228
-Plus, you'll be wasting cash.
-Right?

514
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,271
But these birds aren't that expensive.

515
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,442
If it pleases the councilor,
I might just win.

516
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,527
Fine, do what you want.

517
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:10,163
Great changes are happening in our town.

518
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,167
We have fixed the power outage,

519
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,712
we repaired Maristela Bridge,

520
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,010
and we built additional schools
in Syjuco and Capas.

521
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,680
Will he ever stop talking?

522
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,307
The birds are clawing at my nipples.

523
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,936
Remember, you wanted this.

524
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,356
Hug them tightly so they won't move.

525
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,661
From the country of Israel!

526
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,883
It's so itchy, we have so many... Russia!

527
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,558
Spain!

528
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,628
Good evening, everyone!

529
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,807
Who believes in this saying:

530
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:57,270
I catch balls under the bridge.

531
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:45,568
Stop with the gimmicks.
Work on your Q&amp;A skills.

532
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,947
Didn't I give you a sample Q&amp;A?

533
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,698
Memorize that.

534
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,160
Or you can crack a joke
if you can't think of an answer.

535
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,456
Or ask for an interpreter.

536
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,584
Or just blabber anything in English.

537
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,211
Say something like:

538
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,055
Something like that!

539
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,431
What does that mean, Mother?

540
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:16,891
Nothing.

541
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,811
Dumbass, just say it with confidence.

542
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,354
Take it from Barbs.

543
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,481
Her English is hopeless,

544
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,358
yet she took home Miss Friendship.

545
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,903
Our next stop is Concepcion,
Tarlac, girls.

546
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,950
-Let's team up! One more!
-My bikini area is burning already.

547
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,494
The bones in my feet
will show up any time.

548
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,954
It's my mom.

549
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,496
Let's go home.

550
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,915
Ma!

551
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,458
Hello, child!

552
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,004
Did you win, Ma?

553
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,382
Same as always.

554
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,055
You should join
Miss Gay Philippines instead.

555
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,141
So I can watch you on TV.

556
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,894
Dear, I've been telling her that.

557
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,354
She refuses.

558
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,189
She's too insecure.

559
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,026
You two are too ambitious.

560
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,820
Even in small-time pageants,

561
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,156
I only get First Runner-up.

562
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,576
What more in Miss Gay Philippines?

563
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,706
That's because
your beauty isn't for small-time pageants.

564
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:27,628
You really know how to
make Mama feel good.

565
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,047
Go inside now.

566
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,715
You have school tomorrow.

567
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,091
Here, take this.

568
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,093
-Good night.
-Good night.

569
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,512
-Brush your teeth!
-Yes, Ma!

570
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,932
I'll go ahead.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at six.

571
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,518
Wait, really? At six?

572
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,936
Isn't that too early?

573
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,691
We're doing make up for the entourage.

574
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,903
We need to be early.

575
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,281
Stop complaining.
Be thankful that we have a job.

576
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,325
Why, it feels like...

577
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,163
I'm so tired of joining beauty contests.

578
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,875
These boobs have taken us nowhere.

579
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,586
Idiot.

580
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,381
All you think about are pageants.

581
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,845
Personally, I've given up.

582
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,723
I'm only still joining them
because of you.

583
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,518
Really, now?

584
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,814
Looking at you, I wouldn't have guessed.

585
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,484
Pageants are a nice way to earn money.

586
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,403
Yes, I know.

587
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,948
But we're getting old.

588
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,200
Your boobs are wasted on nothing.

589
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:43,746
You should use them to
breastfeed some boys.

590
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,499
I'm leaving.

591
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,626
Good night. See you tomorrow.

592
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,378
I'm getting sleepy.

593
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,136
Hurry, please.

594
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,474
What happened to her? Put her here.

595
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,399
-Trisha?
-Ma'am sorry, you can't be here.

596
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,121
Where's Trisha?

597
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:34,649
-See, you're Miley Cyrus today.
-Good morning!

598
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,902
Good morning, Madam!
You caught me by surprise.

599
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,364
-My sympathies.
-Thank you very much.

600
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,243
I'm Flora,
the owner of this funeral parlor.

601
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,994
Yes, I know you, Madam.

602
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,456
I've been to a number of wakes
here before.

603
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,834
This funeral home wasn't called
Happy Ending back then.

604
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,753
It was called "Living Things" then,

605
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,423
back when I was still a
Born Again Christian.

606
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,884
What a nice lamp.

607
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,095
Oh, it's not a lamp.

608
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,180
It's a wrecking ball.

609
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,392
Are you going to wreck something here?

610
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,437
Where is her family?

611
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,900
That's a tragedy.

612
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,111
She was disowned?

613
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,322
Growing old is already tough.

614
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,657
Look at me.

615
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,619
All my family died before me.

616
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,831
That's why I take care of my boy toys.

617
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:38,004
So someone will be there for me
when it's time for me to die.

618
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,755
Look.

619
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,633
-That's my boyfriend.
-Oh, really, Madam?

620
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:48,805
We've been together a long time.
He's never left me.

621
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,933
Perhaps he really does love me.

622
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:51,976
Babe!

623
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,978
Motel later?

624
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,064
That one is Bruce Walis.

625
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,607
We've only been together two years.

626
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,276
Really, madam?

627
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,987
I noticed them yesterday.

628
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,157
Bruce, mop the floors next.

629
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,326
He's my embalmer.

630
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,870
When I die,

631
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,122
I want him to embalm my body.

632
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:17,376
I know my organs
will be handled with care.

633
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,836
I feel like vomiting.

634
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,047
Joke.

635
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,508
The other one is 19 years old.

636
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,843
Although, he's leaving soon.

637
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,889
But oh my, he's always hard.

638
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,349
Oh, really?

639
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:35,102
Your funeral parlor is like a gay bar,
too.

640
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,314
That's why it's called Happy Ending.

641
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,441
That's right, Happy Ending.

642
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,404
Oh, every night it's different.

643
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,158
That was her last request.

644
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,911
Why?
Did she know that she was going to die?

645
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,746
Did she die of cancer?

646
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,039
No.

647
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:01,754
We once talked about her last wishes.

648
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,756
She's very young.

649
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
What a waste.

650
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,717
Was she flirty with boys?

651
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,262
Even at two years old.

652
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,766
Good. She's very beautiful, after all.

653
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,395
She looks like she's just asleep.

654
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,021
Can I take a selfie?

655
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,064
Sure.

656
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,440
Thanks.

657
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,734
You can do it here, for a better view.

658
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,239
Can you take the picture?
Here, just press it here.

659
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,782
-Here?
-Yes, that's right.

660
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,367
Your phone's so lit.

661
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,083
-Now, let's do a candid shot.
-OK, candid--

662
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,174
Such a beautiful girl.

663
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,563
A town in Spain?

664
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,193
my mother loves Spanish bread.

665
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,989
-So, where does Echevarria come from?
-Jan-jan!

666
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,825
Nowhere really, it just sounded nice.

667
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,411
I invented that name when I was a kid.

668
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,787
Oh, I see.

669
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,000
How does that feel?

670
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,837
I'm excited. And nervous.

671
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,299
It says here, makeup is your hobby.

672
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,469
And you can transform into any celebrity.

673
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,389
Yes, me and my best friend, Barbs,

674
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,349
when we have nothing to do,

675
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,353
-we study and copy the faces of stars.
-I'll feed my grandchild.

676
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,356
Jan-jan.

677
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,574
Can you copy her face?

678
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,075
Me?

679
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,535
How about next time?

680
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,573
Girl, look at that lump.

681
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,452
Did you spot anyone?

682
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,913
I want him!

683
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,039
Him? Or him?

684
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,834
That one is cute.

685
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,753
-There.
-Where?

686
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,338
We start with that one.

687
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,552
Looks like a biggie.

688
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,886
You're totally gay.

689
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,491
But his nose looks a bit big.

690
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,536
Look down!

691
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,288
That's also big.

692
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,499
My ovaries can't handle the excitement.

693
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,209
It makes me want to just open my mouth.

694
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,255
You like him, too.

695
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,257
Guess what?
My plaster is falling off instantly.

696
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,341
He's mine.

697
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,896
Stop it.

698
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,315
I'll just take a look at it.

699
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,818
The doctor said leave it for a week.

700
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,906
-Promise, just a peak.
-Michael Angelo.

701
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,242
That nose of yours

702
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,370
might get infected because of your antics.

703
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,790
I don't have money to have it fixed again.

704
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,377
You're so irritable.

705
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,046
I'll stop, Mommy.

706
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,882
But thank you, really.

707
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,134
I've always wanted a nose job.

708
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:24,140
That's my Valentine's, Birthday, Christmas
and Three Kings gift to you.

709
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,519
Didn't the doctor give you a discount?

710
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,189
I'm saving up to get a vagina.

711
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,899
But I spent it on your nose first.

712
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,777
That's why I love you so much.

713
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,910
Shirley Mae! What are you doing there?

714
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,747
We're now a family.

715
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,792
What, I'm a mother to both of you?

716
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,503
I'm the father.

717
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,756
I may be young,
but I know how to be a father.

718
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,804
Shirley, starting today, call me "Daddy".

719
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,306
If you say so.

720
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,267
And you...

721
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:09,978
you're now my wife.

722
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,231
And I am your husband.

723
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,108
Wow.

724
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,360
Just because I paid for your nose,
we're married now?

725
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,404
And one day,

726
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,906
I'll get you your vagina.

727
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,991
Your vulgar mouth.

728
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,913
When it comes to that,

729
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,458
do you plan to quit stripping?

730
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,293
Why?

731
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,587
Are you ashamed of me?

732
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,341
It's not as easy as it looks.

733
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:44,054
And even though I show it to everyone,
my dick is yours alone.

734
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,682
Keep your voice down.

735
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,207
Sorry, what should I call you now?

736
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,598
Are you about to cry?

737
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,142
Or just suppressing a yawn?

738
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:36,607
You're so beautiful.

739
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,070
I'm so happy to see you again.

740
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,117
Your boobs are bigger than mine.

741
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,203
Thank you.

742
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,537
Are those real?

743
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,208
I've been saving money.

744
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,418
I've been thinking--

745
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,670
I want to be a complete woman.

746
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,926
Is that a wig?

747
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,053
No, this is real.

748
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,474
How have you been?

749
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,145
I'm pregnant.

750
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,402
I thought I was going to die an old maid.

751
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,572
You finally got a man.

752
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,541
Papa... he's doing well.

753
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,093
He still talks about you.

754
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,722
That's history.

755
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,310
I don't regret anything.

756
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,025
It's the best decision I made in my life.

757
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,282
He's still your father.

758
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,617
And I'm still your sister.

759
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,794
Not anymore.

760
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,424
That's all in the past, Beth.

761
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,720
It's better if...

762
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,222
we just treat each other as friends.

763
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,270
I have a new family now.

764
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,652
It's so hot!

765
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,281
Hurry! We're going to be late.

766
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,284
Calm your tits!
You sure we didn't forget anything?

767
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,619
Put on your wig.

768
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,078
Later. Just hold it for now.

769
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,204
OK, let's go!

770
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,335
She's still not answering.

771
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,087
I can't believe she's doing this to me
on the day of the finals.

772
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,007
Just call her later. We're late.

773
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,802
You think she turned off her phone?

774
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,847
-Stop it!
-Maybe her phone was stolen?

775
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,059
She'll come back. This is getting tiring.

776
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,186
What if she doesn't?

777
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,271
I didn't come back home.

778
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,482
Nobody asked you to come back.

779
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,988
Excuse me! I didn't want to come back.

780
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,241
Whatever. After the grand finals,
we'll look for her, OK?

781
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,618
We'll call the police.

782
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,833
We're here. Let's go.

783
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,128
Remember the makeup kits.

784
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,964
And don't forget the costumes.

785
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,632
Hurry up, hurry.

786
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,551
The prizes here are huge.

787
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,637
You'll get 5,000 pesos
for placing third runner-up.

788
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,721
Come on.

789
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,391
Just a tiny bit of contour here.

790
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,352
And some highlight on the cheeks.

791
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,687
And the dark eyeshadow.

792
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,271
Dark or black?

793
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,692
What's that? That's a lot of makeup.

794
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,485
I have a gimmick in mind, Mother.

795
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,570
-Another gimmick?
-This will be fun.

796
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,114
Barbs will help me.

797
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,574
We're going to copy the face
of Britney Spears.

798
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,786
What you need to prepare for
is the Q&amp;A portion.

799
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,747
Did you study the sample Q&amp;A I gave you?

800
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,875
I've only been able to memorize one.

801
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:24,918
Which one?

802
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,462
There are too many.

803
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,089
This one:

804
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,688
You waste your time on gimmicks.

805
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,524
Look at what you've done to your face.

806
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,943
You must be cursed.

807
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,362
Of all the questions,
you were asked that one.

808
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,446
Mother Celing,

809
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,824
they just won't let me win.

810
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:22,494
Who knows if that was the question
written on the paper?

811
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,288
Correct! No one else won, aside from you.

812
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,707
Look at your competition.

813
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,751
You shouldn't have expected to win.

814
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:31,670
Why is that, Mother?

815
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,131
They are post-operated women.

816
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,049
They went to Japan.

817
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,093
Especially that Tonette...

818
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,053
Look at her boobs,

819
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,181
so firm as if she's always horny.

820
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,564
Trisha, please don't make a scene.

821
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,606
Hey!

822
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,442
Fuck you, where are you going?

823
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,486
I already saw you. Don't hide from me!

824
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,324
What are you doing here?

825
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,577
Trisha, why?

826
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,829
You're asking me why? You bitch.

827
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,290
You seduced my husband!

828
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:13,003
That's not true. I only asked Miko
to help paint the parlor.

829
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,506
-Right, Miko?
-Why? Is my husband a painter?

830
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,009
Since when did he become
Leonardo da Vinci?

831
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,845
He can't even color a coloring book.

832
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,056
You've had your eyes on him

833
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,475
ever since I took him here for a haircut.

834
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,561
Girl, you're being paranoid.

835
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,355
I only have one question for you.
Tell me the truth.

836
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,817
Are you having an affair with my husband?

837
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,486
-Affair?
-Affair.

838
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:42,115
Are you his concubine,
kept woman, mistress?

839
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,659
-Trisha...
-Don't call me Trisha!

840
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,286
Answer my question!

841
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,290
Wait...

842
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,126
Isn't that a line from a movie?

843
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,794
-Enough of this.
-That's right.

844
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,171
Don't play innocent with me.

845
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,797
You've been found out.

846
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,758
And you're still playing coy!

847
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,510
Damn it, girl.

848
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:05,263
Are you going to use
all of Maricel Soriano's dialogues?

849
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,806
Teach her a lesson already!

850
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:08,767
You don't want to do it?

851
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,685
OK then, I'll do it myself!

852
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,312
Bitch!

853
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,525
You idiot.

854
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,654
We were almost arrested
for starting a fight!

855
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,780
It hurts!

856
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,574
-Thanks, Shirley.
-Ouch!

857
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,953
Thank God, your face is unscathed.
We still have a pageant tonight.

858
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,123
You did nothing but talk

859
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,960
and bitch at her like crazy.

860
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,337
What was that about?

861
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,172
That's all you've got?

862
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,967
That's the best you could do?

863
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,052
-You're a war freak!
-I admit it!

864
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,221
You really attacked her?

865
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,473
I made her boobs a punching bag!

866
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,102
You should have also taken back
Miko's nose.

867
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,396
How much did you spend on it, Ma?

868
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,733
Let's not talk about it.

869
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,737
How dare he?

870
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,123
I really believed that he loved me.

871
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,710
He promised he would marry me.

872
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:20,839
But Ma...

873
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,300
you don't really love him.

874
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,802
You only liked him because

875
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,471
you thought no one was going to love you.

876
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,725
Listen to your daughter.

877
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:33,435
I hope you learn from her.

878
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,731
You talk too much for your age.

879
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,151
What do you know about love?

880
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,112
Not much.

881
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,408
All I know is how you love me.

882
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:53,663
I hope you find the same kind of love
from your boyfriends.

883
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,802
By the way, Ma...

884
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,473
I found this in the cabinet.

885
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:12,974
Here.

886
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,812
This is Mother Celing's...

887
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,192
-I wasn't able to return it to her.
-I remember this.

888
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,319
Look at this.

889
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,447
She wrote down all the possible
pageant questions.

890
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:31,701
You still have time to memorize them.

891
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,496
At my age?

892
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,665
I don't know.

893
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,250
For the longest time,

894
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,462
I've only managed to memorize
one answer here.

895
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,611
Bravo! You're amazing!

896
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,489
Do you want to work here?

897
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,909
Probably when I run out of
other career options.

898
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,495
Bitchy!

899
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,125
-Where did you see this?
-Facebook.

900
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,793
Do you know them?

901
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,295
Aren't they friends of Trisha?

902
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,632
But how did they know?

903
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,679
Barbs, we have a problem.

904
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,763
What?

905
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,850
Let me see.

906
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,602
I'm the one who posted it.

907
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,146
In case you didn't know,

908
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,858
my funeral parlor has a fan page.

909
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,487
That's why her corpse is trending.

910
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,781
Look at this, Barbs.

911
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:53,491
It has 20,000 likes.

912
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:58,872
There will be more people coming
to verify if it's a hoax.

913
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,832
Shit... that's bad.

914
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,960
Isn't that good?
She'll have many visitors.

915
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,256
We stole her body.

916
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,008
What?

917
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,178
Her father might find her.

918
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,138
We won't complete the seven days.

919
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,056
I don't understand.

920
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,144
It's supposed to be a secret.

921
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,521
Let's keep it a secret.

922
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,775
Can we take a photo with her?

923
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,069
Go ahead, but this is a secret.

924
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:34,032
-Why did you let them?
-It's for their eyes only!

925
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,450
Thank you.

926
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,660
I know you're gossipers.

927
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,706
Call me once you get home.

928
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,793
-Hey, look at that.
-Where?

929
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:46,878
It's Migs.

930
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,422
You got sharp eyes.

931
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,342
He's with his girlfriend again.

932
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,594
That girl's annoying!

933
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,515
Now's your chance.

934
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,141
Right now?

935
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:05,021
Yes, right now. It's up to you.

936
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,738
-Did she confess already?
-Yes.

937
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,199
-Hi.
-Your fan.

938
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,203
Have you washed this?

939
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:21,996
Nice.

940
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,501
You should come with us.

941
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,794
Let's eat out.

942
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:28,962
Are you game?

943
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:29,921
Yes, c'mon.

944
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:31,714
I'm shy.

945
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,841
Come on.

946
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:35,802
Let's go!

947
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,307
Come on.

948
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,616
That bitch left me.

949
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,410
She didn't even look back.

950
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,537
She hasn't showed up for two days.

951
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,831
Did you try calling her?

952
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,958
She's not answering.

953
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,419
What's up with her?

954
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,714
Look, she's here.

955
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:13,965
Trish!

956
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,803
Hey!

957
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,723
What happened to you?

958
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,435
What's up with you?

959
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,605
Trisha!

960
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,691
Will you please wait for me?
What really happened?

961
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,651
Hey, girl!

962
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,281
Trisha?

963
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,282
Wait.

964
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:41,659
Are you crying?

965
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,787
I feel sick to my stomach.

966
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,998
Are you pregnant?

967
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,708
You're crazy.

968
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,877
Then what is it?

969
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:58,760
Hey!

970
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,307
Maybe it's something I ate.

971
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,061
Don't change the topic.

972
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,395
What happened to you?

973
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,197
I'm no longer a virgin.

974
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,619
Now I know...

975
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:30,375
what you're talking about.

976
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,088
You know,
the feeling when something's inside you.

977
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,508
At first, I agreed.

978
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,094
I told Migs,

979
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,931
OK, but he has to be the first one.

980
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,519
I thought of it as a challenge...

981
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,485
and a game.

982
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,446
Maybe it could lead to something.

983
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,408
But...

984
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,871
by the fourth guy,

985
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,338
I started thinking,

986
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,215
am I getting raped?

987
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,844
I don't know.

988
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,013
I was so confused.

989
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,310
You said it would hurt,

990
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:36,482
but I would get used to it.

991
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,369
They didn't force me.

992
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,753
I didn't even object.

993
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,260
I felt so helpless.

994
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,772
Sis...

995
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,324
You're bleeding, Trish.

996
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,371
Let's go to the hospital.

997
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,416
Come on, get your things.

998
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,842
So who's bigger, girl?

999
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,302
-Is it Migs or Josh?
-It's Migs.

1000
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,181
You said you were only hurt
after Migs left.

1001
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,211
What happened to you?

1002
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,973
Papa, it's gastroenteritis, they said.

1003
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,686
I think I ate something bad.

1004
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,230
Patrick Villar?

1005
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:57,123
And, well,
he got bruised and it got infected.

1006
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,835
What trauma?

1007
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,757
Perhaps you should ask him.

1008
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,385
But there are...

1009
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,726
Excuse me, sir.

1010
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,687
I'll leave you alone for now.

1011
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,030
You shameless faggot.

1012
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,783
You're not going to stop, are you?

1013
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,246
Papa, not here.

1014
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,169
You're disgusting. You son of a bitch.

1015
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,813
Patrick, I'm trying to understand you,

1016
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,901
but why did you do this?

1017
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:14,784
If I were in his situation,
I wouldn't mind.

1018
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:20,748
Wow! Look at you and your red lipstick!

1019
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,085
It will heal with the help of antibiotics.

1020
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,127
You're sure?

1021
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,837
It also happened to Sonia.

1022
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,466
-She was also gangbanged?
-Moron.

1023
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,103
I don't want to see you all.

1024
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,483
You don't want to mess with me.

1025
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,820
Do you understand?

1026
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,280
Yes, sir.

1027
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,708
Just leave it there! Barbs!

1028
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,001
Barbs!

1029
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,479
What are you doing?

1030
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,774
Have you saved enough money?

1031
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,488
I'm 20,000 pesos short.

1032
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:38,784
Maybe there's a bulk discount
since it's for the two of us?

1033
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,619
A total of four boobs.

1034
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,247
Breasts...

1035
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,755
Trish,

1036
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,716
I'm scared.

1037
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,468
Does it hurt?

1038
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:00,931
-Or you can use a stapler.
-Why don't you try it first.

1039
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,392
Idiot, of course it will hurt,
it's a wound.

1040
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:08,773
But no pain, no gain, right?

1041
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,067
This is a career move.

1042
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:14,111
-A career move?
-So?

1043
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,744
I liked the way you did that.

1044
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,412
You love it?

1045
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,629
I'm OK.

1046
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,050
-I think it's time.
-Yes, sir.

1047
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,307
You can go inside now.

1048
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:43,742
Can we skip my boob job?

1049
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,123
Give me a vagina first
so we can have a child.

1050
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,460
I'm just like you, Trisha.

1051
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:54,587
You have a vagina?

1052
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,634
Just take a nap.

1053
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,765
Let's start.

1054
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,851
We'll just put an IV line.

1055
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,736
Ma'am, we're closing.

1056
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,490
What time is it?

1057
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,867
It's already late, ma'am.

1058
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:37,796
Ouch!

1059
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,716
Does it hurt?

1060
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,094
I think so.

1061
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,096
We're already closing.

1062
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:48,933
Ouch!

1063
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,105
It's a wound, that's why it hurts.

1064
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,399
But it will heal.

1065
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,653
Just take what the doctor prescribed.

1066
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:05,532
Don't carry anything heavy for six weeks.

1067
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,203
And don't remove the surgical tape.

1068
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,829
That's what the doctor said.

1069
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,043
Girl, it really hurts.

1070
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,463
Girl, endure it.

1071
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,384
It's for our future.

1072
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,641
We should finally win
because of these boobs.

1073
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,841
Wait, I think this is wrong grammar.

1074
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,241
One year already...
He's been beating you up...

1075
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,829
-What's the reason?
-Yes, what is it?

1076
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,706
You just get tired one day.

1077
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,467
Just a moment.

1078
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,471
Barbs!

1079
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,349
It's Maumau Zaldriaga.

1080
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,060
-Who?
-The famous couturier.

1081
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,451
My condolences.

1082
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,161
Thank you.

1083
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,169
What's her name?

1084
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,755
Madame, she's Trisha.

1085
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,301
And you are?

1086
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,846
I'm Barbs.

1087
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,349
You're the one who does
the makeup creation?

1088
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,101
Yes, madam.

1089
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,688
Thank you, madam.

1090
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,022
Who is Trisha tonight?

1091
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:28,527
Julia Roberts from Runaway Bride.

1092
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,535
And this is her gown?

1093
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:38,953
Yes, madam.

1094
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:49,715
Is it OK?

1095
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,468
Wow!

1096
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,106
How will you dress the corpse?

1097
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:08,901
What do you mean?

1098
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,113
We can't make the corpse stand.

1099
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:17,910
What do we need to do?

1100
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,954
Cut it at the back.

1101
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:25,876
Madame, it's OK.
We can use the other gown.

1102
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,425
Badong.

1103
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,680
Scissors.

1104
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:10,254
Don't cover the coffin.

1105
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,400
Excuse me.

1106
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,207
What a beautiful transwoman.

1107
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,544
Madam, she's a real woman.

1108
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,928
You're together now.

1109
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,183
You're really meant for each other.

1110
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,111
This is the men's room.

1111
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,113
Why?

1112
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,824
Do I look like a man to you?

1113
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,826
Sir, just use that other toilet.

1114
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:08,580
You're joining me?

1115
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:09,956
Sir.

1116
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,794
Show the lady some respect.

1117
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,379
It's OK, I got this.

1118
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:17,381
OK, sir.

1119
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,676
Thank you.

1120
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,264
Go ahead.
I'll stand guard while you're inside.

1121
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:28,475
Why would you do that?

1122
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,811
To protect you.

1123
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,403
Are you looking for something?

1124
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,532
Are you an angel fallen from heaven?

1125
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,246
Let's talk again...

1126
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,331
after you've split up.

1127
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:53,792
With whom?

1128
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:58,130
The reason why your eyes are sad.

1129
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,717
I've been watching you with your friend.

1130
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:07,723
Stop right there.

1131
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:10,600
Are you drunk? Maybe on drugs?

1132
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,813
You need to know that I have testicles.

1133
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,024
Maybe bigger than yours.

1134
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,026
I'm just good at hiding it.

1135
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,197
Don't guys tell you you're beautiful?

1136
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:26,158
They do.

1137
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:30,203
But guys who think I'm pretty are animals.

1138
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:34,666
If you're one of them, go away.

1139
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,668
I'm only an animal in bed.

1140
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,132
-I'm only an animal in bed.
-Trish?

1141
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,634
Is he doing something to you?

1142
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:47,971
He hasn't done anything to me yet.

1143
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:49,639
Get lost.

1144
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,188
What are you doing?

1145
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:59,232
Just wait a little more.

1146
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,151
How much longer?

1147
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,445
You're too excited.

1148
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,202
-Wait, I'm coming.
-OK.

1149
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,461
-Now, open your eyes.
-Now?

1150
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,346
That's amazing.

1151
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,850
Angelina Jolie was my teenage crush.

1152
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:35,727
I know.

1153
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,897
That's why I copied her face.

1154
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,651
So who do you love more...

1155
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,822
Julia Roberts or Angelina Jolie?

1156
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,160
The one I truly love the most is...

1157
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:00,585
Really?

1158
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:06,383
Your friend might come back.

1159
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,593
We should leave.

1160
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:13,181
We can stay here all day.

1161
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,018
Why bother your friends?

1162
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,062
We could have gone to a motel.

1163
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,107
I'm not hiding you in a sleazy motel.

1164
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,734
I'm serious about you.

1165
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,278
Cut the crap.

1166
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:30,115
The truth is, you're just being cheap.

1167
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:34,411
I gave all of my salary to my wife.

1168
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,705
I have money.

1169
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,333
No, I don't want you to spend.

1170
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:44,421
You might think I'm using you.

1171
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,551
I know...

1172
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,929
I know my place.

1173
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,850
I wanted a straight man for a boyfriend.

1174
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,437
That's why I'm willing to share you.

1175
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,024
It's unfair to your wife.

1176
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:09,446
Imagine if she learns that her rival
is a transwoman.

1177
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,950
I don't even have a vagina.

1178
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,077
I know.

1179
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:19,080
But I fell in love.

1180
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,334
Straight right here.

1181
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,544
-Really? There?
-Yes.

1182
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,087
What can a guy do?

1183
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:36,056
Hide this gift before Jesse comes.

1184
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,522
Is it his birthday, Ma?

1185
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:47,275
It's our sixth monthsary next week.

1186
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,403
Help me cook for him, OK?

1187
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,865
Giddy as a schoolgirl?

1188
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,200
Don't tease me.

1189
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,203
When you fall in love, you'll understand.

1190
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:02,415
Why is he picking us up?

1191
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,334
No reason. He's free today.

1192
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:10,423
I hope you give him a chance.

1193
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,134
He's not going to hurt me.

1194
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:15,679
What?

1195
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,974
You're happy with him. What can I do?

1196
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:30,694
Did you wait too long?
Sorry, traffic's bad.

1197
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:31,778
It's OK.

1198
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:32,862
Get in.

1199
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,832
Let's see a movie after we eat?

1200
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,083
Sure.

1201
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:08,106
You can sleep in the room now.

1202
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,400
He's not coming.

1203
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,318
What time is it?

1204
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,164
OK, go to sleep. I'll just clean up.

1205
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,713
I'll just clean up.

1206
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,303
My feet hurt already.

1207
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,889
Why do you have to wear
high heels every time?

1208
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:28,394
It's been almost a month, Barbs.

1209
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,940
What if something bad happened to Jesse?

1210
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,567
-He's not like that--
-That's false hope again!

1211
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:38,279
He used to answer all my calls.

1212
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,284
Should I go to his house?

1213
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,037
Do you know where that is?

1214
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:50,416
Somewhere in Better Living, Parañaque.

1215
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,169
Better Living, Parañaque, that's it?

1216
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:57,257
So your plan is
to knock on all the houses there?

1217
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:58,967
Good luck.

1218
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:02,470
And if you see his wife...

1219
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,806
you'll act out another
Maricel Soriano film?

1220
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,475
"You are the intelligent one!
The pretty one!

1221
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:08,476
Bitch!

1222
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,271
Cunt! You took everything from me!
Everything!"

1223
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,272
Like that?

1224
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:13,439
That's overacting.

1225
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,608
-Then what?
-Be subtle.

1226
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,694
-Okay, show me how.
-Like Jaclyn Jose.

1227
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,447
"You are the wife.

1228
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,616
I'm just a mistress.

1229
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:25,618
Fuck you!"

1230
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,078
Like that!

1231
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,082
Bitch, always overacting.

1232
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:35,879
Hey, smile.

1233
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,256
He's going to call.

1234
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:42,218
You should be used to waiting by now.

1235
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:44,888
Just relax.

1236
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,140
-Thank you, what time will she arrive?
-Shirley!

1237
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,851
You have a visitor?

1238
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,770
Shirley, why did you let a stranger
come into our house?

1239
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,827
I'm Diana.

1240
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:11,372
I'm Jesse's wife.

1241
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,132
He's been in remission from leukemia
for a year.

1242
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:07,679
But his sickness came back.

1243
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:12,433
It's more aggressive this time.

1244
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,524
He wants to talk to you.

1245
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,113
Just wait for him to wake up.

1246
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,823
I'll be at the lobby.

1247
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,835
Nothing.

1248
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:34,307
Where's Diana?

1249
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:37,810
She went outside.

1250
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:48,905
I thought I wouldn't be able to
convince her to bring you here.

1251
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,703
She knows about us?

1252
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,501
I told her.

1253
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:07,423
I don't understand what's happening.

1254
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:15,640
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

1255
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:25,441
I really thought I was cured.

1256
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:33,324
My sins from the past still haunt me.

1257
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:40,456
I still have a lot to atone for.

1258
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,587
I've done you so much wrong.

1259
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,133
What are you talking about?

1260
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,850
Don't you remember anything?

1261
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:06,107
You really don't recognize me?

1262
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:13,781
I'm a friend of Migs.

1263
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:23,499
I was there the night it happened.

1264
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:39,849
Your turn.

1265
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:43,227
Be quick. So we can all go home.

1266
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:29,565
Meeting you at the bar wasn't an accident.

1267
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,868
I have been following you.

1268
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:45,915
Watching you.

1269
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:54,632
My guilt is killing me
for what we did to you.

1270
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:08,854
So that's why you're so nice to me.

1271
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:19,365
I thought I hit the jackpot.

1272
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:27,999
You're just an asshole like the others.

1273
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:37,592
Please forgive me.

1274
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,472
I don't know what's worse.

1275
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,517
You raping me before,

1276
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,315
or you deceiving me now?

1277
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,449
Is this why you made me fall in love?

1278
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:05,369
Because of your guilt?

1279
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:21,093
I love you.

1280
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:27,308
Are you sure?

1281
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:12,478
I used up all my concealer
on your eye bags.

1282
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:19,860
You look like you're going to
your funeral.

1283
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:21,654
Can you relax?

1284
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:24,573
I know how this ends.

1285
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,492
Always the favorite at the start,

1286
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:29,370
then comes the Q&amp;A, and I'll fail again.

1287
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:34,291
You will really lose
with that negative attitude.

1288
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,545
I want to win. You know that.

1289
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:38,629
Yes.

1290
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,799
That's my only dream.

1291
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,552
To be crowned a beauty queen.

1292
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:47,596
Then, I'll be ready.

1293
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:49,765
Ready for what?

1294
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:51,934
I'll be ready to die.

1295
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:53,769
Idiot.

1296
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:58,691
You haven't met the love of your life
and you want to die?

1297
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:01,360
I'm done with heartbreaks.

1298
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,573
Promise me this.

1299
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:07,867
What?

1300
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:13,998
When I die, I want different makeup looks
during my wake.

1301
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:18,251
Before you bury me. Promise me, OK?

1302
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,172
Trisha, that's nonsense.

1303
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,549
Promise me.
Or I'll come back to haunt you.

1304
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:28,596
And I promise that when you die,

1305
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,556
I'll give you a beautiful make-over.

1306
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,768
I'll dress you fabulously...

1307
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:36,604
in gowns with those high slits.

1308
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,105
I don't want to wear a gown.

1309
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:39,899
I want to wear a Barong Tagalog.

1310
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:41,776
Tomboy?

1311
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,154
Seriously?

1312
01:44:45,278 --> 01:44:47,990
I thought about it.

1313
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:50,075
As they say...

1314
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:53,746
-Kidding!
-C'mon!

1315
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:58,709
So if he's taking it back,

1316
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:03,672
I want to return it to its original form.

1317
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,676
I played with it all my life.

1318
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,554
At the end, I want to honor it.

1319
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:16,727
When I die, I will tell God, "Take a look.

1320
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,938
I made your gift even more beautiful.

1321
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,022
More fabulous."

1322
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:22,483
He will be pleased...

1323
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:27,905
-Girls, come to the studio now.
-OK.

1324
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:29,615
Hurry up.

1325
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:30,950
Remember, confidence.

1326
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:32,910
Give me that, I'll do it.

1327
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,998
For the first night of my wake...

1328
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:44,004
-How ambitious!
-Really?

1329
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,924
Go, they need you now.

1330
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,260
Do your best, girl! Good luck!

1331
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:48,861
We won't allow it.

1332
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:50,946
Why not? We're the family.

1333
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,407
-But you disowned him!
-Can you just stop it?

1334
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:56,911
Why do we have to fight over this?

1335
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,418
I reached out to you

1336
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:10,549
because you have the right to know,
being her sister.

1337
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:14,053
But, I repeat,

1338
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,806
you cannot take her away from us.

1339
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,269
I have plans for her wake.

1340
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:25,731
So do we.

1341
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,943
I've already spoken with our father.

1342
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,695
He wants Trisha to be brought home.

1343
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:34,239
Patrick.

1344
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,077
I won't forbid you to visit him.

1345
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:40,079
But I'll warn you now,

1346
01:47:41,038 --> 01:47:42,790
if you decide to visit him,

1347
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:44,875
-you can't be...
-We can't be what?

1348
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:49,046
You can't be that way.

1349
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,105
For your information,

1350
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:10,859
Trisha wanted to be buried...

1351
01:48:12,778 --> 01:48:14,905
looking this way.

1352
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:17,825
Your sister, Trisha.

1353
01:48:32,006 --> 01:48:36,760
I told you to supervise this.

1354
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:40,389
Why are those still there?

1355
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:43,809
What, Pa?

1356
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:47,771
Those!

1357
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,527
People won't notice.

1358
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:58,866
Perhaps we should leave those there
for now.

1359
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:05,581
I'm not going to let people see him
unless those are removed.

1360
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:09,001
I'll talk to the embalmer.

1361
01:49:13,546 --> 01:49:20,012
Can't we just respect
Patrick's last wishes?

1362
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:24,850
After all, we don't know half of his life.

1363
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:28,937
But he's back with us.

1364
01:49:29,354 --> 01:49:31,023
I want his old self back.

1365
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:33,192
That's only right.

1366
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:42,534
Yes?

1367
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,205
We're here at the funeral parlor.

1368
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:50,209
Maybe tomorrow morning.

1369
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,087
I'll leave you to it.

1370
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:55,172
You can let them know,

1371
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:58,092
but don't invite everyone, OK!

1372
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,116
What did you do to Trisha?

1373
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:27,371
If you really knew your sister,

1374
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:32,793
you would know that she wouldn't
want to be seen looking like that.

1375
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:39,800
I know.

1376
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,764
That's why I'm returning her to you.

1377
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:49,560
What about your father?

1378
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:51,436
Won't he get mad at you?

1379
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,522
I'll handle him.

1380
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:57,025
Just give my sister
the funeral she wished for.

1381
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:15,544
Beth?

1382
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:18,422
Thank you.

1383
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,469
I should be the one thanking you.

1384
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:30,683
Papa might come back.
Leave now before he sees you.

1385
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:32,144
Thank you, Beth.

1386
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,571
I'll make you beautiful again.

1387
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:55,477
This is the last night of Trisha's wake.

1388
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:01,066
I know you're all curious
to see her look for tonight.

1389
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:07,114
I've thought about this long and hard.

1390
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:11,743
As her best friend,

1391
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:15,372
this is how I want you to remember her.

1392
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,170
In her short life,

1393
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,756
she's worn many faces.

1394
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,344
As a daughter,

1395
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:33,598
as a mother,

1396
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:37,185
a friend,

1397
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,814
a girlfriend,

1398
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:44,609
a wife,

1399
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:47,487
and most of all,

1400
01:53:48,613 --> 01:53:50,157
a beauty queen.

1401
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:54,703
Tonight,

1402
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:59,249
I want you to see her simply as Trisha.

1403
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:04,129
Trisha Echevarria.

1404
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:09,551
The most beautiful woman I know.

1405
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:25,283
FOR JOSHUA
