WEBVTT

00:03.580 --> 00:05.350
Wow! You were on fire, Bugaboo!

00:05.450 --> 00:07.790
You never beat a villain
so fast! Pound it!

00:09.460 --> 00:11.460
Bugaboo? Something wrong?

00:12.390 --> 00:14.160
Uh, pound it, yeah. Heh, heh!

00:14.230 --> 00:15.830
Hey! Why not check one more time

00:15.900 --> 00:17.390
that everything's OK in Paris?

00:17.760 --> 00:19.200
Like an extra patrol.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.800
What's going on?

00:20.900 --> 00:22.870
You didn't even scold me
when I said "Bugaboo".

00:22.940 --> 00:25.200
Nothing's going on!
Everything is great!

00:25.270 --> 00:28.010
I just have extra time
and don't feel like chatting.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.870
I know the perfect place
where there's no talking.

00:30.940 --> 00:31.880
I'm all in!

00:32.680 --> 00:35.080
<i> Oh, my darling,</i>
<i> why can't you love me?</i>

00:35.180 --> 00:38.280
- You tricked me!
- Shh! No talking you said!

00:38.380 --> 00:39.820
That's Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.420
<i> I'm keeping too many secrets</i>
<i> from you, Ronaldo!</i>

00:42.560 --> 00:46.520
<i>Stop giving me those puppy eyes,</i>
<i> OK? I'll tell you everything.</i>

00:46.590 --> 00:48.690
<i> I'm leading a double life,</i>
<i> Ronaldo!</i>

00:48.760 --> 00:49.860
Are you kidding me?

00:49.930 --> 00:51.400
Don't tell him anything, fool!

00:51.500 --> 00:52.600
Could you keep it down?

00:52.730 --> 00:54.260
Romantic comedies are lame.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.970
It's totally not realistic!

00:56.070 --> 00:57.570
In real life, she'd take forever

00:57.670 --> 00:58.800
to tell him she loves him

00:58.940 --> 01:00.640
without stuttering, blablabla!

01:00.740 --> 01:02.740
So how could she know
if he loves her back?

01:02.810 --> 01:05.240
So she decides she can never
be with him and<i> bam!</i>

01:05.310 --> 01:08.580
She falls in love with another
guy and it's almost too easy.

01:08.650 --> 01:11.980
No stuttering, they hold hands,
kiss, and then... surprise!

01:12.080 --> 01:15.450
She has secrets!
And he hates secrets, of course!

01:15.590 --> 01:18.460
So they break up and everyone
lives<i> unhappily</i> ever after.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.290
The end. And that's why romantic
comedies are so lame! (Slurps)

01:23.930 --> 01:26.930
- So sorry. We'll be going now!
- (Slurps)

01:27.000 --> 01:28.830
Stay away
from the romantic comedy.

01:28.970 --> 01:32.300
Go for<i> Heroic Heroes 8</i> instead.
Special effects, heroes,

01:32.400 --> 01:33.970
no feelings, no questions!

01:34.070 --> 01:35.970
Nobody talks
'cause there's nothing to say!

01:36.080 --> 01:38.780
That is good entertainment
for sure! Hmm!

01:38.880 --> 01:40.580
(Nervous laugh) Sorry.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.650
Listen, I didn't get everything
you said and know nothing

01:44.750 --> 01:47.850
about your life, but I do know
what heartbreak sounds like --

01:47.950 --> 01:50.620
Heartbreak? Me? Ha, ha!
That is not it at all!

01:50.720 --> 01:53.290
Everything's fine.
In fact, I feel like swimming!

01:53.390 --> 01:55.990
- Let's go to the pool!
- If you ever wanna talk,

01:56.100 --> 01:58.400
- I'm here for you.
- Swimming! Woohoo!

01:59.300 --> 02:00.730
(Sighs)

02:13.210 --> 02:15.280
It's so sad!

02:15.350 --> 02:18.150
I told you we should've
taken those photos down!

02:18.250 --> 02:21.320
Stop! I'm not sad and these
photos don't bother me at all.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.490
They're just shots
of fashion and friends,

02:23.590 --> 02:27.860
and I love fashion and I love
my friends. So, it's all good!

02:27.990 --> 02:31.260
- There's no problem. See?
- Hmm.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.530
So, Marinette's got a problem.
Her heart's been broken.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.500
At first,
she's crazy about Adrien,

02:36.600 --> 02:38.400
but she's never told him

02:38.500 --> 02:41.000
because, well, she's Marinette,
and he's Adrien!

02:41.110 --> 02:44.070
Then comes along Luka.
Marinette can talk to him,

02:44.210 --> 02:47.180
because he's, well, Luka.
So they start dating.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.020
- They were so cute together!
- Yeah, except they broke up.

02:52.950 --> 02:56.850
- He looks super sad.
- Aw.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.890
But the real problem here is
that she never told us anything.

03:00.990 --> 03:04.190
If Luka hadn't told Juleka,
who told Rose, who told MylÃ¨ne,

03:04.300 --> 03:06.600
who then told Alix,
who finally told me,

03:06.700 --> 03:08.900
then I,
her BF in the whole world,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.570
would still be in the dark!

03:10.900 --> 03:13.440
Yesterday, I was in the restroom
and I heard her crying.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.440
Marinette? Have you been crying?

03:15.540 --> 03:19.380
(Sobbing) Me? Crying? Are
you kidding? I'm super happy!

03:19.450 --> 03:23.410
Let's celebrate
and have a party! I'm so happy!

03:23.920 --> 03:26.380
Why is she keeping
all these secrets from us?

03:26.450 --> 03:29.050
If she's not telling Alya,
there's a real problem.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.460
- What do we do?
- She needs an intervention.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.760
Let's all call her up
and see how she's doing.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.990
Rabbit check. Two, two.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.430
(Ringing)

03:42.430 --> 03:45.970
- She's not picking up.
<i> - Marinette. Leave a message!</i>

03:48.370 --> 03:50.740
- ALYA:<i> Hey, Marinette, it's us!</i>
-<i> Hi, there!</i>

03:50.840 --> 03:53.080
<i>We're here if you need to talk,</i>

03:53.180 --> 03:55.580
<i> whenever you want,</i>
<i> wherever you want. Call us.</i>

03:55.650 --> 03:57.680
<i> We love you! Big hugs!</i>

03:59.290 --> 04:01.750
- We gotta do something.
- We need Tikki.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.450
I got this!

04:03.560 --> 04:05.620
Why aren't you using
the talking light box

04:05.720 --> 04:07.820
- to speak to your friends?
- About what?

04:07.930 --> 04:09.590
Everything is fine.

04:10.060 --> 04:12.260
Shouldn't you detransform, then?

04:12.360 --> 04:15.470
No, I'm better off like this.
If Shadow Moth attacks Paris,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.630
I'll be ready for action
at any time.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.440
Yes, but what about Tikki?

04:19.540 --> 04:22.270
She might need to rest a bit,
maybe eat something.

04:22.370 --> 04:24.780
Oh, no! Tikki. Spots off!

04:26.180 --> 04:29.250
- Are you OK, Tikki?
- Better than you, Marinette.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.980
We should have a little talk.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.320
Maybe we should go there.
What do you think?

04:34.420 --> 04:38.690
We'll give her this bracelet,
so she never forgets

04:38.820 --> 04:40.320
we'll always be there for her.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.330
I read that an ancient
South American tribe

04:43.430 --> 04:46.030
did something like this.
You tell a secret to the bead

04:46.130 --> 04:48.970
in your mind. Once Marinette
adds her secret to the bead,

04:49.070 --> 04:51.500
this bracelet
will unite us all forever.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.400
- ALL: Woohoo!
- Ready?

04:55.010 --> 04:57.670
Wouldn't it be more logical
to take her out

04:57.780 --> 05:00.410
and help her work out
her love problems?

05:01.780 --> 05:03.410
OK.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.980
As long as I'm Ladybug, I can't
have loved ones in my life.

05:07.050 --> 05:09.820
- What makes you say that?
- You know why.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.960
I had to break up with Luka
'cause I couldn't be truthful.

05:13.030 --> 05:14.590
It'd be the same with Adrien.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.160
I can't share my secret
with either of them.

05:17.260 --> 05:19.300
I can't be honest
with my closest friends

05:19.370 --> 05:21.160
or my parents about anything!

05:21.230 --> 05:24.770
I'm doomed to be a big liar
to everyone, forever.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.370
What do I do, Tikki?

05:27.470 --> 05:31.380
I wish I could tell you,
but kwamis don't fall in love.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.010
You see? No one can help me.

05:34.110 --> 05:36.150
My life as Marinette
is too complicated.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.220
I should just be Ladybug
all of the time.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.020
Tikki, spots on!

05:42.490 --> 05:44.820
- ALYA: Marinette!
- (Gasp)

05:44.890 --> 05:46.120
Marinette?

05:48.560 --> 05:53.360
Wow! Check this out, girls.
This is new. Aw... it's so cute!

05:53.430 --> 05:55.770
Another one of Marinette's
cool creations!

05:55.900 --> 05:57.870
She must be on the patio.
I'll go get her.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.610
What are you waiting for,
Shadow Moth? Here I am!

06:05.940 --> 06:08.550
- Marinette!
- (Gasps) Spots off!

06:08.610 --> 06:10.180
- Marinette!
- Why are you here?

06:10.250 --> 06:11.680
Just checking in on you, girl.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.320
Looks just like a real house.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.450
Look how the roof comes off!

06:15.550 --> 06:17.750
Don't touch that! Move away!

06:17.860 --> 06:19.320
(Gasp)

06:19.590 --> 06:22.260
- Sorry, Marinette.
- Please leave my room.

06:22.390 --> 06:24.430
Chill out.
It's just a doll house.

06:24.530 --> 06:27.600
- We'll totally help.
- No, you won't! Please go!

06:28.270 --> 06:30.200
OK, there's clearly
something wrong

06:30.300 --> 06:32.800
and we're not leaving you
till you tell us what it is.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.270
Each of us told their secrets
to this bracelet.

06:35.370 --> 06:38.910
- It's your turn now.
- The only problem is you guys,

06:39.010 --> 06:42.110
still hanging out in my room,
which is not cool.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.450
If we're your friends,
you can confide in us.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.150
Real friends don't ever
let each other down!

06:49.460 --> 06:53.190
Well, then, maybe I don't want
you to be my friends. Get out!

07:09.840 --> 07:11.610
(Sobs)

07:12.710 --> 07:15.510
I had no choice, Tikki.
I had to do it.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.450
I know, Marinette.

07:17.550 --> 07:19.620
At least now I won't
have to lie any more

07:19.690 --> 07:22.290
since there'll be
no one to lie to.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.060
Is everything OK? Girls?

07:34.600 --> 07:38.200
Several fragile hearts
that break all at the same time.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.810
What a lovely symphony
for my akumas.

07:48.180 --> 07:51.750
Fly away, my akuma,
and evilise them!

08:02.790 --> 08:04.690
I just lost my best friend.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.430
I really thought it would work.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.200
(Sobs) This is so sad!

08:14.210 --> 08:16.270
(Mutters indistinctly)

08:18.140 --> 08:21.340
This cannot end like this.

08:22.780 --> 08:25.980
Gang of Secrets,
I am Shadow Moth.

08:26.050 --> 08:28.850
Your friend wouldn't
reveal her secrets to you?

08:28.950 --> 08:31.150
I will give you
all the powers you need

08:31.220 --> 08:33.220
to force her to give them up!

08:33.360 --> 08:34.860
All that I want in exchange

08:34.960 --> 08:37.690
are Ladybug and Cat Noir's
Miraculous!

08:37.760 --> 08:40.130
Marinette will stay our friend.

08:40.230 --> 08:42.230
Whether she wants to or not.

08:42.330 --> 08:45.040
And she'll keep
no secrets from us.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.900
(Mutters indistinctly)

08:50.180 --> 08:52.280
I'll be in charge
of capturing her.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.880
I'll force her to reveal
what she's been hiding.

08:54.950 --> 08:57.880
I'll turn back time to return
everything to the way it was.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.420
We'll comfort her
and she'll be our friend again.

09:00.550 --> 09:02.220
And if Ladybug and Cat Noir

09:02.290 --> 09:03.750
try to stand in our way,

09:03.860 --> 09:06.890
Horrificator
will keep them busy!

09:14.900 --> 09:15.900
(Sighs)

09:20.040 --> 09:22.740
I'm here for you, Marinette.
I'm your friend.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.110
You will tell us
all your secrets

09:25.240 --> 09:28.080
and you will feel
so much better!

09:29.010 --> 09:31.050
You really shouldn't be
doing this, Trixx.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.550
Remember the last time
you used your power?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.520
Marinette must not
reveal her secret! Mirage!

09:47.070 --> 09:48.160
How did she... ?

09:50.540 --> 09:53.840
Don't run away, Marinette.
We're friends, aren't we?

09:54.740 --> 09:56.110
Follow me!

10:01.580 --> 10:02.650
Thanks, Trixx.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.950
Tikki, spots on!

10:06.020 --> 10:07.020
Ha!

10:24.170 --> 10:27.100
When a kwami uses their power
without a holder,

10:27.170 --> 10:29.510
doesn't it often
set off a catastrophe?

10:29.610 --> 10:31.680
My power creates illusions,
so the effects

10:31.810 --> 10:34.410
will hopefully just be
in their imaginations.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.280
Oh, come on.
Her Miraculous Ladybug

10:40.350 --> 10:42.720
will make everything
all right anyway.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.320
I hope.

10:46.690 --> 10:47.920
Oh, Trixx!

10:51.060 --> 10:53.330
<i> A strange phenomenon</i>
<i> has hit the Eiffel Tower.</i>

10:53.430 --> 10:56.730
<i> - We advise Parisians...</i>
- I'll bet you a camembert

10:56.840 --> 10:58.870
- that this is Trixx's doing!
- Trixx?

10:58.970 --> 11:03.010
- The kwami of illusion.
- Still, Ladybug needs our help.

11:03.110 --> 11:05.540
Great. Even when I'm not
the one who made the mess,

11:05.640 --> 11:07.380
I still have to help
clean it up!

11:07.480 --> 11:09.010
Plagg, claws out!

11:10.620 --> 11:12.520
Marinette...

11:17.420 --> 11:19.390
Aaah!

11:24.130 --> 11:27.360
Has anyone seen
Marinette Dupain-Cheng?

11:27.430 --> 11:31.270
- Huh?
- Then you'll help us find her!

11:33.340 --> 11:35.070
(Coughing)

11:35.170 --> 11:38.910
At your service,
Princess Fragrance!

11:42.810 --> 11:45.280
She's got to be here somewhere.
Let's split up.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.450
Aaah!

11:59.030 --> 12:02.200
<i>Hey there! Supervillains having</i>
<i> a party and didn't invite us?</i>

12:02.270 --> 12:04.430
They're looking for Marinette.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.570
<i> Haven't we saved her</i>
<i> a bunch of times?</i>

12:06.640 --> 12:08.440
<i> You'd think everyone</i>
<i> would like her.</i>

12:08.540 --> 12:11.570
Apparently, she's alienated
all her friends at once!

12:12.910 --> 12:15.480
<i> - You still there?</i>
- Just thinking.

12:15.580 --> 12:19.580
With five villains, it won't be
easy to find the akuma.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.480
<i>I bet you already have an idea.</i>

12:21.620 --> 12:23.320
I'll isolate one of the villains

12:23.420 --> 12:25.220
and get her to tell me
where it is.

12:25.290 --> 12:28.320
Meanwhile, stop Timebreaker
from going back in the past.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.990
<i> Otherwise she could</i>
<i> really screw up my plan.</i>

12:31.130 --> 12:33.630
- Good luck, Milady.
- Thanks. You too.

12:38.570 --> 12:39.940
Hey, it's been a while.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.970
How's it ticking,
Miss Timekeeper?

12:42.070 --> 12:43.310
It's Timebreaker.

12:43.410 --> 12:44.640
And I don't have a second

12:44.740 --> 12:46.180
to lose talking to you.

12:56.090 --> 12:59.220
Ha! Bummer for you, Ladybug.
I don't have the akuma!

12:59.320 --> 13:02.030
No biggie, I just wanted
to talk to you anyway.

13:02.130 --> 13:04.560
I've got nothing to say to you.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.000
Your friend, Lady Wifi,
is having trouble with Ladybug.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.600
Drat!

13:11.970 --> 13:13.970
Hey!
Don't you want to play any more?

13:14.040 --> 13:17.010
Alya, from what I understand,
you've been having some issues

13:17.110 --> 13:20.680
with your best friend.
Her name's Marinette, right?

13:25.780 --> 13:27.520
I don't know what happened,

13:27.620 --> 13:29.720
but let me tell you
about a friend of mine.

13:29.820 --> 13:33.360
She's a superhero.
You know Rena Rouge, right?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.560
We keep secrets
from one another,

13:35.690 --> 13:37.460
because of my secret identity.

13:37.530 --> 13:40.830
But we still trust each other.

13:40.930 --> 13:43.830
And that's why
we can fight side by side.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.440
You can reject the power
that Shadow Moth gave you.

13:51.980 --> 13:53.680
SHADOW MOTH:
Don't listen to her.

13:53.780 --> 13:56.350
If you do, you'll never know
your friend's secrets

13:56.450 --> 13:57.580
or Ladybug's.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.550
I trust you completely, Alya.

13:59.650 --> 14:02.750
And I need you.
I need Rena Rouge.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.630
Argh! That's... impossible!

14:16.430 --> 14:17.430
Wow!

14:21.340 --> 14:25.070
No one has ever done that.
You're amazing!

14:25.580 --> 14:28.310
It's 'cause you're
an amazing friend, Ladybug.

14:29.180 --> 14:30.580
- Pound it!
- Pound it!

14:32.020 --> 14:34.750
The Gang of Secrets is
looking for you. I'm on it,

14:34.850 --> 14:37.690
but I don't know how long I can
hold them off all by myself.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.060
Lady Wifi has betrayed you.
She chose Ladybug's side.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.860
Hurry up
and seize his Miraculous

14:43.930 --> 14:46.130
so you can take care of the bug.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.600
- Which object holds the akuma?
- It's in a bracelet.

14:50.700 --> 14:54.640
Timebreaker must have it. But
you can't take on four villains.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.310
I think this calls for
the master of illusion!

15:01.080 --> 15:04.110
- Whoa! How'd you do that?
- There have been a few upgrades

15:04.220 --> 15:06.550
since I became
Guardian of the Miraculous.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.590
You're Guardian of the... ?
(Gasps)

15:08.650 --> 15:12.420
Yeah. Keep it on the down low.
Not a word on the Ladyblog.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.820
You know I know
how to keep a secret.

15:20.430 --> 15:22.600
Trixx, let's pounce!

15:37.930 --> 15:40.300
No cataclysm
toe.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.640
We need to hurry!

15:43.470 --> 15:45.100
Lucky charm!

15:56.920 --> 15:58.720
OK, I got a plan. Listen...

15:59.250 --> 16:02.690
The moment you touch it,
who knows what'll happen to you!

16:02.790 --> 16:06.590
Why bother taking it when
I can order you to give to me?

16:06.660 --> 16:08.530
Give them what they want, now!

16:14.470 --> 16:15.540
Mirage!

16:16.710 --> 16:18.240
Cat Noir! No!

16:18.670 --> 16:19.710
Marinette!

16:20.780 --> 16:22.310
Catch her!

16:22.710 --> 16:25.410
No! Take his Miraculous first!
Come back!

16:26.750 --> 16:30.350
Thank you. I was a whisker away
from Cat-astrophe.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.690
That's what friends are for,
my kitty cat!

16:32.790 --> 16:34.820
OK!
You two get to the pool, now.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.960
- And you?
- I'll keep our guests busy!

16:37.030 --> 16:39.760
Rena Rouge will explain
the rest of the plan!

16:50.670 --> 16:53.410
- Argh!
- Seize Ladybug!

16:53.510 --> 16:54.910
Take her Miraculous!

16:55.410 --> 16:57.580
Take care of her.
I'll deal with Marinette!

17:06.020 --> 17:08.920
- Groar!
- You're on, Princess!

17:15.860 --> 17:18.100
It's time to give up
your secret, Marinette!

17:18.230 --> 17:21.730
Soon you're going to do anything
we demand of you, Ladybug.

17:21.870 --> 17:25.240
For starters,
give us your Miraculous, now.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.870
Finally.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.140
There's nowhere to go!

17:35.220 --> 17:36.920
Mirage! Vanish!

17:46.930 --> 17:48.090
Cataclysm!

18:02.280 --> 18:03.940
Thank you, Ladybug!

18:08.880 --> 18:11.150
No more evil-doing for you,
little akuma.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.690
Time to de-evilise!

18:18.290 --> 18:19.330
Gotcha!

18:20.400 --> 18:22.160
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:22.930 --> 18:25.000
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:36.110 --> 18:37.440
Pound it?

18:39.180 --> 18:41.710
- Pound it!
- You've made mistakes before,

18:41.820 --> 18:43.850
Ladybug,
and you'll make them again.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.620
One day,
I<i> will</i> discover your secret.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.320
Let's rest.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.460
Thank you, Ladybug.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.830
You know,
without you and Cat Noir,

18:58.930 --> 19:00.630
I'd not have made it
through today.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.040
I'm really lucky
to have friends like you.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.000
So, thank you.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.510
It's true, breaking up
with Luka broke my heart.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.020
And never being able
to tell Adrien how I feel

19:16.120 --> 19:20.320
is just as painful.
Love is too difficult.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.860
I think... I think
I'm gonna stick to friendship.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.160
That's about
all I can handle right now.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.460
- Take your time.
- It'll all work out.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.830
And whatever happens,
we'll always be here for you.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.330
When you're ready for love,
make sure you tell us,

19:34.400 --> 19:37.170
so we can help you with a sick
new plan to win over Adrien,

19:37.240 --> 19:41.070
- Luka, or whoever!
- (Laughter)

19:41.180 --> 19:43.740
Girls, it's you who I love!

19:45.350 --> 19:48.250
- Bye, Marinette
- Bye! See you tomorrow!

19:50.420 --> 19:53.620
You go ahead. I just have one
last thing to say to Marinette.

19:56.220 --> 19:58.420
You didn't tell us everything,
did you?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.630
A journalist, and a BFF,
can tell these things.

20:04.330 --> 20:07.200
I won't try to figure it out
or force it out of you.

20:07.270 --> 20:10.540
If you can't tell me what's
in your heart, it's your right.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.740
Will we still be friends?

20:14.610 --> 20:18.410
Marinette, I'm your best friend,
and I'll always be.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.050
That's why it kills me
I can't help you

20:21.150 --> 20:23.750
with whatever is
making you feel so alone.

20:24.550 --> 20:25.750
(Sighs)

20:28.620 --> 20:31.260
Alya, wait. Stay.

20:32.090 --> 20:35.130
You're right. I am alone.
More than ever before.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.800
I can barely take it any more.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.660
You know why
I broke up with Luka?

20:38.770 --> 20:40.970
Not because I don't like him.
He's amazing!

20:41.100 --> 20:43.070
But there's something
I can't tell him.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.570
You know why I have to forget
Adrien? For the same reason.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.810
You're right. I keep secrets.
I lie all the time.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.610
I lie to my friends,
to my parents, to everyone.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.250
And the worse thing is
I can't do it any other way.

20:55.350 --> 20:58.750
- There's always another way.
- No, not this time.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.390
I have no choice.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.090
All this is bigger than us,
Alya. Way too big.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.160
If it's too big, two of us
can handle it better than one.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.660
If I tell you,
things will never be the same.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.230
It'll mess up everything,
maybe even destroy it!

21:11.630 --> 21:14.100
Marinette,
I'm your very best friend.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.500
And I...

21:17.170 --> 21:18.440
I'm Ladybug.

21:31.620 --> 21:47.570
(Miraculous theme)
