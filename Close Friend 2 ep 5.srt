1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,200
(Previously)

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,039
You don't want to accept the truth,

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,359
or are you embarrassed about our relationship?

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,160
It's neither.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,800
Wait for a little bit longer.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,609
I'll find the right time to talk to Mom.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
But not right now.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,480
How did these photos get out?

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,879
What do you have to say, Jedi?

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,079
Nothing.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
It's not wrong for people to have secrets.

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,280
He didn't murder anyone.

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,719
Why do we have to hide this?

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,840
I don't care who's the one for you.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm okay with just...

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,640
being close to you, Jedi.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,280
Have you come to a decision?

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,280
I probably won't have the courage to love anyone again.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,799
(Close Friend 2)

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,519
(Is There an Expiry Date for Love?)

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,359
Oh?

22
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,719
Who said I'm going to get it just now?

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,239
Are there going to be any more visitors?

24
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,120
Come on, Phoon. We're home.

25
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,120
Five more minutes.

26
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,400
Five minutes? It's not morning.

27
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,639
Pierce? How did I get here?

28
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,919
I picked you up and drove you home.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
You're way too drunk.

30
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,719
Turn on some music. Turn it on.

31
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,120
Gently. Take it easy.

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,360
I wonder if it was a mistake or a deliberate move

33
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,839
Your every smile and gesture make me feel suspicious

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,800
I wonder

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,960
If it was a mistake or a deliberate move

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,639
The more you look at me the more I tremble

37
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,800
Every word, every greeting...

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm thirsty.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Thirsty...

40
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,039
Here. Drink some water.

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,599
- Drink slowly, okay? - Okay.

42
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,360
I can't open it.

43
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,479
Here.

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
Hey, Phoon! Phoon!

45
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,400
Phoon.

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,080
All right. Let it all out.

47
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,480
- Nothing's coming up. - What?

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
Look at you. Your face is all greasy.

49
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,879
Here.

50
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,399
I'm going to dress you up as Santa.

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,639
- Come on. - What?

52
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,879
Don't squirm.

53
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Why did you bring me back?

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,399
I didn't ask you to.

55
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,800
You didn't. But the owner did.

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,279
Jedi called to ask me to pick you up.

57
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,199
Jedi?

58
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,199
What about Ray?

59
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,040
He's heartbroken right now! Gosh!

60
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,959
Come on, Pierce!

61
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,199
He's as wasted as you are.

62
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,639
But you don't have to worry about him.

63
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,680
Jedi's looking after him now.

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,839
Let's head inside. It's late.

65
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,199
No!

66
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480
No? You're not going inside?

67
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,439
Then where do you want to go?

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,079
I'm going to stay the night at Mom's.

69
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,079
I can call a taxi.

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,920
At this hour?

71
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,120
Won't she punish you if you go there?

72
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,319
She won't.

73
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,360
My mom always understands me.

74
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,959
I tell her everything, unlike someone.

75
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,639
Everything?

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

77
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,680
Including this?

78
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,680
Pierce, what are you doing? I'll hit you! Let go of me!

79
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,639
I'm not scared of you.

80
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,639
You're tiny.

81
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
What are you doing?

82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
Teaching a naughty kid a lesson.

83
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
Pierce! Pierce!

84
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm almost at my limit!

85
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Just a little more.

86
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,600
Pierce!

87
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,439
I can't take it anymore!

88
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,479
Hang in there.

89
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,800
- I have had enough. - A little bit longer. Come on.

90
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,879
- You got this. - My abs hurt.

91
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,839
Almost there.

92
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,680
- Close? - Yes.

93
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,319
- Gosh! - What are you doing, boys?

94
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,279
Oops.

95
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Excuse me.

96
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
Mom! Mom!

97
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,210
Mom! Listen to me!

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,559
Listen to me, Mom! I can explain!

99
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,840
There's nothing else to explain. I understand everything.

100
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,759
And I've seen everything.

101
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,330
What have you seen, Dad?

102
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,679
And if you understand,

103
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,559
why did you walk away from me?

104
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,519
Well, I was shocked.

105
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,240
Mom. Dad.

106
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,519
Phoon and I...

107
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,090
have been together for four years now.

108
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I love him.

109
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,720
And there's no way I'll change my mind.

110
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,399
Phoon has to be a part of my life in the future.

111
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,600
I want you to understand.

112
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,039
Pierce,

113
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
Mom and I have known about this for a very long time.

114
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,919
We were just waiting...

115
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,919
for you to tell us yourself.

116
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,450
And can you...

117
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,759
accept this?

118
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,720
Even if we couldn't,

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,639
would we be able to change anything?

120
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,799
Would we be able to force you to break up with each other?

121
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,639
Technically we could.

122
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,639
But if it meant that you would be unhappy,

123
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,399
I wouldn't do it.

124
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,960
But Mom and I don't agree with you entirely.

125
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,720
We need time to adapt

126
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,519
and take it in as well.

127
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm not an old-fashioned person.

128
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
And you're a grown-up now.

129
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,840
But as parents, we're afraid that you might have to struggle.

130
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,639
We were terribly worried.

131
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,240
I want us to communicate with each other

132
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,200
so that I don't have to make assumptions.

133
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Mom.

134
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,159
Give me a hug.

135
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,279
Typhoon, come here.

136
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Thanks, Dad.

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
See? Easy-peasy.

138
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,080
Are you okay, Jedi?

139
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,879
You keep staring at me.

140
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,919
I'll never get bored

141
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
staring at someone as cute as you.

142
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,759
Silly. Stop staring already. Don't you have work to do?

143
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,799
I don't want to go.

144
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm scared you might overthink things if you're alone.

145
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,200
I won't anymore.

146
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,320
Ray,

147
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,799
don't listen to what other people say.

148
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
Just remember...

149
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,639
that I love you very much.

150
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
Don't forget...

151
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,039
how we first met each other.

152
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,039
Miracles only happen...

153
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,039
with soulmates.

154
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,679
Don't you agree?

155
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,840
Whatever you say.

156
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
It's only been a second, but I already miss you.

157
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,199
(What were these two doing at Jedi's place?)

158
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,158
(Probably shared by the same person, but they changed the profile.)

159
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,080
(Carrying the boy at Jedi's)

160
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,639
It's nothing.

161
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,639
It's okay.

162
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,799
(Why were there drunk kids at your house, Jedi? Who are those two?)

163
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,399
Here.

164
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,240
Where did you find these photos?

165
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,639
Someone sent them to us.

166
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,720
We only have until noon.

167
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,840
If we don't pay them 100,000 for each photo,

168
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,519
they're going to leak them.

169
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Nonsense.

170
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,519
Don't transfer them any money.

171
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
And go to the police.

172
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,679
Good thing Pai isn't here.

173
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
What about you, Pierce and Typhoon? What were you doing at Jedi's?

174
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,759
Typhoon is Ray's friend.

175
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,320
They were just hanging out for a bit.

176
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,720
I don't think that's "a bit".

177
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
What about Pierce?

178
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,799
Pierce just went there...

179
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,679
to pick Typhoon up.

180
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,960
He has nothing to do with me.

181
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,840
But this is stirring up suspicion,

182
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
and the problem won't be over.

183
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,600
It won't...

184
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,480
if there's someone harassing us

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
and taking candid photos like this.

186
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,200
So? Can we get to the root of everything?

187
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,960
It's too late.

188
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,840
Oh dear! How did the photos get leaked?

189
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,039
I thought they said we have until noon!

190
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,519
By now, Pai's probably seen all of them.

191
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,200
I think...

192
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,759
the person who leaked the photos isn't after money.

193
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,080
That's why they've set the price so high.

194
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,960
They probably want to see

195
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
how the company and Jedi would react.

196
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,480
So?

197
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
If you can't give me an answer, you can pack your things and leave.

198
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,639
(Pai)

199
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,039
Hello?

200
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm willing to resign.

201
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,919
I just started working here. I'm still on probation too.

202
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
But it's not fair.

203
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

204
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,120
But it involves work.

205
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,639
It can't be helped, right?

206
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
It's okay.

207
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I'll find the time to talk to Tina.

208
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,440
I feel bad.

209
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,839
Well, I think...

210
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,519
if I try to reason with her,

211
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,200
she'll probably understand.

212
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,759
Excuse me.

213
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
Typhoon, Tina wants to see you.

214
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,650
Tell me what you know

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,890
about Ray and Jedi.

216
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
What's wrong? Are you stressed about the leaked photos?

217
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,559
No.

218
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
I can tell. No need to hide it from me.

219
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,039
Do you have a lot of time on your hands?

220
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,720
Is that why you're taking a stroll around here?

221
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm looking for some inspiration.

222
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,240
Mr. Producer, let me tell you something.

223
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,079
Where there is love, there is suffering.

224
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,319
And where there is content,

225
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,960
there is a song to be written.

226
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,650
It's not funny?

227
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
No.

228
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,200
Seriously though.

229
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,890
It's impossible to be in love and not suffer.

230
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,480
Because everyone has expectations.

231
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,599
And therefore, everyone will change.

232
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,200
If you want to be in love without suffering,

233
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,200
then you have to be able to accept and understand changes.

234
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,680
Don't let love revolve around you,

235
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,359
and don't let yourself be the center of your life.

236
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,759
I came across it. It's the concept behind my new song. So?

237
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
You like it?

238
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,759
Yes, I do.

239
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
I kind of understand.

240
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,519
- So does that mean you don't? - I do.

241
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,759
Anyway,

242
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,119
I get it a lot more now that I've told you about it.

243
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,960
Thanks so much. Cheers.

244
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,720
What's up with him?

245
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,319
Boo!

246
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
Teddy's back!

247
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,650
Teddy actually hurried back home today!

248
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,278
Let's see. Is there anything to eat?

249
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,720
Teddy is starving right now!

250
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,680
Mr. Ray?

251
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,559
Ray?

252
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
He's not here?

253
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,519
Where did he go?

254
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Ray?

255
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,039
Ray?

256
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Miracles only happen with soulmates.

257
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,319
But I guess it'll eventually expire.

258
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,279
Getting to be with you

259
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,799
and be loved by you

260
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,519
felt incredibly amazing.

261
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,039
I don't dare to ask for more.

262
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,319
But I think my time is up.

263
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,039
I don't want to be the cause of your troubles.

264
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,799
I have to go now.

265
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,519
I'm sorry that I didn't give you a proper goodbye.

266
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,599
I don't think I can handle it.

267
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you for the time we've spent together.

268
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,960
I love you.

269
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,720
I will always be part of Jedi's Army.

270
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,759
You have reached the voicemail box of...

271
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,079
The number you have reached is not available.

272
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,519
Please leave a message after the tone.

273
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,039
The flowers reminded me of you.

274
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,720
Us meeting each other

275
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,599
is a miracle.

276
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,599
What do you think?

277
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,279
This is better than the VR, right?

278
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,079
This Jedi is fake.

279
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,518
(BEHIND THE SCENE)

280
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,799
Oh, sorry. It's my fault. I heard it wrong.

281
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,119
- You got it right. - It's me. My bad.

282
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,559
You already got it right.

283
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,038
- That's why they've set... - Set the price so high.

284
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,759
- All right. - From the top?

285
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,599
What? Nobody's pranking you.

286
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,839
(Next episode)

287
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,759
Goodbye, Jedi.

288
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,960
If Ray is interested in doing something, he'll do it

289
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,518
and become entirely focused on it, especially when it comes to Jedi.

290
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,799
Ray, wake up.

291
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,879
- What? - What?

292
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,719
A fan's love for their favorite artist

293
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,759
isn't the same kind of love most people would usually think of.

294
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Let's see how far it can go.
