OVER 500,000 THAIS
HAVE FALLEN ILL DUE TO UNKNOWN CAUSES.

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,708
OVER 100,000 PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT
THE UNKNOWN CAUSES ARE...

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,833
WANDERING SPIRITS

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you doing to me?

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,708
Get rid of it!

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,833
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:43,375
GHOST DOCTOR TV FOLLOWS THE GHOST-BUSTING
STORIES OF A SHAMAN CALLED "MASTER PLA."

8
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:10,583
MASTER PLA HELPS HEAL "ILL PEOPLE"

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,416
FROM ALL CONDITIONS BEYOND EXPLANATION.

10
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:50,083
THIS FILM WAS INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS.

11
00:01:55,208 --> 00:02:00,041
GHOST DOCTOR: THE LOST CASE

12
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,208
Do you really have to film this?

13
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,833
Yes, I do.

14
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,583
Are you trying to catch something from me?

15
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,708
Everything you two did.

16
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,083
You could take me down, too. You know?

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,375
So I need to record this as evidence.

18
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,208
I simply went to work like you'd ordered.

19
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,875
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,666
How the heck would I know?

21
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,625
I'm just seeing you now
since you've returned.

22
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,458
And where the hell is Itt?

23
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,583
So where's the work I asked you to film?

24
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,458
It's here.

25
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,708
And what happened to your eyebrow?

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,625
Nothing.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,250
I have a bit of a problem with Itt.

28
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,333
What problem?

29
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,666
How many times have I told you two
to talk it out when you have problems?

30
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,666
I get that.

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,958
You should ask Itt yourself
what the hell is wrong with him.

32
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,250
I've been waiting for him.

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,166
He hasn't been in the office since
he returned, and he won't answer my calls.

34
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,250
After we got back,

35
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,958
I went to pick him up the following day.

36
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,833
But look at this.

37
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,666
I shouldn't have let you two
go on the field alone.

38
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,125
You can fire me if you want.

39
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,625
I don't want this job anymore.

40
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,208
Let's try this.
Calm down and tell me what happened.

41
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,916
Okay. I filmed everything on this.

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
You can check it out yourself.

43
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,375
Have you already edited
what you're showing me?

44
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,250
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

45
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,625
Which button do I push?

46
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,958
Let me see.

47
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,333
This one here. That's the menu.

48
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,166
-Is that so?
-Yes.

49
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
Wait. Which one again?

50
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,958
This. Here.

51
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,166
How's the new camera?

53
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
It's okay. Pretty light.

54
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,041
Won't the camera keep shaking?

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,750
Hell, no. Even people with Parkinson's
can film with this one.

56
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,041
Wow, too good to be true. Let me try.

57
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,333
Yeah, check it out.

58
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:25,958
Do something.

59
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,791
Want me to do K-Pop moves?

60
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,916
You can? Go ahead!

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Fuck you! I'm not gonna do that!

62
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,833
You're not being very helpful, man.

63
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,083
Can't you see I'm working here?

64
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,833
You only try to look hard-working
on camera.

65
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,916
Whatever!

66
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,083
This is Itt,

67
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,875
a fake-ass crew member of the show

68
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,541
called Ghost Doctor TV.

69
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,958
On this show, we travel
to help people who are disturbed

70
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,625
by mysterious things,
ghosts and supernatural powers.

71
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,333
Let's get to know
this fine young gentleman.

72
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,041
Mr. Itt, what are your roles on this show?

73
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,333
I'm the creative producer.

74
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,458
Wow, creative producer? Sounds awesome!

75
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,166
What is the role of a creative producer?

76
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,083
Well, to stay creative.

77
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,208
Sounds real tough.

78
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,791
How long have you worked here?

79
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,916
Around three months.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,666
Tomorrow will be the first case
we film on our own.

81
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,375
After three months of being a slave?

82
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
Yeah, you can say that.

83
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,708
Okay, do you think
we'll pull through probation together?

84
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,208
Good question. We'll find out soon enough.

85
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,708
But I've heard,
whether we pull through or not,

86
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,291
we'll have to give it our all tomorrow.

87
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,916
We'll be in trouble
if we come back empty-handed.

88
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,916
So you have to be focused

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,416
and not get me into trouble.

90
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,166
You're the one always fucking up!

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,791
Don't say that. Don't get me involved.

92
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,541
Let me try the camera.

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,791
Let me try working with it.

94
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,833
Here you go.

95
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's see.

96
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,125
Hello, Mr. Por.

97
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,875
Hello!

98
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,208
What is your role on this show?

99
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,541
I'm the show's main cameraman.

100
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,250
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow?

101
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,416
Not yet.

102
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,916
Why don't you fucking do it?

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,458
Because I'm testing the new camera here.

104
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,916
You don't deserve to be
the creative producer.

105
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,083
Are you done testing?

106
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,833
Yeah, I am.

107
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,291
Good, now get everything
ready for tomorrow.

108
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,208
Okay.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,333
What will you be filming?

110
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,291
Why do you need this much stuff?

111
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,875
Just in case, you know.

112
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,458
When will you be back?

113
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,708
Don't know.

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,708
Tell me when you'll be back.

115
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,958
I don't know.

116
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,166
-We had a deal. When are you coming back?
-Come here.

117
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,916
So when are you coming back?

118
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,833
In a couple of days, maybe.

119
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,541
We already have plans.

120
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:22,208
I know. I won't be gone
longer than three days, babe. Babe...

121
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,833
Don't. I'm not in the mood.

122
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,250
I'll be away for many days.
Don't you wanna give me some love?

123
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,500
Nah.

124
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,500
Please.

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,333
Please.

126
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,750
Turn off the camera first.

127
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,666
Please.

128
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
Turn off the camera.

129
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,416
Por, turn off the camera!

130
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,291
Whose girlfriend is this? She's so pretty.

131
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,791
What are you doing, Por?

132
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,041
I'm testing the camera.

133
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,250
We're here. Hurry up and get Itt.
You'll be late for work, so hurry.

134
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,125
Do the sexy face.

135
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,458
Hurry, or I'll leave you here,
and you'll have to get a cab to work.

136
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,458
First do the sexy face.

137
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,541
Por, get out!

138
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

139
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,583
My friend is a very loving
and grateful son.

140
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,958
I really want him
to be nominated for Son of the Year.

141
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,458
Plus, his younger sister is super cute.

142
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,750
Por, hurry up!

143
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,875
Okay.

144
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,625
Give her these two antibiotics
before breakfast.

145
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,708
This is paracetamol.

146
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,625
Give her one or two tablets
after each meal. Okay?

147
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,958
Don't forget to give her these,
and easy with the cellphone,

148
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,833
so you can hear Mom when she calls.

149
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,833
I know. Just hurry back.

150
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,166
I will.

151
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,750
Hi, Por.

152
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,166
Hi, Oil.

153
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,875
What the hell are you filming?

154
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,166
Son of the Year nomination video.

155
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,041
-Is your mom dropping you off?
-Burn! No, that's my driver.

156
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,208
Let's roll!

157
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,666
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay. Take care.

158
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,875
Call me when you can.

159
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,083
-Sure.
-Bye.

160
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,875
Does she want to come too?

161
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,083
Fuck you.

162
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,458
Come on. Let's go.

163
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,750
Itt, I'm serious, man.

164
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,916
Why didn't you book first class
or at least something air-conditioned?

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,625
It's fucking hot.

166
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,875
Come on. Don't be so picky!
These were the only seats available.

167
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,750
Itt. Itt.

168
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,000
What?

169
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,916
Film me too so I have evidence
to show Jay that I'm working.

170
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,291
Fucking bastard!

171
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,208
It's 2,500.

172
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,750
Okay, thank you.

173
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,916
You sure it's this way?

174
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,458
I'm sure. It's this way.

175
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,500
From the atmosphere around here,

176
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,416
it seems like we're considerably
far away from any civilization.

177
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,000
This case will be a tough one for sure.

178
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,041
We're close to the scene.

179
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,291
But looking around,

180
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,875
I feel like all the houses are haunted.

181
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,416
Hey, Por. We're almost there.
Can you be serious for once?

182
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,958
Put your work mode on!

183
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,916
Why so serious?

184
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,916
We have to be, or else we'll get told off.

185
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,416
Yo allowed us to work
by ourselves unsupervised.

186
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,916
More like nobody wanted to do this,
especially not Yo.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,250
Always throwing the tough ones at us.

188
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,250
You're so fucking picky.
How did they hire you?

189
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,458
Because they saw potential in me.

190
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,291
Whatever you say.

191
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,375
Do you know which house is his?

192
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,291
He said to keep walking straight,
and we'll find it.

193
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,333
I think it's this one.

194
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,125
Are you sure?

195
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,166
Yeah.

196
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,958
Is anyone living here?

197
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,916
When we arrived here,

198
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,875
I could feel the presence
of wandering spirits in the house.

199
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,208
Shit, what the hell is she doing there?

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,083
You!

201
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,875
Are you Chai?

202
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:33,916
Yeah.

203
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,791
I'm from the TV show you contacted.

204
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,875
Yeah? Where's Master Pla?

205
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,291
Well, Master Pla can't make it here today,

206
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,333
so we arrived here first.

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,583
I see.

208
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,875
Well, come in.

209
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,583
This is where people have seen the ghost.

210
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,291
Oh, is it here?

211
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,375
So I put up a spirit house.

212
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:10,333
My neighbors told me that
they'd seen somebody walking around

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,208
and heard some sounds, like a girl crying.

214
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,125
Have you seen it yourself?

215
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:18,916
Well, never.

216
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,875
But it does feel kind of strange.

217
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,791
No idea why that is.

218
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,500
It feels so suffocating that
I can't sleep inside this house.

219
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,583
What did you do?

220
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,958
Did you collect any weird stuff
or swear to anything?

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Well, no.

222
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,708
But my daughter passed away last year.

223
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm not sure if it's her.

224
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,416
How did she die?

225
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,250
She hanged herself in the storage here.

226
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,333
Do you know why she did that?

227
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,416
Check out what I've brought.

228
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,791
Two brand-new cameras.

229
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,750
This is one.

230
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,458
And that is the other one.

231
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Let's try on this one. What's good?

232
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,416
Sure.

233
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,958
Por, did you bring the camera light?

234
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,083
Fuck! I forgot.

235
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,916
Fuck, you just talk so much!

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,916
How are we gonna shoot in the dark?

237
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,291
It's all right.
This camera can shoot at night.

238
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,750
I tried before coming here.

239
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,458
The picture will be pixelated.

240
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,833
Trust me. If I say it will work, it will.

241
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,583
I can use the flashlight
on my phone and attach it on.

242
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,000
What else have you brought?

243
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,166
Here, I've brought a bunch of GoPros.

244
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,916
We can attach them
where people say they saw the ghost

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,833
and hope we get some freaky stuff.

246
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,500
Good. At least we have those.

247
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,166
When they pay me ten,
I'll perform a hundred.

248
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,291
A little mistake can be fixed.

249
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,916
Don't you get it?
A smart man can always fix problems.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,916
Haven't you heard?

251
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,375
Nope.

252
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,333
Because you've never known shit.

253
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,333
Successful people aren't flawless.

254
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,208
They're judged by how they solve problems.

255
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,375
And that's me.

256
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,500
Hey, Por. Good news for us.

257
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,500
What?

258
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,166
Master Pla still can't make it.

259
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,500
Fucking shit.

260
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
Fuck! Four days?

261
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,333
Fuck me.

262
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,916
This is where we're staying.

263
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,958
And this is where
the daughter hanged herself.

264
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,125
Right next to us. Perfect location.

265
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,708
Guess they wanted to put on a show for us.

266
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,458
And look around.

267
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,583
There's fucking nothing.
Complete darkness.

268
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,791
If something happens to me,
I've no idea what to do.

269
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,166
See anything, Por?

270
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,625
Nothing.

271
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,833
But I know now
why the girl killed herself.

272
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,083
Why?

273
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,416
Look around, man.
There's nothing but banana trees.

274
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,708
I would kill myself too.

275
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,166
Wow, you've got a big mouth.
Be careful what you say.

276
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,500
Let me take that back.

277
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,166
Por! Look!

278
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,250
What?

279
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,166
Who the fuck is that?

280
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,125
I don't know.
Who would take a walk this late?

281
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,541
Do you think it's someone drunk?

282
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,375
Which direction is she coming from?

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,375
I'm not sure. Let's follow her.

284
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,708
Are you nuts?

285
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,000
Duh, idiot. We're here to work.

286
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,458
They didn't hire you
to film your own vlog.

287
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,166
It's so fucking dark.
Why the fuck are we following her?

288
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,375
Just come with me. Stop bitching.

289
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,166
Be careful.

290
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,833
Itt.

291
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,916
Where did she go?

292
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,750
Over there. Can't you see? Hurry!

293
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,791
Shit, is this place dangerous?

294
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,833
There's nothing here. Come on.

295
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,791
Hurry up. We'll lose her.

296
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,708
How far are we going to follow her?
Let's go back, Itt.

297
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,333
No, let's keep following.

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,916
Fuck, it's so fucking dark.
Itt, take me back.

299
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,125
Where'd she go?

300
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
Shit. We lost her.

301
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,416
We should go back then.

302
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,541
Did Itt tell you
we had to stay there for four days?

303
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,916
Yeah, he called me.

304
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,083
I don't know if he was lying
about Master Pla or not.

305
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,250
But I guess he wanted to stay there
as long as possible.

306
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,750
I understand that
he's under a lot of pressure

307
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,375
because he has to take care of
his whole family after his father died.

308
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,458
This job decides his future.

309
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,708
It's getting worse
as it's nearing assessment time.

310
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,125
He wants to do his best on this job.

311
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,291
This is where
the woman disappeared yesterday.

312
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,250
Where could she possibly have gone?

313
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,125
Hey, Por!
What the hell are you doing there?

314
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,041
Nothing. Just checking
on the person we saw last night.

315
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,833
She's over there, dude.

316
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,208
What?

317
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,291
She's at Chai's place.

318
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,875
The lady from yesterday?

319
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,333
Yeah, I guess.

320
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,083
How did she end up there?

321
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,500
How would I know?

322
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,375
What is she doing?

323
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,625
Hanging the laundry, I guess.

324
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,250
Come with me if you want to find out.

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,583
Yeah, I think it's the same person.

326
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,750
Itt, I think you should ask Chai first,

327
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
then casually ask about his wife.

328
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,458
But don't ask him out of the blue,
or else he might not answer.

329
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,333
Fine.

330
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,416
Hello?

331
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,083
Is Chai here?

332
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,166
He's inside the house.

333
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,583
We're here to film a TV show.

334
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,625
Did Chai tell you about us?

335
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:42,916
No, he didn't.

336
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,916
So can we go up to see him?

337
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,375
Of course.

338
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,000
This way.

339
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,583
Shit, isn't their daughter dead?

340
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,125
Are these your daughter's?

341
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,791
Yes.

342
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,166
This one is when she scored 100% in math.

343
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,625
These were what she drew
when she was younger.

344
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:35,958
And this,

345
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,333
she said when she'd improved at drawing,
she would draw me.

346
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,708
So Mommy can look pretty.

347
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,625
She loves English the most.

348
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,583
There's a lot of her writing here.

349
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,500
She's started to speak English now.

350
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,458
How many children do you have?

351
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:07,750
Just one.

352
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,750
She's not back from school yet.

353
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,833
Since today is Friday,

354
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,625
the kids are still playing at school.

355
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,000
They come home late.

356
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,458
I'll get Chai for you.

357
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,208
Thank you.

358
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,625
Is she hallucinating?

359
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,625
I think she's been through a lot.

360
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,166
I think she got messed up badly.

361
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,000
Guess so.

362
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,666
My wife thinks
our daughter is still alive.

363
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,500
But she saw her when she...

364
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,375
She did, but she passed out.

365
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,500
When she woke up,
she didn't remember anything.

366
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,833
Have you talked to her about this?

367
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,291
Yes, but she wouldn't listen.

368
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,333
She still does things
as if our daughter is here.

369
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,208
Have you taken her for help?

370
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,000
I took her to the hospital,
but the doctor said she's fine.

371
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:25,000
I took her to see famous shamans.

372
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,041
We got all these things from them.

373
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,916
They told us to pray to them
every Buddhist holiday.

374
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,458
I followed all their advice.

375
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,166
But Aueng remains the same.

376
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,083
Do you have more questions?

377
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,791
If not, I have to excuse myself
and work on the farm.

378
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,083
No more questions.
Thank you very much, Chai.

379
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750
Are you done?

380
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,125
Just a second.

381
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,458
Here, all done.

382
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,000
Have a look. Is it working?

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,791
Yes, put them there
in case something freaky happens.

384
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,458
There will be something for sure.
Don't you worry.

385
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,791
We'd better interview people around here.
Maybe they'll know something.

386
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,291
Ever experienced strange incidents
near Chai's house?

387
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,208
Yes, I have.

388
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:38,583
What did you see?

389
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,250
I saw it when I was walking at night.

390
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:46,083
I saw a tall, dark silhouette
standing face down under his house.

391
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:49,000
When I walked past the house
late at night,

392
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,791
I heard weird noises from under the house.

393
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,458
But when I turned to look,
nobody was there.

394
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,541
What kind of weird noises, would you say?

395
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,583
Like a door loudly slamming open and shut

396
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:06,000
and something smashing
from under the house.

397
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,875
What do you think
of Aueng's behavior after that day?

398
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,833
I think Aueng sees her daughter's ghost.

399
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,583
What do you think is wrong with her?

400
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,583
She's gone mad.

401
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,250
I guess when her daughter killed herself,

402
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,416
she was so traumatized
that she lost her mind.

403
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,541
You're here for a TV show?

404
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:27,916
Yes.

405
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,916
At what time will it air?
I want to catch it.

406
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,750
Sure, I'll give you a call
about when it airs.

407
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,833
Will I be in it?

408
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,750
Yes, yes. Thank you.

409
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,875
How is it? Is it okay?

410
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:42,875
Okay, I guess.

411
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,416
What else do you want to film?

412
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:50,041
I think that's enough.
There's nobody here.

413
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:51,916
You sure?

414
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,833
Yeah.

415
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,250
After interviewing the villagers here,

416
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:05,375
I know now that
I'm not only facing a ghost,

417
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,750
but I need to prepare myself
to handle a mad person too.

418
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,583
But aren't ghosts and mad people
a match made in hell?

419
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,416
Isn't that right, Itt?

420
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:18,583
Right, my ass. They say only people
with good karma can see ghosts.

421
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:19,500
Is that so?

422
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,583
Yeah, you're not one of them,
so you can't see them.

423
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,458
So that means mad people have good karma?

424
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,708
I guess so.

425
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,958
I'm lucky that I don't have
good karma, then.

426
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,791
Dickhead, mad people are always happy

427
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,666
because they don't care about shit.

428
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,166
They're stress-free. The ones with stress
have to take care of them.

429
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,083
Really?

430
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,083
-Yeah.
-And how's Aueng these days?

431
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,666
Don't you see her condition?

432
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,125
You think she's happy?

433
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,583
And how do you know she's mad?

434
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:54,583
What? Every day of her life,
she still thinks her daughter is alive.

435
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,000
Isn't that called madness?

436
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,583
Fuck that!

437
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,291
Nobody really knows the truth.

438
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,250
Just do what you came here to do.

439
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,875
Why? I just wanted
to share my opinion. That's all.

440
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,666
If you want to share your opinion,

441
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,958
come up with a good name for this episode.

442
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,875
Well, as far as I know,

443
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,333
people who can see ghosts

444
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,875
have brain wave frequencies
that match those of ghosts.

445
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,000
That means...

446
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:28,208
I suppose that works similarly
to radio frequencies.

447
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,083
So the name for this episode is

448
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,958
"Ghost Frequencies."

449
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,541
What do you think?
Do you think the name will work?

450
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,458
I don't think it will.

451
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,333
Why not? It's such a cool name.

452
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,333
You really think
Aueng sees the ghost of her daughter?

453
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,041
She doesn't see shit.

454
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,708
You can't just say that.

455
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,375
Did you talk to someone?

456
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,625
Dude, I'm serious.

457
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,541
Why? Are you scared?

458
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,625
Hell, yeah, I'm scared.

459
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,250
Come on. Don't overthink it.
There's really nothing.

460
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:19,916
Easy for you to say.

461
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,041
Have you had enough? It's almost 11:00.

462
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,958
There's nothing to film now.

463
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,458
Okay. Let me check out
the inside of the house.

464
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,541
If there's nothing, we'll call it a day.

465
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,208
Por, come here and see this.

466
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:44,750
What?

467
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,958
Did you see a person's shadow
inside the house?

468
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,416
That's probably Chai.

469
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,916
I don't think so. Chai's not here.

470
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,666
-Should we go in and get it on camera?
-Is that a good idea?

471
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:31,916
Let me get the camera.

472
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,708
Wait, Itt.

473
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,208
We should wait for Chai to come back.

474
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,416
It's fine.

475
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,625
I'll go film upstairs. You go downstairs.

476
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,750
Itt!

477
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:55,750
Itt!

478
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,041
Fucking Itt!

479
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:00,666
For fuck's sake!

480
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,166
Where'd she go?

481
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:07,583
Fuck!

482
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,750
Shit!

483
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,791
That's my daughter.

484
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,333
Shit!

485
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,291
Shit!

486
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,875
Por, you bastard,
you didn't fucking wait for me!

487
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,583
Did you see something?

488
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,041
See what? What's wrong with you?

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,208
Look here.

490
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,291
What?

491
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,500
There's something right there.

492
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,791
It's their daughter's ghost.

493
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,916
The spirits of people
who die unnaturally go adrift.

494
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,000
They don't have a reincarnation.

495
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,208
Did you know Chai's daughter?

496
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:58,125
My daughter was Nhoonee's classmate.

497
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,000
I think they were friends.

498
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,458
But when I asked her,

499
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:05,208
she said she didn't know anything
and she didn't want to talk about it.

500
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,291
Were you there at the scene
when they found her body?

501
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,916
Yes, but I had a bad feeling
since the night before.

502
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,666
Suddenly, there was
a barn owl flying near their roof.

503
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,000
It wouldn't stop hooting.

504
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,041
The next day, she hanged herself.

505
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,166
When I saw her, her neck came right off.

506
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,166
Today is day three.

507
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,000
The situation here is
starting to get unusual.

508
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,000
I think the daughter really is here.

509
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,958
And today is Saturday,

510
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:42,583
she's probably playing
and running around here.

511
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,916
Por, I have something to tell you.

512
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,208
Last night, I went into her room.
I got this from there.

513
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,375
What is it?

514
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,541
I guess it's her diary.

515
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,666
Shit, Itt!

516
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,708
You've gone too far.

517
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,833
Why?

518
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:01,583
If you don't respect our hosts,
at least respect the ghost.

519
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,166
What's the big deal?
She's already dead. She won't use this.

520
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,250
How can you be so sure?
Be careful. You'll get screwed.

521
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,416
You know what will really get us screwed?

522
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,458
What?

523
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,416
If we go back empty-handed.

524
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,708
That's the real trouble.

525
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,041
You should be thanking me.
I'm helping you out here.

526
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,250
What did she write in that?

527
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,500
Not sure.

528
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,875
I think

529
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,750
she liked drawing.

530
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,291
Have a look.

531
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,583
Can we make any use of it?

532
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,000
Don't know. I have to see inside.

533
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,500
If she hadn't killed herself,

534
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,416
she would have been a great cartoonist.

535
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,000
Look, there's a photo.

536
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:53,208
Fuck! The face is completely ripped up.

537
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,541
Must have been her ex-boyfriend.

538
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,833
Should we ask this guy in the picture?

539
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,875
Maybe we'll get some details about her.

540
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,041
But his ex-girlfriend killed herself.

541
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:07,708
Dude, don't assume things on your own.
Let's try asking the guy first.

542
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,041
If he doesn't talk,
we'll find something else.

543
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,541
And do you know where he is?

544
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,416
We can ask the daughter
of that lady we interviewed yesterday.

545
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,708
She's her friend.

546
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,666
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Don't you remember?

547
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,666
No, dude, it's not my job.

548
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,041
Excuse me.

549
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,250
Were you friends with Nhoonee?

550
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,791
Yeah, why?

551
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,750
Can I ask you something about Nhoonee?

552
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,291
Did Nhoonee ever ask you for any advice?

553
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:44,791
No.

554
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,416
Have you seen this guy?

555
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,750
Where did you get this picture?

556
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,666
They used to date.

557
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,500
I introduced them myself,

558
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,583
hoping that their lives
would be better, but...

559
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,125
nope.

560
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,333
Do you know where this guy is?

561
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,333
He helps his father
sell noodles near here.

562
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,500
Where?

563
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:17,833
Just a short walk from here.
There's only one noodle shop.

564
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,958
Is this the guy?

565
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:22,375
I think so.

566
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,791
But I think we shouldn't mess with him.

567
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,708
Come on. It shouldn't be a problem.

568
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,125
Hi, bro!

569
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,666
We're here to film a TV show.

570
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,958
We want to ask you about Chai's house.

571
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,666
-What do you think you're filming?
-Bro!

572
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,416
-What are you filming?
-Wait!

573
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,000
What the fuck are you filming?

574
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,208
Bro, calm down a sec.

575
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,708
Fuck you, I'm not your bro!
What are you filming?

576
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,666
Calm down.

577
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,000
-Fuck you! What are you filming?
-Calm down, brother.

578
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,041
-Don't--
-Fuck off.

579
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,791
-I asked why the fuck you're filming me!
-Calm down.

580
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,750
You're here to film a TV show?

581
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:58,666
Yes.

582
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,541
Why are you messing with that guy?

583
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,750
We wanted to ask him about Chai's house.

584
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,750
About what?

585
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,875
About his daughter.

586
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,833
That ended a long time ago.

587
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,125
They concluded that it was a suicide.

588
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,875
Nobody knows why she did it.

589
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,083
You two, why are you messing with him?

590
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,166
Hello, Yo.

591
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:23,291
-Look at the chaos you created.
-Well, we've got a bit of a problem.

592
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
-Nothing to see here.
-I'll have Itt call you back.

593
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,291
Okay, thank you.

594
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,208
Go.

595
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,541
How is it? Is the camera intact?

596
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,500
It's flickering.

597
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,916
You tell Yo what happened.

598
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,916
Okay, I'll talk to him.

599
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,625
It's no big deal to him.

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,625
Yeah, he won't yell at you,
but he'll yell at me.

601
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,333
Plus, it's a new camera.

602
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:52,208
What happens in the end?
I have to work for free.

603
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,416
Screw that. It was an accident.

604
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,250
Don't be such a little bitch!

605
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,791
I told you! Didn't I tell you
nobody wants to talk about it?

606
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,333
Yeah,

607
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,583
but I think he's guilty of something.

608
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,916
He couldn't answer a simple question.

609
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,125
Probably knocked the girl up
and didn't want to take responsibility.

610
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,375
You have to be careful.
This is not a place we're familiar with.

611
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,583
If anything happens, no one will help us.

612
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,833
Yeah.

613
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,291
Fuck. There's a bunch
of missed calls from Yo.

614
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,083
Shit. Let's head back
before I call him back.

615
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,041
Did Itt tell you
we almost got into trouble?

616
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,583
Yes,

617
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,750
but, after that,
I told you guys to leave that place.

618
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,000
Did you?

619
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,833
Itt didn't tell me that.

620
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,833
I told him to come back
if it's too dangerous.

621
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,666
But Itt said you two
wanted to stay and finish the job.

622
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,583
Wait. I didn't say anything of the sort.

623
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,041
Really? That's what Itt told me.

624
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,708
Yes, boss. Well, we...

625
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,041
Yes.

626
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,166
What did Yo say?

627
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,125
Nothing.

628
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,541
He said we've filmed
sufficient material in Chai's house.

629
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:25,916
I told you so.

630
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,625
How's that? He told you off, didn't he?

631
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,833
What the hell are you looking at?

632
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,833
Let me see.

633
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,666
Can't you see I'm using this right now?

634
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,208
What are you so upset about?

635
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,666
Mind your own fucking business.

636
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,375
Have you checked
the cameras inside the house?

637
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,375
What's the purpose
of putting them up if you haven't?

638
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,791
Every time you get told off,
you always take it out on me.

639
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,375
What the fuck?

640
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,416
Hey, Itt!
Itt, where are you going? Wait up!

641
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:28,708
Hey, Itt.

642
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,625
Are you really going up there?

643
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:43,083
Fuck, whose footprints are these?

644
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,375
Itt, there are so many footprints here!

645
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,000
We should go back, Itt.

646
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:57,750
Itt!

647
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:10,666
Fuck!

648
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,083
Itt, let's go, please.

649
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,583
Itt!

650
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,375
Itt!

651
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,375
Itt, I can't take this anymore.
Itt, let's go!

652
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,541
Itt, did you see that?

653
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,916
Itt, let's leave!

654
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,375
Itt!

655
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:54,083
Itt, I really can't do this!

656
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,416
Itt, let's go.

657
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,625
Don't fuck with my mother!

658
00:41:58,708 --> 00:41:59,541
Fuck!

659
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,333
-I will take my mom with me!
-Itt.

660
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,625
Get out!

661
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,041
Fuck!

662
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,750
Fuck! You see? I told you not to go up.

663
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,666
We're screwed.

664
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,625
Are you okay, Itt?

665
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,333
Don't you fuck with me.

666
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,750
I'm already scared shitless.

667
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,458
What the fuck is wrong with you, Itt?

668
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,583
The time now is 2:00.

669
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,833
Itt has disappeared out of the blue.

670
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,333
He's not at Chai's.

671
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,583
Why did you leave me
all alone, fucking Itt?

672
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:01,958
I'm scared as fuck.

673
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,250
Where the fuck did Itt go?

674
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,625
Why don't you pick up the phone, Itt?

675
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,833
Itt!

676
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,166
Itt!

677
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,250
What the hell are you doing there?

678
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,833
Itt!

679
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:08,958
Are you okay?

680
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,333
Itt.

681
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,708
Itt, what the fuck are you filming here?

682
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,208
Itt. Stop shooting, man.

683
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,791
Shit, are you okay?

684
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,666
Let's see what Itt shot.

685
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:07,958
Itt!

686
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,416
Itt!

687
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,458
Itt, what the fuck are you filming here?

688
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,000
Itt. Stop shooting, man.

689
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,416
Shit, are you okay?

690
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:40,000
Itt started to change from that moment.

691
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,625
I don't know what had gotten into him.

692
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,125
How was he?

693
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,958
He'd get mood swings.

694
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,625
He was like a roller-coaster.

695
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,000
Sometimes, I couldn't tell
what his mood was.

696
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,041
After that night, he became very quiet.

697
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,625
Like he was mad at me or something.
He wouldn't talk to me at all.

698
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,958
Itt, I think that's enough.

699
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,541
Let's go home.

700
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,500
We can't leave yet.

701
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,166
Or we can go stay somewhere else.

702
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,208
We can come back here
when Master Pla comes.

703
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:31,166
If we stay somewhere else,
how are we going to film?

704
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:33,791
Then give me the camera.

705
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,791
I'll go outside
and shoot some footage myself.

706
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,791
And don't forget
to return that book to her.

707
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,500
There's definitely
something about that house.

708
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,416
We're going through this together,

709
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,750
but instead of helping...

710
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,333
Something is fucking wrong with Itt.

711
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,500
I guess he's in his work mode.

712
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,833
I really want
to ask you guys at the office

713
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,625
if you hate me or anything.

714
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,000
Why did you send me to this place?

715
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,791
I have to go back and check on Itt.

716
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,541
I wonder how Itt is doing.

717
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,625
Fuck, you're still sitting
in the same spot?

718
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,958
Itt, you haven't returned that yet?

719
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,000
Do you hear me?

720
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,458
Have you had enough?

721
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,166
Where are you going?

722
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,833
Itt!

723
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,416
What the fuck is wrong with you?

724
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,083
Itt!

725
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,541
What are you looking at?

726
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,750
Itt! Where are you going?

727
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,625
Not again!

728
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,083
Itt!

729
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:50,791
Itt!

730
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:52,916
Can you hear me?

731
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,000
Itt!

732
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:58,125
When are you gonna stop following her?

733
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,833
It's our last night.

734
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,250
But you've already got enough footage.

735
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,375
Our boss will be so pleased.

736
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,708
Trust me.
He'll definitely let us pass probation.

737
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,375
How would you know?

738
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,500
I'm the one who filmed all this footage.
Why wouldn't I?

739
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,666
If the footage is not enough,
you'll be responsible.

740
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,916
You ass! I'm not going with you.

741
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Itt, how will you film without a camera?

742
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,708
For fuck's sake. What the fuck?

743
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,833
What is she doing at the school?

744
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,416
Itt, don't follow her.

745
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,166
Do you hear me?

746
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:52,541
Shit.

747
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,833
What is Aueng doing up there?

748
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,166
Who is Aueng coming to see?

749
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,333
Who is Aueng talking to?

750
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,333
Why aren't you home?

751
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,250
I've already told you...

752
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,500
Don't you argue with me.

753
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,416
I told you to come home.

754
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,708
Why aren't you coming?

755
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,458
Come home!

756
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,208
Goddammit!

757
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,250
Where are you going?

758
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,583
I'm fucking leaving.

759
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,625
And you? Are you leaving or staying?

760
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,333
If you're staying,

761
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,625
there are the cameras,
and you help yourself.

762
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,791
At that moment,
I couldn't take it anymore.

763
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:24,000
All I could think was,
I had to get out of there ASAP.

764
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,625
I didn't care
if I was pissing anybody off.

765
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,166
And so you just ditched your friend?

766
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,583
I guess so.

767
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,875
If he wanted to shoot so much,
he could stay and do that himself.

768
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,875
But in the end, I couldn't.

769
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:38,041
I tried to drag him out.

770
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,916
But when I went back
inside the room, he was gone.

771
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,125
Itt!

772
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:26,416
Itt!

773
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,000
Itt, what's wrong with you?

774
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:31,708
Shit, Aueng!

775
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,250
Aueng!

776
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,625
Aueng! Aueng!

777
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,708
Aueng! Aueng!

778
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,916
Itt, give me a hand!

779
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,833
Itt!

780
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:50,750
Hey, Itt,

781
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,666
what the fuck is going on?

782
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,250
Why is Aueng trying to kill herself?

783
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,833
Answer me!

784
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:06,500
Itt!

785
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:09,708
Itt,

786
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:12,416
talk to me!

787
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,166
Why are you back?

788
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,041
Why are you saying that?

789
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:22,625
Why the fuck do I have to be
in a situation like this?

790
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:23,583
I don't know.

791
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,958
I don't know how she got in there.

792
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,166
Damn it!

793
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:41,291
When Aueng gained consciousness,

794
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:45,791
I asked her about hanging herself. She
said she didn't know what was going on.

795
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,791
Next thing she knew, she was up there.

796
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:49,708
She's lucky that we found her.

797
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,833
Otherwise, she would be much worse.

798
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,000
And Master Pla?

799
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,125
The next morning,
Master Pla performed the ceremony.

800
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,416
Put your hands together.

801
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,000
Get a grip on yourself.

802
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,375
Keep your hands together.

803
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,833
Aueng.

804
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,458
Okay, untie this.

805
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,375
Why did you accept all these child dolls?

806
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,583
They said they would help.

807
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:22,500
For Christ's sake,
how can these dolls help you?

808
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,875
All these sodas you get for them,

809
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,291
they can't even get it themselves.

810
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:31,333
All this stuff, it's not just
for the rich. It's for the dumb too.

811
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:34,791
Get it? I'm not trying to insult you,
but be more logical next time.

812
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,875
You wouldn't have kept them otherwise.
These are devilish, not auspicious at all.

813
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,708
There's too many.
What fell didn't jump out by itself.

814
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,750
Someone broke them.

815
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,000
You think some kind of miracle happened,
but there's no miracle.

816
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:50,916
Tell me why.

817
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:55,583
My neighbors say
they see a ghost around here.

818
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:57,208
Do they know who the ghost is?

819
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:58,666
I don't know.

820
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:00,041
Has it been here long?

821
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:02,125
About a year now.

822
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Your daughter hanged herself a year ago?

823
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:05,500
Yes.

824
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,291
And what is this little spirit house?

825
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,916
A shaman told me to build it.

826
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,125
For what?

827
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,833
For my daughter to live in.

828
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,833
So you let your daughter live in here

829
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:18,333
instead of letting her go?

830
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,000
Why keep her here?

831
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:24,166
Building a spirit house isn't the way out.

832
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,541
Your daughter's ghost can't reincarnate

833
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:30,125
because she has to stay here.
She has nowhere to go

834
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,541
because she's attached to this house.

835
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:36,208
I see all these termite hills
around the house.

836
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:39,000
Why are you worshipping them?

837
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:42,041
The shaman said they're holy.

838
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,291
What's the name of this holy being?

839
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,666
Grandpa Jomthong.

840
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,833
Yeah, right. Some holy grandpa wouldn't
want to live in this stupid termite hill.

841
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:38,041
What did Master Pla say?

842
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,708
He said the house was haunted
by wandering spirits.

843
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,125
And he did his ceremony.

844
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,458
And were Chai and his wife better?

845
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,250
It seems like it.

846
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,083
And your friend?

847
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:01,041
Finally, we can go home.

848
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,958
I've never been this happy before.

849
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:10,791
Look at Itt.

850
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,875
We're going home, and he isn't happy.

851
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,875
Guess he wanted to stay on a bit longer.

852
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:21,708
I was the one who helped him,
and I don't even get a thank you.

853
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,916
Don't you have to return all this stuff?

854
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,541
No rush. I can do it tomorrow.

855
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,291
Anyway, I have to pick up Itt.

856
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,500
He can help me carry all this.

857
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:42,125
How was work? Did you have fun?

858
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,125
Yeah.

859
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,083
Tell me, what did you see?

860
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,125
No, I don't feel like it.

861
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:51,291
Are you going to tell me or...

862
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,291
Do you really want to know what I saw?

863
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,750
I saw a horny ghost!

864
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,375
You freak. Stop teasing me.

865
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,625
What is Itt doing? Is he coming out here?

866
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,083
I'm always late because of him.

867
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,583
Probably up missing Aueng all night.

868
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,166
Guess I should get out.

869
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,541
See what he's up to.

870
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,750
Itt.

871
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,583
Itt.

872
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,875
Are you coming to work? We're late.

873
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:34,625
Hi, Por.

874
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,708
Itt is inside, feeding Mom.

875
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,750
Is he coming to work?

876
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,833
I don't know. Something's up with him.

877
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,041
Can you check on him?

878
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,541
Hi, Mom.

879
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,208
Hey, Itt, you're making a mess!

880
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,750
Itt, enough.

881
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,666
I'll take care of it.

882
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,833
What the heck is wrong with you?

883
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:04,708
See?

884
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,375
What's wrong with him? He isn't talking.

885
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,375
Let me go talk to him.

886
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,125
Itt.

887
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,208
Itt,

888
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,166
what's up with you?

889
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,291
Are you okay?

890
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,875
Shit, why do you still have her stuff?

891
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,333
I'm going to throw it out.

892
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,458
That's what happened.

893
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,250
Do you get it now?
I don't know what's wrong with him.

894
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,041
Try calling him.

895
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,791
Let me speak to him.

896
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:57,958
Good idea.
You can talk some sense into him.

897
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,291
Hello?

898
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,541
Is that you, Oil? Where's Itt?

899
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,250
In his room, I guess.
He left his phone here.

900
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,375
How is he? Still going insane?

901
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:15,666
He's still bummed out.
Do you want to talk to him?

902
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah, let me talk to him.

903
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,750
Okay. I'll get him for you.

904
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:37,000
Itt, it's Por on the phone.

905
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:42,708
How's it going, Oil?

906
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:45,458
Itt!

907
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:53,541
Shit!

908
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,250
Oil, what's wrong?

909
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,166
The power went out.

910
01:03:58,625 --> 01:03:59,625
Is Itt there?

911
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,500
Nope.

912
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,291
I have to go check on Mom.

913
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,750
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

914
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:16,958
Watch your step.

915
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,375
Mom, the power is out.

916
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,000
I'll go check the cutout switch.

917
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,541
What's wrong, Mom?

918
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:47,375
I think we should go to his house!
Something's not right.

919
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,666
You go. If something's up, just call me.

920
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,750
What? Don't you think you should
take care of your crew?

921
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,375
I'm busy. I've got work to do.

922
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,750
You're such a dick.

923
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,000
Watch your mouth. I'm your boss, prick!

924
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,541
Fine, I'll go by myself.

925
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:06,875
And don't forget to show
your boss this tape. I quit!

926
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,125
I really don't want to go in.

927
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,458
But he's still my friend.

928
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,250
Guess I have to go check on him.

929
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,750
If something happens to me,

930
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,875
please check this tape.

931
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:35,875
Itt!

932
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:38,458
Itt!

933
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,333
Itt!

934
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:48,916
Itt, where are you?

935
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,041
Fuck!

936
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,125
What's happened, Itt?

937
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,583
Itt!

938
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,208
Oil!

939
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:11,708
Oil!

940
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:17,250
Itt!

941
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,833
Where are you?

942
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,041
This is not funny.

943
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,291
Itt!

944
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,333
Oil!

945
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,708
Itt! Are you upstairs?

946
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,375
Itt!

947
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:10,083
Stop messing around. I don't like this!

948
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:11,000
Itt!

949
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,666
Itt! Itt!

950
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:38,916
Itt!

951
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:53,791
Itt!

952
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:57,583
Itt! Where the hell are you?

953
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:02,666
Itt!

954
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,625
Itt!

955
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,208
Itt! Itt!

956
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:27,625
Itt!

957
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:44,791
Itt!

958
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:17,000
Can we conclude that
there was a ghost there, Master Pla?

959
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:20,500
We can't conclude
whether there was a ghost or not

960
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:23,666
because we don't have
any evidence to prove it.

961
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,000
People can argue all day about this.

962
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:29,208
For those who believe there was,
there was.

963
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,166
For those who don't
or who didn't see it, there wasn't.

964
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,000
My job was to help this family

965
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:42,125
be free from the thing
that couldn't be seen but existed,

966
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:45,208
to bring their lives back to normal.

967
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,166
That's the mission I had to complete.

968
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:51,708
But it can't be proven
if there really was a ghost in that house.
