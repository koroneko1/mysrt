But, for the moment,

That's carbs and sugar.

What a revelation.

201
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,449

None of your bleeping business.

It's an iPhone.

Good luck getting a signal.

yourself-Well, anything.

269
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,765
Whatever you get will be
a serious improvement.

270

-What?

274

She was a grade one A-hole with
a severe attitudinal problem.

You will never get away with
that uniform for start,

281
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,086
and FYI, no drinking,
no smoking, no alcohol,

282
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,798
no fireworks,
no dangerous weapons,

283
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,466
no illegal drugs.

284
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,301
If you have a problem
with someone,

285
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,469
no random bitching.

286
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,762
Structure your point.

287
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,223
No Web-surfing, no bullying.

288
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,266
So, if you behave like
an asshole, we all suffer.

289
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,395
So do not get us in your shit,

-Hi, Kate!
-Hello.

292
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,110
What are you, like, prom queen
or something?

293
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,863
Kate's got
a terrible affliction.

294
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,698
You're actually lucky
that you don't have it.

295
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,907
It's called "popularity".

296
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,450
Hey, get up.

297
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,702
Wait for Mrs. Kingsley
and the prefects.

298
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,161
Screw them.

299
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,584
That is physical abuse!
I'm calling my lawyer!

300
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,918
With what?

301
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,172
Well, hello, Freddie.

302
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:27,134
How kind of you to grace us
with your gorgeous presence.

303
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,765
And cue Harriet

308
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,987
I love that Freddie's always
here at the beginning of term.

309
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,741
It's such a perfect
welcome back.

310
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,868
So, who is Freddie?

311
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,119
Mrs. Kingley's son.

312
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,704
Devastating heartthrob.

313
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,996
Won't look at any of us
since he got caught

314
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,749
playing doctors and nurses

315
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,041
with a girl in the third grade
when he was 11.

316
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,628
Massive hoo-hah.

317
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,087
They're not together now,
though.

318
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,380
Because of her massive hoo-hah?

319
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,299
(all laughing)

320
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,594
No. Fraternizing is forbidden.

321
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,639
Here you go.

322
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
I can't eat this.

323
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,812
Anorexia or bulimia.

324
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,772
Because if it's bulimia,
I'd rather you didn't

325
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,523
eat other people's birthday cake
on their birthdays.

326
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,317
It's such a waste.

327
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,237
Actually, I'm a pescetarian
Monday through Wednesday,

328
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,072
fruitarian Thursday
through Sunday,

329
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,658
and vegetarian always.

330
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,075
Oh.

331
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,829

00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,673
Don't try and hide it, honey.

502
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,883
We've got ourselves a SULA.

503
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,304
Sweaty Upper Lip Alert.

504
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,306
(girls giggle)

505
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,556
Oh!

506
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,394
How on earth did Freddie
know her name?!

507
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,062
You may depart.

508
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,315
But, um, I still have
to turn down your bed.

509
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,691
-Get out!
-(sobs)

510
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,901
Oh!

511
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,196
I don't understand.

512
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,823
Freddie's got a crush on me.

513
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,825
Why was he looking at her?

514
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,328
He was looking at her
so he didn't come across

515
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,454
as looking at you.

516
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,498
He needs to be careful.

517
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,957
He can't get caught.

518
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,126
Yeah, and if he
looked at you too much,

519
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,752
he wouldn't be able
to control himself.

520
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,798
Like, when I have to look sad,
I think about...

521
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,842
...horses being slaughtered.

522
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,720
So, to Freddie,
Poppy's the equivalent

523
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,762
to a slaughtered horse.

524
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,848
You're probably right.

525
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,393
But we're going to have
to do something

526
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,978
about little Miss U.S.A.

527
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:08,025
She needs a lesson in exactly
who's boss, me thinks.

528
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,361
(both) We think so, too.

529
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,655
I didn't start it,
it wasn't my fault.

530
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,992
-Go out and close the door.
-But you asked to see me!

531
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,537
Yes. Well, you have
to knock before you enter.

532
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,579
I can't believe it.

533
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,581
This is all horse face's fault.

534
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,084
(knocking)

535
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,544
Who is it?

536
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,214
-Jesus Christ.
-Oh, dear.

537
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,258
We were led to believe
you had a beard and sandals.

538
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,552
Now we'll have to change
that stained glass window

539
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,136
in the school chapel.

540
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,389
Look, I didn't start it,
it wasn't my fault,

541
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,640
and if this were America,
I would sue.

542
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,351
That girl is a grade one A-hole,

543
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,520
with severe attitudinal
problems.

544
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,897
I know perfectly well
what happened, Poppy.

545
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,815
Then why isn't
Harriet here, too.

546
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,985
Because, unsurprisingly,
it's you I want to talk to.

547
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,364
Look, I know it's very difficult

548
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,657
being the only new girl
in your year.

549
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,077
You mean the only normal girl.

550
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,621
What do you like to read, Poppy?

551
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,418
"OK Magazine," "People,"
"US Weekly."

552
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,670
Well, might you be able to
tackle such a thing as a book?

553
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,298
I prefer movies.

554
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,383
Well, my personal library
seems to be missing

555
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,718
the book version
of "Freaky Friday."

556
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,011
(scoffs)

557
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,181
So perhaps you might try this.

558
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,267
Oh, my uncle's producing
the film version.

559
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,896
"Alice in Wonderland"
was originally a book.

560
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,609
You might surprise yourself
and actually enjoy it.

561
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,026
This is my punishment?

562
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,403
(scoffs)

563
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,113
This school is so weird.

564
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,949
What do you want to get
out of this school, Poppy?

565
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,909
To get "out" of this school.

566
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,329
You know, this school
has produced

567
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,456
absolutely nobody of note.

568
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,999
Our leading light was the girl

569
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,959
who was
Princess Diana's foot doctor.

570
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,380
So, if your aim
is to make pages of "Us Weekly",

571
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,091
then isn't the place for you.

572
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,759
What we do produce is smart,

573
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,262
independent, free-thinking,

574
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,806
good-hearted girls,

575
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,892
who remain friends for life.

576
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,396
The kind of girl that,
behind all your wisecracks,
I know you are.

577
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,276
Run along now, I must get on.

578
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,403
My in-tray is piling up.

579
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,737
(cat purrs)

♪

581
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,502
Not brown enough.

582
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,711
More coffee.

583
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,218
Ugh. More elbow grease.

You're aging these clothes,
not stirring your tea.

587

Charlotte heard Freddie say

588
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,232
I looked exactly like
Keira Knightly.

Right. That's done.

Empty the water.

Not that way, fool.

592
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,210
You'll spill it. Out the window.

593
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,713
-Out the window?
-Just get on with it.

-So sorry.

597
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,935
Just can't trust
the help these days.

598
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,105
Do you have a pass to be out
during lessons?

599
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,440
Oh, yeah, I do.

600
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,775
It's-it's right here!

601
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:40,028
Well, don't walk on the grass!

For the tenth time,
you need to make your bed.

Jesus, what's so bloody hard?

you need a jumper.

I don't think I have anything

Thanks.

I didn't really come prepared.

Nothing worse than
the only message you get

all day being from
the phone company.

618
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,960
But Matron took all the phones.

619
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,921
No. She took all your phones.

620
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,465
She took our decoys.

621
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,384
She has no idea
that none of them work.

Here.

625
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,641
Call your parents,
call your therapist.

626
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,685
Knock yourself out.

627
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,353
But why would you
do this for me?

628
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,938
I mean, you think
I'm a total asshole.

629
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,691
No. You behave like an asshole.

630

There's a difference.

00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:50,450
Look, I know that
I'm not some Malibu therapist,

632
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,994
but I can guess that you're
feeling scared

633
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:57,750
and a little bit homesick.

634
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,376
Which, in my experience,

635
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,754
doesn't actually make you
a bad person.

636
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,380
Just a normal one.

637

Is it your mum?

639
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,730
Is she gonna come out and visit?

640
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:25,026
She died in a car accident
when I was 11.

641
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,363
Oh.

642
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,915
Poppy, I'm so sorry.

I know you're not some
Malibu therapist, but, um...

644
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,978
Listen, are you serious about
getting out of here?

645
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,939
Yeah.

646
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,691
Then you're gonna have
to get yourself expelled.

647
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,735
Okay.

648
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,780
"Anybody disporting themselves
in an improper manner

649
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,158
will be proposed for expulsion
before the Honor Court."

650
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,035
Wait, Honor Court?

651
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,996
It's like a trial,
in front of the whole school,

652
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,415
by your peers, your teachers,
the head girl,

653
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,000
and Mrs. Kingsley.

654
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,796
But, I'm telling you,
it hardly ever happens.

655
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,130
If you really wanna
get expelled,

656
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,757
you can't just rock the boat.

657
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,717
You have to drive it up
onto the rocks,

658
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,928
set fire to the galley,
and dance on the burning deck.

659
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,639
You have to take it all the way.

660
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,641
Aye, aye, Captain.

661
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,225
Make your calls.

662
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,899
Oh, tip for best reception.

663
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,401
On top of the cupboard.

664
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,029
Hi, Ruby, I miss you.

665
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,407
I'm gonna escape, though,
I promise you.

666
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,326
You have no idea
what it's like here.

667
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,830
Ew! Who is she?

668
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,414
Zero lip-gloss upkeep

669
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,751
and what's with the sweater
from Target?

670
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,170
I wish you could
come and rescue me.

671
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,007
Oh, she is such
a romantic, Roddy.

672
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,717
Take care of Roddy for me.

673
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,011
(phone beeps)

674
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,637
You already have.

675
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,222
Let's hit the pool.

676
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,853
(creaking)

677
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,479
(cat meows)

678
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,148
(gasps)

679
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,033
(screams)

680
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,077
Watch it, Wee Willie Winkie,
you'll set us all alight.

681
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,120
I've had a word with the girls.

682
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,833
True, some of them took a little
more convincing than others,

683
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,835
but it's decided.

684
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,169
We're gonna help you.

685
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,713
We're your very own crack unit.

686
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,881
Operation Freedom.

687
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,925
Kiki, please explain.

688
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,762
Right. We'll commence with
an entry-level basic favorite,

689
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,722
just to get warmed up.

690
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,306
It smells like pee in here.
Does not smell like--

691
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,725
Bonjour, les filles.

692
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,810
(all) Bonjour,
Monsieur  Nellist.

693
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,604
(Kiki)
But it's not good just playing
the same old tricks.

694
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,857
Try to be
as imaginative as possible.

695
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,860
Only do things that will
get you noticed.

696
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,279
Vary your targets
as much as you can.

697
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,740
And although we'll
all be helping you,

698
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,158
the important thing
to remember...

699
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,953
(phone rings) Harriet?

700
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,121
...is that you have to get
the blame for everything.

701
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,959
Run along.

702
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,167
Speaking.

703
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,628
Headphones on, girls.

704
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,758
Come on, everybody.
Don't run too fast
in your flip-flops.

705
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,718
We'll just jump in,
have a quick paddle about,

706
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,178
warm up, then have tea
and crumpets, yes?

707
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,808
Yes, I'm in school right now.

708
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,059
Regulation uniform?

709
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,603
Skirt just below the knee.

710
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,896
(scoffs)

711
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,731
Of course.

712
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:53,860
They are simple polyester,
sturdy and practical.

713
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:57,030
No, I have certainly
not been naughty.

714
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,909
My disciplinary record
is exemplary.

715
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,911
Are you okay?

716
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,080
(phone clanks)

717
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:08,583
-Get out!
-Get out!

718
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:12,087
(chattering)

719
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,464
(whistle blowing)

720
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,053
(all repeating in French)

721
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,058
(gasps)

722
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,814
(stammers)

723
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:31,940
Uh, yes, thank-thank you
very much.

724
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,942
That's it, thank you.

725
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,235
(Kiki) If you make enough
of a nuisance of yourself...

726
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,489
Poppy... Moore!

727
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,533
...she will eventually bow
to pressure,

728
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,785
and she'll have
to call your father.

729
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,078
Naturally, I'll call her father,

730
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,579
but she's had a difficult time.

731
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,956
No, Sara, please,
it's all right.

732
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,916
-Mr. Nellist.
-Oh, uh, sorry.

733
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,626
(Kiki) And then with any luck,

734
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:56,006
she'll recommend you
to the Honor Court.

735
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,926
Unbe-bloody-lievable!

736
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,513
She's got more lives
than a Buddhist cat.

737
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,808
Kingley's not even mentioned
Honor Court.

738
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,518
I think people
are starting to like her.

739
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,269
People?

740
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,648
People can learn to get used
to rotting pig's vomit,

741
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,441
if they live with it
for long enough.

742
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,194
I believe she's trying to leave.

743
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,529
It'd be a nightmare
if she stayed.

744
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,031
She makes
a mockery of the system.

745
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,743
She's not staying,
take it from me.

746
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,830
Five generations of my family
have made the school great.

747
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,373
The school motto is

748
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,458
"scholarship,
fellowship, loyalty,"

749
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,048
not "be a slutty, whorey,
shit-brain."

750
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,967
(both) So brillianté, Harriet.

751
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,264
(sobbing)

752
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,018
I'm only sorry it can't be
something stronger.

753
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,771
Cup of tea.

754
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,398
(giggling)

755
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,908
Quick, give me the tape.
Give me the tape.

756
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,995
Pull the button off.

757
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,205
Oh, my God, there's a car.

758
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,330
-Get out.
-Quick.

759
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,166
(car approaches)

760
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,766
Whoa. It's all right,
Cerberus, it's only me.

761
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,434
Who's Cerberus?

762
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,769
The dog that guards
the gates of hell.

763
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,399
(whispering)

764
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,361
Hurry up,
or you'll disturb my girls.

765
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,239
(girls wooing)

766
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,450
-(sneezes)
-Huh?

767
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,496
(sneezes)

768
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,206
Sorry, terrible allergies.

769
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,499
(groaning)

770
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,252
(mimics farting sound)

771
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,130
Uh, sorry.

772
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,048
Better an empty house
than an angry tenant, right?

773
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,383
Hmph.

774
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,680
I don't get it.

775
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,682
It's like you've got immunity.

776
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,101
Your dad's a mafia guy
or something.

777
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,313
Yep, I'm the "goddaughter."

778
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:19,274
Whatever it is, she's cutting
you a lot of slack.

779
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,400
We need to up the ante.

780
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,488
In fact, we need to focus on
her big weakness.

781
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,783
Oh, my God,
you have to snog Freddie.

782
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,952
Snog? That sounds disgusting.

783
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,204
What is that?

784
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,788
It's English for make out.

785
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,665
Mrs. Kingsley will go ballistic.

786
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,169
And Harriet would have
an absolute fit.

787
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,920
Well, that's a definite bonus.

788
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:41,963
And he'll be at the social.

789
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,589
Cool.

790
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,343
Just remember,
the point is to get caught.

791
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,053
All right, so what's the deal
with the social?

792
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,596
It's the school dance
on Saturday night.

793
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,848
Traditionally, it's fancy dress.

794
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,393
This year it's movie magic.

795
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,355
But the only ones who
bother to dress up are teachers,

796
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,606
morons, and Harriet.

797
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,235
I say we dress up fancy.

798
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,819
Real fancy.

799
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,655
This mission needs to be
planned precisely.

800
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,490
Kiki?

801
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:14,037
Okay. Operation Freedom,
part two, step one.

802
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,248
Attract Freddie.

803
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:21,002
Step one, subsection "A",
look the part.

804
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,297
Kiki, you're actually making
something quite exciting

805
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,631
sound like physics homework.

806
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,967
Basically, we're going
into town,

807
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,719
and we're gonna get
some killer outfits.

808
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,638
I want something
that says elegant,

809
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,393
but at the same time
incredibly slutty and available.

810
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,896
In fact, I'm not that bothered
about elegance.

811
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,357
(all laughing)

812
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,651
♪

813
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,372
"So, apparently,
the key is to hook up

814
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,291
with the headmistress' son.

815
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,127
I'll do your trick, Rubes,
swing my hips and giggle."

816
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,879
Oh, come on, Poppy,
we're gonna miss the bus.

817
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,257
Don't forget to log off now,
you ninny.

818
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,096
Everyone, sign out.

819
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,307
Remember you are representatives
of the school.

820
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,225
Sign your own name, come on.

821
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,852
Poppy Moore,
what are you wearing?

822
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,562
You are going to town,

823
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,148
not appearing in a window
in Amsterdam.

824
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,399
Change immediately.

825
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,067
I don't have anything else.

826
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,568
I thought you might
be quite concerned

827
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,279
by that attire, Matron.

828
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,406
So we had a little look-see
in lost property

829
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,075
on our way here, didn't we?

830
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,410
(both) We did.

831
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:41,166
It'll suit you,

832
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,709
promise.

833
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,421
Arf, arf, arf.

834
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,256
(girls giggling) That's cute.

835
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,049
My grandma used to have a dog
just like it.

836
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,761
Poppy, I think your jumper
is the cat's pajamas.

837
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,273
Come on, girls, in you go,
hurry up.

838
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,359
Upstairs to the seats.

839
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,491
Don't push. Don't push.

840
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,574
Plenty of room.

841
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,951
Come on, here we go.

842
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,578
-Poppy!
-Come on, Poppy!

843
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,581
-Poppy, jump!
-I can't find my sanitizer!

844
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,583
I can't find my sanitizer!

845
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,960
You left it in the dorm!

846
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,045
Oh, my God, no!

847
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,338
Oh, my God!

848
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,922
(all) Run!

849
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,926
(all laughing)

850
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,094
Ew!

851
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,054
(all) Ew!

852
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,596
(all laughing)

853
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,476
(all talking at once)

854
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,186
(heavy metal music playing)
Oh, my God, look.

855
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,692
(heavy metal music playing)

856
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,459
(dog barking)

857
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,381
-Oh.
-Hi!

858
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:15,176
Ew. Gross.

859
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,469
Where are we going?

860
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,179
To our favorite shop.

861
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,597
Cancer research?

862
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,307
Girls, I'm all about
finding a cure,

863
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,101
but considering
I flunked chemistry,

864
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,852
I don't know how much help
I'm gonna be.

865
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,355
And BTW, which FYI means
"by the way,"

866
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,232
this is supposed
to be shopping time.

867
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,776
We're not gonna be
doing  the research.

868
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,445
This is a charity shop.

869
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,321
The money goes to charity.

870
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,240
Oh, I just had
a heart palpitation.

871
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,824
You guys are so adorable,

872
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,619
but we need to look
really hot for the social.

873
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,162
So let's go hit Oxford Street.

874
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,164
I take it
you flunked geography, too.

875
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,584
Oxford Street is in London,
my friend.

876
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,795
This is your lot.

877
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,172
(giggling)

878
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:00,388
(chattering)

879
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,015
Hey, Kate,
what about this for Ascot?

880
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,892
Magnificent.

881
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,770
Is this too workaday?

882
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,397
(sighs)

883
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:12,275
Come on now, girls,
this is a serious mission.

884
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,901
Get a move on.

885
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,237
Now, Poppy, how about
something like this?

886
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,780
Fifty pence.

887
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,449
It looks like
someone died in it.

888
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,409
I'd rather stay
the Yorkshire Terrier freak.

889
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,952
You're a Buddhist, right?

890
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,955
Think of it as
clothing reincarnation.

891
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,208
Honey, even Buddha wouldn't be
caught dead in half this stuff.

892
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,044
Still, I guess
anything's possible.

893
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,422
Come on, let's do this.

00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,841

895

905
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,151
Unbelievable, this season Marni.

906
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:39,696
It's sophisticated,
it's elegant.

907
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,616
-Hot to trot.
-Check.

908
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,451
If we could just
call this stuff vintage

909
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,286
and add like three zeroes
to the price tag,

910
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,745
I could totally get into it.

911
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,415
Perfection.

912
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,291
Operation Freddie is well
and truly underway.

913
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,959
Malibu moment!

914
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,461
Remember what I taught you guys?

915
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,922
(all) Who are we?

916
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,507
(camera shutter clicks)

917
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,551
I think he's down a penny black.

918
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,469
Yes, dated prewar.

919
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,929
(chattering)

920
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,725
Oh, my God! It's Tom Cruise.

921
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,184
Would you like
to say any louder?

922
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,810
I need your help.

923
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,896
And I need a back wax
and a night with Michael Bublé,

924
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,690
but we don't always
get what we want.

925
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,942
Trudy, attend to the brows.

926
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,694
Mmm. Yorkie fan.

927
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,696
It's a nice dog, Yorkie.

928
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:24,657
I used to have one once.
Wee Phillippe.

929
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,618
Got savaged to death
by a badger.

930
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,744
Ow!

931
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,328
Mm.

932
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,788
Aren't you the soufflé
that didn't arise?

933
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,291
Tell me about it.

934
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,876
Okay, I need these
extensions taken out,

935
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,712
a serious deep conditioning.

936
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,922
I'm thinking side bangs
with some buttery highlights,

937
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,924
and maybe a few honey tones.

938
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,842
Oh! And I'd like a night
on Fireman Island,

939
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,262
but I'm afraid
I'm whistling Dixie, okay?

940
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,180
So, here's what's
on offer for you.

941
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,766
A tight perm.

942
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,476
-No.
-How about this?

943
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,394
A wee bob. That's fun, isn't it?

944
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,853
-No.
-Okay.

945
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,981
What about this?
Oh, a pineapple.

946
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,983
Oh, Hawaii.

947
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,110
No.

948
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,489
What about something
a little bit more natural?

949
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,073
Natural?

950
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,866
Aye. The real you.

951
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,118
Hmm.

952
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:11,912
Natural it is.

953
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,581
Radical.

954
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:16,417
Okay, ladies, let's do this.

955
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,670
♪

956
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,798
All right,
I'll need that, that, that.

957
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,049
Mm.

958
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,926
(motor hums)

959
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,554
Oh, oh! Oh, no.

960
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,972
Look it. Mmm.

961
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,849
That's not mine. Hmm, nope.

962
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,436
Hey, Mommy,
two strong teas, please.

963
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,853
Bella pronto.

964
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,440
Don't you look at me like that.

965
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,527
(scissors clipping)

966
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,069
Nix that.

967
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,905
You ready, hen?

968
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,407
-Um-hm.
-Okay.

969
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,662
-Et voila.
-Wow.

970
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:53,954
Thank you.

971
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,289
Oh, you're welcome, darling.

972
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,791
I'm cream-crackered.

973
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,502
I'll lay down
and have a wee Satsuma.

974
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:02,672
-You look so--
-English.

975
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,465
I look like my mom.

976
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,676
Is she beautiful, too?

977
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,136
She was... very.

978
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,223
Sorry. Foot-in-mouth disease.

979
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,975
(giggling)

980
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,728
Okay, time for the juice.

981
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,312
Any bright ideas?

982
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,731
Leave it to me, I've got a plan.

983
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:21,982
(bell chimes)

984
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:29,657
So, Susan, do you like
your new office?

985
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:32,951
I don't know what's worse,

986
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,538
my job or that husband of mine.

987
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,834
Keith from accounts
is driving me crazy.

988
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,961
He wants that report
on his desk by Thursday.

Do you want to buy
a carpet tomorrow?

993
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,855
Yes, after I've dropped
the kids off at the pool...

994
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:04,400
...in my saloon car.

the crème eggs, you idiot?

1113
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,021
And I am sober and sensible.

1114
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:38,442
And you, my sweet friend,
are overexcited and concussed.

1115
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,651
I go back to school tomorrow,

1116
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,072
but I'll be back on the 18th.

1117
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,531
How about I see you then?

1118
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,075
Okay.

1119
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,035
I'll make a deal.

1120
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,536
No more head-fry behavior.

1121
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,413
I sense that might be
your forte.

1122
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:55,084
I won't fry your head,
if you don't poach my heart.

1123
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,045
Deal.

1124
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,630
(Jane clears throat)

1125
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,716
Oh, crap.
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

1126
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,094
Fraternizing with the girls,
Freddy Kingsley,

1127
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:08,555
as you are well aware,
is not allowed.

1128
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:12,268
Poppy Moore, get back inside.
Immediately.

1129
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,277
Tell Harriet.

1130
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,070
She won't just
shoot the messenger,

1131
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,447
she'll skin us alive first.

1132
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,827
Me think not.

1133
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,829
We think not.

1134
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,123
Oh.

1135
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:35,958
Nice work, Kate.

1136
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,628
So, is Operation Freddie
well and truly underway?

1137
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,337
God knows? Harriet didn't come.

1138
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,923
So it just depends on whether
Tweedledum or Tweedledee

1139
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,258
decide to tell her.

1140
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,634
There's nothing to worry about.

1141
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,719
-Clearly not.
-Right.

1142
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,515
We're gonna have to come up
with an addendum to Plan B.

1143
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,600
Isn't it ironic how
my ticket out of here

1144
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,519
just might be the reason
I wanna stay?

1145
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,896
I mean,
one of the reasons, anyways.

1146
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,231
Someone call Al Gore.

1147
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,192
I think the ice queen
is melting.

1148
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,152
What an excellent night.

1149
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:07,489
Eight boys have actually come up
and directly spoken to me.

1150
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,035
Now, for all you
lovers out there.

1151
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,828
It's your final chance.

1152
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,123
It's the last dance.

1153
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,000
Come on!

1154
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,127
(chattering)

1155
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,297
There's something
I have to tell you.

1156
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,924
Oh, we already know.

1157
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,134
You wax your bum.

1158
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:28,802
No.

1159
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:31,263
Not quite, but similar ballpark.

1160
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,140
You haven't done it, have you?

1161
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,227
No. I mean, I couldn't
admit it back home,

1162
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:40,856
so I kind of lied,
but I'm a total nun.

1163
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,733
Welcome to the nunnery.

1164
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:47,738
(singing together)
♪ I'm loving angels instead ♪

1165
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,156
(all laughing)

1166
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,701
Come on, girls.

1167
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,786
If we lose today, we're out
of the championship again.

1168
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,791
(groaning)

1169
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,214
Perhaps you'd like
to explain last night to me.

1170
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,507
Kate?

1171
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,261
I'm sorry.

1172
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,304
We just got a little bit
carried away.

1173
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,807
Well, as I understand it,
Drippy got totally carried away

1174
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,352
by Mr. Nellist
and Miss ReesWithers,

1175
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:20,687
after she lay in a pool
of her own vomit.

1176
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,648
Actually, it was Kate's vomit,
Mrs. Kingsley.

1177
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,943
I was just lying in it.

1178
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,029
I expect better of you two.

1179
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,698
You know the values we stand for
at Abbey Mount.

1180
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,075
And as for you, Poppy,

1181
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,743
I don't know whether
to be pleased

1182
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,328
that you've finally
made some friends here

1183
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,289
or furious that you've
led them astray.

1184
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,582
Dismissed.

1185
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,298
Not you, Miss Moore.

1186
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,302
I gave your father my word
that I'd try and help you,

1187
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,719
but I'll be honest,

1188
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,764
you're making it
awfully difficult.

1189
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,393
You're cleverer and better
than this, Poppy.

1190
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,853
Why don't you
give yourself a chance?

1191
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,063
Try.

1192
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,024
Try at something.

1193
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,860
Show him that you can rise
to the occasion.

1194
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,363
Because, judging by the outfits
you created last night,

1195
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,740
when you put your mind
to something you can do it.

1196
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,619
Don't give up on yourself.

1197
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:22,707
Because I haven't
and neither has your father.

1198
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,462
Now off you go.

1199
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:32,343
Ugh, I really do feel sick.

1200
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:37,264
-What did she want?
-Oh, nothing.

1201
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,141
Just a good spa destination.

1202
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,366
Come on, guys!

1203
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,950
Come on!

1204
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:06,043
Oh, God, I feel really vile.
I think I'm gonna puke.

1205
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,961
Seriously, Poppy, you're gonna
have to take my place.

1206
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,838
There's only seven minutes left.

1207
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,340
(wretches)

1208
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:12,883
Oh, cripes!

1209
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,218
Um...

1210
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,802
Poppy can take my place.

1211
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,596
Don't worry, Miss Rees-Withers,

1212
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,015
we'll play one man down.

1213
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,892
We don't want
to carry dead weight.

1214
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,018
No offense.

1215
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,062
Oh, none taken.

1216
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,604
But seeing as how you don't
want me playing on your team,

1217
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,858
well, I'm friggin' playing.

1218
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,111
Ugh!

1219
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,488
-Into the bucket.
-(wretches)

1220
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,241
Josie, on the wing!
Poppy, go long!

1221
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,034
All right. Wow, okay.

1222
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,577
Let's just pretend the ball
is the last size five pair

1223
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,953
of Manolos at Barney's.

1224
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,498
Okay.

1225
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,624
Let's pull it out the bag.

1226
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,043
Offense, yeah!

1227
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,044
Eyes on the prize.

1228
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,546
Aah, Josie!

1229
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,548
Eye on the prize. Oh, my God!

1230
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,091
Josie, help!

1231
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,800
Poppy, roll over it
or pick it up!

1232
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,970
-Yeah!
-You go, girlfriend.

1233
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,222
Dunk that bitch.

1234
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,681
You see the goal, Josie.

1235
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,017
Focus, focus.
Do you see the goal?

1236
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,646
(cheering)

1237
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,456
And, finally,
in news that's shocking

1238
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,207
as the fall of the Berlin wall,

1239
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,626
our under-18 Lacrosse team
has gone through

1240
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,962
to the second round
of the county championships

1241
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,798
for the first time since 1976.

1242
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,758
(cheering)

1243
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,431
To sign up for extra practice,
please see Harriet B--

1244
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:44,224
Oh, my apologies.

1245
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,436
No, it seems you should see
Poppy Moore.

1246
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,646
(whispering)

1247
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,277
All right, people,
choose a goal buddy.

1248
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,488
From now on, each sentence
starts with "I will,"

1249
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,448
not "I want to."

1250
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,451
"I will" want to saliva vomit

1251
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,119
if we have to call
each other "buddy".

1252
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,246
Shut up. Hit it.

1253
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,290
I'm giving us
an aggression makeover.

1254
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,541
♪

1255
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,543
Go, go, go! Crawl, crawl, crawl!

1256
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:12,710
Who is that? Kiki?

1257
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,045
Kiki, get it, get it.

1258
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,672
Oh, that's okay. Pick it up.

1259
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:16,881
Scoop it. Pass it, pass it.

1260
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,634
Come on, faster, faster, faster!

1261
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,135
This is ridiculous.

1262
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,761
Come on, play like
you mean it, baby, try.

1263
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,556
Call the ball.
"Mine." "I got it." "Your ball."

1264
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,933
Come on, Josie.

1265
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,435
Pass the ball.

1266
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:35,192
Congratulations, once again,
to our under-18 Lacrosse team

1267
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,487
who beat Bodley Girls
on Saturday, five-two.

1268
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,821
Well done.

1269
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,865
(cheering)

1270
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,534
(whistle blows)

1271
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,785
Come on, you guys!
Come on, up and together!

1272
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,704
Come on, shake it, Kiki.

1273
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,289
Come on, come on!

1274
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,915
What is this?

1275
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,337
(growls)

1276
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:56,921
Whoo!

1277
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,554
Good, come on.

1278
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,180
Quicker, quicker,
quicker, quicker.

1279
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,392
Josie, come on! Josie, yes!

1280
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,934
Kiki, go!

1281
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,478
Shoot, Kiki, shoot!

1282
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,272
And the groundbreaking news
is that Abbey Mount

1283
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:18,276
is through to the lacrosse
championship finals.

1284
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,111
"Dear Ruby,

1285
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,113
today is my big date with
the headmistress' son, Freddie.

1286
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,575
Wish me luck.
I may be out of here
before you know it.

1287
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,451
Lover boy's waiting
outside for you.

1288
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,161
(giggling)

1289
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,543
But, remember, you want
someone to catch you out.

1290
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,712
So stay near school
and good luck.

1291
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,464
Thanks. Fingers crossed.

1292
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,734
Ah, Freddie Kingsley.

1293
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,527
Nice to finally see you
when I'm not delirious

1294
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,405
-or, uh, half-naked.
-Don't speak too soon.

1295
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,822
And is it wrong for me
to say that I'm just

1296
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,533
a tiny bit disappointed?

1297
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,493
Come on, trouble,
let's hit the road.

1298
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,162
Hey, I thought maybe
we could take a romantic stroll

1299
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,205
around the school grounds.

1300
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,831
(laughs)

1301
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,125
And get caught?
Are you out of your mind?

1302
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,668
Call me old-fashioned,

1303
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,045
but I actually do
quite like living.

1304
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,094
I thought you said
you could drive.

1305
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,513
It's not my fault
your stupid car doesn't work.

1306
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,515
Have you ever thought
of changing gears?

1307
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,768
That's the car's job.

1308
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,728
Turn right here.

1309
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,480
We drive on the left
in this country.

1310
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,106
Whatever.

1311
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,401
♪ Putting on a front

01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,173
And so I threw the whole lot
over the cliff.

1319
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,217
My dad went mental,
as Drippy would say.

1320
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,844
Drippy said I was crazy,

1321
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,763
but Kate said she would have
done exactly the same

1322
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:11,222
in my position.

1323
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,058
Sorry, chattering away
like this.

1324

Feel free to shut me up.

1325
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,313
Well, remind me to never
to get on your bad side.

1326
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,982
But the thing is...

1327
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,901
I'm pretty sure
you don't have one.

1328

1332
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,172
Bread and fries,
that's my treat?

1333
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,341
If I affect your life
in no other way,

1334
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,845
allow this honor,
The humble chip butty.

1335
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,429
Here we go.

1336
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,274
Kinda gross, but, um, I like it.

1337
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,068
Here.

1338
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,657
You know this is
one of the dates...

1339
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,664
The best date I've ever had.

1340
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:21,251
There's something
about you Poppy Moore.

1341
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,087

Guys, guess what?

1350
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,375
You'll never believe it.

1351
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,378
What happened?

1352
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,673
"Dear Ruby,

1353
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,760
you cannot imagine
how retarded these idiots are.

1354
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:14,387
They're a bunch of ugly losers
who think a mani-pedi

1355
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,972
is a Latin greeting.

1356
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,891
I despise these village idiots,

1357
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,350
but I have to pretend
to like them so they'll help me

1358
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,018
get out of this hell hole.

1359
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,147
I tried doing it on my own,
and it was impossible.

1360
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,278
Still they're so sick,

1361
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,072
they'll never realize
I'll be out of this asylum

1362
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,950
by the end of term."

1363
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,953
I didn't write that.

1364
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,370
I mean hardly any of it...
just the loser part.

1365
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,705
But that was weeks ago.

1366
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,123
Well, it's dated today

1367
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,667
and it's from
your e-mail address.

1368
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,251
Where did you get it?

1369
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:47,587
It was taped to the door.

1370
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,965
You're a seriously
horridious cow.

1371
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:55,261
Come on, guys,
you have to believe me.

1372
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,388
Just forget it, okay?

1373
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,890
Why would you do that?

1374
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,768
You can't believe
I actually wrote this.

1375
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,314
All we did was try to make
your life here happier, Poppy.

1376
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,651
I thought we were friends.

1377
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,402
(door closes)

1378
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,410
"So, all I have to do
is hook up

1379
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,036
with the headmistress' son,

1380
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,747
and it's sure thing
that they expel me.

1381
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,666
He's a total English dweeb.

1382
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,793
Pretty gross,
but an easy target.

1383
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,670
Give me a week tops."

1384
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,714
(knocking)

1385
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,885
I can explain.

1386
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,399
Please, I really need
to talk to you.

1387
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,776
I can't right now.
You know the limo's
coming in five,

1388
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,236
and I have nada to wear.

1389
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,196
-Where are you going?
-Nick's house.

1390
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,281
Oh, not the Jimmy Choos.

1391
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,617
They don't match,
for Christ's sake.

1392
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,077
Rubes, I just need some advice.

1393
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,996
Something really
bad has happened.

1394
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:06,207
Oh, crap, fashion emergency.

1395
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:09,794
Gotta go, see you soon as.
I love you.

1396
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,296
I love you more.

1397
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,007
(phone beeps)

1398
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:16,593
Sorry, Roddy,
couldn't get rid of her.

1399
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,928
What was I saying?

1400
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,014
Roddy? Babe?

1401
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:25,226
No, Ruby, still me, babe.

1402
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,438
(phone beeps)

1403
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,397
(scoffs)

1404
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,024
(dial tone)

1405
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,410
(sighs)

1406
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,471
Shit!

1407
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,391
Shit!

1408
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,631
(screams)

1409
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,394
Kate, Kate, quick!

1410
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,229
-Wake up, wake up!
-What's wrong now?

1411
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:54,107
I didn't mean to do it,
It was an accident.

1412
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,151
I thought I put it out.
I-I thought I'd stopped it.

1413
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,611
I don't know what happened.
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

1414
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,031
Jesus, Poppy,
you're a proper psycho.

1415
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,699
Help me get everyone out
before it spreads.

1416
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,075
Josie. Josie, get up.

1417
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,994
Josie, there's a fire! Get up!

1418
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,579
(fire bell)

1419
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,373
Fire, fire! Everyone get up!

1420
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,249
Fire! It's a real fire!

1421
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,751
Get out of bed!

1422
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,003
It's a fire!
This isn't a practice!

1423
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,295
Guys, get up!

1424
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:17,881
Come on, darling get up.

1425
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,966
It's a fire, it's not a drill.

1426
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,635
(sirens)

1427
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,390
-Joise!
-No, I'm not getting up.

1428
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,142
Get up! On fire!

1429
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:31,769
It's a real fire!
Please, everybody get up!

1430
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:40,028
-Phoebe Faircloff.
-Here.

1431
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,197
-Susan Casey.

1434
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,127
-Daisy Bevin?
-Here.

1435
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,213
-Can't hear you. Daisy?
-Here.

1436
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,054
Jennifer Logan?

1437
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,515
Jennifer?

1438
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,726
Has anyone seen Drippy?

1439
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,228
Come on, girls.

1440
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,854
Who was the last person
to see Drippy?

1441
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:17,941
The freezer.
Drippy's in the freezer!

1442
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:23,320
Hey, stop her!

1443
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:35,875
Drippy! Drippy!

1444
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,377
Drippy!

1445
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,967
What's going on?

1446
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:56,311
(coughing)

1447
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,626
What do you think happened?

1448
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,211
Don't know yet.

1449
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,964
We're lucky,
could've been a lot worse.

1450
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,142
Well done, Poppy, you saved us.

1451
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:35,852
You're brilliant.

1452
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,320
Hey. I believe this is yours.

1453
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,738
Thank you.

1454
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,699
Do you realize
you could've killed her?

1455
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,159
Well done, thanks, Poppy.

1456
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,285
You could've killed all of us.

1457
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,120
I didn't mean to.

1458
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,164
I thought I'd stopped it,
I swear.

1459
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,082
I don't understand, okay?

1460
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,085
I heard footsteps,
and then I put it out.

1461
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,754
I was just so upset
at everything,

1462
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,924
and I wish
I hadn't have done it.

1463
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,093
I really wish you hadn't
done it, too.

1464
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,686
Someone here knows exactly
what happened last night.

1465
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:25,026
What we're clear on is
that this fire was no accident.

1466
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:29,030
If you have the sense to own up,
no legal charges will be filed.

1467
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:34,118
If not, it will be passed on
to the local authorities.

1468
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,830
You have until the end
of the day to come forward.

1469
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,238
"Dear Freddie,

1470
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,532
How can I begin
to say I'm sorry?

1471
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,160
You are good and honest
and true.

1472
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,829
And, well, I'm the opposite.

1473
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,040
But I'm learning.

1474
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,251
So, now, I'm going
to do the right thing.

1475
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,627
And if it means
I have to leave here,

1476
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,170
I just want you to know

1477
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:30,841
I promise you
I never wrote that e-mail.

1478
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,220
For a moment, there, yeah,
you were my ticket out of here,

1479
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,972
but then I got to know you.

1480
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:39,434
I have never felt this way
before about anyone,

1481
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,103
and I really need you
to know that."

1482
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,149
(sighs)

1483
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,947
Come in.

1484
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,410
Oh, what can I
do for you, Poppy?

1485
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,333
It's what I used to start it.

1486
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:07,544
It was an accident, and,
uh, I thought I put it out.

1487
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,213
But I guess not.

1488
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,674
Obviously not.

1489
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:14,802
Oh, Poppy.

1490
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,722
You realize what this means,
don't you?

1491
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,018
Will I be expelled?

1492
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,561
The Honor Court will decide,

1493
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:28,232
but I suspect you'll understand
that it's just a formality
at this point.

1494
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:35,031
The weird thing is I really
did try to turn it around.

1495
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,409
I didn't want to disappoint you.

1496
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,328
I'm so sorry.

1497
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,000
I'm so sorry, too, Poppy.

1498
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,836
Uh, do you think maybe

1499
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,881
you could give this
to Freddie for me?

1500
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,273
I told her it was me.

1501
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:12,109
I'm going to the Honor Court
and then I'll be leaving.

1502
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,445
So, this is for you.

1503
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,779
Well done.

1504
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,740
You finally got what you wanted.

1505
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,409
You must be overjoyed.

1506
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,994
I couldn't be more unhappy.

1507
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:25,415
Oh, please, give it a rest.

1508
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,414
Mom?

1509
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,233
Hey, I've been looking for you.

1510
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,486
Hi.

1511
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,446
So, you're backed out
of our deal.

1512
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,407
What deal?

1513
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:44,076
That you wouldn't fry my head.

1514
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,869
Yeah.

1515
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,538
But you poached my heart.

1516
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,833
Hey, come on.

1517
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,588
What if it doesn't have a moral?

1518
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,881
Or says Alice.

1519
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,469
I think I just fell down
the rabbit hole and found it.

1520
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,262
Look.

1521
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,684
She looks exactly like you.

1522
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:12,146
Yeah. She was my mom.

1523
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,649
She went to this school.

1524
01:18:14,689 --> 01:18:16,317
I didn't even know.

1525
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,994
Well, I guess it's time
to face the music now.

1526
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:40,174
(all talking at once)

1527
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,843
Josie, I'm never wrong.
When am I ever wrong?

1528
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,178
You're wrong when we did
the math challenge.

1529
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,347
Hey! She's confessed.

1530
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,765
She's going to Honor Court
this afternoon.

1531
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:49,892
That's brave.

1532
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,268
And really stupid.

1533
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,896
Because guess what
I've discovered.

1534
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:57,525
It is with
great regret and sadness

1535
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,569
that we call the Honor Court
to session.

1536
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:04,781
The e-mails were sent
11:40 in the morning.

1537
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,659
But, according to Drippy,

1538
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:09,744
Poppy left the computer room
a few minutes after 11:00.

1539
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:11,664
I got my 11:00 Wagon Wheel,

1540
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:13,165
and then I went to tell her
that Freddie was waiting.

1541
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,209
She left immediately.

1542
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,461
I was able to access
the keystroke order

1543
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,589
of the root file
to find out who else

1544
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,006
was logged on there then.

1545
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:24,051
And guess who
the only other person was?

1546
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,303
Who?

1547
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:29,432
It will henceforth
be our job to objectively

1548
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,475
and dispassionately ascertain

1549
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,227
what happened
that fateful night.

1550
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,978
That will hence to forth

1551
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,400
long blight the memory
of this proud institution.

1552
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:42,361
When you think about it,
Poppy would never say "term".

1553
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,238
She calls it a bloody samosa
or something.

1554
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,115
-Semester.
-Whatever.

1555
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,950
Anyway, to check the reality,

1556
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:52,455
I had a sneaky look in her diary
for Friday's entry.

1557
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,664
Don't do that.

1558
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,874
Shut up and listen.

1559
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,754
"I think, deep breath,
I kind of love them

1560
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,214
like proper friends
I've known forever.

1561
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:05,926
They've made me say words
like 'horridious' and 'herbal.'

1562
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,678
Which is sort of whack,

1563
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,472
and I'd probably hate them
if I wasn't one of them.

1564
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:13,934
But I like that
I'm now one of them."

1565
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:18,105
Apart from some
atrocious spelling mistakes,

1566
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:22,067
it's a little bit more kosher,
don't you think?

1567
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,194
And now she's
gonna get thrown out.

1568
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:30,660
It is your duty
to understand the dark forces

1569
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,495
that drove a seemingly--

1570
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,330
Harriet.

1571
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,666
May I remind you
that the Honor Court is no place

1572
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,375
for your personal grandstanding.

1573
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,544
Look, Poppy has a right
to speak in her own defense

1574
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,755
before the court, as a whole,
passes judgment.

1575
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:46,133
Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley.

1576
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,304
I won't insult everybody
by trying to defend myself

1577
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,722
or my actions.

1578
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:01,816
So, uh, I think
it's safe to say that I've...

1579
01:21:01,856 --> 01:21:03,526
I've really messed up,

1580
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,737
and I apologize profusely.

1581
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,574
But I'm also so grateful
to you all.

1582
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,661
I tried really hard
to get out of this school.

1583
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:19,375
And, only now, do I realize
just how much I want to stay.

1584
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,712
I've learned so much being here,

1585
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,588
being with all of you.

1586
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:28,843
And, in some ways,
being with my mom,

1587
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,596
who I found out was actually
a student here.

1588
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,181
(whisperings)

1589
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,768
I've had a hole in my heart
for five years,

1590
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:39,436
and somehow being here,

1591
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,189
it slowly started to heal.

1592
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,692
I know I may have looked
like a California girl,

1593
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,611
but in my heart I've discovered

1594
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:51,240
that I really am
an Abbey Mount girl.

1595
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:57,204
Objection! Sustained.

1596
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,997
The court will
heretofore disregard

1597
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,666
the previous statement.

1598
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,669
And perhaps heretofore we can
begin the real business.

1599
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:07,130
Can you tell us,
in your own words,

1600
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,966
where were you on
the aforementioned evening of--

1601
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,720
Honestly, Harriet, who else's
words do you expect her to use?

1602
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,388
Just leave this to me.

1603
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,890
Right.

1604
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,684
Sustained.

1605
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,270
Poppy, were you in
the cook's sitting room

1606
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,939
-on the night of the fire?
-Yes, I was.

1607
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,525
Were you there with permission?

1608
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,984
No, I was not.

1609
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,069
(whispering) Quiet, please.

1610
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,529
Silence in court.

1611
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:34,991
Did you intend
on starting a fire?

1612
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,661
-Not really.
-Objection!

1613
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,414
Does the defendant
mean yes or no?

1614
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,041
-Harriet?
-It means no.

1615
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,502
I had no intention
of actually doing it.

1616
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,296
Was anyone else with you?

1617
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:48,714
Not as far as I know.

1618
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,966
I was.

1619
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:53,343
I was.

1620
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,763
-I was.
-I was.

1621
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,765
-I was.

I was.

1632
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,155
This is ridiculous!

1633
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,407
What are you all doing?

1634
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,659
You're lying.

1635
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,034
They're lying, Mrs. Kingsley.

1636
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,496
Harriet, you're going down,
biatch.

1637
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,539
This is a conspiracy.

1638
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,918
You can't expel the whole year,
and they know that.

1639
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,295
Be quiet, Harriet!

1640
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,255
Sit down, everyone.

1641
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:33,383
It's a black-and-white case.

1642
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,177
She has to be expelled.

1643
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:37,805
The girl set fire to the school,

1644
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,474
endangering
all our precious lives.

1645
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,018
She walked in there,
lighter at the ready,

1646
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,646
and tried to burn
the place down.

1647
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:46,772
Lighter?

1648
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,106
Not now, Jane.

1649
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,442
Have respect for court protocol.

1650
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,027
What lighter, Harriet?

1651
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:55,197
Jesus, Charlotte,
how daft can you possibly be?

1652
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:58,074
That ridiculous I heart L.A.
lighter of hers.

1653
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:01,161
She left it behind,
for God's sakes.

1654
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:05,165
Except how do you know that,
Harriet?

1655
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,543
No one's mentioned
a lighter before.

1656
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,628
(whispers) What?

1657
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,254
Yes, they have.

1658
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,590
Objection.

1659
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,927
Actually, Harriet, they haven't.

1660
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:20,055
I have to second
Jane's question, Harriet.

1661
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,099
How did you know about
that lighter?

1662
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,020
Well, I-I had--

1663
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:29,272
Freddie found the lighter
before anyone saw it.

1664
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,317
How could you
possibly know unless...

1665
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:33,944
unless you were there.

1666
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,614
Well, this is absurd.

1667
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,658
I refuse to sit here
and listen to these wild--

1668
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,744
I had put it out.

1669
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:44,830
And I heard footsteps.
It must've been you.

1670
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:48,124
Oh, my God, you restarted
the fire, didn't you?

1671
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:49,543
Harriet, is this true?

1672
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,836
Of course not.

1673
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:54,339
It all makes sense now,
I knew it.

1674
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,174
I think I'm innocent.

1675

You've turned this school
upside down.
