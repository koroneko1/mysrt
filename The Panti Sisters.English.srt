Gabriel, is that you?

[woman exclaiming]

8
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,591
I'm Gabriel, but you can call me Gabbi.

9
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,137
And that's with an "I," not with a "Y,"
because I...

10
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,222
thank you.

11
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,223
Hmm.

[instrumental music playing]

13
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,747
I grew up here.

00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,083
Scary, isn't it?

15
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,217
Yes, that's me.

16
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,638
Flamboyant, even as a kid.

Moon prism power makeup!

18
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,073
But even though our house was gorgeous...

19
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,077
I hated it.

20
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,829
The people here were crazy.

[Nora] Hello? Hello, Doc? Can you hear me?

Doc? This is Nora Panti.

Hello? Yes.

27
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,809
Doc, my eyebrows are uneven.
What happened?

28
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,354
[Gabriel] My mom, the scandalous one.

29
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,358
She'd do anything to stay young-looking.

30
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,276
And of course, my dad,

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,949
Don Emilio Montemayor Zobel Ayala y Panti.

32
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,409
He holds himself in such high esteem,

33
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,662
even his own family

34
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,872
calls him Don Emilio.

35
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,541
I'd rather have my factories shut down!

36
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,961
I'm not in the mood to sign that!

37
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,589
Uh, Don Emilio,

38
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,718
is it okay if we miss that event today?

39
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,138
See, my eyebrows are uneven.
What will people say?

40
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,557
Even your eyebrows
are my problem now, too?

41
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,309
Just cover them with bangs!

42
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,355
[clears throat] Mom, Don Emilio...

43
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,316
I have something to tell you.
I hope this doesn't come as a shock.

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,985
I'm gay!

45
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,070
What? Really?

46
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,074
Unacceptable. I'm going
to enroll you in a co-ed school.

47
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,326
Your mom made the wrong decision

48
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,829
putting you
in an exclusive school for boys!

49
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,331
Wait, why is this my fault?

50
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,749
You're the one to blame.

51
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,584
You never had time for your son.

52
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,629
He has no father figure,
that's why he became gay!

53
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm working so hard
to give you a good life,

54
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,300
yet it's my fault?

55
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,677
Your son became gay

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,596
because you always take him
to the shopping mall!

57
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,098
Shopping mall?

58
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,519
He became gay
because you never taught him basketball!

59
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,646
I got him a personal coach, no?

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,982
Aren't you part of the varsity team?

61
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,776
Why do you always ask for money
to buy basketball shoes?

62
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,194
Right.

63
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,656
-They were for the coach.

[stammering] My son... dear...

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,498
You are possessed!

67
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,667
Don Emilio won't stand for it.

68
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,419
Unacceptable! I'll send him to the PMA!

69
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,172
They will surely make a man out of you!

70
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,673
Mom...

71
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,676
This is all your family's fault!

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,137
Blame your ancestors,

73
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,224
or whoever had the
bright idea to make Panti our last name!

74
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:55,521
Mom, Don Emilio's ancestors
have nothing to do with this.

75
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,982
It's not my school's fault, either.

76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,485
Nor is it the shopping mall's!

77
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,528
It's the devil's work.

78
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,281
-Fight it, Gabriel.
-[whining] Mom!

79

Fight it,
or else I'll throw you out of this house,

80
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,997
and I won't ever
want to see your face again.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,749
-Fight it!
-That's harsh of you!

82

Don Emilio, he's our son. Show some mercy.

-Mom!
-No.

89
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,851
Forget that you have a son named Gabriel.

90
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,938
I'll also forget that you are my parents.

91
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,399
Good... Goodbye?

92
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,753
So, why did you summon me?

93
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,132
Take a seat, Gabriel.

00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,801
Oh!

-Are you still with him?
-Hmm. Yes.

101

Don't talk to me then.

102

[Gabriel] Look at you.

103
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,568
K-pop wannabe.

104
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,195
You don't look like an idol.

105
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,071
You look like a member of a hunk group.

106
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
Hmm.

107
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,326
You weren't summoned here to fight.

108
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,786
Why are we here then?

109
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,125
We're still waiting for some people.

Well, here we are.

114
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,851
That explains the funky smell.

115
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,356
Vilma, Samuel, have a seat.

116
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,860
[scoffs] Hmm.

117
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,740
Let's eat.

118
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,908
What?

119
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,660
[loudly] Let's eat!

120

-What did he say?
-[shouting] Eat!

121
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,958
-Let's eat.
-Yeah, let's eat.

122
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,961
What are your mistress
and her son doing here?

123
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,004
Do we need more maids?

124
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,881
Can we eat first?

125
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,385
-Say what?
-I can't hear them either, Samuel.

126
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,221
Why did you ask us
to come here, Don Emilio?

[Samuel clears throat]

Excuse me.

129
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,727
Can you speak louder?
We can't hear you over here.

130
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,771
Can't they just sit closer?

131
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,856
-Yeah, let's sit closer.
-Let's go.

You can't come closer! Stay where you are!

[grumbles]

134
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,616
If you don't want them near,
why did you invite them?

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,079
I only invited the bastard son,
not the mistress!

136

-[scoffs]
-Is she talking about me?

137
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,795
Is there any other mistress in this room?

138
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,172
Okay, let me make it clear.

139
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,801
I'm referring to the mistress
who wears fake branded clothes.

140
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,637
Hey, I may be wearing fake brands,

141
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,514
but at least my face is real.

142
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,850
Unlike someone who's had work done. Right?

143
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,019
[laughs] Right!

144
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,937
Want me to beat you with our silicone?

145

What a reaction. You're so sensitive!

-And you look like a pug!

Hey! My child doesn't look like a pug.

00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,746
She's the prettiest among you!

I have testicular cancer.

I am dying.

161

We've consulted medical experts
from Europe and China.

We've talked
to faith healers from Siquijor.

[sighs] There is nothing that can be done.

164
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,930
I will only live for a year,
or maybe a year and a half.

But while I am still alive,
you may get your inheritance.

[Don Emilio] 300,000,000 pesos
is at stake.

167
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,234
There are three of you,

168
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,404
so you will each get 100,000,000.

169
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,530
[gasps]

170
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,324
But I have a condition.

171
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,036
Oh, I knew it.

172
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,872
You just have to make
everything difficult.

173
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,335
First of all, you and Daniel
have to live here with Samuel.

174
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,546
-Huh?
-What?

175
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,633
Second, if you're all going to live here,

176
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,176
all of you have to act like men.

177
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,304
No dressing up like girls, none of this.

178
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,265
No gay stuff.

179
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,016
-Huh?
-[Gabriel chuckles]

180
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,644
Excuse me, Don Emilio.

181
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:13,023
Even if you remove the makeup,

182
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,527
take off the wigs, and have none of this,

183
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,988
gays will be gays.

184
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,905
Mmm.

185
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
Third,

186
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,535
while I am still alive,

187
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,913
you have to give me a grandchild.

188
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,293
If only one of you fathers a child...

189
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:38,174
he will get the entire 300,000,000.

190
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,592
[scoffs]

191
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,679
What do you think women are, baby makers?

192
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,474
That shouldn't come as a surprise.

193
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,477
You've seen how he treats Mom.

194
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,520
[Don Emilio] My decision is final.

195
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,605
Take it...

196
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,690
or leave it.

197
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,567
Leave it.

198
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,487
-Uh, Emil! Emil!
-Ouch.

199
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,074
Samuel is a real man.

200
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,119
He looks like this because he came
from a Halloween party,

201
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,913
but he's really just metrosexual.

202
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,706
Stop it, Mom.

203
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,625
No, no, no!

204
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,378
What do you mean, "no"?
Hush, you're not gay!

205
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,839
Shape up! You're a Panti!

206
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm a Panti wearing panties.

207
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,802
Enough!

208
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,515
Now that everything's clear,
if you come back,

209
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,143
that means you agree to these conditions.

210
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,728
[sighs]

211
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,730
Why do you want a grandchild, anyway?

212
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,483
You want to spread the name Panti?
It stinks!

213
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:42,613
No Panti will stink
if you take a bath every day.

214
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,201
-You're such an idiot, Samuel!
-[Samuel mutters]

215
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,245
You should have just played along with me.

216
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,623
That would have gotten us
into your father's good graces.

217
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,710
[groans] Why don't you do it?
You might get a girl pregnant.

218
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,130
If you can't do it,
I'll find a girl for you!

219
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,968
[groans] But, Mom, I don't want a girl!

220
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,971
I don't like tight spaces
and smelly places.

221
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,808
I don't like the dark, I don't like mud!

222
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,477
Do you want a slap in the face?

223
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,479
Support me on this!

224
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,357
I was supportive of you,
so you should return the favor!

225
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,151
When we get a ton of money,

226
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,195
you will become a total woman!

227
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,951
Promise?

228
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,666
[sighs]

229
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,091
[gasps]

230
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,889
Hi, Pepe.

231
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,353
[automated voice] Hi! I'm Pepe,
the prettiest among the Pantis.

232
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,189
-How are you today?
-I don't know.

233
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:04,111
Pepe, do you think I should stay here?

234
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,114
Growing up,

235
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,534
Pepe has always been my best friend.

236
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,455
Actually, I came out to him first.

237
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,372
[shushes]

238
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,463
[young Daniel] Pepe, I'm going to admit
something to you.

239
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,591
-[whispers] I'm gay.
-[Gabriel] Daniel!

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,803
Daniel! Mom is looking for her things!

241
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,269
What foolishness is this?

242
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,979
Why is Pepe wearing makeup?

243
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,150
Don Emilio,
Pepe has something to tell you.

244
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,695
Go ahead, Pepe.
Tell Don Emilio everything.

245
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,364
Tell me what?

246
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,451
It's okay, Pepe.
Don't be scared, I'm here.

247
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,579
-What's wrong with you?
-[Daniel gasps]

248
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,830
[automated voice] Gay.

249
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,291
What is he saying?

250
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
What is he saying?

251
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,048
Pepe just wants to let you know
that Pepe is gay.

252
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,594
Oh, my God.

253
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,680
-Please, don't!
-Stop it!

254
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,974
It's not his fault!

255
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,435
I was the one who took Mom's things!

256
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,773
Don't lie to me.
Come with me, I'll teach you a lesson!

257
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:27,069
[Daniel] My brother was
my original best friend.

258
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,738
When he left,

259
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,616
I tried to be an ideal son to Don Emilio.

260
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,202
[Nora stammering] Son...

261
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,371
[Daniel sobbing]

262
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,123
Tell us.

263
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,791
Are you gay or not?

264
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,296
It's a very simple question.
Are you gay or not?

265
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,050
I'm not.

266
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,719
[sighs]

267
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,471
But I'm also not a boy.

268
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,728
Don't tell me you believe you're a girl.

269
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,688
No.

270
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,316
You're not a girl, not a boy,
and not gay. What are you?

271
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,193
Are you a lesbian?

272
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,946
Mom, Don Emilio,

273
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,324
it's so hard to explain.

274
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,826
The truth is,

275
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,704
I am a demigirl.

276
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,497
A girl who's a little masculine.

277
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,166
Huh?

278
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,251
[both] Say what?

279
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
In other words,

280
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,089
I'm like a chick with balls.

281
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,340
Do you get it now?

282
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,092
[both] Huh?

283
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,806
I have no son who's a chick with balls!

284
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,892
I don't understand you. Get out!

285
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,560
Leave. I never want to see you again.

286
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,646
Stop! You're hurting my Pepe.

287
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,524
-[Nora] Have mercy.
-[Daniel] That's my Pepe!

288
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,360
You don't have a Pepe anymore!

289
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,446
-[Nora and Daniel crying]
-Nora!

290
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,405
Nora!

291
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,032
-[Daniel crying]
-Emilio!

292
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,952
[Daniel] Last I heard,
they tortured my Pepe.

293
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,372
[MC] Here she is. Ladies and gentlemen...

294
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,167
Vukaka Panti!

295
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,297
-[dance music playing]
-[people applauding]

296
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,675
[dance music continues]

297
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,204
[audience cheers]

298
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,332
[Louie] 300,000,000 pesos?

299
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,085
Gabbi, get a girl pregnant!

300
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,088
Then share your blessings,
so we can all leave that bar.

301
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,881
Why don't you do it?

302
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,218
My best friend is different.
He doesn't get dazzled by money.

303
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,761
-Right, sis?
-Right.

304
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:03,559
I know of a quick way
to give your father a grandchild.

305
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
IVF.

306
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,436
-IVF?
-[Louie] Mmm.

307
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,981
In vitro fertilization.

308
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,776
That way, you don't have
to go to bed with some woman.

309
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,736
-[Louie] Right.
-That's better.

310
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,656
Idiot. I know what IVF means.

311
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,491
Do you know how expensive that is?

312
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,452
And it doesn't always work.

313
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,621
[Kat] You can talk to your mom.

314
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:29,209
Borrow some cash,
and pay her back when you get your share.

315
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,463
I'm sure she would rather
have a grandchild from you

316
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,841
and not from your half-brother.

317
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,801
My mom doesn't have any money.

318
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,512
Don Emilio never allows her
to handle finances.

319
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,514
Well, then that's too bad.

320
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,393
[scoffs] If you can't pay for it,
then you have to work for it.

321
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,562
[Gabriel] Didn't you hear what I said?

322
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,815
I will never take part
in Don Emilio's mad scheme.

323
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,067
No, no, no!

324
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,528
Gabbi, isn't that where you live?

325
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,240
[gasps] He's right! It's your place.

326
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,995
-[Kat] Haggard!
-[Louie] Oh, my gosh.

327
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,664
I have to get home!

328
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,001
You have no home.
It's being gutted by a fire.

329
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,426
[Samuel] Many have claimed
to be the King of Tondo.

330
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:25,849
But no one can take pride
in being its queen.

331
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,684
Except for me.

Ouch! Hey, it hurts.

335
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,413
I said it hurts!

00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,207
Ouch! It hurts!

337
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,959
You stink! Bonehead!

Show me what you've got!
You want some? Huh?

-[thug] Let's get out of here!
-Show me what you got.

-Really? You want more?

Not so tough now, huh?

-Hey, Samuel.
-And you!

You've got some nerve.
You had to stay behind.

[sensual music playing]

Kid, what's with the bubbles?

Want me to devour you?

whenever there's a ruckus here,
I see your face.

Hey. That's what you call coincidence.

365
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,565
Coincidence!

-I heard you're moving.
-What?

You're going to leave me?

Come on.

Oh, yeah. To my father's place.

Are you okay?

377
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:21,358
[Samuel] We became a couple
because I thought she was a guy.

378
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,485
She also thought I was a guy.

379
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,696
Because of these false assumptions...
[shudders]

380
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,241
...we got together.

-Relax.

Look, your back is drenched in sweat.

You might get sick.

Chiqui, stop it. You're all over me.

387

It's embarrassing.

So what? They know we're a couple.

389
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,510
Besides, your mom likes me.

390
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,345
She keeps asking, "Have you done it yet?"

Done what?

It! You know.

Of course, I told her that we haven't.

because I want to confess something.

There are no miracles!

Miracles are in people's hearts.

They are in every one of us.

don't you ever get tired?

Are you okay?

00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,283
I was just thinking about our future.

437
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,412
Think about it. With that much money,

438
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,458
we can have a fabulous wedding.

439
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,295
Nonsense. It's just a ceremony.

440
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,007
You know our marriage
won't be considered legal here.

441
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,635
Well, it's our right.

Even if they won't honor it, let's do it.

this is going to make you happy?

you used to live in a mansion!

I didn't think I'd ever come back.

448
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,583
I told you, you can stay with us.

449
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,086
But our place is cramped.

I don't want to bother you. This is fine.

I'm no snake.

00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,986
Uh, this is Kat,

492
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,488
the future mother of my child.

493
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,241
Is this a girl?

494
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,621
Yes! She just looks like a gay man.

495
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,667
[all laughing]

496
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,128
[Don Emilio] I knew it.

497
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:44,050
[Daniel] Really?
Well, you better get ready.

498
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,887
[techno music playing]

499
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,964
[Daniel in cute voice] Yummy!

500
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,468
Daniel... focus.

501
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,439
Sir, you need to slow down.

502
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:43,526
It looks like a milkshake,
but it can make you drunk.

503
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:48,364
That's okay. I need the boost.

504
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,869
[Daniel] You can do this.
Go get yourself a girl.

505
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,246
But the bartender's so cute!

506
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,749
Idiot! Focus!

507
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,466
[techno music continues]

508
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,721
[Daniel] You're a winner, girl!
They're buying your act.

509
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,936
Even grandma here is unstoppable.

510
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,731
[woman] Excuse me.

511
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,400
[Daniel] Someone wants the spotlight.

512
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,526
Get lost.

513
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,660
[Daniel] And she's game for anything.

514
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,379
I knew it, alcohol is the key!

515
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,256
-What?
-Nothing.

516
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,802
You wanna come over to my place?

517
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,887
[in deep voice] Sure.

518
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,602
Are you okay?

519
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,479
[gagging]

520
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,447
[Gabriel] Kat, come on.

521
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,827
Kat, please talk to me.

522
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:21,416
Okay. I'll give you 30 seconds
to tell me what you really want.

523
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,251
What am I, a microwave?

524
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,836
Fine, don't do it.

525
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,672
Find another girl to play the fool.

526
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,467
Okay, just 30 seconds?

527
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,679
[clears throat]

528
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,056
Ready?

529
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,102
Timer starts now.

530
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,229
I'm desperate. I didn't tell you,

531
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,606
but if I do get my inheritance,
I will help not just you,

532
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,733
but your family as well.

533
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,276
Please let me impregnate you.

534
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,403
I don't want to do this
with anyone else but you.

535
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,865
I'm sure when you get pregnant,
no one would dare court you.

536
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,159
Who would want to court a pregnant woman?

537
00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:01,414
But I promise
I'll spoil you when you give birth.

538
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,667
And then superficial people
will be all over you

539
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,961
but when they get to know you,
they'll love you.

540
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,256
Even a gay like me would like you
if I weren't gay.

541
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,968
So please let me impregnate you
so we can have kids--

542
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,136
Stop!

543
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,599
You took it too far.

544
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,893
[inhales deeply]

545
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,732
How much will you get
if you get me pregnant?

546
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,317
100,000,000.

547
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,072
Do this.

548
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,160
Tell me this, make me feel it.

549
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,747
"I can't bear to be away from you, Bella."

550
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,833
[Chiqui] Bell-ya?

551
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,670
Idiot. Bella!

552
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,672
"Bell-ya"? Bella Flores?

553
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,800
[Chiqui] But I don't get it.

554
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,970
Who are you, anyway?
Who am I supposed to be?

555
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,139
Why are we wearing these?

556
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,101
You are Edward Cullen.

557
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,604
You're a vampire.

558
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,234
I am Bella Swan. A goddess.

559
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:16,614
We need to role-play to get me going.

560
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,615
Know what I mean?

561
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,242
All right.

562
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,578
Twilight is my favorite movie.

563
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,455
-Okay?
-Mmm.

564
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,376
Oh, here.
Shine the light on your face. [gasps]

565
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,088
Edward...

566
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,174
you're turning me on.

567
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,844
I'm getting turned on, Edward.

568
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,721
How can you get turned on? I look dead.

569
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,308
Dead people turn you on?
I think you should see a doctor.

570
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,727
You talk too much. Stop complaining.

571
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,314
Just say your lines.

572
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,943
You can ad-lib if you wish,
as long as in the end,

573
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,363
um, you bite me, okay?

574
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,364
Okay.

575
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,491
Is that clear, Edward?

576
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,286
Is that clear, Edward?

577
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,204
Tell me, Bella...

578
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,956
Bella, tell me... wait.

579
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,041
Why are they speaking in our language?

580
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,087
Stop ruining the moment. Just go on.

581
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,006
-So what if it's our language?
-Okay, okay.

582
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,591
Go on, continue!

583
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,051
[breathing deeply] Bella...

584
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,971
What am I? What am I?

585
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,265
You are a vampire.

586
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,477
Rawr! Rawr!

587
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,188
Idiot!

588
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,982
It's Twilight, not The Lion King.

589
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,861
-Fine. Okay.
-Again!

590
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,282
Bella, aren't you afraid of me?

591
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,784
I'm not afraid of you, Edward.

592
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,120
You should be scared of me.

593
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,830
I'm not, Edward.

594
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,542
My only fear is
if you are no longer with me.

595
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,836
[moans]

596
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,137
-[growls]
-[laughs]

597
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,434
That hurts!

598
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,354
Ouch! Ouch!

599
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,523
[screams]

600
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,777
-Chiqui, what have you done?
-Samuel, sorry.

601
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,445
But you did tell me to bite you.

602
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,948
I told you to bite me, not kill me!

603
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,831
[Kat] How's it coming along?

604
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,625
Will you be done soon?

605
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,961
I might fall asleep.

606
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,171
Hey! Don't sleep!

607
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,881
I'm really making an effort here.

608
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,885
Do you think this is easy for me?

609
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,221
This isn't easy for me, either.

610
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,847
This gay.

611
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
Just make yourself comfortable.

612
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,685
I'll come out right away, okay?

613
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,603
When I'm ready.

614
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,318
Gabbi!

615
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,113
What is it again?

616
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's grab a bite!

617
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,077
You know I'm concentrating.
Don't bother me.

618
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,454
Fine.

619
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,088
Hold on.

620
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,424
It's the reception.

621
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,843
They're asking if we will extend our stay.

622
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,428
Isn't it obvious?

623
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,264
So quick-tempered!

624
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,851
Uh, yes, we will extend our stay.

625
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,604
No. Make it two more days.

626
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,940
[Gabriel] Kat!

627
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,820
Kat! Are you ready? Assume the position!

628
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,281
[exclaims] I've been ready.

629
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,409
Gabbi! Shocks!

630
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,911
I don't think I can look at you.

631
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,413
I might throw up.

632
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,166
The feeling is mutual.

633
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,126
Quick! Are you ready?

634
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,421
I'm not going to face you, okay?
Just do your thing.

635
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,506
Yes, I can do it. Quick!

636
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,008
-Go!
-[Gabriel] Game?

637
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,925
Go!

638
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,803
[Gabriel screams]

639
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,305
[laughs nervously]

640
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,600
-[Gabriel giggling]
-[Kat screams]

641
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,028
Success! I'm going to have a baby.

642
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,155
I'm going to become a mother. Success!

643
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,740
Gabbi!

644
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,492
[Kat panting]

645
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,870
You went through the exit,
instead of the entrance!

646
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,082
You didn't check first.

647
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,834
You're driving me crazy!

648
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,878
So, sorry, no baby?

649
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,339
-Don't count on it!
-Sorry.

650
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,673

-[door opens]

653
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,400
I've been here for ages!

654
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,026
Out of my way!

655
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,570

Mmm. How did it go?

659
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,702
I tried meeting women in a bar.

660
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,288
And?

661
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,332
Epic fail.

662
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,673
I'm sure you'll come up with a plan.

663
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,011
Whatever that will be,

664
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,513

665
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,101
But keep in mind, Dane.

666
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,148
We don't need a huge amount of money.

She's pregnant?

00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,408
And that jerk continues to hound her?

671
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:38,245
Babe, women should protect each other.

672
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,540
It's been a long time since I practiced
my tae kwon do skills. Okay?

673
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,709
It's not that... Dane! Dane!

-Dane!

Don Emilio, this is Joy.

-Hi, Uncle, may I eat?
-Of course.

680

Join us. Sit down.

Did you say something?

684
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,702
Mmm. I just said, "Maybe she wants rice."

685
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,079
Rice? There's no rice.

686
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,790
[muffled] Sorry, I'm very hungry.

687
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,960
I'm eating for two.

688
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,338
Joy's pregnant. I'm the father.

[both laughing]

690
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,385
You mean, I'm going to be a grandfather?

691
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,803
Yes, Don Emilio.

692

[Don Emilio laughing]

Don Emilio... how can you be sure

694
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,479
that he is the father of the child?

695
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,274
How come we just met this girl?

696
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,902
Unlike you guys, I wanted
to be sure before introducing her.

697
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,779
Do you want to see the pregnancy test kit?

698
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,447
A pregnancy test kit?

699
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,699
That's crap.

700
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,286
Who knows where you got that!

701
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,497
[Gabriel] Listen to him,
he has a point, Don Emilio.

702
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,749
Don't tell me you believe
everything Daniel says.

703
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,668
He's a smooth liar.

704
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,378
Take it from me.

705
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,338
He has deceived me in the past.

706
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,716
Well, well, well, why?

707
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:17,970
Are you scared that I'll get
the 300,000,000 pesos?

708
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,222
-Don't be so sure.
-Why would I be?

Silence, all of you!

711
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,571
The earliest that DNA testing can be done

712
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,781
is at nine weeks.

713
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,951
How far along is she?

714
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,830
-A little over a month.
-Okay.

715
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,166
After the first trimester,

716
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,043
we will conduct a DNA test.

717
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,920
In the meantime,

718
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,423
let me enjoy my son's good news.

719

[Daniel] Eat a lot,
so the baby won't starve.

721
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:03,015
My birthday is coming up next month.

722
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,018
My brother is throwing me
a surprise party,

723
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,854
along with members of my fraternity.

724
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,481
You call that a surprise?

725
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,984
It's a surprise
because they don't know that I know.

726
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,364
I will bring you all,
so my brothers will meet you.

727
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,407
Bring your girlfriends,

728
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:25,371
so they'll see
that I don't have gay children.

729
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,457
But... haven't they always known?

730
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,876
It's all speculation. Gossip.

731
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,420
Once a blind item on a gossip website.

732
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,214
But no one has confirmed it.

00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,710
No. I just find it rude.

819
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,128
They don't respect us.

820
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,840
-I'm going to tell them off.
-Hey, hey.

821
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,010
-[clears throat]
-Hey...

822
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,845
Um, bro...

823
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,349
I heard you asked our girlfriends

824
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,059
to go swimming tomorrow.

825
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:45,232
You should have asked us, too,
we're their boyfriends.

826
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,276
What if we don't allow them?

827
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,529
We just want to get some tan.

828
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,780
Suntan?

829
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,492
Yes, because we're so pale. Look...

830
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,203
[Kat] Oh!

831
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,789
[Kat barking]

832
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,541
Ouch!

833
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,460
You should have told us earlier!

834
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,588
We could have bought trunks and swimsuits.

835
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,841
-Guys, we'll go swimming tomorrow.
-Game!

836
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,302
You should have told us right away,
since you're so pale.

837
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,597
-[Kat] You're so pale!
-Excuse me.

838
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,185
[chuckles] Um, excuse me.

839
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,937
Excuse me.

840
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,106
Uh, good night, everyone.

841
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,274
Hmm.

842
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,777
Uh, I just want to give a message...

843
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,280
to Don Emilio.

844
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,199
I'm Samuel, his youngest son.

845
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,702
That's my mom, Vilma.

846
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,746
Let's all give a round of applause
to my mom.

847
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,997
-[crowd applauding]
-Uh...

848
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,083
Most of you probably don't know me...

849
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,627
but...

850
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,840
I just want to tell you,

851
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,301
how happy I am to be here today.

852
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,722
As a gift, I want to tell you...

853
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,684
-I am now a father.

[giggles] Hello, hello.

857
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,195
Uh, Chiqui's pregnant.

858
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,738
I'm pregnant!

859
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,074
We did it and I liked it.

860
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,200
Ouch.

-[Gabriel stammering]

00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,630
I mean, she's pregnant.

867
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,132
We're going to give you a grandchild, too.

868
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,927
-Pregnant but playing billiards?
-I want to make a toast!

869
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,261
To my sons.

870
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,597
Finally!

871
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,433
I will be a grandfather of three.

872
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,103
-[Nora gasps]
-And I liked it.

873

[glasses clink]

877
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,619
[sighs] It's so nice here.
It's good that we came.

878
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,581
-It's a chance for us to relax.
-As if.

879
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,167
Did you really come to relax,

880
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:14,756
or to look at your cousins' abs?

881
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,092
Abs are relaxing.

882
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,718
They make me happy.

883
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,430
Oh. Happiness, wow.

-I have news for you.
-What's that?

885
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,730
Since back when you made an effort
to look for my cave,

886
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,983
gosh, I haven't gotten my period.

887
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:37,279
-Really?
-I might be pregnant.

888
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,239
Your wish came true.

-[man 1] Come on, let's swim!
-[man 2] Let's go!

-Oh!
-[man 1] The water feels good.

894
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,675
[man 2] Yeah, man, it's so refreshing.
We should come here more often.

895
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,302
They're your cousins.

896
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,471
[chuckles] No. I'm an illegitimate child.

897
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,057
-[man] What about the girls?
-Stupid.

898
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,184
It's the same thing.

899
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,519
Really? You're the one who's stupid.

900
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,645
I was just kidding!

901
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,314
Not funny.

902
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,566
-[Joy] Yes.
-Stop bickering.

903

I have to tell you something.

I was just found in a parking lot.

-[Gabriel] Like that!
-[man] Hey, guys.

907
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,660
Do you wanna play volleyball
against us tomorrow?

908
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,538
You three against us?

909
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,917
[clears throat] What do you say?

910
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,835
Uh...

911
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,546
-No, thanks.
-[chuckling]

912
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,672
That was so gay.

-[laughing]
-[man] Yeah, you're right.

914
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,093
Hey, you! What's so gay?

915
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,638
Nothing. I just said, "It's so gay."

916
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,641
It's just an expression.
You know, "So gay."

917
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,767
[Daniel] Ah, "So gay."

918
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,770
You mean weak? Worthless?

919
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,358
Look, Dan, I didn't mean anything bad.

920
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,777
And why do you look offended?

921
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,612
Are you gay?

922
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,114
Let's fight.

923
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:07,160
I'll show you what gay truly means.

-[all chuckling]
-Okay.

[man] Bro.

926
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,544
We need to beat those guys.

927
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,004
They're so cocky.

928
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,882
I'm fine with it.
Losers have to kneel before the winners.

929
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,175
It's a win-win.

930
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,012
Let's stop fighting for now.

931
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,015
We need to work together to beat them.

932
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,268
Have you seen them play volleyball?

933
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,312
They spike like monsters.

934
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,022
Look at their bodies!

935
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,941
Oh, so yummy.

936
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,611
We should have played hopscotch instead.

937
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,155
[Gabriel] Unless...

938
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,909
they really like women.

939
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,452
They get easily distracted.

940
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,204
And so?

941
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,749
It's time for some glam!

How can I take care of you then?

Don't act crazy.

You can't stand, okay? Just stay here.

986

Where are you going?
Are you going to see Estong?

987
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:04,189
What, Estong? Stay in bed, okay?

988
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,111
Can't I go to the toilet?
What if I have to pee?

989
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,989
I don't want to smell of pee. Babe!

Well?

992
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,205
Positive.

-What?
-I have something to confess.

997
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,353
You see, that night...

998
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,396
when something happened between us,

999
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,775
I also did it with Zeus.

1000
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,320
Zeus?

1001
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:56,407
We've been friends with benefits

1002
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,660
for almost a month.

1003

So, what are you saying?

He could be the child's father?

1005
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,001
Or it could be you.

1006
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,797
Gosh. What is this, multiple choice?

1007
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,346
What were you thinking?
You introduced Joy to them right away.

1008
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,641
Of course your dad
was going to ask for a DNA test.

1009
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,852
I didn't know that you could make
pregnant women undergo a DNA test.

1010
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,022
I just wanted to make my siblings panic.

1011

[Joy] If only I could do something.

1012
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,652
I owe you two a lot.

1013
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,988
If it weren't for you,

1014
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,117
I would have been killed
by my boyfriend who beats me up.

1015
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,744
Joy, that's nothing.

00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,622
[Joy] What now, Daniel?

1017
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,208
Are we going to Don Emilio tomorrow?

1018

A young, gay dragon.

The Queen of Tondo.

1023
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:02,515
This is my day of revenge, Pantis.

1024

Are you trembling with fear?

[Daniel] This is my last day on earth.

1027
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,608
Don Emilio will kill me

1028
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,486
when he finds out
that I have been deceiving him.

1029
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,324
Please tell Blackpink
"hello" and "I love you!"

Tell BTS' Jungkook and Exo's DO
that when I become a ghost,

1031
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,165
I will visit them
while they are taking a bath.

1032
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,209
Seems like dying ain't so bad.

Please. Please.

Have mercy.

1036

Do me this favor.

1037
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,556
I hope Kat is pregnant with my child.

My God, please. [inhales]

[Don Emilio] Hey, hey, hey.

1044
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,039
What are you doing?

1045
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,210
Act properly.

1046
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,387
The DNA test results are with me.

1047

Daniel...

1048
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,521
why can't you look at me?

1049
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,023
Did you think you could fool me?

1050
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,151
You, too, Gabriel.

1051
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,071
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

1052
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,449
Then why does this show
that you're not the father of Kat's baby?

1053
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,160
-Let me explain--
-You don't have to explain!

Another crazy stunt? Why are you leaving?

I don't take it personally.

show whenever money is involved.

The game is far from over.

It's true, we all want the money.

I was never number one in Emilio's life.

01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,664
No need to emphasize. I've accepted that.

1147
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,001
You grew tired of me.

1148
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,128
It happens.

1149
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,841
Wait, wait, wait. I grew tired of you?

1150
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,511
What are you talking about?

1151
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,929
That's not true.

1152
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,807
You had no time for me.

1153
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,684
You had gig after gig.

1154
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,104
You loved your work
more than you loved me.

1155
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,816
I was doing it for us.

1156
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:36,779
Even on my birthday, huh?

1157
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:42,576
When I came home that day,
huh, where were you?

1158
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,204
But Daniel was there.

1159
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,039
He even made the dish

1160
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,416
that I always asked you to cook for me.

1161
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,377
Frog stew.

1162
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,298
I have to admit...

1163
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,177
because of that dish...

1164
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,470
I fell for him.

1165
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,680
Excuse me!

1166
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,225
That's my frog stew.

1167
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,478
Before I left for work,

1168
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,146
I made sure to catch some frogs

1169
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,566
so I could cook your favorite dish.

1170
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,486
Hey, Chiqui. What's your problem?
Why are you leaving?

1171
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,822
There's no place for drama here!

1172
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:24,118
Samuel, did you get me pregnant
because you needed it?

1173
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,995
Or do you need me, so you got me pregnant?

1174
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,330
What? I don't get it, babe.

1175
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,374
I saw you with Estong last night.

1176
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,835
If you wanted it,
why didn't you come to me?

1177
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,253
Why did you have to go to him?

1178
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,130
Do you like him? Do you love him?

1179
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,840
Chiqui, look here.

1180
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,968
First of all, I didn't ask for it.

1181
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,511
Estong did.

1182
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,513
Second, I don't love him.

1183
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,099
Not yet.

1184
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:49,643
You ask too many questions.
You're messing with my life.

1185
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,645
Why shouldn't I? What are we?

1186
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,772
Business partners.

1187
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,359
We're partners and it's not just business.

1188
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,945
Oh, are you requiring me to love you?

1189
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,489
If you want me to see this through,

1190
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,824
you have to become a lesbian.

1191
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,619
Stop seeing Estong.
I don't want to share you.

1192
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,704
Chiqui, you're not sharing me,

1193
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,707
because we were never a couple
and we'll never be together.

1194
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,917
I hope you know that.

1195
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,627
If we're not together,

1196
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,546
then there's no reason to push
through with this pregnancy.

1197
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,673
What are you saying?
You'll get an abortion?

1198
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,091
Where's your conscience?

1199
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,551
Did your conscience bother you

1200
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,137
when you knocked up someone
you don't love?

1201
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,640
It's my body, my decision.

1202
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,392
-I will get an abortion.
-Chiqui, Chiqui!

1203
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:34,647
-Hey! I'm leaving!
-Don't leave! Chiqui, please.

1204
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,484
-Don't interfere! I'm going!
-You're not leaving.

1205
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,694
-Chiqui! I'm sorry.
-[grunts]

1206
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,697
-[groans]
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1207
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,994
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.

1208
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,539
Help! Help!

1209
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,707
Chiqui, sorry.

1210
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,797
What took you so long?

1211
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,677
I thought you were just bringing Joy home.

1212
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,846
I went to church.

1213
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,932
I asked for a sign from God

1214
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:13,852
if I should pursue getting
my inheritance from Don Emilio.

1215
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:18,148
[chuckles] That was some novena,
to last all night!

1216
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,486
I hope you asked for forgiveness from God.

1217
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:24,738
Forgiveness?

1218
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,408
For stealing Zernan!

1219
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,118
Huh?

1220
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:33,247
I thought you had moved on.
I thought we were okay.

1221
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,416
I thought so, too.

1222
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,712
I really believed that...

1223
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,215
Zernan fell for you.

1224
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,510
But you're something else.

1225
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,180
You were sneaky. You stole him from me.

1226
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:57,479
You even pretended
that you cooked my frog stew.

1227
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,149
My God! Why fight about him now?

1228
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,818
-Do you still like him?
-No.

1229
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,155
Oh, then what's the issue?

1230
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,990
The issue is, you lied to me.

1231
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,075
And you haven't apologized until now.

1232
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,827
Why should I say sorry?

1233
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,748
Did you say sorry
when you left me with Don Emilio?

1234
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,666
I'll give you what you're asking for, huh?

1235
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,919
-What if I do that to your face?
-[both grunting]

1236
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,297
[Nora] Hey, hey!

1237
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,467
Stop that!

1238
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,136
What's the matter with you?
Fighting at such an early hour.

1239
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,929
You're acting like children!

1240
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,723
Don Emilio called...

1241
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,600
asking me to come back.

1242
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:36,894
And you will?

1243
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,438
He's all alone there.
No one's taking care of him.

1244
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,440
Samuel rushed to the hospital

1245
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,734
because Chiqui had a miscarriage.

1246
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:47,237
[sober music playing]

1247
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,748
[nurse] Sir, please go back to the room.

1248
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,042
We'll just bring her there.

1249
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,972
Don't be so sad.

1250
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,557
According to the doctor,

1251
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,811
Chiqui can get pregnant again
in six weeks.

1252
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,480
Are you serious?

1253
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:26,026
She's not yet well, and you're already
thinking of getting her pregnant.

1254
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,781
Why were you fighting?
Were you fooling around with a man again?

1255
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,867
You know how much Chiqui's into you,

1256
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,286
and yet you are still flirting
with other men.

1257
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,705
Couldn't you wait
for the child to come out?

1258
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,666
We could have had 300,000,000.

1259
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,918
-And now it's gone.
-Mom!

1260
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,213
Mom, give me a break.

1261
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,758
You lost a grandchild.

1262
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,844
I lost a child.

1263
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,016
If I were a good person,

1264
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,185
I wouldn't have dragged her into this.

1265
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,354
[sighs]

1266
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,274
You can be a good person

1267
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,484
while you are waiting to become rich.

1268
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,611
Just take a look at some politicians. See?

1269
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,782
They hoard the people's money
before they share their blessings.

1270
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,618
Who knows?
You might become a senator someday.

1271
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,915
We need your inheritance first
so that you can become,

1272
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,878
as I promised, a total woman.

1273
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,838
Will you trade that for your conscience?

1274
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,469
Shouldn't I want to be a good person

1275
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,346
rather than be a total woman?

1276
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,985
What are you doing here?

1277
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:51,653
[inhales deeply]

1278
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,906
We heard...

1279
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,409
We're all not getting our inheritance.

1280
01:14:58,702 --> 01:14:59,578
Happy?

1281
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,414
I told you he'd be mean.

1282
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:05,042
We're just wasting our time. Let's go.

1283
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,753
We're just making sure
you're okay, Samuel.

1284
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,216
Only a Panti can comfort another Panti.

1285
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,886
-[sentimental music playing]
-We may have misunderstandings...

1286
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,349
but in the end, we are all Pantis.

1287
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,772
Why so big?

1288
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,190
It looks stupid.

1289
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,612
[all chuckle]

1290
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,114
It's her fault.

1291
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,700
I told her you're not a typhoon victim,

1292
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,911
but she still brought relief goods.

1293
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,996
-[chuckles]
-At least it's assorted.

1294
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,998
[laughs] There's a lot to try.

1295
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,959
[sniffles] Thank you.

1296
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,670
Thank you, um... forgive me.

1297
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,589
I'm just so confused.

1298
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,050
[Don Emilio] Samuel!

1299
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,890
Why is nobody telling me

1300
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,476
how my grandchild is doing?

1301
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,778
-Chiqui had a miscarriage.
-Oh?

1302
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,698
So, it's all even again.

1303
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:20,742
I will wait for all of you at home.

1304
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,704
[Samuel] Wait.

1305
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,415
Is that all you can say, huh?

1306
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,210
You're not going to ask how I am?

1307
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,007
Or how Chiqui's doing?

1308
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,259
[Samuel] What's this to you?

1309
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:38,969
A game?

1310
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,308
I'm not a sentimental human.

1311
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,601
You're not human, period.

1312
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:53,734
All my life, I've dreamt of seeing you,
being with you.

1313
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,613
But you're a very bad person.

1314
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,994
[Samuel] You're a worthless person.

1315
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,912
I'm not going back to your house.

1316
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,498
You should die alone.

1317
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,587
[sobs] Me, too.

1318
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,427
Neither am I.

1319
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,847
And I... thank you!

1320
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,021
Hey! Come back.

1321
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,902
-Hey. Are you walking out, too?
-I have to pee.

1322
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,237
It's better to be sure.

1323
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,532
You gays. [sighs]

1324
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,370
[Samuel] Look!
Your relief goods come with freebies.

1325
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,914
-Oh.
-So glam! [laughs]

1326
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,334
-How cute.
-The blue one is for you.

1327
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,920
-I like this one.
-Thank you.

1328
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,755
Oh, fabulous!

1329
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,173
[Samuel chuckles]

1330
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:00,717
-Mmm.
-You know...

1331
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:03,679
I was so envious of you two

1332
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:08,058
because you grew up with him around.

1333
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,186
I used to wonder

1334
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,730
what it felt like to have
a father at home.

1335
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,982
-[scoffs]
-It was hell.

1336
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,818
He watched every move we made.

1337
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,653
We weren't allowed to be effeminate.

1338
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,322
We learned all kinds of martial arts,

1339
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,157
but he still wasn't happy.

1340
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,660
We experienced all sorts of punishment.

1341
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:30,997
We were made to kneel at the stars,
on broken glass...

1342
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,249
on mung beans.

1343
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:35,001
All that kneeling made us gay.

1344
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,087
[all laugh]

1345
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,134
But...

1346
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,053
Samuel, um...

1347
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:47,264
Sorry...

1348
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:51,476
for not immediately accepting
you as our brother.

1349
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:57,649
[sniffles and laughs] No need
to apologize. 

1350
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,110
It's okay, right?

1351
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,238
Fate has a strange sense of humor.

1352
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,240
He doesn't like gays?

1353
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:08,326
Well, gay, gay, gay!

1354
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,370
[all laugh]

1355
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,247
I feel sorry for him!

1356
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,249
I feel sorry for him
because he doesn't see

1357
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:18,920
that having gay sons is a blessing.

1358
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,213
Correct.

1359
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:24,050
But, of course,
we have our differences, right?

1360
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,261
When I first saw him,

1361
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,514
I wanted to poke his pretty face.

1362
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,184
[laughs] More like punch him, girl.

1363
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,603
I knew right away that you're into Korean!

1364
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,605
-[exclaims]
-So true!

1365
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:40,358
And I believe that size does not matter!

1366
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,195
-Amen!
-Hypocrite!

1367
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,447
-Yeah, right.
-[laughs]

1368
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:48,116
What about you? What kind of gay are you?

1369
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,703
Grandma. An old gay person.

1370
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,664
-Oh!
-Are you teasing me?

1371
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,542
-I'm a beauty queen.
-[Daniel] Admit it.

1372
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,879
Of the three of us,
you're the most old-fashioned.

1373
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,214
Wait a minute.

1374
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,216
I can practically smell a fight coming.

1375
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,884
Is there an issue here?

1376
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,141
-Gabriel. Gabriel.
-Huh?

1377
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,060
I'm sorry.

1378
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,897
He's crying. So, there is an issue.

1379
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:22,526
It's okay. He chose you.

1380
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,279
Are we really okay or are you just drunk?

1381
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:31,576
-Both.
-[all laugh]

1382
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:33,828
[exclaims]

1383
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,165
I'm sorry, too.

1384
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,626
You know our family.

1385
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,588
We're stingy when it comes to giving love.

1386
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,132
I'll make it up to you, hmm?

1387
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,222
Fine, I'll make it up to you, too.

1388
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:55,016
-You might get envious.
-[all chuckle]

1389
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,020
-Thank you.
-Let's have a toast.

1390
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,855
-Don't cry.
-Wait.

1391
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,232
Look who's here!

1392
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:04,734
[Samuel exclaims]

1393
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,611
[man] Hey, jerk.

1394
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,701
Fix my hair.

1395
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,254
What a snob!

1396
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,300
As if they're studs.
I'll teach them a lesson.

1397
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,970
I'll join you.

1398
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,890
-[both laugh]
-Hey, hey.

1399
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:38,143
Let's not. They're our cousins.

1400
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,729
[both] You hypocrite!

1401

-[exclaiming]
-Hey, McDonald's!

1402
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,822
Just because he's cute,
you're hot on his heels!

1403
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:53,408
-He's gone now.
-[car beeps]

1404
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,827
But he was staring at me. He even winked.

1405
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,121
-[man] What's your problem?
-That was a long walk.

1406
01:21:58,204 --> 01:21:59,414
[man] Let me go!

1407
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,042
[Daniel] Oh, my God!
Our cousins are in trouble.

1408
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,586
-What's your problem?
-Going to fight us?

1409
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,797
-Aren't you black belters?
-[man] You're weak!

1410
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,591
-[Samuel] Let's help.
-[Daniel] Wait.

1411
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,301
What are you doing?

1412
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,678
-[all clamoring]
-[Gabriel] Hey, stop that.

1413
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,556
-Stop it!
-Don't mind them. They're just gays.

1414
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,100
"Just gay"? Did they say "just gay"?

1415
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,810
Girls, position!

[upbeat music playing]

1417
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,689
Uniting our hearts to fight as one

1418
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,651
is what makes us sailor guardians!

1419
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,945
Mercury, power!

1420
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:33,198
Jupiter, power!

1421
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:38,495
And the last, Uranus, power!

That's it! Go, sisters!

01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,435
[Samuel] Oh, my gosh! Go, sisters!

1428
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:20,120
Let me know if you need my help.

[man] Let's go!

01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,844
So, who's gay now?

1434
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,139
You're no match for us!

1435
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,267
Not so tough now, huh?
Go home crying to your mothers!

to take them to a hospital.

Samuel? Are you okay?

1445
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:52,003
He looks traumatized.
I think blood scares him.

1446
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,088
No. I wasn't traumatized.

1447
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:58,468
How can they be this hot
even if they're bloody?

Stop messing around.

I can only take five people.
We can't fit more.

01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:59,320
If you're going to insult me,
you have to do better.

1465
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:03,783
Call me a faggot all you want,
but I really am gay.

1466
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,118
What about you?

1467
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:08,663
You're dumb men who
don't stand a chance against gays!

01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,598
Hey!

1471
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,518
Are you done treating the patient
or are you just flirting?

1472
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,771
Excuse me. We are all professionals here.

1473
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,399
Your eyebrows look more professional.

1474
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,610
Hey. Your eyebrows are on fleek.

1475
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,529
Come. We better leave.

1476
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,656
-Snobs.
-What a snob.

1477
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,033
Is this your house?

1478
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,285
Probably.

1479
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,956
We're done saving you.

1480
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,958
You're old enough
to take care of yourselves.

1481
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,377
We can't thank you enough for saving us.

1482
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,047
Yeah, um...
how can we make it up to you guys?

1483
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,174
Oh, make it up?

1484
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:02,592
Um, just...

1485
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:08,765
[in English] French kiss me,
but don't you dare fall in love with me.

1486
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:13,061
[in Tagalog] Samuel, you crazy girl!
You become good at English when you flirt.

1487
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:14,229
Right?

1488
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,230
-[in English] Remember!

[both laugh]

[gasps]

01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,126
What happened?

1496
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,671
He fainted during the pageant.
He hasn't eaten anything.

1497
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,172
I see.

01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,718
-Doctor? Doctor!
-Samuel!

1499
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,721
You're driving me nuts.
What are you doing?

1500
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,723
Why are you calling for a doctor?

1501
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,725
There's swelling at the bottom.

1502
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,686
-Swelling?
-Take a look.

1503
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,231
Oh, my God. It's an emergency!

1504
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:00,566
We need to take him home.

Excuse me. We don't know you.

-Daniel.

Hello, Mom.

Sorry, my phone was on silent.

1515
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,729
Still no news from the doctor.

1516
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,773
Yes, just stay calm.

1517
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:43,318
Okay.

1518
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,364
It's okay.

I shouldn't have waited

1525
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,761
for Daniel's birthday next month.

1526
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,357
I was planning to propose to him...

1527
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:08,486
to make it more special.

1528
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,656
But...

1529
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:13,866
he didn't get to live that long.

Daniel wanted this.

[Zernan] He wanted this.

1534
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,136
He told me...

1535
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:38,766
that even though the law
would not recognize our marriage,

1536
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,018
it was okay.

1537
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,813
What was important was the ceremony.

1538
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:47,525
The ceremony is important
for people to know

1539
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,610
that we're here.

1540
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,530
He told me...

1541
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:57,535
that we will never stop
until the day comes

1542
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,036
when we are accepted.

Nobody in the bar knows where he is.

Since when? Why didn't you tell me?

1557
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:02,201
Huh?

1558
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:06,163
You already have so much drama
in your life. I don't want to add to it.

1559
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,416
Want me to punch you?

Stop acting coy.
I've been inside your vulva.

And the rear end, let's not forget.

1562
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,674
Let's forget. Bitter past.

1563
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,676
Then...

1564
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:23,055
If Zeus doesn't want the baby,
I'll be the father.

1565
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,017
Are you sure?

1566
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,894
Do you have any objections?

1567
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:32,356
You're going to be a great dad.

1568
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:37,528
-We'll have a beautiful baby.
-I don't know, but that's life.

1569
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:41,282
It may be a while before we meet again.

1570
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,492
I also can't text you. It's not allowed.

1571
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:46,871
-Why? Where are you going?
-I'm entering a convent.

1572
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,040
Be serious.

1573
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,916
Chiqui, in fairness,

1574
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,169
you delivered the joke very well.

1575
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:55,171
Do I look like I'm joking?

1576
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:59,634
Is that for real? It doesn't suit you.

1577
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:02,136
I'm serious.
I thought about this for a long time.

1578
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,722
I think I will be happy there.

1579
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,228
Is it because of me?

1580
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:15,816
Did I ruin your life?

1581
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,402
Is it because of you?

1582
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,196
Yes and no.

1583
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,576
Maybe I just needed to go through that
so I could find God.

1584
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:27,620
Did you ruin my life?

1585
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:31,374
Not at all. You even made it colorful.

1586
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,379
If you're saying...

1587
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:41,467
that I was used as an instrument
for you to see God...

1588
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,136
does that mean...

1589
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,849
he sees me, too?

1590
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:51,894
Of course. Why not?

1591
01:34:55,731 --> 01:34:57,400
Well, according to church teachings...

1592
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:02,029
God only created Adam and Eve.

1593
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,534
Where am I there?

1594
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:11,914
Do you believe that God gave you life?

1595
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:13,374
Of course.

1596
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,211
That's the only answer you need.

1597
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,422
If He gave you life,

1598
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:23,050
then that means He can hear and see you.

1599
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:35,438
In fairness,
you already sound like Sister Stella L.

1600
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:38,065
-Sister Chiqui.
-[both laugh]

1601
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,401
You seem like a true nun.

1602
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,653
[both laugh]

1603
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:50,035
[Samuel] She did become a nun!

1604
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:55,166
We don't see each other often,
but I always send them eggs.

1605
01:35:56,709 --> 01:36:01,255
I wonder what they do with eggs.

1606
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:03,424
[Gabriel] Kat was in labor for 16 hours

1607
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:05,760
before our baby was born.

1608
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:10,181
I'm not the father,
but many say the baby looks like me.

1609
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:15,019
You don't need to be blood relatives
to become a family.

1610
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:17,771
I have proven that with my gay friends

1611
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:21,150
who became my family
after my father kicked me out.

1612
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:23,152
I also proved that with Kat,

1613
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:26,280
and our son, Prince Vladimir Ashley.

1614
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,532
[Samuel] That's so gay.

1615
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,660
Don't butt in. This is my voice-over.

1616
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,915
You know what? I've been thinking...

1617
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,876
Why don't I make it real?

1618
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,630
What if I marry this girl?

1619
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:44,840
[priest] You may now kiss the bride.

1620
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,094
[instrumental music playing]

1621
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:52,890
[Gabriel] Wait, you might be thinking
I suddenly became straight.

1622
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:54,850
There was no magical transformation.

1623
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:56,185
I married Kat

1624
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,188
because I could see myself
growing old with her.

1625
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:01,232
She feels the same way about me.

1626
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:06,111
Before you judge us,
look at yourselves in the mirror.

1627
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:09,949
Think of those married politicians

1628
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:12,284
showing off their extra-marital affairs.

1629
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:15,412
If you voted for them,
how can you judge us?

1630
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,333
-[Samuel] The gay got married!
-[Nora] Congrats!

1631
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,001
I wanted to stop her,

1632
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:25,256
but I wanted to experience
being a maid of honor.

1633
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:28,259
-Congrats.
-Okay, okay.

1634
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:30,845
-Picture.
-Wait a minute.

1635
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:37,184
[Gabriel] I thought if there was someone
who would be happy I got married,

1636
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,228
it would be Don Emilio.

1637
01:37:39,311 --> 01:37:42,439
But... he didn't come.

1638
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,983
Mom says

1639
01:37:44,066 --> 01:37:48,571
that he has kept himself busy
visiting Daniel's tomb.

1640
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,698
Even now his condition has worsened,

1641
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:54,827
he still visits him every day,
always bringing him flowers,

1642
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,954
even though he is already very weak.

1643
01:37:57,037 --> 01:38:00,416
[Nora] Don Emilio, your sons are here.

1644
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,130
Go ahead.

1645
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:08,966
[sighs]

1646
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:14,763
Don Emilio, you don't need
to come here every day.

1647
01:38:16,473 --> 01:38:17,850
You need to get well.

1648
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,313
Did I kill your brother?

1649
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,322
Maybe if I had accepted him...

1650
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:37,620
things would have been different.

1651
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:46,378
Yes, someone else killed him...

1652
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,927
but I was the root of it all.

1653
01:38:57,848 --> 01:39:00,059
I was a bigot.

1654
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:08,734
I committed a grave sin...

1655
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:10,778
against everyone.

1656
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:19,870
You may not believe this,
but I've always loved you.

1657
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:28,045
I thought my strictness

1658
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:31,298
would correct your ways.

1659
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:37,262
I thought it would save you...

1660
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:39,848
from peril.

1661
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:47,231
I always worry about you.

1662
01:39:57,157 --> 01:40:00,744
I don't want people
to laugh at you. [sniffles]

1663
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,290
I don't want...

1664
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:09,336
I don't want them to insult you...

1665
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,675
or belittle you.

1666
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:24,977
But I was only thinking
of myself, my own welfare...

1667
01:40:26,895 --> 01:40:30,441
my reputation and the Panti name.

1668
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,409
I never thought about
what would make him truly happy.

1669
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:42,536
[sobbing]

1670
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,793
Please forgive me.

1671
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:03,098
[crying] Forgive me, my children.

1672
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,939
[sobbing] Forgive me.

1673
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,361
We forgive you, Don Emilio.

1674
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:21,200
But you need to forgive yourself.

1675
01:41:24,369 --> 01:41:29,541
If Daniel were here,
I'm sure that's also what he would want.

1676
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:33,003
-[sentimental music playing]
-What's important is you're still here.

1677
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:36,006
We can start over again.

1678
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:41,303
[sobbing] We can still see you
and spend time with you.

1679
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:43,388
We can make up for lost time.

1680
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:50,646
Can you call me "Dad"?

1681
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:55,859
Call me "Dad."

1682
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:00,280
Dad... Dad...

1683
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,157
It's music to my ears.

1684
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:06,995
Can you do it? You want me to do it?

1685
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:09,540
-I think I can do it more.
-You have big bodies, yet you...

1686
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:12,668
-[upbeat music playing]
-All you do is flirt.

1687
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:13,794
I'll do it.

1688
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:15,963
-I'll text you later.
-You're shameless.

1689
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:18,841
-Doing it in front of Dad.
-[shushes]

1690
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,510
What's your Facebook, handsome?

1691
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:22,845
He's mine.

1692
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:28,767
Dad, did you really donate
our inheritance to charity?

1693
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:31,562
[Daniel] You are so materialistic, Samuel.

1694
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:32,563
Huh?

1695
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:34,565
Aren't you dead?

1696
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,150
How come you have a voice-over?

1697
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:40,779
-[Samuel] I was just asking.
-[Gabriel] Daniel, are you in Heaven?

1698
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:43,615
Is there Heaven for gay people like us?

1699
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,494
[Daniel] Oh, yes,
you'll love it here, sisters.

1700
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:50,914
Do you wanna see it?
Want to come over? [chuckles]

1701
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:53,750
[Gabriel] We're not yet ready, but Dad is.

1702
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,961
[Samuel] You fool.

1703
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:57,963
[Gabriel] Do you want to go instead?

1704

[cast chatting and laughing]

1705
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,682
I never thought we'd all get along.

1706
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:12,811
No ruckus, no fights.

1707
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,646
[Nora] You're right.

1708
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,399
From now on, we're not gonna fight.

1709
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:19,443
There's nothing to argue about.

1710
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:22,029
That's correct. We promised this tramp.

1711
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,031
Sorry. Sorry.

1712
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:26,491
I just went to the toilet. Are we ready?

1713
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:28,911
[Don Emilio] Let's do this. Positions.

1714
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,288
Okay. I'll get set up.

1715
01:43:33,123 --> 01:43:37,211
Excuse me. I'm ready. My room smells nice.

1716
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,796
His smells of saliva. Mine smells better.

1717
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,549
-The shower is also ready.
-No, his room smells like feet.

1718
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:43,675
No, check his breath.

1719
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,302
-Look at his face.
-He's married.

1720

Hey, hey!

1721
01:43:46,428 --> 01:43:49,556
Stop it. Behave.
You're not acting like Pantis.

01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,683
-Go to your positions.
-Yeah.
