1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,200
DANGER, UNDER RENOVATION

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,120
Hey.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,280
Hey.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,720
Have you heard about this?

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,040
They say that…

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,720
DANGER, CONSTRUCTION SITE, KEEP OUT

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,920
…at the old building behind the school…

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,120
Hey, Korn.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,120
We need a favor from you.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,360
Just a simple thing

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,320
that a great student like you can do easily.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
…at the end of the hall,

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
there's an abandoned infirmary.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
INFIRMARY

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
You see, we have exams tomorrow

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,640
that the three of us need to pass.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,880
Hey, Korn.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,400
You gotta let us copy your answers, okay?

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,000
If you sit in the wheelchair in that room…

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,960
and turn your back towards the door,

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,800
the school nurse ghost will appear.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Our seats are far apart. How can I show you the answers?

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
I don't care.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,520
Just do whatever it takes to make us pass

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
or I'll kill you.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,440
-No. -Damn it!

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,840
Stop it!

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
You think you're better than us?

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,360
And if you ask her to make your wish come true,

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
that wish

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,400
will come true.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,360
If we fail,

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,440
we'll kill you, shithead.

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,840
KUNAKORN SCHOOL

35
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Hello, exam day.

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
You guys are so ready. I can tell.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
SHRUGGIN' ANGEL

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
SOJU QUEEN

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
ONEEME

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,000
The exam room is like the death row for stupid people.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
SOJU QUEEN - LOL

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
Good luck.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Hello, students.

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
Final Destination sucks less than final exams.

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Look at your uniforms.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
Good one.
Tuck your shirts in.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Come on, sir.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,720
If you want to pass, go make a wish.

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,920
-Give it back. -Come and get it.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440
-Mor! -What? Make a wish?

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
-Give it back. -You know.

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
It was in the group chat yesterday.

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey! Give it back to me.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
You mean the old building's school nurse ghost?

55
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
-What? -Shit. That's creepy.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Come get it!

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
PEX942 - SHIT. THAT'S CREEPY

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,440
Damn. Do you think it's real?

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,320
You'll never know unless you try.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,760
DANGER, CONSTRUCTION SITE, KEEP OUT

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Who'd be that goddamn stupid?

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
KORN IS A SISSY LOL

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Shit.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,640
So you found your bag, didn't you?

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,720
Why is your stuff all wet like that, Korn, you idiot?

66
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,200
Screw you, Jack and Mor.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,480
Still want a piece of me? Come and get it.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Wanna try me?

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,880
Damn it. They're all wet.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
Attention, please.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,000
The midterm exam starts at 8:30 a.m.

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,000
-Please go to your exam rooms. -Damn it. No kindness around here.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,360
Proceed with your exams with decorum.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,040
Cell phones are banned.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
All electronic devices are banned.

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
-These dickheads won't share their tables. -Latecomers will not be admitted.

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
Hey.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,480
What? It says "kick me" on your back.

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,960
-Where? -What an idiot.

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,880
Damn. What an easy target.

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Hey, show some respect. He's a senior.

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,200
-Why? Everyone picks on him. -Whatever.

83
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,320
Yeah, walk away. Don't let me see you again.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Hey, Korn.

85
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,680
If he really does comes back, you're the one who's gonna get beaten up.

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,800
Damn it. Asshole.

87
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,840
Hey, Korn, my friend.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,400
Enjoying your food, buddy?

89
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,040
A and Bom, be gentle.

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,840
We're asking him for a favor.

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,640
-Are we? -Yeah.

92
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
Favor? What favor?

93
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,400
I made it clear yesterday. Our seats are far apart. How can I share my answers?

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,160
Forget that. I already have a better idea.

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,000
But you're the one who has to do it.

96
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,080
But…

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,560
I… I have to study, finish my food, and go line up at the exam room.

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,240
Hey.

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
You know what?

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,560
If you have so much to do,

101
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
just skip eating, moron.

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,600
-A! -Hey!

103
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Be nice.

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
Wanna get beaten up again?

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
-A. -What?

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,840
Come on. We'll be late for the exam.

107
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
Fine.

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm not going. Let me go.

109
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
Drag him, Bom.

110
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,240
Let me go.

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm not going. Let go, Bom!

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,800
Let go. I have to take my exams. Let go!

113
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm not going. I have to take my exams! Bom, let go! I told you to let go!

114
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,160
Let go, damn it! Let go!

115
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
DANGER

116
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,920
UNDER RENOVATION

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Let go of me.

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
Where are we going?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
Just shut the hell up.

120
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
I'm not going.

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
Just walk up.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,800
DANGER! KEEP OUT

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,440
What are you waiting for? Open it.

124
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Is this the place?

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah, of course it is.

126
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,480
All right.

127
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,960
-Go. -Go where?

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,120
Just get in there.

129
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm not going.

130
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,640
Let go of me.

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,840
I said, let go!

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Don't be difficult.

133
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Hurry up, will you?

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,800
INFIRMARY

135
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
Move. Keep walking.

136
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
-Boo! -Shit!

137
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,880
Dumbass.

138
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,680
What a wuss. Damn.

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,680
Did you piss yourself? Well?

140
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,280
Come on, Korn.

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,200
I know you guys are scared too, A and Bom.

142
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,080
What did you say?

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,600
Such a smart-mouth, aren't you?

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Wanna fight me?

145
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,680
Come on.

146
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Shit. So damn pathetic.

147
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,760
A, where are you going?

148
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
What are you doing?

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,320
I think I found something fun to do.

150
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,280
Ta-da!

151
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
Let's go.

152
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,680
Vroom! Whoosh!

153
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
Damn, A.

154
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Show some respect to the ghost in the room.

155
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,680
Whoa! Let's go! Vroom!

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,360
Okay. Now what?

157
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
-A. -What?

158
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,160
They say

159
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,320
that if you sit in the wheelchair in this room

160
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
with your back facing the door,

161
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
the school nurse ghost comes.

162
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,840
Then if you make a wish,

163
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,360
whatever you wish for will come true.

164
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Korn.

165
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,360
Come and sit here.

166
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
Hey, Korn.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,040
No.

168
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I won't.

169
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
I said no. Hey!

170
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,080
-Get up, asshole. -What are you doing? Let go of me!

171
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
-Come on. -Let go!

172
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Sit still.

173
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,080
-Let go. Let go of me, Bom! Let go! -Hey.

174
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
Let go! I said, let go.

175
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
Let go. Let me go!

176
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Let go! I said, let go.

177
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,120
-Just sit still. -Let go of me!

178
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
-Let go. -Don't be so loud.

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
-Hey, shut up. -I gotta take my exams. Let go!

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,880
I'm begging you, A. Please let me go.

181
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,240
Sure, buddy.

182
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,200
-One sec. -Let me go!
Hold him still.

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,040
Hold him.

184
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,360
-Let go! -Stay still.

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,280
Let go of me!

186
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
Why are you tying me up?

187
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,560
I said, let go of me. Come on.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,400
Let me go! Let go!

189
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Hey, Korn.

190
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,160
You are going to wait here.

191
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,320
Wait for the school nurse ghost to come,

192
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
and wish for us to pass all the exams, okay?

193
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,160
You dragged me all the way here just for this nonsense?

194
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,280
Stop complaining.

195
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
You idiots.

196
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,000
-Hey. -How can a ghost help you?

197
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
Let me go.

198
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
A,

199
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,720
we should go. We'll be late for the exam.

200
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,880
-Aren't you gonna wait and see? -No way. Let's go!

201
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,680
Hey, Korn,

202
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,480
listen carefully.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
If the nurse ghost doesn't show up,

204
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,000
you won't take the exam.

205
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,640
And if we fail,

206
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
you're dead meat.

207
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Hey.

208
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Where are you going?

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
A, where are you going?

210
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,800
Let me go. A.

211
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,080
A! Let me go!

212
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,600
-You're all set. -I said, let me go!

213
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
Let me go!

214
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,000
A!

215
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,560
-Bye-bye. -Let me go!

216
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,800
Help!

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Let me go.

218
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,680
KUNAKORN SCHOOL

219
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,680
CONGRATULATIONS

220
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,440
-Under-eye bags? -Do the lips.

221
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Wait. Add this first.

222
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
-What is that? -Nose hair.

223
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,680
-What the hell is that? -Aw.

224
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,040
What are you doing? Well?

225
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,480
Aekachai, Burin, and Mintra.

226
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
Yesterday, I was told

227
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
that you three threatened someone so they'd let you copy their answers,

228
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,200
but they refused, and you beat them up.

229
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Is that true? Well?

230
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,400
We already had a meeting with your parents once, remember?

231
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,040
Who snitched, sir?

232
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
You don't need to know.

233
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Was it Korn?

234
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,600
It must have been him.

235
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,640
That asshole.

236
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,200
Hey. Stop it, Burin.

237
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,680
Don't believe him, sir. Korn's such a liar.

238
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,720
No one wants to be his friend.

239
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,560
That's enough.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,640
Considering what you did yesterday,

241
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,920
if you fail today's exams too,

242
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,080
I will need to speak to your parents again

243
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,320
to let them know that you must repeat this year level.

244
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Understood?

245
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
Listen, you three.

246
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,680
If I don't see all of you at the exam room before eight o'clock,

247
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
you can't take the exams.

248
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,240
Sir.

249
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,480
Shit.

250
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,080
If my dad gets a call again, he won't let me stay in school anymore.

251
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,440
Same here.

252
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
My mom said she'd buy me a car when I graduate.

253
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,960
If I don't graduate,

254
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,800
what am I gonna do?

255
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,120
If I have to repeat,

256
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,440
my dad will beat the shit out of me.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,160
It's that prick's fault.

258
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,320
That bastard, Korn.

259
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
Attention, please.

260
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,520
The midterm exams start at 8:30 a.m.

261
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,160
All students, please go to your exam rooms

262
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,680
and proceed with the exams with decorum.

263
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
-A and Bom. -What?

264
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,800
How do we know Korn made a wish for us?

265
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,400
The exams are starting.

266
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,960
I told you, Mint. We should have waited there.

267
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,960
Why did you leave so fast?

268
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,960
Well, I was scared, of course.

269
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm sure he made a wish for us, Mint. He wouldn't dare defy us.

270
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,840
I know, but I can't be sure. How do we know if the wish came true?

271
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
A.

272
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,560
What?

273
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,240
Should we go back and check on him?

274
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,760
Seriously, Mint?

275
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
The exam is about to start.

276
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,840
Jeez. Just take the exam first.

277
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,800
If we happen to fail…

278
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,200
Bom and I will beat him up. Okay?

279
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,680
Why are you yelling at me? Is this my fault?

280
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,520
Fine. I'm sorry.

281
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
-Is that good enough? -Shit.

282
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm stressed out. I'm going for a smoke.

283
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,840
Hey, Bom.

284
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,920
-I'm coming with you. -Don't go, A.

285
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,760
I told you, I'm scared. Stay here with me.

286
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
Sit down.

287
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
Sit.

288
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,920
Sit.

289
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,800
DANGER! KEEP OUT

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Let me go.

291
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,360
Don't try to scare me, A, Bom, and Mint.

292
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
Won't you make a wish?

293
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,560
What the hell?

294
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
I'm not scared.

295
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,720
Don't try to scare me.

296
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,120
Show your face if you dare.

297
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Aren't you going to make a wish?

298
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,160
Hey.

299
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,640
You can't scare me, Mint.

300
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,240
Your stupid tricks only work on little kids.

301
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,800
You won't make a wish?

302
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,280
DANGER, UNDER RENOVATION

303
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,280
We're screwed.

304
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Damn, it's Korn. Mint, Korn's back. Let's go!

305
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,640
Where are you going? Hey, Korn. Don't run. Where are you going, buddy?

306
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,400
Where are you going, huh?

307
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,560
Did you make a wish for us?

308
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,280
You made a wish for us, right?

309
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,320
Answer me!

310
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,080
Hey, Korn,

311
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,280
did you ask that damn ghost for a wish?

312
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,240
You did, right?

313
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, I made a wish for you.

314
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
You idiots.

315
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,560
Sir! There's a dead body behind the gym!

316
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,000
Sir! It's Bom.

317
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,000
Bom from Room Two died behind the gym!

318
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,200
There's blood everywhere. Sir!

319
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,920
Shit. Bom.

320
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,840
The legend…

321
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,120
the legend is true, Mint.

322
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,720
My wish,

323
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,280
it came true, Mint.

324
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
Korn, you bastard!

325
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,320
-What wish? -What did you wish for?

326
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
What did you say?

327
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
What was your wish? What did you ask for? Answer me!

328
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,080
KORN IS A SISSY LOL

329
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,080
KORN, YOU IDIOT

330
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
Damn it!

331
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,480
Stop it!

332
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,120
Fuck!

333
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
Fuck!

334
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,440
Fuck!

335
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Tell me your wish.

336
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Fine!

337
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,920
I made a wish for you.

338
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,160
You won't make a wish?

339
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
Fine. I'll make a wish.

340
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,600
A, Bom, and Mint. I wish all three of them would die!

341
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,600
I wished for all three of you

342
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
to die!

343
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,560
You all can die!

344
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,880
Remember this.

345
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,680
You all will pay the price.

346
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,320
Why the fuck did you wish for that? How could you do this?

347
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
You wished for us to die?

348
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,040
Shit.

349
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Shit. What the hell?

350
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
Yeah.

351
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,160
I wished that the three of you

352
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,920
would all die.

353
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
A, Mint, and Bom.

354
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
All of you can die.

355
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,720
A!

356
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,520
All three of you can die.

357
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,440
-All of you can die. -A!

358
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
A, get back here.

359
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
A.

360
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
A, is that the wheelchair from the old infirmary?

361
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Shit!

362
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Hey.

363
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,240
Mint, you bitch!

364
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,200
-Hurry. -Hey, what is it? Hey, what happened?

365
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,560
Attention, please.

366
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
The exams for all classes and year levels are postponed.

367
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,880
All teachers, please inform and advise your students to go home.

368
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Hurry up, kids. Get yourselves home.

369
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,040
-Wait at home for further announcements. -Hurry up. Go home now.

370
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,400
-Avoid the scenes of the incidents. -Go get your bags and go home. Hurry up.

371
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,920
-Hey, a Room Four kid died on the stairs. -Do not take photos or videos.

372
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
-Don't spread any unconfirmed information. -Scary. I bet that's why we're going home.

373
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,600
Really?

374
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,360
-I've no idea. -The teacher's here. Guys, let's go.

375
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,840
-Hey. -Let's go and see.

376
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,160
…according to the school code of conduct.

377
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,800
Please pay attention, students.

378
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,640
Today, the school has decided to postpone the final exams.

379
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,400
Sir, did someone really die behind the building?

380
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,120
Sir, the body on the staircase, is it A's body?

381
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,160
Sir, my friend said someone died in front of the old building.

382
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,560
Is she really one of our senior students?

383
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,560
-Is it true, sir? -Is it true, sir?

384
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,800
Please tell us, sir.

385
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
That's enough.

386
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,920
Enough for now. Please remain calm, everyone.

387
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,000
For now, I'd like you to call your parents and have them pick you up soon.

388
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,440
Go and wait at home for announcements from the school.

389
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
-What? -All right. That's it.

390
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
-Sir. -What the hell?

391
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,800
What the hell was that?

392
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,360
-What? -What do you think?

393
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
I guess we'll go home.

394
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Hey.

395
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,360
You made the ball wet. Watch where you're going.

396
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,160
Are you stupid? Standing here drinking? Damn, our ball is all wet now.

397
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
Hey, you're the ones who threw it at me.

398
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,080
Well, you weren't paying attention.

399
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,440
-Wipe it with your shirt. -Take it off.

400
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,880
-Hey. -Just take it off.

401
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
Get off me.

402
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,200
Get off. I said, get off. Hey, get off me. Get off!

403
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,000
-What the hell? -Hey!

404
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,560
You. And you.

405
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,440
You wanna end up like A?

406
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,200
What are you talking about?

407
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
Are you joking about the dead?

408
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah. You always talk shit like this. That's why nobody wants to help you.

409
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Fine! I don't want your help anyway!

410
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,800
-You assholes! -Hey. Why would you say that?

411
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,080
-How dare you? -You're the asshole!

412
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.
-Idiot. -Fine!

413
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,560
Mark my words.

414
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll get back at all of you. Just you wait!

415
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,400
I'll get you, assholes. Damn.

416
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
I'll get you, bastards.

417
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,880
You got it, assholes.

418
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,800
I'll get back at you.

419
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,440
I'll get back at all of you.

420
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,760
Just wait, assholes.

421
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,640
Jack, Mor, Kong,

422
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,880
Guide, Por, Tong, Game, White, Lee, and Champ.

423
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,400
Did A and his friends die today

424
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,360
because of my wish?

425
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,880
Yes.

426
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,360
Then I want to make another wish.

427
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,120
All the people who bullied me,

428
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
I want them to die.

429
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,000
Of course.

430
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,440
But last time,

431
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I didn't get anything in exchange

432
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
for your wish.

433
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,680
Well,

434
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,080
what do you want?

435
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,240
You ask for death,

436
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,360
you pay with a piece of a living soul.

437
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
What do you mean?

438
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,720
One dead body

439
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,720
in exchange for one body part.

440
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,280
These are

441
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,520
for the three bodies earlier.

442
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
And

443
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,880
as for your new wish…

444
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
about all your bullies,

445
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,920
there are

446
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
33 of them.

447
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't want it anymore.

448
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,120
I take it back. Wait!

449
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,200
I take it back!

450
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,400
Help! Help me!

451
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,840
What an idiot.

452
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,680
If he really does comes back,

453
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,400
you're the one who's gonna get beaten up.

454
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,400
Fuck off.

455
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,440
Hey, I'm just warning you nicely.

456
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
Wanna fight me?

457
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,080
You're so rude, Korn.

458
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,640
That's why no one helps you when you get beaten up.

459
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,400
Help me! Somebody help me!

460
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,440
I don't want it anymore. Help me!

461
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,520
-What's up, Korn? -You'd better shower!

462
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,600
Hey.

463
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,960
I take it back!

464
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,240
Don't believe him, sir. Korn's such a liar.

465
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,120
-I take it back! -He's so rude.

466
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,120
And he always swears at other people.

467
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
I don't want it anymore.

468
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,520
Shit. Stop it.

469
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,440
-You stink. Let me wash you. -Stop. I told you to stop.

470
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,800
-Stop it! No! -He thinks he's smarter than us.

471
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040
He's a school representative,

472
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,480
so he thinks he can call anyone stupid.

473
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,080
You're all stupid.

474
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,680
Just quit school.

475
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,520
Idiots.

476
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
All brawn and no brains.

477
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,920
Damn it!

478
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,440
I take it back.

479
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,000
Please help me.

480
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
You want me to kick you first?

481
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,000
Help me!

482
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,400
So you found your bag, did you? Why is your stuff all wet like that,

483
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,600
Korn, you idiot?

484
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,400
Help me.

485
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,240
I can't take it anymore. I don't want this.

486
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,960
No more.

487
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,560
Don't worry.

488
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:06,240
I won't let you rot to death before I grant you 33 bodies for sure.

489
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,520
No!

490
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,080
Hey, do you think the legend of this place is true?

491
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,120
Of course. It's quite scandalous.

492
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,400
They say if you sit on the wheelchair

493
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,200
and turn your back to the door, the school nurse ghost will appear.

494
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,160
What?

495
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,840
So where's the wheelchair?

496
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,200
You're right.

497
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,080
There it is.

498
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,760
-Go take it. -Yeah.

499
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,480
Be careful.

500
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,840
-Bring it here. -Come on.

501
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,600
-Whoa. -Whoa.

502
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,440
Well, what do we do next?

503
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,640
You just sit in it
