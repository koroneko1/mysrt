Episode 1

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280
That is Mr. Thach,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.260
whom you will have to look after.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.920
I've taken the carer to see you.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.380
Hi! I am Thien Phuc.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.500
Nice to meet you!

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960
You don't have to speak so loudly like that!

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.360
Go out there, I will show you something.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.060
Come here!

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.840
This is the kitchen.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.380
Yes.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.000
If you cook, remember to wash the dishes right after that.
Or it will be really stinky.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.860
Yep!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.460
Over here is the laundry.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.080
And that is the garden.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.560
Remember to close the door when you go in and out,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560
because there are lots of mosquitoes here at night.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.340
What's the matter?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.120
Ah, nothing!

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.660
If Mr. Thach or I am not at home, don't go into his room.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.580
Yes.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.200
It's time for medicine.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760
Go there and get me some water!

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.000
The schedules, I've written them on the box.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.800
Remember to give him medicine on time.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.320
Yes.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.420
Oh, I almost forgot!

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.180
Whenever you go in and out, remember to put the key under the plant pot.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.640
In case of any urgencies, I can still get in.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.340
Yes.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.520
Okay, let's go.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.680
It's time for him to take medicine.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.540
Let's give him the medicine!

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.680
Here is your medicine!

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.400
Since the day of the accident, he has kept being like this.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.600
He doesn't care who says or does anything.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.700
Have you done the transferring procedures yet?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.640
I don't have time to come here every day.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.800
Duy is about to come home.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.520
He will carry on all the work that you and I have been set up for years.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.940
So, hurry up with the paperwork!

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.820
If you don't read these books anymore, then throw these away!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.980
Just leave it right there!

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.100
Go out!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.760
You! Stay here!

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.500
If you want me to sign, I will.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.300
From now on, I will be your boss.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.300
Anyone who wants to talk to you has to go through my consent.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.900
Yes.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.120
Change all of the locks!

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.220
Yes.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.060
Also the gate's lock,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.240
don't forget it!

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.280
Yes.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.920
At 5:00 PM precisely, I will take a shower.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.560
Don't be late!

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.780
I don't like that.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.280
We're both men,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.680
so there is nothing to fear.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.420
Yeah!

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.240
He can't eat me up.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.960
How long are you gonna think?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.420
Am I really coming in there?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.160
Come and sit here!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.060
Huh?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.240
What if I get wet when sitting on the tub?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.840
What did he eat to be so white?

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.220
If it's not because of the money,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.760
there is no way I do this.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.820
Is he really blind?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.720
Go out!

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.340
Oh my god!

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.220
I didn't see anything, I didn't see....

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.420
I didn't see... his butt.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.460
I saw his butt!

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.680
Ouch, my pure eyes!

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880
Mr. Thach!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.140
Breakfast is ready.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.400
Please go outside and eat!

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.700
Are you alright?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.540
Let me clean this up! Please go and brush your teeth!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.540
Let it be!

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.420
Just let me clean this up! Go and brush your teeth!

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.860
I said leave it alone!

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.240
If I don't clean this, you will step on these broken glasses.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.340
It's my business!

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.740
Okay then!

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.740
You clean this up!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.460
See! I told you, but you didn't listen to me!

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.480
Just let me do it!

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.780
Keep your hands off!

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.400
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.420
What's the matter with me doing this?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.940
You really like being scolded?

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.860
It's not that I don't want to let you do it.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.380
But you have to let me work, so I can feel happy when getting the salary at the end of the month.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.900
So obstinate!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.520
Do you need to bandage the wound?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.520
No need.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.900
Can I go to open the door?

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.000
If it's Linh, don't let her come in.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.000
Why?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.700
Why couldn't I come in?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.480
What do you come here for?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.400
Sign the paper!

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.700
Of your dreams that I will sign.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.080
I will ask you one last time.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.240
I don't want to see blood again.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.440
So please don't push me!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.300
You think you have enough ability?

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.040
I don't want to have a murder!

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.520
Sit down and talk properly!

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.160
I will not sign it.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.840
Stop wasting your breath!

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.600
What a useless blind!

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.160
How can you manage the restaurant when you're blind?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.540
Or would you let it rot away and go bankrupt?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.600
Think about it!

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.220
Except from me,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.700
is there anyone staying with you when you lost your vision?

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.240
Oh! That's right!

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.360
Where's your poor little sister?

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.760
She has been studying abroad, right?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.880
You are still waiting for her to come back and celebrate Tet with you?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.220
How pitiful!

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.760
Hey! You're exaggerating it!

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.680
Is it your turn to speak?

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.960
Both you and I have no rights to speak up.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:08.920
You!

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.680
Leave, please!

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.060
Or I will call the police.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.480
Do it!

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.240
I'll say this one last time!

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.900
Sign the conveyance!

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.800
Who am I to you that you make me sign it?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.460
Stop with that scornful smile of yours!

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.200
Now you are no different from a useless person.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.340
You keep it for what?

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.460
If I were you,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.320
I would rather die.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.640
Get out!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.060
Sign the paper!

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.920
Out!

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.240
Sign it!

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.240
Out of my house!

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.780
As long as you haven't yet signed,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.280
I would still come back.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.300
You forgot to lock the gate, right?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.900
I am sorry!

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.160
If doing it one more time, I'll fire you!

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.240
I am so sorry!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.960
Mr. Thach!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.880
I've finished all the work! I'm going home now!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.280
Good night!

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.040
At least, answer me with a "yes".

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.240
Why do I feel like something's gonna happen?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.460
Mr. Thach!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.500
Can you talk to me a little bit?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.960
What is wrong with him?

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.560
The door is locked.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.640
Maybe he has worn headphones and gone to sleep.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.680
If something happens, I will fall into disrepute.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.660
Mr. Thach!

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.240
Mr. Thach!

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.680
Mr. Thach!

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.220
The house is small, but why are there so many keys?

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.680
Right at this time!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.060
Calm down! Calm down!

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.900
This crazy guy!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.720
Are you awake?

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.820
Are you alright?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.540
Hurt...

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.660
Are you okay?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.400
It hurts!

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.580
I said I'm hurt.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.800
Are you awake?

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.740
Why didn't you just let me die?

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.140
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.580
Hey!

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.720
I am still your boss.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.460
I am the one who saved you.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.240
Did I beg you to save me?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.820
Why are you so stubborn?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.460
Please don't do this nonsense anymore.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.340
Why do you keep such people in your hair?

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.640
If there is a sad thing, just ignore it.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.580
If you want to confide, I am here for you.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240
What's wrong?

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.460
Mr. Thach!

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.640
Mr. Thach!

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.400
I didn't say that to make you cry.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.860
Mr. Thach!

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.800
Please!

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.520
Don't cry!

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.020
You call that comforting?

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.100
I did it in a strong way.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.800
Mr. Thach!

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.900
Gosh!

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.040
Let me take you to go inside!

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.320
I will be outside. Call me if you need anything.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.820
What do you want?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.940
I want to repay you with my body
