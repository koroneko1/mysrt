2
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,875
Baby?

3
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,079
Oh, you scared me.

4
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,992
Sorry.

5
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,959
Didn't mean to.

6
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,514
You were outside?

7
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,479
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I wanted to be alone.

8
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,677
I mean, I needed to clear my head
and get the ideas flowing.

9
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
And did they?

10
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,350
No.

11
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,680
They will.

12
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,354
Don't worry.

13
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,194
It'll come.

14
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,829
- I must stink.
- I like it.

15
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,514
I better shower.

16
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
Hey.

17
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,278
- Can I grab these?
- I got it.

18
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,989
Ooh.

19
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,199
Perfect.

20
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,154
You didn't need to do all of this.

21
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,310
I wanted to.

22
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,279
You've been working so hard.

23
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,552
Yeah. Right.

24
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
Wait here.

25
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,233
No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

26
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,879
- Come in. Please.
- Thanks. Thanks.

27
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,713
Oh. Hello.

28
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
Hello.

29
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,317
So this gentleman here just started working

30
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,119
at the hospital, and he thought we were...

31
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,317
- What do you do there?
- I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

32
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,430
Really?

33
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,318
But mostly now I do research and teach.

34
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,750
Research.

35
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,150
Yes. I know, it's a bit boring.

36
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,999
It's not boring at all.

37
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,515
Sit for a second.
Can we get you anything to drink?

38
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,751
No. That isn't... That's fine.

39
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,592
- Some tea?
- Hmm?

40
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,353
- Some tea?
- No, no, no, no, no.

41
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,669
Uh, I don't...

42
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,195
Uh...

43
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,033
I don't want to be a bother.

44
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,110
But you must.

45
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,637
A guest and a doctor? I mean, who knows?

46
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,279
I might trip down the stairs one day.

47
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,079
Let's hope not!

48
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,594
- I'll go make some.
- Thank you.

49
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,114
This way please.

50
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,676
Sorry for the mess.

51
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,917
We're moving in after months of construction.

52
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,479
- It's an incredible place.
- My wife loves having company.

53
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,630
- Your wife?
- Yes.

54
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
I thought it was your daughter.

55
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,156
- Sit down.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,314
You all right?

57
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,990
Fine.

58
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,352
Then there's this one case,
This was an opera singer, late 20s.

59
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,035
Her femurs were rotated so far inward

60
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,312
that she couldn't spread her knees
more than a foot apart.

61
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Ooh, really?

62
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
- Thank you.
- You've upgraded.

63
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,195
- Where'd that come from?
- I always carry a supply.

64
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,555
I never tasted something like this.

65
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,475
It's hard to come by. I had to share.

66
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,550
Won't you join?

67
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,552
Mmm. She's not much of a drinker.

68
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,870
I drink.

69
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,872
Here, let me put a little in your tea.

70
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,552
I'm fine with tea, thank you.

71
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,039
The good doctor here
is about to publish a major paper.

72
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,474
"About" is generous.

73
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,517
I still have reams of research to write up.

74
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,353
And he's moved here to finish it.

75
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,476
And... And what brings you to us?

76
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,398
Well, they told me I could find a room here.

77
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,151
He thought we were a bed and breakfast.

78
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,873
We always talk about how this place
is too big for the two of us.

79
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,150
Well, I really should be going
if I'm going to find another...

80
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,795
Nonsense. No, no.
No, it's late. Stay the night.

81
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,234
No, I couldn't, no.

82
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,391
Please. We'd enjoy the company, right?

83
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,394
Yes, of course.

84
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,954
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

85
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,192
Well, then I'll just grab
the rest of my stuff.

86
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,310
That's incredibly kind and generous.

87
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,995
I just left it on the...

88
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,470
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

89
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,074
You sure?

90
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,391
Yeah. It just went down the wrong tube.

91
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,789
Thanks.

92
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,434
We don't know him.

93
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,715
He's a doctor.

94
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,790
He's a stranger.

95
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,559
We're just gonna let him sleep in our house?

96
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,553
You want me to ask him to leave?

97
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,477
- Is that all?
- That's everything.

98
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,440
Um, we don't smoke.

99
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,430
That's smart.

100
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,479
In the house, I mean.

101
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,116
Sorry.

102
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,237
I'll go get you some linens.

103
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,312
- I'll show you to your room.
- Thank you.

104
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,754
Once again, sorry for the mess.

105
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,116
No, please. I really appreciate this.

106
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,955
Oh, and this! I love this.

107
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,117
How come you have so many copies?

108
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,634
Well, I wrote it.

109
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,990
Oh, my.

110
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,920
- That's you?
- Mmm-hmm.

111
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,796
- I'm a huge fan.
- You've read it?

112
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,951
I've read it many, many times.

113
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,918
Your words have changed my life.

114
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,671
Oh, I'm sorry. You must...

115
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
You must hear that all the time.

116
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,033
Not really, no.

117
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,956
And that.

118
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,353
What is that?

119
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,870
Careful.

120
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,830
This is very, very delicate.

121
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,031
It was a gift.

122
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,871
A very special gift.

123
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,919
Is it from you?

124
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,030
No.

125
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,314
When I was younger,
I lost everything in a fire.

126
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,630
Oh, I'm sorry.

127
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,798
It's hard to imagine what that means.

128
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,070
Losing everything.

129
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,119
Your memories, your work,
even your dirty toothbrush.

130
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,835
I didn't know if I could ever create again

131
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,993
until I found this in the ashes.

132
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,714
Isn't that remarkable?

133
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,836
Can I just...

134
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,835
It gave me the strength to start again.

135
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,914
And then I met her.

136
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,070
You.

137
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,120
And she breathed life back into every room.

138
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,153
She redid all of it.

139
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,673
Every last detail.

140
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,478
- By yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

141
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,069
Wow.

142
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,998
So you're not just a pretty face.

143
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,911
I just came up to say
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

144
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,797
I'm sorry. I didn't...

145
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,553
You okay? Want some water?

146
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,030
Are you all right?

147
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,520
I'll be up soon.

148
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,279
Sure you don't want some water?

149
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,589
Just a little bit.

150
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,870
Here you go.

151
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,195
Sit down.

152
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,119
You just drank too much.

153
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,953
You're okay. It's okay.

154
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,639
Is everything all right?

155
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,877
He drank too much. He'll be fine.

156
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,951
- What is...
- Give him some privacy.

157
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,192
Okay, get it up.

158
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,994
Just get it all up.

159
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,036
- Good morning.
- Morning.

160
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
Smells great.

161
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
What happened last night?

162
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,232
I couldn't sleep. I got so excited.

163
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,916
From what?

164
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,799
His stories. I love the man's mind.

165
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,395
It is so inspiring, speaking to someone
who really appreciates the work.

166
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,589
I love your work.

167
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,754
Of course you do. I know that.

168
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
So is he better?

169
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,834
Pardon?

170
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,559
Is he feeling better?

171
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,313
- Is he all right?
- Fine, fine. One sec.

172
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,597
Oh, sorry. Just need a light.

173
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,829
Don't worry about it. I'll take it outside.

174
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,272
- Morning.
- Good morning.

175
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,113
How are you feeling?

176
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,270
Wonderful.

177
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
You're all better?

178
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,750
Better?

179
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,600
- Morning!
- Morning!

180
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,791
- How did you sleep?
- Like a baby.

181
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,874
Really vivid dreams. Must be the air.

182
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,950
Well, I'm confused.

183
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,040
- Who's that?
- I'll get it.

184
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,112
No, don't. I'll get it.

185
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,350
Expecting guests?

186
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,360
- We don't really get visitors.
- That would drive me crazy.

187
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,794
Tell me about it.

188
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,673
- Can I help you?
- Ah, you made it!

190
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,874
My better half.

191
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,191
- Get rid of that thing, won't you?
- I'm not inhaling.

192
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,432
Nice to meet you.

193
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,275
- Oh, the pleasure is mine.
- Well, come in.

194
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,792
I didn't realize you were married.

195
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,076
Really?

196
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,474
Breakfast!

197
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,199
- I'll grab her suitcase.
- Oh.

198
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
Oh, it's burning.

199
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,073
- No, don't!
- Oh!

200
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,757
- Oh, sorry.
- I got it!

201
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,036
- Sit down.
- I'll get the windows.

202
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,713
Let me look at it.

203
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,553
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

204
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,359
You're okay. Ice.

205
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,635
Ice!

206
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,757
So stupid.

207
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,232
It's not bad. It's fine. You're fine.

208
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,436
Oh.

209
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,239
- Thank you.
- I'm really so sorry.

210
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,879
Oh, don't worry about it.

211
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,594
It's very nice to meet you.

212
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,036
Very nice to meet... You.

213
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,920
Oh, please!

214
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,476
I'd given up on romance.

215
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,876
I was getting used to being alone.

216
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,474
Oh, thank you.

217
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,120
- But then...
- Yummy.

218
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,993
...it just happened for us.

219
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,472
I saw her, and I knew she was the woman

220
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,353
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

221
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,160
- Hmm. Love at first sight.
- Same here.

222
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah, right.

223
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,839
What? How could I resist this face?

224
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,673
You believe me, right?

225
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,679
Come. Sit already.

226
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,994
- So you never had a doubt?
- That's true.

227
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,152
- Oh, yeah. Come on.
- What?

228
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,352
- Didn't you have any doubts?
- No! Not a one.

229
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,115
You guys understand that kind
of connection, right?

230
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,076
You must.

231
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,873
I mean, you're both so different.

232
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,838
It must have been what pulled you together.

233
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,838
You're so beautiful. Come here.

234
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,835
And then the kids came and screwed it all up.

235
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,714
- You have kids?
- Two.

236
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,672
- Boys.
- Beautiful.

237
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,633
Here. This is my eldest.

238
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,279
Let me see.

239
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,955
- And then her baby.
- Oh, shut up.

240
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,953
- Oh, amazing eyes.
- Mmm.

241
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,516
And you two?

242
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,554
You have kids?

243
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,632
Not yet. But we want them.

244
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,320
Well, what are you waiting for?

245
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,676
Why not finish breakfast and get to it?

246
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,271
Well, I want to finish the house,

247
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,797
and he's working on a new piece.

248
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh, so you're writing again?

249
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,036
- Yeah.
- Oh.

250
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,471
- That's wonderful.
- Finally, right?

251
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,550
Yes.

252
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,913
Oh, no. We're in the way.

253
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,275
That's the last thing in the world...

254
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,714
No, no, not at all. No, no.

255
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,474
You're more than welcome
to stay here as long as you want.

256
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,559
That's very kind of you.

257
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,518
No, we couldn't impose.

258
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,159
Honey, they've got plenty of room.

259
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,390
Speaking of kids, do you have a phone?

260
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,675
I can't get a signal.

261
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,750
That's how we like it.

262
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,274
You don't have to call him every day.

263
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,919
There's one in the kitchen. I can show you.

264
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,354
No, it's all right.

265
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,116
Can we just relax for the weekend?

266
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,391
No, honey, I just want
to let him know we're okay.

267
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,636
Just a quick call.

268
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,880
What's wrong?

269
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,950
Why would you do that without asking me?

270
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,394
- Do what?
- Invite them to stay.

271
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,512
I didn't think it was a big deal.

272
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,236
- It's strange.
- What?

273
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,073
Did you know he had a wife?

274
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,914
What about your writing?

275
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,957
I was actually enjoying
not thinking about it.

276
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,034
But now that I am thinking about it,
I should go and do something about it.

277
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,635
Hey. Hey.

278
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,433
I really should work.

279
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,074
Lemonade!

280
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,190
Oops. Oh!

281
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,475
Careful.

282
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,639
Thought you might like some.

283
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,154
Yes, thank you.

284
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,119
Secret family recipe.

285
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,873
Which part? The lemons?

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,440
- How's your hand?
- Mmm.

287
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,871
- Still stinging.
- I'm sorry.

288
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,873
It's not like it was your fault.

289
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,872
You don't have any painkillers, do you?

290
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,792
Are you telling me the truth?

291
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,352
I really don't have any. I'm sorry.

292
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,115
Okay.

293
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,193
You're not thirsty?

294
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,396
Right.

295
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Now I get it.

296
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,160
- It's strong.
- I'm on my second.

297
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,471
I can't believe you did
all this work yourself.

298
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,396
- Why not?
- It's a lot.

299
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,080
Well, we spend all our time here.

300
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,879
I want to make it paradise.

301
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,713
And I love the work.

302
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,080
And it's exquisite.

303
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,430
Thank you.

304
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,998
Would you take me on a tour?

305
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,275
Sure.

306
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,871
I want to thank you for your hospitality.

307
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,880
Your husband has been so generous.

308
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,509
You're welcome.

309
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,274
Well, where to begin?

310
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,550
Well, this was the hardest part.

311
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,472
There was so much damage.
The treads were gone,

312
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,313
the railing, even the skylight.

313
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,756
So I had to get a lot of new material,
but I tried to save as much...

314
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,076
Isn't it a lot harder
than just starting fresh?

315
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,554
How do you mean?

316
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,389
Why didn't you just build a new house?

317
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,709
Well, it's...

318
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,434
It's his home.

319
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,240
Oh...

320
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,913
You really love him.

321
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,634
Can I ask you a question?

322
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
Why don't you want kids?

323
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,436
Excuse me?

324
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,796
I saw how you reacted earlier.

325
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,110
I know what it's like
when you're just starting out,

326
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,800
and you think you have
all the time in the world.

327
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,752
You know, you're not going
to be so young forever.

328
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
Have kids.

329
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,829
Then you'll be creating something together.

330
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,399
That's what keeps a marriage going.

331
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,358
This... This is all just

332
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,150
setting.

333
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,676
Oh, you do want them.

334
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,754
Is it him?

335
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,430
- I'm gonna get back to work.
- Then why did he say...

336
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,310
I'm sorry.

337
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,791
Was I too forward? I do that sometimes.

338
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,471
Every relationship has its issues.

339
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,438
And when there's
a full generation between you,

340
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,432
I can only imagine.

341
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,876
Is that where he works?

342
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,470
That's private.

343
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,075
Oh, can't you just give me a peek?

344
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,790
He doesn't like anyone
being in there without him!

345
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,954
Wow. You really do love him.

346
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,512
God help you.

347
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,436
Where are you going?

348
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,477
- I'm gonna take him outside.
- We're going on a hike.

349
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,070
A hike?

350
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,833
- Me on a hike!
- Just a quick one.

351
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,076
Go slow.

352
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,994
Yeah, slow enough so my smoke
doesn't burn too quickly.

353
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,754
- You don't want to come?
- No, we have laundry to do.

354
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,760
You'll show me where, right?

355
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,672
- Which way?
- Doesn't matter.

356
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,956
- The boys have bonded, don't you think?
- Mmm-hmm.

357
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,714
Mine's not usually such a nature boy.

358
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,277
Wow. Guess you haven't quite
got to this part yet.

359
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,511
This is so heavy.

360
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,120
That's a lot of tools.

361
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,350
I'll get it.

362
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,835
- Which is which?
- On the left.

363
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,318
Oh, it's full.

364
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,515
Oh, wait! I'll help you.

365
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,872
Oh, no. So that's the problem.

366
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,354
What?

367
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,677
You're gonna
have to try harder than this.

368
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,558
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,314
Believe me, when they get older,

370
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,474
you got to keep it interesting.

371
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,400
He's not that old.

372
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,119
How's it going in that department?

373
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,314
I don't feel comfortable
talking about that stuff.

374
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,710
I'm just trying to help.

375
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,551
I mean, look at you.

376
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,000
If he's not all over you,

377
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,470
it's either because of his age or...

378
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,110
Or what?

379
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,913
You know what? Forget it.

380
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,877
It's none of my business.

381
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,155
I think this has gone to my head.

382
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,674
No, it's okay. Say what you were gonna say.

383
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,070
No, seriously. No, obviously
he still loves you.

384
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,919
I'm gonna freshen these up.

385
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,390
Hello?

386
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,160
Hey!

387
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
I told you, he doesn't like
anyone being in here without him.

388
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,318
It's amazing. What is it?

389
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,272
We really have to leave.

390
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,157
- Please?
- I just want to look at it.

391
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,640
You have to go.

392
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,912
I don't know why you have
to make such a big deal of it.

393
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,115
Oh, they're back.

394
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,080
- This way. Here.
- Honey?

395
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,072
- Let's get you some water.
- Are you all right

396
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,032
Your damn smoking.

397
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,630
Here.

398
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,152
- You all right?
- Just started.

399
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,311
Come on. Let's go get you your pills.

400
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,076
If I wanted a third child...

401
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,709
I guess you overdid it.

402
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,158
Whew! That was intense.

403
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,959
And you won't believe what he just told me.

404
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,394
That sink's not braced yet.

405
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,830
What?

406
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,350
Hey, wait.

407
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,079
Something happened?

408
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,910
What?

409
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,751
What is it? What?

410
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,674
He has one of those pictures of you
in his luggage.

411
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,320
What were you doing in their luggage?

412
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,920
That's not the point.

413
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,839
He didn't just stumble on us.

414
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,997
- He's a crazy fan.
- I know.

415
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,070
Excuse me?

416
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,556
That's what he told me on our walk.

417
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,520
He's dying.

418
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,840
Oh.

419
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,673
That's why he came here.

420
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,509
He wanted to meet me before he's gone.

421
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,876
Well, why didn't he tell us that?

422
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,111
- Why lie?
- I don't know. I don't know.

423
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,953
He's a proud man.

424
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,390
I admire that.

425
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,876
Oh!

426
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,637
- What have you done?
- I'm so sorry.

427
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,474
We're both sorry.
I was telling her this story and...

428
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,960
It just... It just fell out of my hand.

429
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,509
- We'll search and find you another one.
- We can pay for it.

430
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,954
Quiet!

431
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,073
I'm sorry I screamed. I just need a moment.

432
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,073
It was an accident.

433
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,079
I think it's best if you leave.

434
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,233
We said we were sorry.

435
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,392
- Honey, don't antagonize her.
- Well, what more do you want?

436
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,279
Just... It'll be okay.

437
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,110
Please.

438
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,954
Please!

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,550
What are you doing?

440
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,871
They will never get in here again.

441
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,071
Well, don't worry. I'm kicking them out.

442
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,153
Yeah. And where will they go?

443
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,949
Need something?

444
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,471
- Are you ready?
- What do you mean?

445
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,074
We want you out.

446
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,800
We? Or you?

447
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,310
- I've tried very hard...
- Yeah, well, look,

448
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,312
I have to check on my husband.

449
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,391
Hello? Hello!

450
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,354
Where is everybody?

451
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,640
Oh, hey.

452
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,270
Hey, who are you?

453
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,071
Who are you? What are you doing here?

454
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,480
What are any of us doing here, right?

455
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,236
Where's my mother?

456
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,753
Uh, she's... Wait here.

457
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,835
Hey, nice view.

458
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,632
- Did you invite your son?
- What are you doing here?

459
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,393
Mom, I tried calling,
but I couldn't get through.

460
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,516
What's wrong?

461
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,080
He came to the house and found the will.

462
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,435
- What?
- Yeah, he's out of control.

463
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,715
I'm sorry, but whatever this is,

464
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,479
- you'll have to finish this...
- Dad!

465
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,880
- He's here?
- What? Oh, no.

466
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,519
- Who's that?
- Dad! Dad!

467
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,514
Yeah, ran straight to Mommy.

468
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,955
You followed me. What's wrong with you?

469
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,997
- You shouldn't be here.
- Where's Dad? Where is he?

470
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,878
Who is she? Who are you? Who are you?

471
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,469
- He doesn't want to see you.
- That's not true. Is he here?

472
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,960
- Dad!
- Boys?

473
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,190
Boys, why are you here?

474
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,471
What is this? Do you know what you've signed?

475
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,153
- Of course I do!
- Go lie back down.

476
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,396
You said that you told him.

477
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,954
No, honey, I didn't say that. I was going to.

478
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,793
You wanted this? How could you?

479
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,280
It's for a good reason, son.

480
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,396
Let me explain to him.

481
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,960
- I'll talk to him.
- No, I'll talk to him.

482
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,549
You're right. I should have told you myself.

483
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,950
And I'm sorry. I promise you
that I was thinking about you.

484
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,434
Stop it! About what's best for all of us.

485
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,556
Just listen to Dad!

486
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,472
It's a trust. You have to make a decision

487
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,552
as a group before anything can be spent.

488
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,840
It won't work. I have to get permission
from them every time I take a piss?

489
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,990
It will force you to get along.

490
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,150
That's the most important thing.

491
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,390
She will side with him every time.

492
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,470
You're not even listening to me!

493
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,512
No, no! I just want
to support both of you.

494
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,590
Support me?

495
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,160
You just want to tell me
what I can and can't do.

496
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,435
That is not fair!

497
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,512
You never believe
in me or anything I try to do.

498
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't do this, Dad. They hate me!

499
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,912
- They don't hate you.
- We love you.

500
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,076
You're my son.

501
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,480
Well, then treat me like one!

502
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,829
The sons are here.

503
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,794
They just barged in. I couldn't stop them.

504
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,870
I know.

505
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,440
Yeah, if you don't waste it all.

506
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,159
- Shut up!
- Here we go again.

507
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,799
Losing his temper
when he doesn't get his way.

508
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,593
Let's discuss this outside.
Our hosts are here.

509
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,114
No! I want to talk about it now.

510
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,078
- I want to talk about it now, Dad.
- Shut up!

511
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,594
If you need money, I'll give you money.

512
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't want your chump change!

513
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,639
Don't touch me!

514
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,990
Calm down. Calm down.

515
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,755
You're the poet? The great writer?

516
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,390
You don't know anything.

517
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,278
They lied to me, they're robbing me.

518
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,795
I don't know their story,
but will you calm down?

519
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,880
Will you?

520
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,190
Thank you.

521
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,040
You can sit in there.

522
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,994
Let's go sit down and discuss this.

523
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,719
No! Mom, Dad's dying,

524
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,031
and all he cares about is his damn money!

525
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,795
- No! Stop it!
- Boys! Boys, stop it!

526
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,712
Look at Dad! Look what you did!

527
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,190
Stop!

528
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,518
Boys! Stop it!

529
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,273
Stop! Please!

530
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,392
Can you breathe? Breathe.

531
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,950
No!

532
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,757
- Come here!
- Wait! Stop!

533
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,354
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

534
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,320
No! Stop!

535
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,556
No!

536
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,992
No! No!

537
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,510
Get off!

538
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,870
Get up.

539
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,034
Get up! Get up!

540
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,840
Stop faking. Get up.

541
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,594
Get up. Look at me!

542
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,116
No, look. It's not my fault.

543
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,431
It's not my fault.
They never really loved me.

544
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,080
They always loved him more.
They were leaving me behind.

545
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,833
Just tell me you understand.

546
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,320
Tell me you understand!

547
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,080
You have to understand.

548
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,434
What have you done to your brother?

549
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,074
My baby. My baby.

550
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,080
What did you do?

551
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,712
What did you do?

552
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,879
You did this.

553
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,600
Wake up! Do something! Help him!

554
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,712
- Towels. Towels.
- Okay.

555
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,112
- Easy now.
- Father...

556
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,953
- The doctor. Go get him.
- Okay.

557
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,440
- Come quick!
- What?

558
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,358
- What's happening?
- He's bleeding.

559
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,955
- It's bad! It's really bad.
- He's not waking up. He's not waking up.

560
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,874
Careful. Careful! Don't drop him.

561
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,394
I'll call you from the hospital.

562
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,955
- Keep his head up.
- No! No, please stay with me.

563
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,269
Please, we need him.

564
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,919
Lock the doors.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

565
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,559
Please don't leave me! Please don't leave me!

566
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,670
Hey.

567
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,920
They left you all alone?

568
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,434
You do understand.

569
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,230
Good luck.

570
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,756
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

571
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,672
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

572
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,230
You all right?

573
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,436
He was here!

574
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,193
I know. I know. The police brought me home.

575
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,350
They'll find him. Don't worry.

576
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,590
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

577
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,909
- No?
- No.

578
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,990
Okay.

579
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,999
Okay, sit.

580
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,271
Let me get you some water.

581
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,235
Here.

582
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,109
It's okay.

583
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,034
It's all right.

584
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,111
What happened at the hospital?

585
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,591
I was holding the boy's hand when he died.

586
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,000
Oh, that's awful.

587
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,074
Are you all right?

588
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,719
I'm exhausted.

589
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,719
I need a hot shower.

590
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,275
Will you come?

591
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,990
Yeah.

592
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,840
What is it?

593
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,400
- I'll be up in a minute.
- You sure?

594
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,070
Yeah.

595
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,116
In here?

596
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,991
Yeah, straight ahead in the kitchen.

597
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,909
They came back quick.

598
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,920
What are they doing here?

599
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,990
They had nowhere to go,

600
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,670
so I told them it would be all right
to invite some friends and family.

601
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,600
I'll go deal with them.

602
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,356
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

603
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,113
I'm so sorry for your loss.

604
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,874
You're all so welcome here.

605
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,360
Please make yourselves at home.

606
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,193
I'm so sorry.

607
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,159
Shall we have a toast?

608
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,070
Yes, let's.

609
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,038
Make sure everyone has one.

610
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,429
Would you say something?

611
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,000
He so respects you.

612
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,759
- Of course.
- Thank you.

613
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,194
Everyone.

614
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,630
Well, how can one begin
to understand your pain?

615
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,200
The sacrifice of the parent.

616
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,356
Here you go.

617
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,636
All those years of worry.

618
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,515
Years in days, days in hours,
hours in seconds.

619
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,353
But in each second,

620
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,556
an infinite amount of love.

621
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,520
And now,

622
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,314
suddenly,

623
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,072
it seems there is nothing to love.

624
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,038
Just a vast and silent darkness.

625
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,871
But fear not.

626
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,833
From inside it, there's a voice
crying out to be heard...

627
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,277
...loud and strong.

628
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,954
Just listen.

629
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,114
Oh, God.

630
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,359
Do you hear that?

631
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,236
Do you hear that? That is the sound of life.

632
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,391
That is the sound of humanity.

633
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,752
That is your son's voice.

634
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,713
His cry of love.

635
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,793
His love for you.

636
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,960
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

637
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,230
Hear, hear!

638
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,310
Hear, hear!

639
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,917
Thank you all for coming here
and being with us tonight.

640
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,550
My husband and I are so touched.

641
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,149
We lost our baby today.

642
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,550
I just...

643
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,393
I can't believe that just a few hours ago,

644
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,394
he was standing there,
and I was holding him in my arms.

645
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,392
He was so full of life.

646
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,840
He always was.

647
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,038
- Hello.
- Thank you.

648
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,997
- Where should I put this?
- Maybe in here.

649
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,350
Now he'll never wander again.

650
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,830
I'll never hold him again like I did today.

651
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,356
He'll never laugh again.

652
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,071
I just want to thank you all for being here.

653
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,797
It means so much.
I don't know what else to say.

654
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,434
I just want to thank
our dear host for his hospitality

655
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,233
- in our time of need.
- Of course.

656
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,920
So, please,

657
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,797
I'd like to drink to your kindness.

658
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,074
Excuse me.

659
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,512
Sweetheart, you don't have to do this.

660
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,193
No, I want to.

661
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,439
I loved my son.

662
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,720
I loved him.

663
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,593
I can't believe this.

664
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,717
But I shouldn't be eulogizing him.

665
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,910
He'd say...

666
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,637
I'm sorry...

667
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,440
I'm sorry. I can't.

668
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,112
Would someone please...

669
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,599
Would you say something?

670
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,716
I...

671
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,394
For your child.

672
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,554
For both your children. Come.

673
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,075
Let's not forget the one
still in the wilderness.

674
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,871
Wherever he goes, wherever he is...

675
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,360
Welcome. Please join us.

676
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,840
I'm just gonna put this in the kitchen.

677
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,036
Yes, through there.

678
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,431
May he find kindness, compassion...

679
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,271
- I'll wait here.
- I'll be right back.

680
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,914
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good, considering.

681
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,673
Um, excuse me. Could you get down from there?

682
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,035
That sink's not braced yet.

683
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,713
Oh, I'm sorry.

684
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,834
Oh, there's glass there.

685
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,430
That was so beautiful, no?

686
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,314
It's all right.

687
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,715
Can I use your phone?

688
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,952
Sure. It's in the kitchen.

689
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,750
No, it's just...

690
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,120
Excuse me?

691
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,434
Where did you go?

692
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,474
I was just in the...

693
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,555
I'm really sorry, again.

694
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,154
I know you are.

695
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,120
- I can't imagine...
- No.

696
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,873
You can't imagine what it feels like
if you don't have a child.

697
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,310
You give, and you give, and you give, and...

698
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,751
It's just never enough.

699
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,514
- I understand.
- Do you?

700
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,794
Why don't you at least
put on something decent?

701
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,390
Hey!

702
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,910
You can't be in here.

703
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,999
- I'm sorry?
- You need to leave.

704
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,198
- We'll just be a minute.
- This is our room!

705
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,030
It's okay.

706
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,920
It's your room.

707
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,351
Come on. Let's find another spot.

708
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,116
Oh.

709
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,316
Excuse me.

710
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,039
Just exploring.

711
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,350
Excuse me.

712
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,794
Could you please go downstairs?

713
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,716
- This way?
- Yes.

714
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,670
Sure.

715
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,434
What is...

716
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,640
What are you doing?

717
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,710
Oh, it's no big deal.

718
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,354
I worked my way through college doing this.

719
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,955
But why are you painting my house?

720
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,036
Well, he's been so kind to everyone,
it's the least we could do.

721
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,470
Stop!

722
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,711
Both of you. Stop!

723
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,310
No problem.

724
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,477
Yes, of course. What's mine is yours.

725
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,392
There you are! My goddess. Come here.

726
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,876
Please, make some room for her.

727
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,997
You've got to hear these stories.

728
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,230
All these people!

729
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,834
I know. They're just letting off steam.

730
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,514
They're painting our house!

731
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,000
Oh!

732
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,393
You all right?

733
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,153
I told you to stop drinking.

734
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,316
I got it.

735
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,153
- Napkins!
- Yeah, I got some.

736
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,998
- Are you all right?
- The chair might not be all right.

737
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,070
After spending
a few days with my mother...

738
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,231
Please! Get down from there.

739
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,794
Sorry.

740
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,075
Excuse me.

741
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,351
- What's her problem?
- I don't know.

742
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,430
Hey, we haven't met.

743
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,557
I've known this family for years. And you?

744
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,589
This is my house.

745
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,240
Well, it's a beautiful home.
You want to take a walk?

746
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,956
- What?
- A walk. With me.

747
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,353
No. No.

748
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,280
Please!

749
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,956
- Take my number.
- No, I don't want your number.

750
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,714
Why would you say that?
You don't even know me.

751
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,519
- Let go of me!
- Why?

752
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,159
Because I don't know you.

753
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,040
- Get down from there.
- From where?

754
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,396
You don't know what I could do for you.

755
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,199
I don't want anything from you.

756
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,470
Sassy.

757
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,479
Leave me alone.

758
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,111
You know what? Get out of my face.

759
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,078
You're an arrogant cunt.

760
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,639
This sink. There's nothing wrong with it.

761
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,710
It's really okay.

762
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,231
No, stop doing that. Don't do that. Stop!

763
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,392
Stop doing that! Stop, stop!

764
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,154
Get out! Get out, all of you!

765
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,470
What happened?

766
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,990
They won't listen!

767
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,915
It's all right. We'll fix it.
It can be fixed.

768
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,072
- We're being punished.
- Please, don't go. Don't go.

769
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,913
- We'll turn it off.
- It's been an honor.

770
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,593
We will never forget all you've done for us.

771
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,080
But where will you go?

772
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,720
They're gone.

773
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,956
Come. Let's go to bed.
You don't need to do that.

774
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,236
Do what?

775
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,314
Clean up their mess?

776
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,359
We did a good thing.

777
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,033
They needed a place to celebrate life.

778
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,190
They needed tonight.

779
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,919
What about what I needed?

780
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,877
A boy died here today. I mopped up his blood.

781
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,476
- And you abandoned me.
- No, no, I didn't abandon you.

782
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,718
They just lost a son.
They lost, well, two sons!

783
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,634
I was helping them.
This is not about us. It's about them.

784
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,474
No! It's not about them. It's about you.

785
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,032
It's always about you and your work.

786
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,311
You think that's gonna help you write?

787
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,232
Nothing does!

788
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,994
I rebuilt this entire house, wall to wall.

789
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,799
You haven't written a word!

790
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,078
I know! I know! I'm sorry!
I can't... I can't write!

791
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,310
I can't think!

792
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,154
All I'm trying to do
is bring life into this house!

793
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,074
Open the door to new people, new ideas.

794
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,159
You think you can't breathe?

795
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,118
I'm the one who's suffocating here

796
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,990
while you pretend that nothing is wrong!

797
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,800
"Everything will be all right.
Everything will be good.

798
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,950
"You'll be fine." You know what?

799
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,590
Life doesn't always work out
the way you want it to.

800
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,395
You're right.

801
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,880
Mine certainly didn't.

802
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,270
Excuse me?

803
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,160
You talk about wanting kids,
but you can't even fuck me.

804
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,110
- Come here. Come here!
- No! No!

805
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,760
I'm pregnant.

806
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,990
Hmm?

807
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,433
We're gonna have a baby.

808
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,640
I'm serious.

809
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,679
How could you know?

810
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,713
Because I know.

811
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,550
I'm pregnant.

812
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,713
A baby...

813
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,315
- Are you happy?
- Happy?

814
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,677
That's the most beautiful gift.

815
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,150
What?

816
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,311
Pen, pen, pen.

817
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,920
What are you doing?

818
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,350
I'm writing.

819
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,160
- What?
- Writing.

820
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,913
Last night, those people.

821
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,589
Their pain. Their love
behind the pain. And then...

822
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,150
You.

823
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,430
Us.

824
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,672
And now that.

825
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,760
Life.

826
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,353
It's coming to me. It's...

827
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,354
I know what to say.
I have to find the words. That's all.

828
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,670
Amazing.

829
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,633
Well, I won't...

830
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,870
I don't want to interrupt.

831
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,476
I'll just get started on the apocalypse.

832
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,550
Hey.

833
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,230
I love you.

834
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,709
It moved! It moved!

835
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,395
What is it?

836
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,914
Is that it?

837
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,754
I finished it.

838
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,390
May I?

839
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,320
It's beautiful.

840
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,995
Really?

841
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,754
Why are you crying?

842
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,110
It's just a lot.

843
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,514
You think it's good?

844
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,680
It's perfect.

845
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,199
But then what's going on?

846
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,640
Am I going to lose you?

847
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,190
Never.

848
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,470
Hello?

849
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,040
Hi.

850
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,310
Yes?

851
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,470
Really?

852
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,153
- Really.
- Who is that?

853
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,949
One moment. Give me a second. They loved it.

854
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,475
Who did?

855
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,394
What? Yeah, I'll be here, standing by.

856
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,559
Are you there? Hello?

857
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,712
- Who was that?
- My publisher.

858
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,480
- She's read it?
- Yes. Of course. Why?

859
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,510
Yes.

860
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,229
Hi, again.

861
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,836
Press? Uh, well, you know
how I feel about it.

862
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,279
I'd rather not. But if you think it's a must.

863
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,435
I'll be here, waiting.

864
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,673
Wow, amazing!

865
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,872
Well, we're celebrating.

866
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,874
One day, every copy sold.

867
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,953
You're so beautiful.

868
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,632
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll go get everything.

869
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,039
Looks delicious.

870
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,631
- Let me help you.
- No, sit.

871
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,870
No, I'm helping.

872
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,229
Okay.

873
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,393
Will you bring the bread in?

874
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,320
All right.

875
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,831
No. Wait, please. Can I see him?

876
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,352
Excuse me, I have a question.

877
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,719
What are you doing?

878
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,232
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

879
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,480
Please. Wait.

880
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,750
What do they want?

881
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,190
I don't know. They've come here to see me.

882
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,554
Please! I just want to
get a photo with him.

883
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,155
He'll be back in a moment.

884
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,436
Just keep everything warm. I'll be right in.

885
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,956
You had a question.

886
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,070
- Yeah.
- What is it?

887
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,199
As I was saying, we've
all traveled a great distance,

888
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,237
and I feel that, uh...

889
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,671
Well, these words,

890
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,514
I feel like they were written for me.

891
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,000
Of course they were.

892
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,194
My goddess! Come here.

893
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,996
Come.

894
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,354
- No, stay away from me!
- Please leave her. Thank you.

895
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,318
They love it. They understand all of it.

896
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,914
But it affects everyone in a different way.

897
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,276
It is remarkable.
Come. They want to meet you.

898
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,272
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to. Come inside.

899
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,193
But they've come from so far.

900
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,480
Look at me!

901
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,358
I'm about to have our baby.

902
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,954
Why is that not enough for you?

903
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,919
Of course it's enough.

904
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,760
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here, with you.

905
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,515
I want to be alone with you.

906
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,114
I'm with you.

907
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,395
Give me a second.

908
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,953
Come, come, come. Quick, quick.

909
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,076
Just hang in there. Hold it in.

910
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,190
Hey!

911
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,312
I'm sure there's a bathroom really close.

912
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,595
- Hold it in.
- Excuse me.

913
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,114
Do you know where the bathroom is?

914
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,317
- You need to leave.
- Where should I go?

915
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,750
I don't know, but you can't be in here.

916
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,194
But my son, he, um...

917
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,110
Oh...

918
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,479
Okay. Come with me.

919
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,717
Thank you so much.
I'll come back and clean up.

920
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,393
Did you open this?

921
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,473
Okay, here we go.
Just a little bit longer.

922
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,433
It's okay. We'll get you dried off.

923
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,357
After you've finished,
I really need you to go back outside.

924
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,160
What are you doing?

925
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,159
How about a little privacy?

926
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,835
Please?

927
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,235
Sir!

928
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,994
I've been waiting a long time. Excuse me.

929
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,952
- Hey, wait your turn, lady.
- No!

930
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,276
How did you get in here?

931
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,840
Could you get the two of us, please?

932
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,314
- No, I got it. I got it.
- Thanks.

933
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,949
- Okay, get down on the floor.
- It's beautiful.

934
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,470
Don't touch that!

935
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,949
It's so organic.

936
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,833
Hey, stop pushing!

937
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,917
All of you need to go outside.

938
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,034
Hey! Sir!

939
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,557
I'm just gonna lie down for a bit.
I don't feel so good.

940
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,758
- No, no, you cannot lie down here.
- Why? You staying in here?

941
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,559
I live here. This is my house.

942
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,911
"My house"? "My house"?

943
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,277
The poet says it's everyone's house!

944
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,353
Food and drink, my friends.

945
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:01,634
I believe it's, um,
yes, right back here.

946
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,870
Hey!

947
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,314
Oh, this is nice.
We've got vegetables...

948
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,914
Stop! All of you.

949
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,639
Check the cabinets. And the fridge!

950
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,074
What are you doing?

951
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,196
Oh, beautiful!

952
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,911
No! No! That's not for you.

953
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,673
He said to share.

954
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,276
But it's not yours!

955
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,274
They're hungry and thirsty. Here you go.

956
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,674
Now, take the fruit and
the cheese and the pickles.

957
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,190
Excuse me. Watch your backs.

958
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,432
You can put that over there.
And that goes over there. Thank you.

959
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,439
- Looks great, let's share it.
- I'll slice this up.

960
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,476
You can sit here, sir.

961
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,029
There'll be
no photos, just autographs!

962
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,874
Your writing is so beautiful.

963
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,952
What is this? What are you doing?

964
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,236
I'm showing them my appreciation.

965
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,720
- Hey!
- Oh, hi!

966
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,315
Oh! My genius.

967
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,120
Look at you.

968
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,554
- The second printing is here.
- Great.

969
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,393
Yes. I wish you would've told me
about this turnout.

970
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,836
- Have you met my...
- There she is.

971
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,070
Oh...

972
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,710
The inspiration.

973
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,510
All right, I have to be honest.

974
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,559
I was a little worried about him
being holed up here with you.

975
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,034
I was nervous you'd never write again.

976
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,150
Of course not.

977
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,836
But whatever you did, it was worth it.

978
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,631
And look at you. You're ready to pop!

979
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,159
How are you feeling? Hot?

980
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,471
It's hot in here. Is it me? It's broiling.

981
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,550
I've got it right here.

982
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,994
Oh, yes. Will you excuse me?

983
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,634
Let me see. Take it out!

984
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,631
Oh, yes. That's exactly what I wanted.

985
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,156
- Um, the original, where is it?
- It's right there by the desk.

986
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,680
- I've got it!
- Excuse me.

987
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,312
- I've got it.
- I'll take that, thank you.

988
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,512
- Oh. No, it's okay.
- No, don't touch it!

989
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,160
- No, it's fine.
- Don't touch it!

990
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,999
- No! Get your hands off it!
- What happened?

991
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,152
Wait, wait! Easy, easy, easy.

992
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,034
I'm trying to put it in this frame.

993
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,198
Okay, I'll do it. It's all good.

994
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,840
Hey!

995
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,475
Hey!

996
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,751
Stop! Give that back. Give it back.

997
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,958
No, I have to have something of his! No!

998
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,679
It's mine!

999
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,078
You did it! Now I got to find something else!

1000
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,192
Get out! All of you!

1001
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,556
Stop! This doesn't belong to you!

1002
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,230
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

1003
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,640
Can you help me?

1004
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,915
<i>What is your emergency, ma'am?</i>

1005
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,032
They're stealing everything!

1006
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,310
Thank you.

1007
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,720
I was using that!

1008
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,076
That's all right. Share, like the poet said.

1009
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,480
Yeah, share.

1010
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,392
That's not right.

1011
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,991
Look, he marked you. He marked you.

1012
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,231
- Me, too. Please.
- Okay.

1013
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,553
- Oh, thank you.
- Stop!

1014
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,873
Stop! Stop touching him!

1015
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,793
They're ruining everything.

1016
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,270
Those are just things.

1017
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,431
They can be replaced. Don't worry.

1018
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,273
- Forgive me. Just a few shots.
- Of course.

1019
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,715
- Here we go.
- No!

1020
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,678
Look right in the lens,
make sure you're getting him.

1021
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,750
No, no, no, no, don't go!

1022
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,990
Please, just one more!

1023
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,394
You're welcome to
pin your thanks on the door.

1024
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,880
His words are yours.

1025
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,110
<i>Gracias.</i>

1026
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,718
Watch your step going down.

1027
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,720
Next, please. Step forward.

1028
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,759
His words are yours.

1029
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,197
If you please,
pin your thoughts on the wall.

1030
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,994
Step forward.

1031
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,673
- His words are yours.
- Thank you.

1032
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,989
Next.

1033
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,270
There you are!

1034
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,476
Where have you been hiding?

1035
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,360
Why are you doing this?

1036
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,954
Proof we were here.

1037
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,439
- Get off of me!
- What the hell!

1038
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,119
I'll kill you!

1039
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,796
- Watch your back.
- Heads up. Coming through.

1040
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,791
No! Don't.

1041
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,314
- Hey!
- No! Let go!

1042
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,312
No, you can't leave! He loves you!

1043
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,711
I got it. Where are you going?
Don't. Don't go.

1044
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,029
You don't want me here.

1045
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,232
Come here. Look here.

1046
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,356
- I'm here.
- I can't.

1047
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,552
Listen, I have to tell you something.

1048
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,510
What?

1049
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,910
The baby? The baby?

1050
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,916
- Come here. Come, come.
- Lock the back door!

1051
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,672
We need space! We need space!

1052
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,472
Hold on here. I'll be right back.

1053
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,391
Back! Back! Give us some room!

1054
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,830
Police! Get on the ground!

1055
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,673
Help me. Help me. No!

1056
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,796
Against the wall!

1057
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,314
Please don't! My baby! Please don't!

1058
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,239
Get off her! Get off!

1059
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,760
Back off!

1060
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,275
I call dibs!

1061
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,030
Ah!

1062
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,156
Where you going, huh? Get inside!

1063
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,711
Somebody help us, please!

1064
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,310
Shut up!

1065
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,319
- How's Angel?
- Tainted.

1066
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,920
Check the <i>goyim.</i>

1067
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,195
Move!

1068
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,072
- I didn't do anything!
- Get in there!

1069
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,630
- Quiet!
- Keep your mouths shut.

1070
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,920
The inspiration!

1071
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,754
Where have you been hiding?

1072
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,070
Finish her.

1073
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,474
On your knees!

1074
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,593
All right, six more.

1075
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,076
<i>Disperse!</i>

1076
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:19,750
Freeze!

1077
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,238
Oh, no. Come on.

1078
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,116
Are you hurt?

1079
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,916
The baby...

1080
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,280
Medic!

1081
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,195
This way.

1082
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,959
Go, hurry. Just go!

1083
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,237
My darling! It's me! It's me.

1084
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,880
What's happening?

1085
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,874
I don't know.
I have to take you somewhere safe.

1086
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,394
- There.
- No, no, no.

1087
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,675
- Out!
- It's too dangerous.

1088
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,240
Come with me. Quietly.

1089
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,270
This way.

1090
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,071
- The door!
- No, no, it's this way.

1091
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,152
It's him! It's the poet!

1092
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,074
He hasn't forsaken us after all!

1093
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,753
We need to hurry. Stay close.

1094
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,311
We need money! We need to eat! Please!

1095
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,673
Get back! Get back!
Please, no, I can't! I can't!

1096
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,275
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't!

1097
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,837
I will not forget you.

1098
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,236
Poet, over here! Come on!

1099
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,392
Up here! Up here!

1100
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,393
Up there! Up there.

1101
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,993
They will protect us.

1102
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,238
Come. I've got you.

1103
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,240
Grab the hand.

1104
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,192
Get back! Get back! I will return!

1105
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,392
Hold them back!

1106
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,520
Sit here. Rest.

1107
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,192
- I'm a doctor!
- A doctor? Please help her.

1108
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,235
Help her, please. Here. I'll be right back.

1109
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,474
Oh, that's good.

1110
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,712
Don't leave us!

1111
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:44,790
Get off!

1112
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,917
Look at me. Listen to my voice.

1113
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,630
The baby's almost here.

1114
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,236
Just a little bit further.
You can do this.

1115
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,800
Push.

1116
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,155
Just push.

1117
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,390
- No.
- Yes, yes!

1118
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,592
You have to push. Push!

1119
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,554
Push. You're almost there. Yes!

1120
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,239
Do it again.

1121
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,872
Yes, you're doing very good.

1122
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,311
- I can feel the head.
- Please move. I've got her.

1123
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,160
- Wait! I can help.
- I'm delivering my baby!

1124
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,198
- Let me help!
- Shut the door!

1125
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,760
Shut it!

1126
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,830
We're safe.

1127
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,752
It's okay. Our baby's coming.

1128
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,675
Our baby's coming. Our baby's coming.

1129
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,434
Our baby's coming.

1130
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,876
Okay.

1131
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,360
It's almost here.

1132
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,031
It's here. It's coming. It's coming!

1133
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,880
<i>It's a boy.</i>

1134
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,716
It's a boy.

1135
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,799
It's a boy, look.

1136
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,520
It's a boy.

1137
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,320
Cover him.

1138
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,760
What's happening?

1139
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,435
Why are they so quiet?

1140
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,835
I don't know.

1141
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:30,950
Don't!

1142
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,520
Don't do that.

1143
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,115
It's okay.

1144
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,357
Shut the door.

1145
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,550
Seal it!

1146
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,678
They brought us gifts.

1147
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,518
- Here.
- What are they doing?

1148
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:15,554
They're just waiting.

1149
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,954
Waiting for what?

1150
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,194
I don't know.

1151
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,680
Make them go.

1152
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,520
Please.

1153
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,520
Please make them.

1154
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,678
- Please.
- Okay, okay.

1155
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,833
More gifts. Look. Look.

1156
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,676
For you. Clean clothes.

1157
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,514
Are they leaving?

1158
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,550
What?

1159
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,640
No, they... They just want to see him.

1160
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,710
No.

1161
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,513
Make them go.

1162
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,670
I can't. I can't.

1163
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,390
Yes, you can! They adore you.
They would listen to you.

1164
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,996
- Why won't you?
- I don't want them to go!

1165
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,874
He's beautiful.

1166
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,999
- Let me hold him.
- No.

1167
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,353
Okay, let me hold him.

1168
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,230
- Let me hold my baby.
- No.

1169
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,593
- Let me hold him.
- No.

1170
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,994
- I'm his father!
- I'm his mother!

1171
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,074
- Here, let me...
- No!

1172
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,560
Please?

1173
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,551
Please make them go.

1174
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,352
No. No. No.

1175
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,316
No!

1176
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,039
Give me back my baby!

1177
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,360
Where is he?

1178
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,954
Wait! Stop!

1179
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,674
No! That's my baby!

1180
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,272
No! No! Give me back...

1181
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,432
- Hallelujah!
- Praise be!

1182
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,996
Hallelujah!

1183
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,434
You're gonna hurt him!

1184
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,030
Please! Please! Please!

1185
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,800
You're gonna hurt him!

1186
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,072
You're hurting him! You're hurting him!

1187
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,320
Where is he?

1188
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,112
- Where's my baby?
- He's not dead.

1189
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,237
- What? Where is he?
- A voice

1190
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,956
still cries out to be heard, loud and strong.

1191
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,993
- Listen.
- What?

1192
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,673
Do you hear that?

1193
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,834
No! No!

1194
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,600
Do you hear that?

1195
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,992
That's the sound of life.

1196
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,432
The sound of humanity!

1197
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,473
His cry of love!

1198
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,677
His love for you!

1199
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,518
Get off! Get off!

1200
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,237
You killed him!

1201
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,713
- Die, cunt!
- Dirty whore!

1202
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,155
Slut! Bitch!

1203
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,640
Fat pig!

1204
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,870
You bitch!

1205
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,595
Take that, tramp!

1206
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,312
- Cunt!
- Kill the pig!

1207
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,910
Please!

1208
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,231
Please stop! Stop, please!

1209
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,160
Go away. Leave her alone. What are you doing?

1210
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,640
Look what they've done to you.

1211
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,832
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1212
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,437
They killed my baby!

1213
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:45,071
You killed him.

1214
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,679
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1215
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,680
They just want to see him. They just
want to touch him, and then they...

1216
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,680
It was...

1217
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:58,397
It's horrible. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1218
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,114
But we can't...

1219
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,795
We can't let him die for nothing. We can't.

1220
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,150
Maybe what happened could change everything.

1221
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,040
Everyone.

1222
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,278
- What are you talking about?
- We...

1223
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:18,000
You and I, we have to find
a way to forgive them.

1224
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,039
They butchered our son!

1225
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,551
I know. I know.

1226
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,394
You're insane.

1227
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,712
- Listen to me.
- You're insane.

1228
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,349
Well, listen to them. They are so sorry.

1229
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:36,834
They are truly sorry.

1230
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,719
Listen. Have faith in me. Please. Please.

1231
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,913
We need to forgive them.
We need to forgive them!

1232
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,232
Please. Please! We have to!

1233
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,434
No!

1234
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,111
Murderers!

1235
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,114
Murderer!

1236
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,316
It's time to get the fuck out of my house!

1237
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,195
No, no. No, no, no!

1238
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,272
No! Please! Don't leave!

1239
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,113
Please! I beg you!

1240
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,796
Don't run off! We will rebuild!

1241
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,315
Don't! Don't leave me alone!

1242
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,635
This way! She went down here!

1243
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:08,199
Stop! Stop! Wait. Wait.

1244
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,319
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1245
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,840
Please don't.

1246
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,160
I love you.

1247
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,114
You never loved me.

1248
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,396
You just loved how much I loved you.

1249
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,554
I gave you everything!

1250
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,192
You gave it all away.

1251
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,553
No. No. No.

1252
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,712
No, no, no, no!

1253
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,520
What are you?

1254
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,710
Me?

1255
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,439
I am I.

1256
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,270
You?

1257
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:39,840
You were home.

1258
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,072
Where are you taking me?

1259
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:49,990
The beginning.

1260
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,270
Is that it?

1261
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,636
It won't hurt much longer.

1262
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,757
What hurts me the most
is that I wasn't enough.

1263
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,953
It's not your fault.

1264
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,999
Nothing is ever enough.

1265
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,911
I couldn't create if it was.

1266
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:31,075
And I have to. That's what I do.

1267
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,432
That's what I am.

1268
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:39,154
Now I must try it all again.

1269
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,470
No.

1270
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,553
Just let me go.

1271
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,591
I need one last thing.

1272
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,995
I have nothing left to give.

1273
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,070
Your love.

1274
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,079
It's still there, isn't it?

1275
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,430
Go ahead.

1276
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,270
Take it.

1277
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:20,876
Baby?
