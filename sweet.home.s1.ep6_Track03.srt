ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,327
SEPTEMBER 2000

3
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,328
Why did you do it?

4
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,214
Who are you?

5
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:09,840
Why did you do it?

6
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,887
-You've grown a lot.
-Answer me.

7
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:21,393
It was just a prank.

8
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:22,645
Don't come!

9
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:26,023
Don't come, Sang-wook!

10
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:27,858
I didn't think that would happen.

11
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:37,159
It would've been nice
if it had rained like this that day.

12
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,078
Don't you agree?

13
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,001
Don't show up again.

14
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,629
I was already punished.

15
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:52,383
…sentenced to 11 months in prison
and 2 years of supervised probation.

16
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:03,519
Who decides that?

17
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:06,147
Who decides that?

18
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,450
I hear you kill people for money.

19
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,494
Do you also find people?

20
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,746
JULY 2020

21
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,749
I asked him where my daughter was.
He said she was here

22
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,293
and gave this to me.

23
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,211
The bastard that kidnapped my daughter.

24
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,842
Look at her smiling because
she doesn't realize anything.

25
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:38,095
She asked him to take a nice picture
since it's for me.

26
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:45,269
I was going to buy pesticides with this.

27
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,521
I have no will to live.

28
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,692
Then just die.

29
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,533
But how can I?

30
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:02,578
That son of a bitch is still alive
and running around freely,

31
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,705
but I don't know where my daughter is!

32
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,082
Why are the police stopping me? Why?

33
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,709
How is that the law?

34
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,294
How?

35
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:12,838
How is that the law?

36
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,094
How is that the law?

37
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,888
Please find her.

38
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,183
Please find her.

39
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,645
You're the only one I can turn to now.

40
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:36,153
Please find her.

41
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,280
Please…

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,616
What is this?

43
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,166
Son of a bitch…

44
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,418
That man's a murderer!

45
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,337
I was already punished.

46
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,047
How is that the law?

47
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:57,549
How is that the law?

48
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,722
You fucking murderer.

49
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,616
Don't touch me.

50
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,468
Take care of the rest on your own.

51
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,442
GUARD ON DUTY

52
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,855
Nobody's going to take it.

53
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,067
Gosh.

54
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:40,235
You scared me to death.

55
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,155
I'll pick it up for you, so give me that.

56
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,867
Give you what? My liver?

57
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,833
Are you really going to be like this?

58
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,628
Can't I even look at it?

59
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,302
You can only look.

60
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,183
I'll be watching you.

61
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:16,313
Do you have any left?

62
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,277
There's enough.

63
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,505
Shouldn't we kick him out?

64
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:43,465
For what reason?

65
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:45,884
For catching a murderer?

66
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,803
He didn't catch him. He killed him.

67
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:50,305
It was self-defense.

68
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,558
Yun-jae that bastard deserved to die.

69
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,685
If it weren't for that thug,

70
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,687
-one of us would've--
-So what?

71
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:58,939
He's still a murderer.

72
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,692
He might kill again. You never know.

73
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,237
It could be any one of us…

74
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,552
Thank you.

75
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:45,444
Right now, this is all I have…

76
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,844
I think I'll be joining Yun-a soon.

77
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:59,768
If you're still looking for her,

78
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:02,854
please stop.

79
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:07,609
I hope you're safe.

80
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,156
Thank you very much.

81
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,000
Why are you burning money?

82
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,129
I was paid to do an errand.

83
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:31,842
I failed.

84
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,888
Why am I here?

85
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,693
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,903
I saw the text message.

87
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,744
I THINK I'LL BE JOINING YUN-A SOON.

88
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,495
Not everyone agrees,

89
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:03,332
but you can stay if you want.

90
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,796
I don't think what you did was right.

91
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,216
But you did what you had to do.

92
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,846
FROM 7,800 WON

93
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,271
Can anyone…

94
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,027
pray?

95
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,825
Yes, of course.

96
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,335
You do it.

97
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:50,962
Why me?

98
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,891
Because God probably likes you
more than me.

99
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:02,993
Help!

100
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,132
This is just great.

101
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,052
Have fun.

102
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,478
Are they really siblings?

103
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,063
Was she adopted or something?

104
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,775
Let's call it a day.

105
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:18,819
Good work.

106
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,364
-Lower it.
-Okay.

107
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,574
Slowly.

108
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,480
JUNE 2020

109
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:57,107
Are you finished?

110
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:59,776
Yes, I checked it thoroughly

111
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:02,320
because I like you.

112
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,116
How is the condition?

113
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:08,994
Well…

114
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,080
It's pretty okay for such an old building.

115
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,625
When do you get off work?

116
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,586
Let's have dinner together.

117
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,054
I wish we could.

118
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:36,354
Do you only go home to Seoul once a month?

119
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,024
They're working you too hard.

120
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,942
I'm sorry.

121
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,365
What can I do?

122
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,660
You look sexy when you work,
so I'll let it slide.

123
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,829
CHIEF PHYSICIAN NAM SANG-WON

124
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,042
What's "Crucru"?

125
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,961
Is it your blog? It's logged in.

126
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,338
Hey, Yi-kyung.

127
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:02,422
Well…

128
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,257
When is it?

129
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,509
Our wedding photo shoot?

130
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:07,886
What?

131
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,138
What's this? You're acting suspiciously.

132
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,223
-What?
-What are you hiding?

133
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,100
Did you write you don't want
to get married?

134
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,144
No, it's nothing like that.

135
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,105
Yi-kyung.

136
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,692
It's nothing like that. Yi-kyung.

137
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:33,620
You do as you please, don't you?

138
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,331
Please leave.

139
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,792
What?

140
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,670
What are you saying?

141
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,464
We need your help, a firefighter's help.

142
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,968
But you seem preoccupied.

143
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:51,179
Thanks for telling me to leave.

144
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:54,849
No, Yi-kyung.

145
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:58,687
-You shouldn't.
-There's something I need to do.

146
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,568
Thanks for everything.

147
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:18,999
You look better as a monster.

148
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:25,255
So becoming a monster is your dream?

149
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,507
Why do you try so hard?

150
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,843
I work hard at everything.

151
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:33,430
When monsters do show up,

152
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,849
we'll all be killed.

153
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,310
Trying hard won't stop that.

154
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:40,979
I look forward to your turn.

155
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:45,775
Me? I won't do it. Do you think I'm crazy?

156
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,486
Yes. You're a crazy bitch.

157
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,406
That's why you'll end up doing it.

158
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,992
And you'll work

159
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:55,785
even harder than me.

160
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:23,146
Gosh, my precious baby.

161
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:26,357
Don't ride it too hard.

162
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,609
Be gentle!

163
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,084
Why did you poke your nose in?

164
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:46,836
To pay off a debt.

165
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,130
What do you mean?

166
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,050
Why would you pay it off with my bike?

167
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,727
God isn't like that.

168
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:08,691
He doesn't just listen to the prayers
of those He likes more.

169
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,242
What are you trying to do?

170
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,495
Soju is too bitter if you drink it alone.

171
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:25,667
And you end up drinking too much.

172
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:33,174
I used to be an alcoholic.

173
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,719
I'm desperately resisting
the urge to drink.

174
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:43,268
I realized that
what you see isn't everything.

175
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,478
People,

176
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,605
the world,

177
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,317
and God's will, too.

178
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:00,994
I fought by praying.

179
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,371
I'm sure you had your own method.

180
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,332
You're in charge of this place now.

181
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,211
Why would I do that?

182
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,214
Try to fight in a different way.

183
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,676
This is a good place to be alone.

184
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,305
Oh, right.

185
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,514
Now that you're in charge…

186
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,559
Save the rest of that.

187
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,741
You're cheating.

188
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,745
Stop playing with toys.

189
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:45,872
Read a book.

190
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:48,833
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK

191
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,293
Well,

192
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,587
Yeong-su can't read yet.

193
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:57,300
Hey,

194
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,386
kids your age in Gangnam
can speak Chinese.

195
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:06,351
Open the book.

196
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:10,730
All right.

197
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,565
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK

198
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,360
-"I'm

199
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,403
not afraid

200
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:19,697
not afraid

201
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:23,201
-of the

202
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,702
dark."

203
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:27,372
You try.

204
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:30,375
-"Dark."
-"Dark."

205
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,376
Again.

What? My name isn't on it.

212
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,022
Mine isn't on it, either.

213
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,278
You can be my buddy.

214
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,196
With you?

215
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,156
Yes.

216
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,950
Because…

217
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,625
we're secret agents.

Green Home rules of survival.

219
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,595
One. Move in groups of two or more.

220
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,434
Report anything unusual immediately.

221
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:38,526
Two. Eat once a day.
Only the prescribed amount is distributed.

222
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:42,822
What is this?

223
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,950
You call this a rice ball?

224
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:48,995
It should be at least this big.

225
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,848
Thirty-six point six.
Your temperature is normal.

226
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,732
What about that dog? Can't it change, too?

227
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:23,446
Three. Check everyone's temperature
every night at 8 p.m.

228
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:44,300
Thank you.

229
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,644
Quarantine the infected.

230
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,194
Did you shut down the elevator?

231
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:48,239
We're running out of power
and it's dangerous,

232
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,074
so we'll run it in case of emergency only.

233
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,743
What we're doing to Hyun-su,

234
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:55,037
is it right?

235
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:59,041
He didn't harm anyone. We aren't sure
if he'll turn into a monster.

236
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,960
-Locking him up like that--
-It isn't right.

237
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:04,630
I know, but Hyun-su is dangerous.

238
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:12,054
He's dangerous, but we need him.

239
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:35,346
ROOM 702 SUNSCREEN
ROOM 1009 DOG FOOD, CHARGER, SANITARY PADS

240
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:23,853
Damn, why's he only on my case?

241
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:25,605
Well…

242
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:29,525
It's sad to see it go to waste.
Plus, we need the bottle. So…

243
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:32,153
You're so immature.

244
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:36,240
When do you think Hyun-su will be back?

245
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:38,951
I don't know. He's late today.

246
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:41,996
-Do you think something happened to him?
-You know he doesn't die.

247
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,000
Even if he gets hurt,
he gets better after a nap.

248
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:05,227
-Where is it?
-Where?

249
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,646
Come here!

250
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,856
-It's going to come this way.
-Hurry.

251
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:11,150
-Let's go.
-Now!

252
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:17,406
What is it?

253
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,533
-Hold this.
-Oh God.

254
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,038
It's my husband.

255
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:29,835
I have to do this.

256
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,171
-Wait.
-Stay still.

257
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:35,841
-No.
-Seon-yeong.

258
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,135
Seon-yeong.

259
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,268
Pull yourself together, Kim Seok-hyeon.

260
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:52,066
Kim Seok-hyeon.

261
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:54,318
Pull yourself together!

262
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:10,126
You're back.

263
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:16,298
Do you have any last words?

264
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,262
Please…

265
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:23,597
kill…

266
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:25,766
me…

267
00:28:31,897 --> 00:28:33,649
And…

268
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,472
You'll end up like this, too.

269
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:17,938
EXIT

270
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:39,168
You said it for the first time
in 30 years.

271
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:46,175
I'm sorry…

272
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:51,764
Why did it have to be now?

273
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,061
JULY 2020

274

00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:48,028
Hurry!

276
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:58,205
I'm Seo Yi-kyung
from Sujeong Fire Station.

277
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,082
-Hurry!
-She's the bereaved family member.

278
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,460
-I'm sorry for your--
-His body…

279
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,171
hasn't been found.

280
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,508
Please give permission
to preserve the scene. I'll find it.

281
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,760
I cannot give permission.

282
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:13,220
You're a firefighter, so you know…

283

285
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:22,312
From now on, I'm just the bereaved.

286
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,942
-You must find him at all costs.

It's not a disease. It's a curse.

297
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:03,539
I was consumed by it, too.

298
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:07,543
It's been ten days since I began
to have nosebleeds and fainting spells.

299
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:11,713
They talk to me and ask questions,

300
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:13,757
but I'm still resisting them.

301
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:17,845
I have to be a subject myself
and solve this phenomenon.

302
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:21,014
Fifteen days.

303
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:24,268
Subjects enter a stable period
after 15 days.

304
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:25,853
If I hold out

305
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:28,438
for five more days,
I'll become a special infectee.

306
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:32,401
One thing is for sure.
Studying someone who survives

307
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,696
the monsterization symptoms
is the only method we have.

308
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,949
It's the last hope to end
this nightmarish disaster.

309
00:36:11,398 --> 00:36:12,858
The power is out.

310
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:15,235
Let's wait a little, Ji-eun.

311
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,779
It'll be okay.

312
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:19,406
How do you know?

313
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,074
It's obviously not okay.

314
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:22,951
What's going to happen now?

315
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:25,913
I hear we're almost out of food.

316
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:29,333
The water will be cut off soon.
I'm scared.

317
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,500
Su-yeong,

318
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,586
are we going to die?

319
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,383
It's over.

320
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,094
We're all doomed!

321
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:44,640
I really hope I go to Heaven after I die.

322
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:47,559
So?

323
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:49,937
So what?

324
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,606
Do you want to commit mass suicide
since we'll all die soon?

325
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:57,444
Stop whining!

326
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:01,073
Whining won't change anything.

327
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:16,880
It's okay.

328
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,932
People are getting agitated.

329
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:28,725
I know.

330
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,978
It's sooner than I expected.

331
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:35,482
Electricity has no direct impact
on survival.

332
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:39,903
Having no drinking water
is a more serious problem.

333
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,703
You must be happy
because you're so cool-headed.

334
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,042
Be honest with me.

335
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,586
Do you think we can survive?

336
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:17,149
What are you?

337
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:18,942
I don't know.

338
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:20,986
What?

339
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,863
I don't know what I am.

340
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:26,033
You can just start over here.

341
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,952
You can live however you want.

342
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:32,164
And if I reveal my desire,
I become a monster?

343
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:36,710
That's right. Now tell me what you want.

344
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:42,549
Fuck you.

345
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:47,220
Fine.

346
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:49,431
Good luck, then.

347
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,687
BASTARD

348
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:56,897
Are you up?

349
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:01,443
I knew you were a pushover.

350
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:04,488
Being a doormat is in your blood.

351
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,366
But I was wondering, Hyun-su.

352
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,161
Who did that?

353
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,541
-I did.
-I mean,

354
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:19,461
why did you do it?

355
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:22,714
Because of me.

356
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:28,387
It's not because of you, moron.

357
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,974
Does it make you feel better
to think that way?

358
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,395
That's why everyone blames you.

359
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:37,771
You have to throw

360
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:40,732
a huge fucking fit

361
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:41,942
to make people understand.

362
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:48,698
Doesn't it hurt?

363
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:51,201
No.

364
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:54,746
You were groaning miserably earlier.

365
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:09,678
I don't know where you were hurt,
so stick these on yourself.

366
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:14,307
I don't need them.

367
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:16,017
-I'll recover--
-Make it obvious.

368
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,729
"I got hurt because of you.
It fucking hurts!"

369
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:20,647
Get it?

370
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,652
Why don't you get it?

371
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:33,410
BAND-AID

372
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,299
Leave him alone.

373
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:51,052
If it's that important, you go yourself.

374
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,305
-Stop.
-Hey!

375
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:54,931
You're the worst.

376
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:58,185
You act like you care,
but you just stand by and do nothing.

377
00:40:58,268 --> 00:41:00,395
-You're no different.
-What about you?

378
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,231
All you do is run your mouth.

379
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:06,526
You fucking bitch.

380
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:08,862
Hey, Eun-yu.

381
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:11,448
Stay out of it.
You aren't even my real brother.

382
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:21,082
You're fucking unbelievable.

383
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,430
DO NOT ENTER

384
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:44,397
We have to go outside.

385
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,858
There's no guarantee we'll be safe here.

386
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:50,028
Nothing happened
when we retrieved the corpses.

387
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,281
The situation might've calmed down.

388
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,786
So?

389
00:41:58,578 --> 00:41:59,955
It's…

390
00:42:01,957 --> 00:42:04,543
taking you longer and longer to recover.

391
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,503
We don't know
when you'll turn into a monster.

392
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:09,673
You think…

393
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:13,552
I'll hurt you guys if I become a monster?

394
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,602
There are monsters that don't hurt people.

395
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:23,687
So?

396
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,399
Can you be sure you'll be like them?

397
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,160
A monster is a monster.

398
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,708
We don't have time.

399
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,669
We must find a way to survive
while you can still resist.

400
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:04,894
I don't expect you to understand.
Just do your job.

401
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:07,147
You're just being used.

402
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:11,610
You'll end up like this, too.

403
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:35,425
Tell me.

404
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:38,136
Where is Sang-won?

405
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,220
No.

406
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:43,350
What did you do to him?

407
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:49,189
You're not in a position to ask questions.

408
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:50,565
Tell me!

409
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,196
You read this. He must be dead.

410
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:58,031
Whether he killed himself or got killed.

411
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:00,659
I HAVE TO BE A SUBJECT MYSELF
AND SOLVE THIS PHENOMENON.

412
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:02,786
Even if he's not dead,

413
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,913
I don't think you could say he's alive.

414
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:19,052
Now it's my turn to ask.

415
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:22,097
What and how much do you know?

416
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:27,268
I know you'll kill me.

417
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:29,729
Why do you think so?

418
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:33,692
If I know too much, you'll kill me
to shut me up.

419
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,405
If I know nothing, you'll kill me
because I'm useless.

420
00:44:39,364 --> 00:44:40,198
But…

421
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:46,871
I have to live no matter what.

422
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:49,457
How?

423
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:53,002
Get a grip.

424
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,423
You're looking for someone
resisting monsterization, right?

425
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:00,510
I know where one is.

426
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:28,640
I think it's asleep.

427
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:32,268
Let's not wake it up.

428
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:45,717
Help!

429
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:16,432
-Mr. Han!
-Su-yeong, it's dangerous!

430
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:18,059
Run!

431
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:33,032
Mr. Han!

432
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:50,299
