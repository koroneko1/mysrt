1
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,125
You're too loud! I need to focus here.

2
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,541
We're together. Don't be selfish.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,958
You have no manners.

4
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,833
You need discipline.

5
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,458
Time to take your medicine.

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,583
What medicine? Why should I take it?

7
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,750
It's the medicine before...

8
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,833
Whose phone is ringing?

9
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,000
Whose is it?

10
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,583
It's mine.

11
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,958
What the hell?

12
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,750
Why are you all startled? It's just...

13
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,541
Noon!

14
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:23,208
Fire! Everything is on fire! Fire!

15
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,750
It's hot!

16
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,708
It's hot!

17
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,625
I nearly burned to death!

18
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,333
Your clothes are burning.
Rip it off, quickly.

19
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,333
What?

20
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,208
Go away! I beg you! Go away!
Don't! I beg you!

21
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,750
Go away! I beg you! I'm scared.

22
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,208
ALMOST 100,000 LIKES.

23
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,291
IT'S NORMAL FOR CELEBRITIES LIKE US.

24
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,583
AWESOME.

25
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,458
Gosh, Eaky told me

26
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,208
the exam results finally came in.

27
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,541
-I got a C.
-I got a C.

28
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,041
-I got a D.
-I got a C plus.

29
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,958
Yeah, we finally graduated.

30
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,666
Guys, I failed my advanced
general English class.

31
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,083
What? You failed the advanced
general English class?

32
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:51,125
There is definitely a problem here.
I could have done it with my eyes closed.

33
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,791
I only failed this subject.

34
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,375
Could you please change my grade?

35
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,500
How could I change your grade?

36
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,125
I need to graduate this year.

37
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,416
It's very important to me.

38
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,666
I need my diploma to sign up
as an artist in South Korea.

39
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,000
There's no way I can change your grade.

40
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,625
You could take the exam again.

41
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,291
But what?

42
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,833
First, you have to take the class again

43
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,333
at the Education Center.

44
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,833
What?

45
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,000
No, we won't go.

46
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,041
Four of you guys and I, we're five.

47
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,875
According to the university's rules,
we can ask for a room to retake the exam.

48
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,583
You don't know, do you?
Everyone at the university knows it.

49
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:21,208
There're ghosts at the Education Center.

50
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,458
Students who died before graduating,

51
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,416
would assemble there...

52
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,375
EDUCATION CENTER

53
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,958
...every day at midnight.

54
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,375
The bell kept ringing at 12.

55
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,583
Everyone can hear it.

56
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,750
It's a call for all the ghosts.

57
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
All the ghosts there

58
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,250
are those who studied very hard,

59
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,083
so they could get in there.

60
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,625
There was a senior who
rushed to take the exam,

61
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,583
but she fell off the stairs and died.

62
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,750
After that, her spirit
still lingered around,

63
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
trying to run to take the exam
every night.

64
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,125
This story gives me goosebumps.

65
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,166
SORRY

66
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,666
There was a student who was dumped by
her boyfriend.

67
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,125
After the exam,
she went to the toilet and hung herself.

68
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,958
She completed her exam, right?
Why is she still a ghost?

69
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,583
Rumors has it that

70
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,166
she failed the exam.

71
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,333
-That's scary.
-I heard that...

72
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,375
a senior went in that room
and took a video clip.

73
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,833
Everyone who saw this video said that
they could see the ghosts clearly.

74
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,291
Some people say I talk too much,
and I just like to brag.

75
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,958
Bullshit!

76
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,625
It's not me.
Tonight you will see for yourself that

77
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,125
I'm a real deal.

78
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,208
Handcuffs.

79
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,500
Here! Look at this. See?
Here's the key.

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,291
There's no way I could reach it.

81
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,833
I can't run away from ghosts.

82
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,916
Tonight, you will know who I am.

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
I'm the number one here.

84
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,000
Just come here, if you dare.

85
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,791
Damn! They got me.

86
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,916
Hey, it's nothing.

87
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,750
This is the senior from class 22
who hung herself.

88
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,416
She's wearing black underwear.

89
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,208
I don't want to look away.

90
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,750
Hey, one, two, three...

91
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,458
They were stabbed together
like a barbeque.

92
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,875
No, the other way.

93
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,708
So white.

94
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,000
Where are your insides?

95
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,083
God, I can't take it anymore.

96
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:07,833
One is off! What about the other one?
Still there. No!

97
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:14,583
Wait! Is someone peeing on me?

98
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,166
Who's peeing?

99
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,083
Coming out of your rear end,

100
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,166
it's not lymph, this is pure shit!

101
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing?
You can use this key.

102
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,291
Oh! You're so stupid. Yes, I am.

103
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,916
You're crazy! You are too!

104
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,083
You're crazy! Does anyone have a knife?

105
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,458
Just cut off my arm.
I don't need it anymore.

106
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,083
Anyone? Please help me!

107
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,875
-Can I help?
-Thank you.

108
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,916
Fire!

109
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,291
Who's gonna believe this?
Ghost stories are for kids.

110
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,500
More importantly,

111
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,583
I want to start my journey as
a famous artist as soon as possible.

112
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,750
When I arrive in Korea,
I will study the language for a year.

113
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,000
Hello!

114
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,250
I will practice my singing for a year.

115
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,958
One year of learning to dance.

116
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,083
Then, release an album.

117
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,125
Was she accepted by
the record company?

118
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,250
I don't want to waste any more time.
Let's go the Education Center.

119
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,625
-What?
-Are you crazy?

120
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,083
-Who wants to go with you?
-It's getting late now.

121
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,541
-Yeah.
-We won't go. No way.

122
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,875
Okay.

123
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,625
EDUCATION CENTER

124
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,500
Let's go.

125
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,750
Oh! Are we really going in?

126
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,583
You don't have to be afraid. I posted on
my Facebook asking others to join me.

127
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,208
The class might already be full.

128
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,791
How can you be so sure that

129
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,041
it's people in that room, not ghosts.

130
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,666
Hey, look up.

131
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,416
It's nothing. Come on.

132
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,041
Hey, what?

133
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,250
-WE SHOULDN'T GO.
-SO SCARY.

134
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:17,083
-HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?
-WE SHOULD LEAVE.

135
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,416
I'M ALSO IN THIS GROUP CHAT.

136
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Today is the last day of the sale.
I'll see you later.

137
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,666
I want to buy new underwear.
I'll go with her.

138
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,041
I'll drive them there.

139
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:39,791
I... I... This flower garland,

140
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,083
I give it to you. See you.

141
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,125
Why are they so scared?

142
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,541
EDUCATION ROOM

143
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,000
If there was someone who came
to study with me, a woman.

144
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,958
I'll give her
all my new shades of lipsticks.

145
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,250
If it's a man, I'd be his girlfriend
for two weeks.

146
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,166
Hope he's handsome.

147
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,875
Hey.

148
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,791
Hey!

149
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,291
You're here for the retest class?

150
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,916
I got my first classmate.

151
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,250
You're going to study with me, right?
Your words aren't enough.

152
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,166
Let's do this.

153
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,250
Let's see the photo.

154
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,750
Hello? You're my classmate, right?

155
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,916
Auan-Pie? Okay, see you.

156
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,333
Funny, right? Auan-Pie as a name.

157
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,458
What is your name?

158
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,750
My name is Khun.

159
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,833
Hello, Auan-Pie.

160
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,958
What am I wearing? I'm wearing
a white blouse and a printed skirt.

161
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,166
Shoes?

162
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:24,583
Yellow high heels and socks.

163
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,291
I'm going now.

164
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,750
Hey, you! Hurry back home.
I'll see you in class.

165
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,291
Bag?
A black and silver crossbody.

166
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,708
AUAN-PIE
STAR'S ADMIRER

167
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,666
I'm Auan-Pie. We talked on the phone.

168
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,666
I'm your fan.

169
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,833
Let me be in the class with you.

170
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,083
I'm willing to do anything for you.

171
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,208
Anything!

172
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,375
-Anything?
-Yes, anything.

173
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,750
Then, go find those who failed this class
and make them study with me.

174
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,625
I knew you would say this.

175
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,583
I've prepared for you. Here!

176
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,958
Are these three still students?

177
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,458
They've been studying for eight years...

178
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,625
KUNG - MOO - MEUK

179
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,166
...but they failed this subject
so they couldn't graduate.

180
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,875
They used to be kings of party.
They got drunk every night.

181
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,083
All their friends graduated long ago.

182
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,458
They're still here because
they still want to party.

183
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,583
Will you really study with me?

184
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,583
Yeah.

185
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,250
What do you want in exchange?

186
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,083
You want money, right?

187
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:51,500
How much?

188
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,166
We don't want your money.

189
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,500
What do you want then?

190
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,000
-We want a model.
-What?

191
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,666
We want you to be a model

192
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,500
at our party.

193
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,250
Okay.

194
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,708
That's a part of being a famous artist.

195
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,625
I'm fine with that.

196
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,333
But you have to be in class.
You can't be absent.

197
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,666
If you're there,

198
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,375
then we'll be there.

199
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:31,125
Star, there's one more classmate.

200
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,250
What?

201
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,166
OTAKU

202
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,958
Otaku.

203
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,625
You're my classmate, right?

204
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,166
He said yes.

205
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,375
Do you have conditions, too?

206
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,791
Take. Your. Picture.

207
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,166
Fine.

208
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,625
Stop! I'll let you take my picture.

209
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,750
But no filthy pictures.

210
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
Are you in or out?

211
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,000
I've gathered all your classmates.

212
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,625
We can be friends now, right?

213
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,791
Friends? You can be my temporary friend.

214
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,125
Temporary friend?

215
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,416
We'll be friends during this retest class.

216
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,125
When I'm done with it
and you all get your wishes,

217
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,625
we'll go separate ways.

218
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,291
Do you need a friend
to spend the night with?

219
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,208
Hey, you! What the hell?

220
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,416
I thought we would be friends forever
until we die.

221
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,958
Hey, we won't die!
Temporary friend is fine!

222
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,416
Here, as proof.

223
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:37,500
FIRST CLASS - INTRO TO HORROR

224
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,666
The advanced general English class

225
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,500
will be taught from 9:00 p.m

226
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:33,708
until 11:45 p.m.
No student is allowed in class...

227
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,125
Stay away from the shrine behind you.

228
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,291
YEAR 1964

229
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,208
We'll start with essay writing.
A good essay should have a...

230
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,750
To put it simply,

231
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,833
it's a main idea.

232
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,000
We will divide an essay

233
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,833
into three main parts.

234
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,041
We'll start with an introduction,

235
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:29,708
which should contain
the main idea of the essay.

236
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,666
...explaining the details
of the main idea.

237
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,583
The last part is a conclusion,

238
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,833
which summarizes the whole essay.

239
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,750
Time's up! You can go home now.

240
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,541
See? Since I'm here,

241
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,958
all the ghosts disappear, right?

242
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,458
New wave.

243
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,375
He said that you don't have the same
frequency as the ghosts.

244
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,625
That's why you can't see them.

245
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:31,208
How do you know?

246
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:47,375
Damn! That's cool.

247
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:52,791
I'm going home. See you tomorrow.

248
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,250
Come on, take it easy. Tonight...

249
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,458
-We're having...
-We're having a party, right?

250
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:07,416
Here's the mascot outfit for tonight.

251
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,166
See you later.

252
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,416
Meuk! Kung!

253
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:30,166
I have a great idea.

254
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:40,916
Now it's five minutes after midnight.

255
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,583
And we're at...

256
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:49,625
-We're at the Education Center.
-Ghosts,

257
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,666
come out here if you dare.

258
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,958
They should come from the shrine

259
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,708
that people have been talking about.

260
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,250
-A flash.
-Here?

261
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,875
A flash in front of the shrine.

262
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:39,583
Everyone, as you can see,
this place is not scary at all.

263
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,208
...tonight's highlight.

264
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:08,416
What? It's midnight,
why are you still here.

265
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:15,625
-Damn!
-We're here! Damn!

266
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,500
Sorry, why is he here now?

267
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:27,583
Here. Damn.

268
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:32,375
Here. Damn.

269
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,416
Your accent is very awful.

270
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,458
Moo? Meuk? Kung?

271
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,375
What? O! What the hell is wrong with you?

272
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,666
Was the video already uploaded?

273
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,166
This could attract more people
to the party.

274
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,416
Evil Party.

275
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,916
EVIL PARTY

276
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,708
See? The Education Center
is not scary at all.

277
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:37,208
MMK is scarier.

278
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:41,500
And tonight's highlight.

279
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,625
COME AND MEET ME

280
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,708
Everyone. Drink!

281
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,000
Cheers!

282
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,416
Hey, Star.

283
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,875
Why don't you come dance together?

284
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:28,541
She won't dance. That's fine.

285
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:33,708
MMK will dance for you.

286
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,458
MMK!

287
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,583
One, two, three. Go!

288
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,333
You call that dancing?

289
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:14,583
It's still so much better than
someone who is not dancing.

290
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,250
You, superstar.

291
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:28,083
Fine, I will dance.

292
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,083
Who said you could throw a party here?

293
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:45,208
MMK can do it, any problems?

294
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:53,166
You three gramps and those idiots
from the Education Center.

295
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,958
You threw a party to fool other people?

296
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:01,666
You never studied there so you have
no right to criticize us.

297
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,333
Star, we totally understand you.

298
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,750
You have to be with these arrogant people.

299
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:13,416
Come on. Come with us.

300
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,166
Since you said that everything about
the Education Center is bogus,

301
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,708
-then come study with us.
-Why should we do that?

302
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,583
We didn't fail the exam
like these idiots.

303
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,875
But these idiots are my friends.

304
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,666
They came to study with me, unlike
some pretentious smartasses!

305
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,833
Come study with us, if you dare.

306
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:48,333
Who wants to see them brave the ghosts?

307
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,791
Against the ghosts.

308
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,958
Against the ghosts.

309
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,083
-Against the ghosts.
-We won't go.

310
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,875
We didn't fail the exam.

311
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,666
Let's go back.

312
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,916
Boo!

313
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,833
I thought you were better.

314
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,875
Star, what are you going to dance?

315
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,458
What dance?

316
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,666
You say it.

317
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,375
-You say it.
-Spin! Spin!

318
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,416
-You say it.
-Don't argue!

319
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,291
You go, Kung. You go.

320
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:09,041
Well... Star.

321
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:15,250
We... all three gramps want to say

322
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,666
thank you for your help.

323
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,208
How could I not?

324
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,000
Because we're friends.

325
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,250
Temporary friends.

326
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,041
Oh, yes, temporary friends.

327
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:39,666
If I hadn't helped you,
you would be blamed,

328
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,208
and you would miss the class,
then I would be blamed, too.

329
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,083
All right.

330
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,708
-Okay.
-What?

331
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:55,166
This is a special day.

332
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:01,208
MMK prepared a special drink

333
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,291
representing our friendship.
We should drink together.

334
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,208
Let's do it.

335
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,833
Done.

336
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,666
You, try some.

337
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,458
I... later.

338
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:40,000
Who would want to drink this?

339
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,333
-So good!
-Really?

340
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,791
Wait! Wait!

341
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,833
Hey! Give me!

342
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,916
You got me.

343
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,083
We're done.

344
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,333
Hey, serves her right.

345
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,250
Star, what's wrong?

346
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,708
Star became a ghost.

347
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,166
Damn it! Meuk! Kung!

348
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,125
Gosh!

349
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:39,416
Star! You can jump!

350
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,458
What?

351
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,833
O!

352
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,708
Good, O!

353
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,750
Very good!

354
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,250
Hey, O!

355
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:14,250
O isn't dead.

356
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,375
Hey, O became a ghost.

357
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,791
Auan, wait up!

358
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,375
Auan! Wait up!

359
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,291
Damn, why are you in a rush?

360
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:42,333
Auan! Wait up!

361
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,083
Auan!

362
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:54,500
Why are you in such a rush? Auan!

363
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,250
Damn Auan!

364
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:09,833
It's like I'm going in circle.

365
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,000
It's like a nightmare.

366
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,416
There.

367
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,291
It's always right at this moment.

368
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,625
Clear as day.

369
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:39,000
I've had enough!

370
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,166
Ghosts!

371
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,166
What test? Who would have time
to prepare for that?

372
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,041
I've taught you everything.
You have to review it yourself.

373
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,375
Tomorrow will be the essay test.

374
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,458
As for today, I gotta go.

375
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,291
Star, let's go. It is almost midnight.

376
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:49,250
There's a test tomorrow.
No party tonight, okay?

377
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:15,333
SECOND CLASS - SPEAKING OF THE DEVIL

378
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:25,916
Moo, how many times has the clock strike?
What time is it now?

379
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:31,666
Eleven, so it's 11:00 p.m.

380
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,125
But I think it's 12:00. Let me see.

381
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,791
Damn!

382
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,500
Damn!

383
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,333
The ghosts are here, what do we do?

384
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:48,958
Really? Hey, Meuk. Let's see.

385
00:42:58,583 --> 00:42:59,875
Hey!

386
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,166
You guys, calm down.

387
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,666
I'll check.

388
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,875
Damn, he looked me in the eyes.

389
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,375
-What should we do?
-That's easy.

390
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,291
Turn left two steps.

391
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,416
Go straight nine steps.

392
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,791
Turn right 11 steps.
We'll be at the door.

393
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,583
Even with my eyes closed,

394
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,291
I can walk to the exit.

395
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,833
Or you can walk while looking up,
you won't see the ghosts either.

396
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:41,541
Yeah, that's great, too.
I'll count to three.

397
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,208
One... Two... Three.

398
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,000
Go left two steps.

399
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:57,500
-Here we go.
-Okay.

400
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,875
One.

401
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:04,125
Two.

402
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:07,625
We walk quietly like this.
They won't know for sure.

403
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,375
-Are you sure?
-Now, we go straight nine steps.

404
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,333
There's something at my feet.

405
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,125
I'm stuck, too.

406
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:23,500
What is it, guys?

407
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,958
Oh, damn!

408
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,875
Some water lizards?

409
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,958
Ghosts.

410
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,916
-We should walk in a line.
-Wait.

411
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:42,166
Let me stay in the middle.

412
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,125
-We should continue.
-Go straight nine steps.

413
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,583
Let's go.

414
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,291
One.

415
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,708
Two.

416
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,291
Three.

417
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:01,916
Whose phone is ringing?

418
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,750
It's mine.

419
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,041
-Hello.
-It's me.

420
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,208
Me, who?

421
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,916
Your father, asshole!

422
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:19,083
-What's up, dad?
-Can you talk now?

423
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:22,375
-No, I really can't.
-Damn you!

424
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,291
-You can always talk to your friends!
-What do you want?

425
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,041
We can talk later when you're free.

426
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,583
I want you to buy some Tom Yum flavored
instant noodles for me.

427
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,291
Okay, I'll buy them for you.

428
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,708
Should I go with
creamy or clear soup?

429
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:39,208
I'll get you both. I have to hang up now.

430
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,125
Wait.

431
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:43,666
-One more thing.
-What do you want?

432
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:48,791
I... I'll... I'll have...

433
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,458
that thing, it's a red stick.

434
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,708
-red stick.
-red stick?

435
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,375
-A pencil.
-Is a pencil edible? Dumbass!

436
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,291
-Call me again when you know.
-Wait!

437
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:02,208
I know! I know!

438
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,541
What is it again?

439
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,041
-Call me again when you know.
-Wait!

440
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,916
Where was I?

441
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,166
Turn right.

442
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:30,000
-Right what?
-Turn right, six steps.

443
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:34,083
Turn right, six steps.

444
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,083
-I'm going, okay?
-Okay.

445
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,583
Six steps and then
we reach the door, right?

446
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,458
I assure you.

447
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,500
It's clear all the way.

448
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,583
One.

449
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,750
Two. Three.

450
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,416
Four. Five.

451
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,416
Six.

452
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,375
It's done. Should we go left nine steps?

453
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:05,625
Six and then to the left.

454
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,333
Left what? Go then!

455
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,666
Why do you stop, Moo?

456
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,125
Moo!

457
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,333
Moo! What do you see?

458
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:31,625
Moo! What's wrong? Talk to us first!

459
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:39,916
-Meuk, why did you cough?
-No, I did not. Moo did!

460
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:42,458
I didn't cough.

461
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,041
Moo didn't cough, you didn't cough,

462
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,708
I didn't either.

463
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:51,375
Then who did?

464
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,750
Damn! The cough is coming closer.

465
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,166
I think we should count and move forward.

466
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,500
There's no need to count anymore.
Just freaking run!

467
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:09,958
-Do we run while looking up?
-Look down, asshole!

468
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,166
-Hey!
-What?

469
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,083
Where is Moo?

470
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You guys didn't wait for me.

471
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,625
Come on, quickly!
Or the ghosts will follow you.

472
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,208
Are they following me?

473
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,166
There's nothing! Are you crazy?

474
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,666
Hey!

475
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,000
Behind you!

476
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,125
Behind me again?

477
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,625
There's nothing, guys!

478
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:11,041
-Hey!
-Moo! Behind you.

479
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,875
Clear as day.

480
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:23,583
Hey! What's with you guys!

481
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:28,083
It's on your back!

482
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,875
Here.

483
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,500
Hey! Hey!

484
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,791
Damn!

485
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,625
Hey! Get him off of me!

486
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,958
-Get him off!
-No!

487
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,750
Damn! That's enough!

488
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,083
Gosh!

489
00:49:56,916 --> 00:50:01,041
Hey, here! I've had enough!

490
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,333
-Woah!
-Hey, it's gone.

491
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,708
Damn!

492
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,041
Hey!

493
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,875
WGT.

494
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:54,041
WGT. We Go Dancing Together.

495
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,666
Dance?

496
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,583
Dance, what?

497
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,541
THIRD CLASS - SCREAM TEST

498
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:06,208
It's time for the test.
Please pay attention.

499
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:11,916
You only pay attention to useless stuff.
You should focus more on your study.

500
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,916
Where are Moo, Meuk and Kung?

501
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:18,666
They don't come when there's a test.

502
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,208
How could I know?

503
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,083
Why didn't you call them here?

504
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,125
Why should I do that?

505
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:31,666
Friends. Understood? Friends.

506
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,666
Friends help each other.

507
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,416
There're just you guys now.

508
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:41,166
Do you still want to continue?

509
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,083
I would continue, if there was just me.

510
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:47,083
I hope you'll attend every class.

511
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:50,833
If I do that, do you dare?

512
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,625
I'm here every day anyway,
do I dare?

513
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:04,208
But now, it's time to go home.

514
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,541
Are you going to dance now?

515
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:36,916
We go looking together.

516
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,333
Star.

517
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,583
Where are we going to dance?

518
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:51,291
I brought you the dress.

519
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,291
We should go get changed in the toilet.

520
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,000
Is it pretty?

521
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:06,083
So we can look the same.
I'll go first.

522
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,375
Star!

523
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:35,416
Star!

524
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,416
Damn!

525
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,500
Star! I'm sorry!

526
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:52,000
I'M SORRY

527
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,083
What are you doing?

528
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:05,875
Khun! What are you doing?
You scared me.

529
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:10,666
You, why did you follow me?

530
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:15,791
No, I didn't follow you.

531
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,666
I'm going to my car.

532
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,041
What about you?

533
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,458
You wanna know?

534
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,750
I don't wanna know.

535
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,208
I'm going then.

536
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:37,166
If you stay here late,
be careful of the ghosts.

537
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:44,625
Wait for me.

538
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,750
Why are you here? There's nothing here.

539
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,708
This is Chamchuri Court.

540
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:07,458
A ceremony will be held here for students
who are soon to graduate.

541
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,708
This is the place where they hold
Goodbye Senior Party, right?

542
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,375
Do you know why they throw the party here?

543
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,750
Then, close your eyes,
try to imagine this.

544
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,250
Why?

545
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,875
Trust me. Close your eyes.

546
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,250
This court has been here since
the university was built.

547
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,625
It has witnessed students,

548
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,750
class after class.

549
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,541
Before the graduation day,

550
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:55,500
these trees will be decorated with lamps.

551
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:58,458
They will shine brightly
throughout the area.

552
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:02,666
Junior students will stand here
with candles to welcome the graduates.

553
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:07,166
It will be their last beautiful picture,

554
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:10,833
before graduating from here.

555
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,166
Star.

556
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,333
Star.

557
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,458
Why are you smiling?

558
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:04,416
I used to attend the party here
when I was a freshman.

559
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,166
This is a special event for the graduates.

560
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:14,000
-I'm going to graduate, too.
-Are you sure you can pass the exam?

561
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,291
I don't see you paying attention
to the class.

562
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,500
I don't understand what he says.

563
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:23,125
But if you stay focused,
you can do it.

564
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:26,666
I'll help you then.

565
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,250
Do you want something in return?

566
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:35,500
I'll help you so we can graduate together.

567
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,125
"We Graduate Together."

568
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:45,541
That's what you wrote in the notebook.

569
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,708
WGT, this is what it means right?

570
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,750
You're pretty clever.

571
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:20,041
Hey, why the rattling now?

572
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,625
Gosh! Star!

573
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:37,166
What are you doing here?

574
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,916
Look! O posted photos of ghosts
in the Education Center.

575
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,125
You can see it isn't real.

576
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:52,041
Auan-Pie, you're gonna drop out
of class and leave me, too, right?

577
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:55,250
No, I'm not. It's just...

578
01:01:55,708 --> 01:02:01,541
Those guys stop coming to class.
Apparently they've seen the ghosts.

579
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:07,541
What ghosts? Anyway, I'm going to class.
You're coming with me, okay?

580
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,583
FOURTH CLASS

581
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,208
BODY LANGUAGE

582
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:26,083
Yesterday, Moo, Meuk, Kung
were absent.

583
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:29,166
Today, O isn't here either.

584
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:34,375
Don't forget. If you don't attend classes
until the retake exam,

585
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,708
you won't be able to graduate.

586
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:41,708
It's because they were haunted

587
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,875
by the ghosts in this room.

588
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,458
What ghosts? Who said that?

589
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:53,750
Or.. Or... you've seen one?

590
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,625
Don't say that.

591
01:02:56,916 --> 01:03:00,166
The next person will be me.

592
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:14,375
Today, I'll teach you
how to write a resume.

593
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,208
You can use this when you apply for a job.

594
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,583
Let's start with...

595
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:25,500
All right.

596
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,250
That's it for today.

597
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,375
Tomorrow, don't forget to
call your friends here.

598
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:35,208
They won't come.
What do you want me to do?

599
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,375
...why I set out the rules
that there must be

600
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,250
at least five students in order for
the class to run?

601
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,250
Because friends are for
helping each other.

602
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,625
Working together is stronger.

603
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,416
What did he just say? So boring.

604
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:15,625
Hey, it's midnight, Star!
We should hurry.

605
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,041
What?

606
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:21,291
A ghost!

607
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,625
-A ghost?
-Come here! Quickly!

608
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,833
-What?
-Star!

609
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,125
-It's you, Khun!
-Come this way!

610
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,750
Come here, quickly!

611
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,666
Let's go, quickly!

612
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,958
Damn.

613
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:06,291
Hey.

614
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,875
Hey.

615
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,041
What's with you?
Where are you taking me?

616
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,208
You keep walking in circles.

617
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,500
Well...

618
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:06,958
Don't! Don't!

619
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,708
I WAS SCARED BY A GHOST!

620
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:33,208
Can you walk with me to my car?

621
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,291
Okay.

622
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:40,750
Hey.

623
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,125
Do you think there's a ghost
at the Education Center?

624
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:50,791
Don't you know?

625
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:55,000
I'm a ghost.

626
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,750
Promise me

627
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:03,416
that you'll come to class and won't
abandon me like the others.

628
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:09,541
Hey.

629
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,583
I won't go anywhere.

630
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:16,083
I'll help you so that
you can take the exam.

631
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,791
So that you can graduate.

632
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,916
We graduate together, promise?

633
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,500
I promise.

634
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:43,750
FIFTH CLASS

635
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:11,041
SIXTH CLASS

636
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:17,500
SEVENTH CLASS

637
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,250
Good.

638
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,000
EIGHTH CLASS

639
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,208
NINTH CLASS

640
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,708
TENTH CLASS

641
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:38,916
Good! I think you're ready to resit
the exam tomorrow.

642
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,958
Actually, you're better than you think.

643
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:48,125
I think... you should consider
studying very seriously.

644
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:53,208
No, this is hard enough for me.

645
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,750
What?

646
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:00,583
You want to keep tutoring me?

647
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,083
Right?

648
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,000
First, you should pass the exam tomorrow.

649
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:12,250
I know. I'll go back and review it.

650
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,666
I forgot my notebook.

651
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,250
-I'll go back and get it.
-Wait!

652
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,083
Star! It's almost midnight!

653
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,583
There it is!

654
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,416
Here, I got it.

655
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,166
Khun, please help me!

656
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:43,166
Khun! Help me!

657
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,208
Help me!

658
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,708
-A fire!
-You're awake!

659
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,833
What fire?

660
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,625
How did I end up here?

661
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:59,041
Someone found you
lying in front of the old building.

662
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,583
So he called the ambulance
and sent you here.

663
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:07,125
-And what about Khun?
-Khun?

664
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,416
Who is that?

665
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,958
It's nothing.

666
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:54,916
I want to tell you that...

667
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:03,708
Everything happened because
of my stubbornness.

668
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,500
You knew about the ghosts
at the Education Center?

669
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,625
I set up that place.

670
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,958
There!

671
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,916
You're behind all this.

672
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:18,791
Listen to me first.

673
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,333
I set up that room...

674
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,125
It was 30 years ago.

675
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Hey, are you free this Saturday?

676
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:46,416
-Saturday?
-Help me review English.

677
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,625
See you at 9:00 p.m.
at the Education Center.

678
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:53,750
I've got to go.

679
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,208
But then, that night...

680
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,333
That night? What happened?

681
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,958
I fell asleep.

682
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:08,666
When I got up, I hurried there.

683
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,500
After that, I studied very hard.

684
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:40,875
I got to go study in England.

685
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,541
I'm came back here and I became
the Deputy Dean.

686
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,791
When I heard that

687
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,791
spirits have been lingering
around the Education Center.

688
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,083
I think that spirit

689
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,666
is my friend who hasn't gone
to the next life.

690
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,125
So I reopened this room, but...

691
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:01,791
it was a call for other ghosts, too.

692
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,916
I don't know what to do.

693
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:10,458
I just want my friend take the exam.

694
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,041
We used to promise to each other...

695
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,375
This friend of yours,

696
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,250
is it Khun?

697
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,291
He was the one who tricked me.

698
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:40,791
Khun never tricked anyone.

699
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:45,958
He liked to help all his friends.

700
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:50,000
He told all of us to study

701
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,375
so we could graduate together.

702
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:06,458
Where are you?

703
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:13,916
Khun!

704
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,208
Get out here now!

705
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:19,416
You can't just hide from me!

706
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:24,458
If you don't come out,

707
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:30,000
I'll wait here until midnight.

708
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,458
I'm here.

709
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:41,333
I'm sorry, Star.

710
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,166
You tricked me.

711
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,666
I didn't mean to do it.

712
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:52,208
-I was trying to help you.
-Why did you help me?

713
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,291
To help you so that
you can take the exam,

714
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,416
and help you graduate.

715
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,208
Because you aren't like me.

716
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,458
I...

717
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:06,958
I have been here for 30 years.

718
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:10,125
I can't go to the next life.

719
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,875
Even just to graduate,

720
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,500
I still couldn't do it.

721
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,958
If you can take the exam,

722
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:32,083
then you can graduate. If you graduate,
then maybe you can go to your next life.

723
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,083
But after what happened to you,

724
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:38,625
this place might be shut down again.

725
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:42,166
-There will be no more exam.
-No.

726
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:46,625
I'll open this room again
so that we all can take the exam.

727
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,125
So we can graduate.

728
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,500
Do you dare come here for the exam?

729
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,916
I don't, if I'm alone.

730
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:00,083
But if there are many of us, then maybe!

731
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,750
I won't go.

732
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:06,250
Why not?

733
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,416
That room is haunted.

734
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:13,083
If we take the exam before midnight,
they can't do anything to us.

735
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:16,291
We're fine just the way we are.

736
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:19,500
Right. If we pass the exam,

737
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:21,791
who will throw a party for these guys?

738
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,000
Right.

739
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,250
Do you know

740
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,250
why the ghosts assemble there?

741
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,250
Because they were dead
before they could graduate.

742
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:37,833
So their spirits linger there.

743
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:41,375
They want to
take the exam and graduate.

744
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:44,791
We're human. How can we give up?

745
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,375
We're friends.

746
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,125
We have to help each other.

747
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,666
We study together.
We take the exam together.

748
01:19:57,791 --> 01:20:00,125
And we will graduate together.

749
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:03,916
Are we going to take the exam together?

750
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:07,166
No!

751
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:11,791
Star,

752
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,833
don't you fool us.

753
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:17,291
Just like the ghosts there.

754
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:21,208
We're not like you.

755
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,500
A celebrity like you.
Who cares if you don't graduate?

756
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:29,958
-Right.
-You're fine without us.

757
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,333
I'm different from you?

758
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:38,041
For other people, we aren't different.

759
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,541
We're losers.

760
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,041
You know,

761
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,916
even if we're different,

762
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,666
we can still be friends.

763
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,750
I thought

764
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,041
we were friends all along.

765
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:14,750
Don't use my photos to fool someone else.

766
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,375
Hello.

767
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:38,000
Hello.

768
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:54,250
Smile. One, two...

769
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:01,541
Let's take a picture.

770
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:03,916
One.

771
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,500
Two. Three.

772
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,166
Quite nice. Again.

773
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:15,333
This isn't pretty. Wait! Wait!

774
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:19,166
-You're annoying.
-Hey!

775
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,333
Hey! Come here!
Let's take a picture!

776
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:25,458
-Hey! You! Come on!
-One.

777
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,125
Two... Three. Okay.

778
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,250
Hey, tonight.

779
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,958
The party at its best!

780
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,583
For you guys!

781
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:40,833
-Come! Come!
-I already made plans with my friends.

782
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:42,791
Sorry.

783
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,916
I'll go take pictures with my friends.
Bye then.

784
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,958
Bye.

785
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,541
Bye.

786
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,750
You left, just like that?

787
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:54,375
One, two, three.
Pose for a bit there.

788
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:56,708
One, two, three.

789
01:22:57,208 --> 01:23:00,166
I'll take one horizontally. One, two.

790
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:01,666
Look.

791
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:08,250
Let's go somewhere else.

792
01:23:16,916 --> 01:23:18,666
One, two, three.

793
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,291
-Another one.
-Okay.

794
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,541
One, two, three. Yeah!

795
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:31,500
Okay then. One, two, three.

796
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,416
-Thank you. That's so cute.
-Let's check.

797
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:42,041
-I'm the prettiest.
-No. I'm prettier.

798
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,416
Your legs are short.

799
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,333
Come on, Star!
Let's take a group photo.

800
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,833
I didn't graduate like you guys.

801
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:54,208
Come on, Star. That's fine.
Just act like one.

802
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,708
Come on. Quickly.

803
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,083
-Angel gang.
-The photographer's here.

804
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,791
can we please have a group photo?

805
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:00,083
Yes.

806
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:02,125
Star, come on. Let's take a picture.

807
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:13,416
All right, my seniors,

808
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm representing all juniors

809
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,583
and I'd like to wish you all

810
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,333
good luck.

811
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,625
Everything

812
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:29,125
That my heart has been searching for

813
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:34,333
Through all this time

814
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:38,458
You have given me

815
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,583
Good times

816
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:43,458
I want you to know

817
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:46,166
I have you on my mind

818
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:49,375
Wherever

819
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:52,083
I go

820
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:55,791
When I have nobody left

821
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,375
I've still got you to cheer me up

822
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:05,958
Because of everything

823
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:09,916
That you have done
It has changed

824
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:15,250
My broken heart
Your gentleness

825
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:20,791
Your words have filled my void

826
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:27,708
And brought back my hope

827
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,583
Because of everything

828
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:36,500
That you have done

829
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:42,500
It has changed my broken heart

830
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:48,791
You gentleness, your words

831
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:55,000
Have filled my void
And brought back my hope

832
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:58,750
Everything

833
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:03,333
That you've done
It has changed

834
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:07,458
My broken heart

835
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:13,666
Your gentleness, your words

836
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:20,000
Have filled my void
And brought back my hope.

837
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,458
I'm going to take the exam.

838
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,583
Deputy Dean.

839
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,833
I want to resit the exam.

840
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:11,083
I want to graduate.

841
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,541
So does your friend.

842
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,125
I'm happy that you're here.

843
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,208
Friends won't leave friends behind.

844
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:52,875
LAST CLASS - FINAL EXAM

845
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:20,625
I'm ready.

846
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,250
What about you guys?

847
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:32,291
If you're ready, please.

848
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:51,875
Deputy Dean, please let Khun
take the exam, too.

849
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,666
Who is she talking to?

850
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:59,583
She sees a ghost.

851
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,625
Let's go.

852
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:07,916
Go.

853
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,000
Let's start.

854
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,958
Let's start. 

855
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:23,500
Let's start.

856
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:07,875
Don't be scared.

857
01:31:08,291 --> 01:31:10,500
If it isn't midnight,
the ghosts won't come out.

858
01:31:19,416 --> 01:31:22,416
God damn it!

859
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,250
Deputy Dean, what are we gonna do?

860
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,541
Well...

861
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,666
I guess you should
take the exam together then.

862
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:36,333
-Really?
-Everybody.

863
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:41,125
Take the exam questions
and put it on every table.

864
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,875
Ghosts!

865
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:44,458
I told you I'll make sure
you finish taking your exam.

866
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:45,916
Khun.

867
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:00,708
Jon.

868
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,416
We should start the exam.

869
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,791
If so,

870
01:33:16,875 --> 01:33:18,833
everyone please take your seat.

871
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:22,166
We'll start the exam.

872
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:59,458
That's better.

873
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:03,750
-Can we still escape now?
-No, dumbass.

874
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:23,000
Where did you get it?

875
01:34:34,416 --> 01:34:36,250
If you're ready...

876
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:08,500
It isn't true.

877
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,791
One, two, three.

878
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:22,416
It's true.

879
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,208
Help me.

880
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,708
Help me.

881
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:49,541
Moo, why are you coughing?

882
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,708
You shouldn't have asked.

883
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:02,333
I think this is it. This is it.

884
01:37:03,666 --> 01:37:06,000
I've had enough.

885
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:09,333
Hey, wait! I'm going, too.

886
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,333
I'm going, too!

887
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:16,708
-Open it!
-Back off! I'll do it.

888
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,166
-It can't be opened.
-What are you doing?

889
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,458
You haven't finished the exam!
Go back to your seat and get it done!

890
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,458
What exam? Deputy Dean!

891
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:31,458
Well... The exam with the ghosts.

892
01:37:45,166 --> 01:37:47,833
-Deputy Dean, stop them.
-That's right.

893
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:50,166
You opened this room for the ghosts,

894
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,458
you should be responsible for that.

895
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,916
No student is allowed to throw up
in the examination room!

896
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:14,750
Damn, they stayed still.

897
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:18,416
That's freaking cool. Damn!

898
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,875
What should we do?

899
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:39,958
Everyone must finish the exam,

900
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,666
so we can leave this room.

901
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:46,375
Moo, Meuk, Kung,
you have to finish your exam first.

902
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:50,875
Just a little bit more, finish your exam.

903
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,958
And we will graduate together.

904
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,666
-I won't go. You go.
-I won't go. You go.

905
01:38:57,833 --> 01:39:00,125
-I won't go. You go.
-I won't go. You go.

906
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:01,625
Quickly!

907
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:03,583
-Go!
-I won't go!

908
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:06,458
-You go yourself!
-I'm a professor!

909
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:11,708
Moo! Meuk! Kung!

910
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:18,166
When will you go back to your seat?
You don't think about it at all?

911
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:20,833
Everyone here wants to graduate,
so they've come to take the exam.

912
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:24,625
If you want to graduate, go back to
your seats and finish your exam.

913
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:28,291
I'm scared of ghosts.

914
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:31,958
Can you go back and finish your exam?

915
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:33,416
Yes.

916
01:39:33,791 --> 01:39:35,458
-Go!
-Go!

917
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:51,458
I'm done.

918
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,583
Wait.

919
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:57,666
Wait for what?

920
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,666
Wait for your friends.

921
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:32,166
Hey! Hey!

922
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,458
Hey!

923
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:37,000
Don't, Star!

924
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:39,708
Finish your exam, don't worry about me.

925
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:52,916
Auan-Pie!

926
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:54,875
Help me submit the exam paper!

927
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:09,708
Okay.

928
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:38,208
If you can't write, I'll write it for you.

929
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,541
WGT, right?

930
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,291
I allow that.

931
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,541
Khun.

932
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:03,500
You have to graduate.

933
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,208
Your time

934
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:32,916
is almost up.

935
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,750
Quickly.

936
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,333
This is the last question.

937
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,166
What should we do?

938
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:26,291
Star.

939
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,750
The answer for the last question.

940
01:44:46,625 --> 01:44:48,625
Are you sure this is your answer?

941
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:54,791
Time is almost up!

942
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,791
Star! Submit it!

943
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:03,208
Hurry up!

944
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:41,416
Hey, you guys! We survived!

945
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:59,541
Deputy Dean, the last answer.

946
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:02,458
It's wrong.

947
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,333
But only this one.

948
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,791
The rest is all correct.

949
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:29,916
When you have a problem.

950
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:35,125
Friends are always with you.

951
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:42,166
May you rest in peace.

952
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:44,041
My dear friend.

953
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:53,375
Finally,

954
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:56,791
these burning spirits
have gone to a better place.

955
01:46:58,458 --> 01:46:59,875
Congratulations.

956
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,375
You're handsome.

957
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:41,958
THE END

958
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,375
Let's take a picture.

959
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,666
-Yes. Group photo please.
-Let's take a picture.

960
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:47,458
-Let's take a picture.
-Hurry up.

961
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:49,708
Two... Three...

962
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:54,708
-Smile!
-This camera, too!

963
01:47:56,583 --> 01:47:58,666
Here! Here!

964
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,958
-I'm here, I'm here!
-Auan!

965
01:48:04,083 --> 01:48:05,208
I'm here, I'm here!

966
01:48:05,291 --> 01:48:07,541
You're late!

967
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,291
Where is Star?

968
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:12,458
I'm here, I'm here!

969
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:16,166
I'm sorry. I have to find my way here
through all that people.

970
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:17,958
Many of them asked for a picture with me.

971
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:22,541
Can we start?

972
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,791
Here are the balloons.

973
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:30,000
You talk too much!
Here, hand these out!

974
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:35,166
Come on.

975
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:38,666
Come on.

976
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:42,833
Ready?

977
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,333
Okay.

978
01:49:03,291 --> 01:49:05,416
Let's take a group photo!

979
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:09,208
Yeah!

980
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,708
One, two, three!

981
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,500
