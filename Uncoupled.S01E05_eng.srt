Are you all right?

No, no, no, no, it's fine.

-A long-term relationship that just ended.

The last time I had sex with a stranger,
I was gloved up and layered.

My boyfriend left me,
and I'm a little angry about it.

Which, of course, is natural, right?

134

Everything is natural.

Yes?

That's one.

I don't feel any different.

142

We have only begun.

Oh, the journey takes time.

And I'm guessing
you have to buy a package.

00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,505
in Berlin's premier gay periodical,
Das Butt.

312
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,634
I even turned the loading dock
into a back room.

313
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
But people are shy.
Please, have sex there.

314
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,555
Oh, I think we're good.

315
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,391
Ooh! Here's Willie. Welcome!

316
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,936
We were just saying
how beautiful everything looks.

317
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,521
-Yeah, it's-- Whew!
-Yes. Very, um… vivid. Very…

318
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,065
-Bzz, bzz…
-Stirring.

319
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,860
How kind. Between you and me,
this is not even my best stuff.

320
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,987
Look at that one, Friedrich.

321
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,241
That model could have been your father.
You have the same…

322
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,827
Why do you think anyone will pay for this?

323
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,705
I mean, we have Pornhub now.
And I haven't seen any red dots.

324
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,958
Except on that one waiter's ass.

325
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,502
-Hmm.
-Ah, sorry, I'm off the clock.

326
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,630
This crowd will buy, trust me.
Once Stossel primes the pump--

327
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,548
He's a big gay art collector.

328
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,759
I've bet the farm on this,
and I'm never wrong.

329
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,512
-Thanks for the support, Billy. As always.
-[phone alert]

330
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,264
Great. He's ten minutes away. [chuckles]

331
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,393
How do you get fired from a internship?

332
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,937
Because I'm a musician,
not a sound engineer.

333
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,021
Oh!

334
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,482
Well, okay. Maybe it's for the best.

335
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,151
You can find a job
that might actually pay you.

336
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,279
Once in a while, you could flirt with me.

337
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,657
Ooh! We're in luck! A rom-com marathon.

338
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,742
[giggles]

339
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,910
Ooh!

340
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,165
-[sighs]
-What is this? Ice cream is flirting.

341
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,125
Mm.

342
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,419
By the way,
the Jordans want us for dinner next week.

343
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,963
[sighs] Fine. But let's tell them
we have an early morning.

344
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,673
Totally. Love him. Hate her.

345
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,968
I'm just being friendly.
Besides, I'm on the co-op board.

346
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,055
You know, sometimes they say
ice cream tastes better when it's melted.

347
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,015
[chuckles]

348
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,559
Should we let it rest for an hour?

349
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,060
An hour?

350
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,771
Okay, now you're flattering me.

351
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,565
-[woman] Ah!
-[both chuckle]

352
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,775
[groans] Oh my God!

353
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,778
-Oh my God, it's you!
-What?

354
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,282
You're the man in my bed!
There's no room for any hot doctor.

355
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,661
Get out! Get out, get out, get out!
Get your ass out!

356
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,538
[exhales]

357
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,666
That's one.

358
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,585
I remember when you were at Channel Five.

359
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,838
That feature that you did
on Hurricane Sandy. Yes, it was amazing.

360
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,340
I had no idea you were gay.

361
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,177
I would say thank you,
but I'm too evolved.

362
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,094
Huh.

363
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,138
-[whispers] But thank you.
-[laughs]

364
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,976
Oh, a patient just clocked me.
I should go and say hi. Excuse me.

365
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,982
He's great. How's the sex?

366
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,152
No idea. We're takin' it slow.
I wanna get to know him as a person.

367
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,528
God, why?

368
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,654
Mr. Stossel!

369
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,407
Welcome to Butt Munsch.

370
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,494
Allow me to take you through
the exhibition. There's a progression.

371
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,455
From singles, to doubles, to quintuples,

372
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,041
with a corresponding movement
from front to back,

373
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,710
to back to back, to back on back.

374
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,505
That won't be necessary.

375
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,176
I am an art collector, Mr. James.

376
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,347
This isn't art.

377
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,432
It's porn.

378
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,475
Worse.

379
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,811
Cartoon porn.

380
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,190
Oh my God.
Stanley's got everything riding on this.

381
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,237
Uh… Mr. James.

382
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,326
Is Leather Urinal still available?

383
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,786
Um…

384
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,704
Yes?

385
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,875
Not anymore.
Where are your little red dots?

386
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:55,425
What a relief. It's so hard
to buy for Anderson Cooper.

387
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,177
I was actually looking at that one.

388
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,055
Fortunately, I have another
from the same period.

389
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,557
Let me show you Pig Trough.

390
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,184
[mutters] Thank you.

391
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,728
Ahem. It's right over here.

392
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,400
Well played. You're a good friend.

393
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,317
Thank you.

394
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,613
He won't really make me
pay for that, will he?

395
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,412
This is so weird.
I swear I remember this one.

396
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,746
Oh my God, yes.

397
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,041
It was on a postcard I bought
in the Village in the tenth grade.

398
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,002
I was a nervous wreck on the bus home,

399
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,713
clutching my backpack
like Gollum with the ring.

400
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,047
[laughs]

401
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,674
It was ninth grade for me.

402
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,345
Somebody shoved it in my locker
with "faggot" scrawled across the back.

403
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,513
But the front,

404
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,682
perfect.

405
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,477
It was the pride and joy
of my teenage wank bank.

406
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,437
Me too.

407
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,688
Wild.

408
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,441
It's like the universe…

409
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,493
-Is that your first one?
-I haven't eaten a thing all day.

410
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,758
-This part feels like Christmas morning.
-Oh yeah.

411
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,509
-Opening presents.
-[chuckles]

412
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,137
-Mm!
-I hope you like what Santa brought you.

413
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,558
[whispers] Best Christmas ever.

414
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,977
All right, my turn.

415
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,313
Oh!

416
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,733
Whoa, it just keeps on going.

417
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,445
Congratulations to your parents,
Paul and Mary Bunyan.

418
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,530
I hope you're not a grower.

419
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh my God! You are.

420
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,327
Oh, wow!

421
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,957
Okay, well, fortunately,
I can unhinge my jaw like a python.

422
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,291
Oh, actually, um…

423
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,377
I was hoping that

424
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,254
I could…

425
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,966
Seriously? With that thing?

426
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,217
I'll go easy.

427
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,973
-You are so tense.
-I… Uh…

428
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,974
Um…

429
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,642
-Come here.
-Okay.

430
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,602
[Josh groans]

431
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,979
[sighs]

432
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,940
-[whispers] Just relax.
-I'm sorry.

433
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,694
I've just been accustomed to a certain
size and circumference for a lot of years,

434
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,446
and it's kind of minor league
with what you got goin' on down there.

435
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,241
You know, I have heard that before.
[laughs]

436
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,328
And, um… there is a workaround.

437
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,163
What, poppers and a prayer?

438
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,796
I can use an anal paralytic.
It's off-label, but it works like a charm.

439
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,714
What…

440
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,425
You wanna Botox my butthole?

441
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,427
Just a few ccs.

442
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,222
It'll deaden the sphincter reflex,
and then, pah! I'm in.

443
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,058
There is not one word in that sentence
that doesn't terrify me.

444
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,811
Don't worry, I'm great with the needle.
You will hardly feel a thing.

445
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,812
Hardly--

446
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,481
Come on. You spent all night
telling me how open you are.

447
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,275
Yeah, spiritually!

448
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,654
Um, I don't really want you
to Botox my ass,

449
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,073
and, sidebar, when would it snap back?

450
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,161
How long would I walk around
with an asshole like a loose turtleneck?

451
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
I… I'm sorry. I… I can't do this.

452
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,958
Wait, no. It wa-- it was just an idea.
Look, see?

453
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,294
-What are you doin'?
-I'm not supposed to be here.

454
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:21,673
I'm not supposed to know about
Botoxed buttholes, and PrEP,

455
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,884
and-- and no condoms.

456
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,595
I am supposed to be
sitting on my couch watching TV

457
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,639
while my boyfriend
is chewing way too loud beside me.

458
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,601
That is the world that I want.
I miss that world, and I want it back.

459
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,977
And if I can't have it back,

460
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,481
then I want it to be a year from now,
or ten years,

461
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,360
and all this pain and anger
and change will be over.

462
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,946
Okay, I get it, I get it. I really do.
Can I just say one thing?

463
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,615
Sure.

464
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,784
How about just the tip?

465
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,953
[sighs]

466
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,464
No, he's a great guy, Dad, really,
and it started out well. It just…

467
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,550
wasn't a good fit.

468
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,510
I gotta go.

469
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,596
Good news. The loan funded into escrow,

470
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,849
we close the Claire deal in two weeks,
Raffi almost smiled.

471
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,312
Oh, and guess what? The asshole guru,
teacher, whatever, was right about me too.

472
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,816
I realized who the man in my bed is.

473
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,983
Kai, my son.

474
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,985
-Ew.
-I know.

475
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,947
When I think of all the times I reach
for the remote without looking. Ugh!

476
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,367
Could've been a Freudian nightmare.
We gotta find him his own place stat.

477
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,036
And I gotta get back out there
and find somebody that turns me on.

478
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,581
Well, good luck with that.
Out there is no fun.

479
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,000
What happened to the doctor?

480
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,293
It all went away!

481
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,923
The guy, the forgiveness, the compassion.
I'm right where I was.

482
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:48,051
It's now, it's not a year from now,
and now sucks!

483
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,720
I know you're mad, honey,
but we're gonna need that stapler.

484
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,391
I'm just gonna grow older and older,
until one day, I'm Jack.

485
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,602
-Who's Jack?
-Old guy that lives on my floor.

486
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,356
Keeps putting Post-it notes on my door,
asking me over for drinks.

487
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,442
Because we have so much in common.

488
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,569
Gay, old, alone.

489
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,404
I got one of those in my building too.

490
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,239
Three hairs here, 20 down here.

491
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,366
You'll kill me
before that happens, won't you?

492
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,492
[chuckles]

493
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,913
[mellow jazzy music playing]

494
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,458
[Jack] Michael Lawson!

495
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,751
[chuckles]

496
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,465
I thought I saw you
back there in the market. I waved!

497
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,676
Did you see the skinny ice cream on sale?

498
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,679
Three hundred calories for the whole pint!

499
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,932
Not that you need it. [laughs]

500
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:40,061
Look at you. Snake hips.
That's what we used to call it.

501
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,688
Thanks, I think?

502
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,274
Don't you miss the way things used to be?

503
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,401
Only every minute of every day.

504
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,028
That's why I'm moving.

505
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,488
Miami.

506
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,532
Can't take the winters anymore.

507
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm thinking, if I can get two… 2.2,
with a good Realtor…

508
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,082
You think you can handle that?

509
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,002
Wait, you want me to sell your--

510
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,545
Who else?

511
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,549
I left a few notes on your door,
but if you're too busy…

512
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,885
No, right, of course you did.

513
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm sorry, Jack.

514
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,764
I can definitely handle it. Thank you.

515
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,100
Sorry. I'm just a little thrown.
I was not expecting something good.

516
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,312
It's been a hard week.

517
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,314
Hard couple of weeks.

518
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,859
My lover, he died 23 years ago.

519
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,779
I thought I would never get over it.

520
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,365
But you do. Eventually.

521
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,326
It's a journey. No shortcuts.

522
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

523
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,541
Yeah, actually.

524
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,210
A kind of guru, once.

525
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,630
[laughs] Lucky you. I had nuns.

526
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,761
You can see right over the trees
on my floor.

527
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,681
All New York.

528
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,103
I'll miss it, but it's a young man's town.

529
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,522
If I were your age…

530
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,152
But you know that. How lucky you are.

531
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,863
Everything in front of you.

532
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:20,161
Hey, Jack. What do you say
you show me your place,

533
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,748
we crack open that skinny ice cream,
and talk prices?

534
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,319
