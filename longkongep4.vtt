1
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.400
Mom.

2
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.039
Mom, help me.

3
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.680
Mom.

4
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.759
It's black magic. You won't survive.

5
00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.520
There's only one way.

6
00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.400
You have to inherit my powers

7
00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.599
to fight the black magic
that was put on you.

8
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.639
I have half of my powers
which I'll pass on

9
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.639
to you.

10
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.879
But remember, when you take
black magic from me,

11
00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.479
it'll stay with you
for the rest of your life.

12
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.040
The powers you receive

13
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.759
will expel all the black magic
that was put in your body.

14
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.439
If you can handle the pain,

15
00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.360
you will survive.

16
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.319
Remember,

17
00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.160
regarding people that use black magic,

18
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.480
there are only two types.

19
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.399
The first type…

20
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.800
are those who despise each other so much

21
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.920
that they resort to using black magic
to kill one another.

22
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.160
The other type…

23
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.399
are those who have something to hide.

24
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.680
So they use black magic

25
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.160
to harm those
who are trying to uncover their secrets.

26
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.639
Find the woman in that clip...

27
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.759
because it's her…

28
00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.000
who put black magic on you.

29
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.159
I'm serious.

30
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.519
How could I want my friend to die?

31
00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:06.480
A dark, shadowy, and scary figure?

32
00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:10.519
You should cooperate with the police.

33
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.360
If you don't tell the truth,

34
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.679
it would be worse.

35
00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:15.480
I'm serious.

36
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.399
How could I want my friend to die?

37
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.799
There was a dark shadow.

38
00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.159
It was so scary.

39
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.799
It was all around Ping.

40
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.759
It was terrifying, Officer.

41
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.519
-All right.
-It killed Ping.

42
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600
Calm down.

43
00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:49.360
Why don't we take a break?

44
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.399
We'll continue this later.

45
00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.759
Hey, she's coming out.

46
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.759
-Can you answer some questions?
-Aya!

47
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.000
Does the fierce competition
to be the Cheer Club's center

48
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.840
have anything to do with this incident?

49
00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:12.320
Is it related, Aya?

50
00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:15.720
And before the show,
did you have a conversation with Ping?

51
00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:19.240
We have no comment at the moment
because the investigation is still open.

52
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.080
An interview may compromise
the investigation.

53
00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:24.879
Is it true that it was revenge on your
best friend for winning the position?

54
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.879
-Please answer.
-Please.

55
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.679
I will keep saying it.

56
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.360
I didn't want Ping to die.

57
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.279
You will all think that I'm crazy

58
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.799
if I tell you what I saw.

59
00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.360
I don't believe in ghosts or black magic.

60
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.759
But this time…

61
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.519
I saw it with my own eyes.

62
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.960
-What did you see?
-I didn't lie.

63
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.799
Some superstitious nonsense?

64
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:14.720
What's wrong, Dan?

65
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.720
Well…

66
00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:30.240
at first, I wasn't sure
if I should tell you.

67
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.840
But with what happened to Ping,

68
00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.399
I think that I have to tell you.

69
00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:42.559
After what happened to Kin,

70
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.159
I noticed how Khaimook was acting oddly.

71
00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.519
She was following Praewa everywhere.

72
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.679
Praewa?

73
00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:52.879
Yes.

74
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:55.240
I think

75
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.080
Praewa has also been acting odd

76
00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.000
since she came back.

77
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.360
I feel that way too.

78
00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.000
Since she came back,

79
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.039
strange things have been happening.

80
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.600
Especially before Ping fell,

81
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.360
I saw…

82
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:20.600
I saw some shadowy figure attacking her.

83
00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:24.960
Like what Aya told everyone.

84
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.840
I also saw

85
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.919
that Praewa had a smirk on her face

86
00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:33.879
when Ping fell.

87
00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.639
I didn't dare tell anyone

88
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.519
because I was afraid
people might call me crazy.

89
00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:47.559
I don't know what Praewa is thinking.

90
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.200
But if she has something to do
with our friends' deaths,

91
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.639
I'll find out one way or another.

92
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:00.639
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

93
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.399
Be careful, Dan.

94
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.399
If there's anything,

95
00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:09.600
tell me, okay?

96
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.080
Okay.

97
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.919
What should we do now?

98
00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.759
I think we have to disband the team.

99
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.039
Or even the club.

100
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.559
I tried my best.

101
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.600
But I don't know

102
00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:56.679
why they keep dying one after another.

103
00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:02.919
I can't do a fucking thing about it.

104
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.159
Even if we don't have our club anymore…

105
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.480
We'll still have each other.

106
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
Me.

107
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
You.

108
00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.639
And everyone else in the club.

109
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.519
We love this club as much as you do.

110
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.480
IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT DEATHS
OF OUR TWO MEMBERS,

111
00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.759
WE HAVE LOST OUR KEY MEMBER
AND THE TEAM'S CENTER.

112
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.000
WHICH SHOWS THE LACK OF UNITY.

113
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.679
Is it because of me?

114
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.159
Am I the one who did this to our team?

115
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.279
Come on, Ya.

116
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.480
I believe you.

117
00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:07.159
Why does nobody believe me?

118
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.960
I've already told everybody the truth.

119
00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.039
Do you know

120
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.399
why everybody thinks you did it?

121
00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.639
That's because of what you did to Ping.

122
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.879
I know you were upset with Ping,

123
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.720
but she was your friend.

124
00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:34.759
When Brave's clip blew up,

125
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.840
she stood by you.

126
00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.639
She hurt Praewa

127
00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.039
because you were her best friend.

128
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.360
Just admit that you hated her.

129
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.279
Stop lying and making things up.

130
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.639
I might have hated her,
but I didn't want her to die.

131
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.960
That's enough.

132
00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:53.480
Talking about this won't bring Ping back.

133
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:55.240
So shut up about it already.

134
00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:19.919
Don't cry, Ya.

135
00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.200
I'm on your side.

136
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.759
I apologize for calling this meeting
on such short notice,

137
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.320
as well as the statement earlier.

138
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.320
I'm sure you all must have seen it.

139
00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:44.120
I didn't inform you beforehand

140
00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.720
because I had already discussed it
with Justin,

141
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.159
and we both agreed.

142
00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:51.519
So we decided to release the statement.

143
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.320
The first rule of the Cheer Club

144
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.919
is everybody stays united
and trusts each other.

145
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.000
Fighting and bullying during practice

146
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.799
are serious mistakes.

147
00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:09.440
Aya,

148
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.480
I hope you understand.

149
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.960
To restore our good name,

150
00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.839
and as your punishment,

151
00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.960
I'm terminating your role as a cheerleader

152
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.880
effective as of today.

153
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.799
You will regret this.

154
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.720
Hi, Dad.

155
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.799
Hey, Lin.

156
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.759
What brings you here?

157
00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:17.559
I canceled today's meeting

158
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.279
to come and see you.

159
00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:23.759
How have you been, Lin?

160
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.079
Are you doing okay?

161
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160
I'm okay.

162
00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:30.039
Take care of yourself.

163
00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:32.720
Tell me if you need anything.

164
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.240
Okay.

165
00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:36.799
Why don't you go take a shower

166
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.720
so we can have dinner together?

167
00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:39.640
Yes.

168
00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.519
-Mom!
-Get out! Get her out of here!

169
00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:57.880
-Bitch!
-Mom, calm down!

170
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.480
-I hate her! Get her out of here!
-Mom!

171
00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:00.759
Get her out of here!

172
00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:02.480
-Mom, calm down!
-I hate her!

173
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.440
Let's get inside.

174
00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:06.680
-You bitch!
-Mom.

175
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.000
-Get her out of here!
-Mom.

176
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.200
-Let's get inside.
-I hate her!

177
00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:12.519
Let's get inside.

178
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.279
Don't cry, Prae.

179
00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:12.039
Don't mind Mother Parn.

180
00:21:12.119 --> 00:21:15.519
She scolds everyone.

181
00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:19.240
Prae,

182
00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:21.160
you know,

183
00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:25.559
the two of us don't belong here.

184
00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:29.319
One day, when I become an adult,

185
00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.079
I will make everyone who looks down on us

186
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.599
accept us.

187
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.440
When you become an adult?

188
00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:41.279
Will I be like you, Sai?

189
00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:44.720
Will I get to wear beautiful high heels?

190
00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:47.119
Of course.

191
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.039
Because I will make you

192
00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:51.599
my companion.

193
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200
We will be together forever.

194
00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:00.759
We will be together forever.

195
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.359
Let's get some sleep.

196
00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:16.839
-She'll get it for you.
-I'll get it.

197
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.000
-This one?
-Yes.

198
00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:20.680
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

199
00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:21.640
-And you?
-The panda.

200
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.319
The panda.

201
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.839
-Thank you.
-And you?

202
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.160
-The pony, please.
-The pony?

203
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.880
-This one?
-Yes.

204
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.440
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

205
00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:33.359
-Can I have snacks?
-Snacks.

206
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.119
-Would you like a toy too? No?
-No.

207
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.119
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

208
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.400
-Hi.
-I'd like that one, please.

209
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

210
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.079
That one.

211
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.920
-The panda, please.
-The panda.

212
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.240
There you go.

213
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.880
-The pony.
-The pony, okay?

214
00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.640
Thank you.

215
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:51.400
Thank you.

216
00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.759
-Thanks.
-Can I have a doll, please?

217
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.039
This is…

218
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.759
the orphanage that my dad sponsors.

219
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.039
Really?

220
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.880
Dan, can you take me there?

221
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.839
What are you going to do there, Lin?

222
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:33.680
Hello, Deuan.

223
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.359
I'm on campus.

224
00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:39.680
Which one?

225
00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:43.440
Oh, that TV series?

226
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.960
I don't want to do it anymore.

227
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.279
If they don't cast Nat next to me,

228
00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:52.640
then I don't want to do it.

229
00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:56.599
You know what?

230
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.680
You can tell them
that I'm not into horror.

231
00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:05.319
I know I gave them my word,

232
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.039
and they have been waiting.

233
00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.799
But it's their problem

234
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.960
because they didn't cast Nat for the role.

235
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.599
Praewa?

236
00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:46.640
What are you going to do to me?

237
00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:54.640
I just want to know…

238
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.640
The girl in the clip with Brave,

239
00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:04.359
is it you?

240
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.880
It's not me.

241
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.839
Are you crazy?

242
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.960
Are you sure?

243
00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.000
It's not me.

244
00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:28.680
Do you know

245
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.759
who that bitch is?

246
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.759
I don't know.

247
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:35.039
How would I know?

248
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.119
You don't know?

249
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.160
Fine.

250
00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:46.039
Praewa!

251
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.640
Praewa!

252
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:50.119
I really don't know

253
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.640
who that girl is.

254
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.680
Nat doesn't tell me anything.

255
00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:56.599
All I know is that
Nat shared the clip himself.

256
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.920
He didn't lose his phone
like he told everyone.

257
00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:07.880
Praewa, wait.

258
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.200
There's someone

259
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.440
who probably knows who the girl is.

260
00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.960
If I tell you,

261
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.240
you have to let me go.

262
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.519
Are you bargaining with me?

263
00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.319
Are you going to tell me?

264
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.079
Fine.

265
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.839
Okay, Praewa!

266
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.039
I'll tell you, Praewa!

267
00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:48.759
I'll tell you right now!

268
00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:50.119
Nat told me...

269
00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:53.799
that day...

270
00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:56.559
Professor Pat called Nat and Brave in,

271
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.839
the day the clip was shared.

272
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.440
And it was Professor Pat

273
00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:01.519
who told Nat and Brave

274
00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:03.400
to tell everyone
that it was you in the clip.

275
00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.480
I have no idea

276
00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.839
why she would do that to you.

277
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.039
Kat.

278
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.759
What?

279
00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:40.240
Get home safely.

280
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.799
Praewa!

281
00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:06.759
Praewa!

282
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.359
Open the door now!

283
00:29:10.839 --> 00:29:12.839
You can't leave me up here!

284
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.160
Help!

285
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.720
Help! Somebody help!

286
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:25.240
Help!

287
00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:27.119
Help! Somebody help!

288
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.240
Can anybody hear me?

289
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.519
Help! Can anybody see me?

290
00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.440
-Hello.
-Hello.

291
00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:57.359
Hi.

292
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.799
It's been a long time.

293
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.440
You're all grown up now.

294
00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:03.160
How is your father?

295
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.160
He is fine.

296
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.160
The place has changed a lot.

297
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.799
Praewa, the girl you saw earlier,

298
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.359
used to live here.

299
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.240
This is her.

300
00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.160
She used to live here.

301
00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:27.000
And the lady who adopted Praewa,

302
00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:28.240
her name is Fon.

303
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:32.200
Her personal records and information

304
00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:33.960
can't be disclosed.

305
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.039
I do apologize for that.

306
00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:38.000
It's okay.

307
00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:40.160
Fon is a kind person.

308
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.160
She used to visit the children here often.

309
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:46.400
But since she adopted Praewa and Sai,

310
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.279
we haven't heard from her much.

311
00:30:49.759 --> 00:30:50.880
Sai…

312
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.960
you just mentioned, who is she?

313
00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.200
This one here.

314
00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:04.480
Fon adopted two girls from the orphanage.

315
00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.240
Other than Praewa,

316
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.640
there was Sai.

317
00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:12.240
Sai was Praewa's best friend.

318
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.559
They grew up together like sisters.

319
00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:18.400
If I'm not mistaken,
the last time you visited,

320
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.400
many years ago,

321
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.160
around that time Fon came
to adopt Praewa and Sai.

322
00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:30.119
After that, something seemed to happen.

323
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.519
I mean, I heard that Sai ran away.

324
00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:36.480
We hadn't heard any news about the family

325
00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:39.119
until Praewa came back today.

326
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.039
I didn't recognize her at first.

327
00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:42.799
She has changed so much.

328
00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:01.240
Are you okay, Lin?

329
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.839
You've been quiet for a while.

330
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.039
What are you thinking?

331
00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:11.799
I'm just puzzled.

332
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.079
Do you think it's too much
of a coincidence?

333
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:18.599
Why does this seem so easy?

334
00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:23.200
When there are things
we have to work so hard to find,

335
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.720
but we can never seem to find them.

336
00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:30.359
Don't think too much, Lin.

337
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.559
This is good, actually.

338
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.720
Maybe we will solve it
sooner than we thought.

339
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.839
This must be the place
where they used to live.

340
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.599
From the address
we got from the social worker…

341
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.279
From the looks of it,

342
00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:30.039
they probably moved out many years ago.

343
00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:39.319
Are you sure you're coming with me?

344
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680
Yes.

345
00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:46.480
I think being alone in the car is scarier.

346
00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.599
Okay, let's go.

347
00:35:38.199 --> 00:35:39.039
Lin,

348
00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:42.480
let's have a look downstairs.

349
00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:45.440
Come.

350
00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:32.440
What is it, Lilin?

351
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.760
They seemed happy.

352
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.280
I don't understand why

353
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840
that girl Sai would run away.

354
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.119
To others, it might look like a good life,

355
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.159
but to her, maybe it wasn't.

356
00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:08.079
We can't decide for other people, Dan.

357
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.400
I think…

358
00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.559
Praewa's family is not normal.

359
00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:49.920
Let's go back, Dan.

360
00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:53.000
Okay.

361
00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:11.199
Dan, do you think that all of this

362
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.360
is connected to Praewa?

363
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.840
I mean, Kin's and Ping's deaths.

364
00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:21.960
I don't want to jump to conclusions.

365
00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:24.920
But right now,

366
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.159
I think Praewa has the biggest reason
to be angry about what went down.

367
00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.679
If that's really the case,

368
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.320
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

369
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.320
We must find out

370
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.039
what really happened.

371
00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.960
Let's get it over with.

372
00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:02.239
I have a lot of work to do.

373
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.119
I just want
to suggest a solution for our team.

374
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.159
How about…

375
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.119
we don't punish anyone?

376
00:40:15.159 --> 00:40:17.119
If we want to protect Aya,

377
00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:20.000
we just have to find a scapegoat

378
00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:24.039
and blame everything on that person.

379
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.280
Shall we just do that, Professor?

380
00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:31.480
Praewa.

381
00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:36.079
You should watch what you say.

382
00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:38.039
It's bad enough for the team right now.

383
00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:42.079
Hasn't it been like this all along?

384
00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:45.679
Don't behave like that with me.

385
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.199
Like what?

386
00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:54.320
I'm not pointing a finger in your face
and yelling at you.

387
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.000
If you continue to behave like this,

388
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:03.440
even if Justin insists
on having you on the team,

389
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.039
I can still kick you out.

390
00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:09.559
Like you did three months ago?

391
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.320
Let's just talk about this, Professor Pat.

392
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:21.440
You know

393
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.000
that the girl in the clip isn't me.

394
00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:27.800
So who is it…

395
00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:30.760
that you are protecting?

396
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.079
What are you talking about?

397
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.599
So you're really not going to tell me

398
00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:40.519
who that girl in the clip is?

399
00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:45.159
Get out of my office.

400
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.320
Don't ever hope
that you will get back into the team.

401
00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:54.960
When this thing gets out,

402
00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:57.719
I guess that's
when you're going to start talking.

403
00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.320
What are you talking about?

404
00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:02.719
You know what you've done.

405
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.559
I'm giving you a choice.

406
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.320
Tell me the truth

407
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.280
or have everyone know
about that dirty money.

408
00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:30.320
What are you talking about?

409
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.679
You have no evidence.

410
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.320
Don't accuse me without proof.

411
00:42:40.159 --> 00:42:41.239
Praewa!

412
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.760
What?

413
00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:25.320
Help!

414
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.800
Since I can't make you talk,

415
00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:39.519
you have no use to me.

416
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.559
You have sex with women
and show each other the clips?

417
00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:08.360
And you lost your phone?

418
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.920
Yes.

419
00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:15.960
I didn't mean for this to happen.

420
00:44:16.039 --> 00:44:18.440
But you meant to send the clip
to your friend.

421
00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:21.400
For that, you should be expelled.

422
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.800
But I will help you
and the person in the clip.

423
00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:38.920
But you and Nat

424
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.719
have to promise me

425
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.440
that you'll never talk about this again.

426
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.039
I'll take that as a yes.

427
00:44:53.719 --> 00:44:55.519
This is a little token of appreciation

428
00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:58.880
for taking care of my son, Brave.

429
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.719
200,000 BAHT

430
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.920
I hope you'll accept it.

431
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.599
Don't worry.

432
00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:21.079
I'll do my best to help.

433
00:45:21.159 --> 00:45:22.639
I will write a statement

434
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.440
explaining that the people in the clip

435
00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:25.880
are Brave and…

436
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.079
Praewa.

437
00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:31.239
From now on, you will no longer
be the girl in the clip.

438
00:45:45.199 --> 00:45:46.360
Help!

439
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.280
Help!

440
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.079
Help!

441
00:45:50.159 --> 00:45:51.159
Help!

442
00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.679
What's going on?

443
00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.960
-She's covered in them.
-What…

444
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:02.400
Excuse me.

445
00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.719
What happened, Khaimook?

446
00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:07.480
How did this happen?

447
00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:37.079
