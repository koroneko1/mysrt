Don’t you two click at all?

5
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:22,876
I’m not into love.

6
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:26,928
I think your heart hasn’t been used in a long time.

7
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:30,053
I promise I will put my best effort into writing this movie’s script.

8
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,122
And I’ll live Tun’s life to the fullest.

9
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:32,970
With you.

10
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:37,123
We must name our team.

11
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:42,722
I think it should say we’re working behind the film.

12
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:43,465
What do you think?

13
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,639
Up and His Crew.

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,801
Nice and clear.

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,040
It’s clear that you’re brainless, Up-Pree.

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,948
I got something.

17
00:00:57,738 --> 00:00:59,052
End Credits.

18
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,100
Almost there.

19
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,192
But it’s too simple.

20
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,440
Friend Credits.

21
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:11,051
Add F-R-I before E-N-D and it makes ‘Friend.’

22
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,166
Friend Credits.

23
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:15,760
Meaning friends who go through thick and thin together until the end.

24
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,477
Hey! That’s good.

25
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,559
You guys like it?

26
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:24,517
Yeah.

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,392
Let’s go with it.

28
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:27,679
Use this name.

29
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:28,888
Friend Credits.

30
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,768
I will make a sign and put it up in front of our studio.

31
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:33,100
Hold on, Up.

32
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:35,578
When do have a studio?

33
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,890
I’ve prepared you guys a surprise.

34
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,545
It’s dope, I must say.

35
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,792
What is this?

36
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:52,740
The restaurant owner rented it out so cheap and I got it from him.

37
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,519
Damn! You didn’t discuss it with us.

38
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,831
If I did, this rental wouldn’t happen.

39
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,959
I decided to go ahead and rent it.

40
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,020
Welcome.

41
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,599
See? Surprised, huh?

42
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:09,638
Surprised?

43
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,714
Is it gonna work?

44
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:13,733
It’s nice.

45
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,000
TWO WEEKS LATER

46
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,641
Up.

47
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:29,742
For the scene where the male lead confesses,

48
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:31,891
why did you leave it blank?

49
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,527
I can’t come up with any remarkable sentence.

50
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,124
Any good ideas?

51
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,392
I can’t think of one.

52
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,040
Do you want to try?

53
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,849
Try to get to know each other.

54
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,600
You don’t have to like me very much.

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,674
Just keep your heart open for me.

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,600
- That’s…
- Damn!

57
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,707
I love that already.

58
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,827
I think we should use it.

59
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,160
Damn it, Tun!

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,740
You’re a genius.

61
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,458
Now that we got it,

62
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,089
I’m gonna go get a drink. I’m thirsty.

63
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:08,828
Coming with you.

64
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:09,960
I need to use a restroom.

65
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,737
You’re a cheater.

66
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,469
That was from 2gether.

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,704
I was just saying.

68
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,428
Who would have thought they’d love it?

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,996
Shit!

70
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,960
Is this copyright infringement?

71
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,206
It’s from a different universe. It should be okay.

72
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,488
Oh!

73
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,285
I skimmed through what you wrote.

74
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,800
It’s pretty good.

75
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,717
Just one tiny problem though.

76
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:52,535
Here.

77
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:57,704
In the scene where the guy seduces the girl,

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,445
we can make it more swoon-worthy.

79
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,972
I told you I wasn’t an expert in romance.

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,772
Haven’t you acted in this kind of scene?

81
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,606
I have.

82
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,421
It was a short thesis film my senior made.

83
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:21,920
It’s the scene where the male and female leads sit on a dining table.

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,035
Then what?

85
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,564
Ah!

86
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,437
You’re showing me the scene, huh?

87
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,517
Go on.

88
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,725
This is seductive already?

89
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,069
Do I need to blush?

90
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,629
What were you looking at?

91
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,277
Was there a stain on my hand?

92
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:29,160
What?

93
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,230
Why are you so stoic?

94
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:36,000
When I acted in that short film, my partner was captivated.

95
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,091
There, there.

96
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,315
I’m just strong-minded.

97
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:48,514
Don’t you feel anything at all?

98
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:52,833
I do.

99
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:57,509
I feel you are adorable

100
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,035
when you pout.

101
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,554
Hold on.

102
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,461
That’s an act or you’re actually blushing?

103
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:28,061
There. You’re blushing.

104
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,920
Just an act!

105
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,518
That’s enough.

106
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:36,564
Keep reading the script.

107
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,299
You’re cute and tiny when you blush.

108
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,230
It’s mine.

109
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,053
Let me imitate that.

110
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,955
See you.

111
00:07:58,955 --> 00:07:59,790
Bye.

112
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,920
Hello. What’s up, Kita?

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,677
What?

114
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,377
We have a test today?

115
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,078
I’m on my way.

116
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:20,000
Dang, give me a ride.

117
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:23,851
What did you just call me?

118
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:24,794
Dang.

119
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,440
Then you’re not going anywhere.

120
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:30,549
Please, Mr. Tun the Hottie.

121
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,401
Give me a ride.

122
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:34,708
Fine. You should’ve said that from the beginning.

123
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,710
Follow me.

124
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,773
Can we go slower?

125
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,862
You won’t it in time if I go slower.

126
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
What will happen first between we crash and the gas runs out?

127
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,299
What did you say?

128
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,249
I said

129
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,371
I don’t know what will happen first between we crash and the gas runs out.

130
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,695
Ah!

131
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:00,011
We won’t crash and the gas won’t run out.

132
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:02,314
It’s a fuel-efficient motorbike.

133
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,618
I know my bike very well.

134
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,000
It’s Pakorn’s bike.

135
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,180
What?

136
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:09,526
Turn right.

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,605
Left?

138
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,000
Right!

139
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,274
Crap!

140
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,083
I can’t hear you well.

141
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,489
Write on my back.

142
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,237
To turn left, write ‘L.’ To turn right, write ‘R.’

143
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,239
Got it?

144
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,156
Okay.

145
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:26,530
Was that an L?

146
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:28,400
It’s an R.

147
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,412
Damn!

148
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:32,240
What a terrible start.

149
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,132
We arrived five minutes earlier.

150
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:00,955
You can chill now.

151
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,886
Chill, my ass.

152
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,430
Look at me.

153
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:07,927
You rode like Tokyo Drift.

154
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,800
I’m so dizzy I want to throw up.

155
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,120
Oh! You’re dizzy?

156
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:13,652
Hold on.

157
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,215
You got a new one.

158
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,610
What are you doing?

159
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,497
Giving you an inhaler.

160
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:27,923
Do you think it’s a flashlight?

161
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,245
Sticking it in my nose?

162
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,123
Yes.

163
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,797
It’s an inhaler. You’re supposed to sniff it.

164
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,092
Not something you can eat.

165
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,282
Holy shit!

166
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,760
I feel a lot better.

167
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,820
R?

168
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,065
You want me to turn right?

169
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:01,847
But we’ve arrived already.

170
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,545
It’s ‘Really thankful.’

171
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:09,314
Well.

172
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,510
How about this?

173
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,453
L?

174
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:29,007
You ‘Like it?’

175
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:32,338
Just wished you ‘Luck.’

176
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,204
Now go.

177
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:37,707
It’s a long exam day, isn’t it?

178
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:41,960
See you.

179
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,794
Guys, should we go drink tonight?

180
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,800
Celebrating the end of the exam.

181
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,383
You come up with a reason to celebrate every day.

182
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,302
I’m having a bit of a headache.

183
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,600
I want to rest.

184
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:06,484
Tess.

185
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,510
Who’s that guy in red?

186
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,865
He keeps staring at you.

187
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,275
Is he picking a fight? Should we beat his ass?

188
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,010
Relax.

189
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,000
- Relax what?
- Easy, man.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,186
Easy.

191
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,231
That’s Tun.

192
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,928
Tun?

193
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:24,145
Yes.

194
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,437
A friend who’s working with me on the film.

195
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,538
Oh!

196
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,740
You guys go ahead.

197
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,229
I’m going to talk to him.

198
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:36,556
You sure?

199
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,772
Yes.

200
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,240
See you.

201
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:50,577
Why are you still waiting?

202
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:56,264
I was leaving

203
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:59,431
but then I thought of looking for more nice cafés.

204
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:00,585
So I decided to wait for you.

205
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,189
Until now?

206
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,093
Yeah.

207
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:06,662
You could’ve just gone back and worked on the script.

208
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Let the production team do the job.

209
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,200
Not the screenwriter’s job.

210
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:14,942
I can’t.

211
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:20,517
If I’m not into it, I won’t be able to write it.

212
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,673
I want to find it myself.

213
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,750
Can we do it some other day?

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,041
Okay.

215
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,647
And…

216
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,528
How do you get home?

217
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,739
A taxi, I guess.

218
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:43,314
Or are you giving me a ride home?

219
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:51,883
As you wish.

220
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,106
Did you take me here to murder me?

221
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:16,881
It’s desolate.

222
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:19,053
Qooqle Maps told me to take this route.

223
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,737
Stop here.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,299
Stop. Stop.

225
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,061
What?

226
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,936
I think we should go back to the main road.

227
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,986
This alley is frightening.

228
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,626
Damn it.

229
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,280
We almost run out of gas.

230
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:44,520
I don’t think we can even make it to the middle of the alley.

231
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:48,903
Just because it’s fuel-efficient doesn’t mean you don’t need to gas up at all.

232
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,061
That’s true.

233
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:55,960
I’m gonna search for the nearest gas station.

234
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:05,439
Hey.

235
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,789
I’m gonna stop there for a sec.

236
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:07,442
What?

237
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,649
Is this the right time to find the location?

238
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:28,693
Don’t complain just yet.

239
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,000
Let’s get inside first.

240
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:42,000
Shit!

241
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,004
Didn’t know this kind of place existed.

242
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,209
So mysterious.

243
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,270
Let’s check it out.

244
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,883
Holy cow!

245
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,811
It’s gorgeous.

246
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,000
This is what I’ve been looking for.

247
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,423
I designed the ending scene already.

248
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,681
After the lead characters parted, they run into each other here one day.

249
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,158
That’s nice.

250
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,643
It’s their favorite café.

251
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,556
Do you think after they meet again here

252
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:48,000
they will fall back in love with each other?

253
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,805
How would I know that?

254
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:52,709
You’re the one who wrote the script.

255
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,235
I don’t know it either.

256
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,498
Can you walk into the shop again?

257
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,785
I will stand here being the male lead.

258
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,261
No.

259
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:21,736
Come on.

260
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:23,332
Help me.

261
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,395
Please.

262
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:29,356
Come on. Don’t be reluctant.

263
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,149
Go.

264
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,974
What?

265
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,349
Me again?

266
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:31,713
So?

267
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:34,013
Will they fall in love?

268
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,338
I guess they will.

269
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,751
I’m hungry. Let’s eat.

270
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah. Come here asap.

271
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,829
I told Up to bring us some gas.

272
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
He said he was with Aou not so far from here.

273
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,531
Shit!!

274
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,480
The cake is a chef's kiss.

275
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,000
Your eyes go bigger every time you see desserts.

276
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:39,446
Of course.

277
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,000
‘My precious.’

278
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,844
Your lover must be so tired

279
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:51,040
having to take you out for a dessert every day.

280
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,460
I can buy it myself.

281
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,459
I don’t need a lover to take me.

282
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:00,777
Hey! Seriously.

283
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,630
Are you going to work only?

284
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,187
When will you start thinking of dating someone?

285
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,164
Don’t know.

286
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,680
Maybe after I become a colorist for a movie and it is presented at a huge film festival.

287
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:23,083
Haven’t it occurred to you that the key to finding the portkey is love?

288
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,600
Why talking about this all of a sudden?

289
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,001
Because you don’t care about love at all.

290
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:38,703
What if to go back, you must fall in love with someone?

291
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:40,180
What are you gonna do?

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,198
I don’t know.

293
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:47,442
It depends on who that is.

294
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,444
What if it’s me?

295
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,573
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:11,550
I’ve been thinking about lots of things lately.

297
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,940
About going home and about work.

298
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,604
Everything is related to love.

299
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,606
So?

300
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:30,192
So I want to know a little more about love.

301
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,934
How about we fall in love with each other?

302
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:00,799
Ever since you’re here,

303
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
have you ever been scared of tomorrow?

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,244
You already have me here.

305
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,753
One day, if there’s a problem or fear,

306
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,775
Shit!

307
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:42,161
This place is stunning!

308
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,430
Up, let’s go.

309
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,046
You guys are here.

310
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:48,665
Yes.

311
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,269
It’s gorgeous.

312
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:50,927
Wow!

313
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,139
It’s gorgeous.

314
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,228
Wow!

315
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,541
Guys, I’ve got something to show you.

316
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,260
It’s our group’s folders.

317
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:04,514
Wait a minute.

318
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,645
That’s my drawing.

319
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,068
Where did you get it?

320
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:13,159
It was on the treatment paper that you and Tun drew.

321
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,234
I found it funny so I’m using it as our team’s mascot.

322
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:17,101
Is it cool?

323
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,296
Take one.

324
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,794
I tried to stop him but he didn’t listen.

325
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,412
So I brought him here.

326
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,700
But it’s nice, isn't it?

327
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:26,149
Yes, it is.

328
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:29,048
Let’s join forces.

329
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:37,345
To the team folders that I just spent the team budget on.

330
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:40,729
Yeah!

331
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:41,703
What?

332
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,116
The team budget?

333
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,847
Up!

334
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,256
You, bastard!

335
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:48,617
Cheers!

336
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:49,226
Cheers.

337
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:58,743
I’m glad you asked us out to drink once in a while.

338
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:03,271
But I didn’t think you’d bring your secret lover here too, zebra.

339
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,096
What secret lover?

340
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,919
Why are you here?

341
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:28,756
I’m hitting on you, aren’t I?

342
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,673
Hi. I’m Tun.

343
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,207
Hi.

344
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:41,087
You’re the screenwriter, aren’t you?

345
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:46,458
If you need an actor to play a charismatic and handsome guy, reach out to me.

346
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:48,732
My name is Fuse.

347
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:50,416
Fuse.

348
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,527
And this dude is Kita.

349
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:54,605
You don’t need to remember him.

350
00:24:54,848 --> 00:24:57,552
And why are you bribing him?

351
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,091
Stop it, you two.

352
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,600
We're here to drink.

353
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:02,220
Fine.

354
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:03,955
He’s here after all.

355
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,965
We need a welcoming activity.

356
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,944
Take my glass and drink it all.

357
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,193
That’s it?

358
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:12,701
First glass first.

359
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:13,326
Sure.

360
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:15,259
Wait.

361
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,527
Pakorn is a lightweight.

362
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,289
Don’t you remember?

363
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,466
The last time you drank, you woke up in a police station.

364
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:26,686
I do.

365
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,120
Darling.

366
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:30,631
Stop that.

367
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:34,905
Here, Tun.

368
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,207
Come on.

369
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:50,837
Here, buddy.

370
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:00,411
Let go.

371
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,555
Wow!

372
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:27,730
What are you doing?

373
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,902
Why am I topless?

374
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,702
You were drunk and threw up on your shirt.

375
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,804
Kita was going to take you home.

376
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,353
But I offered to take you here instead.

377
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:47,855
Why?

378
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:50,639
Because I’m hitting on you.

379
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,308
Hit on me, my ass!

380
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,352
Give me my shirt.

381
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:02,682
It’s a little wet.

382
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:04,768
I washed it for you.

383
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:19,097
Wow!

384
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,121
You’re reading Shoujo?

385
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:40,922
This is what you like?

386
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:43,372
Hands off it.

387
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,073
It’s Pakorn’s.

388
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,830
I just read it for fun.

389
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:01,817
It’s Pakorn’s too.

390
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:03,373
I’m just wearing his.

391
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,479
I haven’t asked yet.

392
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,070
Don’t be alarmed.

393
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,643
Go away.

394
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:15,777
Those are mine.

395
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,712
They’re Pakorn’s favorite.

396
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:21,518
And my favorite too now.

397
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:23,092
They are so soft.

398
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:24,553
Can I steal some?

399
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:26,288
Sure.

400
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,236
They’re right there.

401
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:30,934
Whoa!

402
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:49,232
So?

403
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,074
Is it soft like my cheek?

404
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:54,961
How would I know that?

405
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,179
Wanna touch it?

406
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,556
No.

407
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:14,681
Maybe it’s soft like your cheek.

408
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,002
Probably.

409
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:24,418
It’s pretty soft.

410
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,468
Let’s see.

411
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,389
Tun!

412
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,758
Soft, indeed.

413
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:36,934
Let go.

414
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:38,344
No.

415
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,304
Fine!

416
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:46,712
You’re not letting go, are you?

417
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:48,602
I’ll pinch your cheek too.

418
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:52,919
Talay.

419
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,002
You wanna fight?

420
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:08,736
Eat that.

421
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:19,653
Get some sleep.

422
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:21,848
All right then.

423
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,814
Tun.

424
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,226
Are you asleep?

425
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:40,891
I have a question.

426
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:42,919
Um.

427
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,085
Ever since you’re here,

428
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:50,919
have you ever been scared of tomorrow?

429
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:57,157
Scared of anything that hasn’t come.

430
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:01,885
I have.

431
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,273
How do you deal with it?

432
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:15,623
I do nothing.

433
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,361
Thanks.

434
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,881
You’re such a big help.

435
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,165
You already have me here.

436
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,215
One day, if there’s a problem

437
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,113
or fear,

438
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:05,589
you can tell me.

439
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,562
I might not be able to fix everything for you.

440
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:17,609
But I’m right here,

441
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:20,913
willing to hear anything you vent.

442
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,003
Thank you.

443
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:36,148
That sounds a lot better.

444
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:49,064
Get some sleep.

445
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,254
Good night.

446
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,176
Good night.

447
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,165
Tun, you’ve got work this Saturday, right?

448
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:12,646
What work?

449
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,444
What? Did you forget?

450
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,361
It’s your high school friend’s wedding.

451
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:18,902
You agreed to be the photographer.

452
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:23,190
Are you going with Tess?

453
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:29,726
Please welcome the groom and the bride on stage.

454
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:32,553
Let’s give it up to them.

455
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:37,231
They look perfect together.

456
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,044
You two have gone through so much.

457
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:45,333
(Hello.)

458
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:47,178
Hey. Where are you?

459
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,248
I’m inside. Just walk in.

460
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:50,866
Now that we’re all ready.

461
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:54,190
Let’s witness their love together in this video.

462
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,472
There.

463
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,414
You’re so into it.

464
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,273
Want to get married too, don’t you?

465
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,113
That’s normal, isn’t it?

466
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:23,876
Of course, I think about it sometimes.

467
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:27,919
When you get married and have a video presentation like that,

468
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:29,659
you can hire me.

469
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,152
Before I go to that,

470
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,085
I should get myself a lover first.

471
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,326
Yeah, I know.

472
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:40,004
But when you get married, hire me.

473
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,280
I’m telling you,

474
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:43,849
my wage is high.

475
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,104
If I need to pay that much,

476
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:49,329
I should just marry a colorist.

477
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,933
Problem solved.

478
00:34:58,492 --> 00:34:59,762
All right, guys.

479
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,838
The bride is about to throw a bouquet of lotuses.

480
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:07,007
Those who are still single, please step up front.

481
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,786
Please.

482
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:10,848
Don’t you want to join them?

483
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,193
All right.

484
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:16,723
3, 2, 1.

485
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:17,919
Go!

486
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,754
Shit!

487
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:33,800
Are you already taken?

488
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,895
Actually, I’m hitting on someone.

489
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,410
But he’s playing hard to get.

490
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,182
Why is he so mean to someone so handsome?

491
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:41,105
Yeah.

492
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,377
So mean.

493
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:15,675
3, 2, 1.

494
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,794
Go!

495
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:20,496
Shit!

496
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:35,186
And the one who got the bouquet is Tun, the photographer of this wedding.

497
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,110
Mr. Tun, please step up on stage.

498
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,015
Please.

499
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,459
Congratulations on the flowers.

500
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:50,721
As someone who got the wedding bouquet, please answer this classic question

501
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,373
Are you already taken?

502
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,280
I’m not.

503
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,422
He’s available.

504
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:06,290
Are you hitting on anyone right at the moment?

505
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,048
Actually,

506
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:19,937
I’m hitting on someone.

507
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:29,156
But he’s playing hard to get.

508
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:31,212
Wondering who that is.

509
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,221
Why is he so mean to someone so handsome?

510
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:35,863
Yeah.

511
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,037
So mean.

512
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:42,951
That’s alright.

513
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:45,647
We all wish you the best of luck.

514
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:48,455
You got the wedding bouquet. You should be lucky soon.

515
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,250
Who was that mean person you talked about?

516
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,626
For what?

517
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,428
I talked about the one I’m hitting on.

518
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:55,622
More!

519
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,730
How about we fall in love with each other?

520
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:05,351
No!

521
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,210
Why not?

522
00:39:07,618 --> 00:39:08,998
We can just fake it.

523
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,997
Love isn’t something you can fake.

524
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:17,468
Of course, we can.

525
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,587
I faked it all the time when I was an actor.

526
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,329
Then you fake it with someone else.

527
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,605
Leave me out of it.

528
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,135
Do you want to try?

529
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:34,098
Try to get to know each other.

530
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,650
You don’t have to like me very much.

531
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,730
Just keep your heart open for me.

532
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:42,107
Add more feelings into it.

533
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,050
If I do, will I get to be the protagonist?

534
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,645
Look! What’s that?

535
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,039
Tun.

536
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:20,142
Tun.

537
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,402
[Talay]

538
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:24,750
Who’s he confessing to?

539
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:26,097
Who is Talay?

540
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,364
Right.

541
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,724
Who is Talay?

542
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,472
Why is Tun doing this?

543
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,522
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

544
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,725
Hitting on you.

545
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:46,479
Hitting, my ass.

546
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:48,794
You’re embarrassing me.

547
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:50,730
I’m not.

548
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:55,676
I’m just making a scene so that I can write romantic scenes better.

549
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:05,074
So all you’ve done is for your screenwriting?

550
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:14,292
Of course.

551
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,498
Are you actually feeling it?

552
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,015
But that might be good.

553
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,060
It might unlock us and get us back to our universe together.

554
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:37,876
Tun.

555
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:40,750
Stop doing this.

556
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:47,637
If we’re the right ones for each other, we’d be back by now.

557
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:51,456
You’re just having fun messing with me.

558
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:54,854
I’m not messing with you.

559
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,872
- I…
- Please.

560
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:00,513
Stop doing this to me.

561
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:08,060
Feelings aren’t something you can toy with.

562
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:11,417
It’s not funny.

563
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:15,728
Fine.

564
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:19,808
I won’t do this to you again.

565
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:23,730
I’m sorry.

566
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:50,606
I am sorry

567
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,231
for making you feel bad.

568
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,722
I didn’t mean to play you.

569
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:55,982
If it’s not you,

570
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,717
I wouldn’t be able to work this well.

571
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:44,466
Fine.

572
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,546
I won’t do this to you again.

573
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:52,553
I’m sorry.

574
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:50,559
Just throw up already.

575
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:53,053
I was right to rent this studio.

576
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,004
When you’re hungry, just order food from downstairs.

577
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:02,734
What’s up?

578
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:06,009
Nothing.

579
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,351
Just came to hang out.

580
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:13,216
Where is Tun?

581
00:45:14,568 --> 00:45:15,497
Tun?

582
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:18,609
He hasn’t been here for a while.

583
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:21,313
He said he’d isolate himself and write the script.

584
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:24,174
You can leave any messages for him with us.

585
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:32,768
I’m done here.

586
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:34,598
Will you excuse me?

587
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,983
I’ve got something to do.

588
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:38,009
See you.

589
00:45:41,703 --> 00:45:43,703
What kind of hangout lasts 3 seconds?

590
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:51,556
(You’re not a movie.)

591
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:54,051
You are real.

592
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:22,002
- Hey.
- Hi.

593
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:23,006
Talay.

594
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,334
It’s late.

595
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:25,998
And you’ve come alone.

596
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:31,932
Has Tun been here at all?

597
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:34,102
He hasn’t.

598
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:34,944
What is it?

599
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,205
Nothing.

600
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,852
Everybody is gone?

601
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,189
Of course.

602
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:46,410
Why?

603
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:50,129
Do you want to vent to the support group?

604
00:46:52,962 --> 00:46:53,712
No.

605
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:55,472
Liar.

606
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:58,686
You can tell?

607
00:46:58,686 --> 00:46:59,827
Come on.

608
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:02,136
You can’t be more obvious.

609
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:04,343
It’s just me here.

610
00:47:04,439 --> 00:47:06,151
You can talk to me.

611
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:11,609
How do I start?

612
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,346
Lately,

613
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:18,170
someone has done something nice to me.

614
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:22,728
So nice that I thought he was serious.

615
00:47:23,905 --> 00:47:25,168
But in the end,

616
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:28,346
it turned out he did it just for fun.

617
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:32,175
Did he tell you he did it just for fun?

618
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:34,300
He didn’t.

619
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:37,207
I could tell from his actions.

620
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,168
I think you judged him too quickly.

621
00:47:41,314 --> 00:47:43,314
I get it that you’re mad.

622
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:46,021
But isn’t it a little too harsh on the other person?

623
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,238
You haven’t heard what he has to say yet.

624
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,681
I tried to look for him.

625
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,575
But I don’t even know where he is.

626
00:47:56,638 --> 00:47:58,261
Think carefully.

627
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:02,922
If you guys are close enough, you know where he is.

628
00:48:07,279 --> 00:48:08,702
Holy cow!

629
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:10,440
It’s gorgeous.

630
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:15,830
This is what I’ve been looking for.

631
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:19,987
Oh!

632
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:22,573
I know it.

633
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:24,390
Thank you so much.

634
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,434
Bye now.

635
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:26,604
It’s raining outside.

636
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,258
Been waiting for you.

637
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:31,892
How did you know I’m here?

638
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:42,496
The script says both lead characters part

639
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:46,977
and meet again here in the end.

640
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:51,446
I come just like what your characters do.

641
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:55,284
Have you got the inner feeling you want?

642
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,032
I am sorry

643
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:14,793
for making you feel bad.

644
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:19,062
I didn’t mean to play you.

645
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:20,439
I just

646
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:27,542
wanted to know the feeling when I really love someone.

647
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,227
Anything I say now sounds bullshit.

648
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:39,582
Since it looks like I already played with your feelings.

649
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:45,984
But I want you to know

650
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:49,281
that if it’s not you,

651
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,172
I wouldn’t be able to work this well.

652
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:05,379
Will you forgive me?

653
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:08,859
Yes,

654
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:11,054
you’re forgiven.

655
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,004
But if your script turns out bad,

656
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:16,965
I’ll kick your ass.

657
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,772
Thank you for understanding.

658
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:31,313
Come on.

659
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,492
We should go.

660
00:51:40,446 --> 00:51:41,445
We can’t go yet.

661
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:46,305
There’s one more thing about the characters that I still don’t understand.

662
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,277
Are you messing with me again?

663
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:53,993
No.

664
00:51:57,668 --> 00:51:59,172
Not messing with you this time.

665
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,088
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

666
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:54,939
Kissing you helped me improve so much on my scriptwriting.

667
00:52:56,566 --> 00:52:57,989
What the heck are you doing, Tun?

668
00:52:59,173 --> 00:53:03,102
You two go stand where marked as lead characters for me.

669
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:09,754
If you found your portkey one day, will you go back immediately?

670
00:53:11,538 --> 00:53:13,006
That’s totally your call.
