00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,940
[reporter] (on television)
<i>Savannah Dillon disappeared</i>
<i>30 years ago tonight,</i>

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,777
<i>following a camp dance</i>
<i>at the historic Tremont Hotel.</i>

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,046
[Harper]
<i>So all we have to do</i>
<i>is stay with her</i>

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,947
until we're positive
she's safe in her bunk,

6
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,383
while keeping an eye on Jess.


7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,251
Tonight's the anniversary
of Savannah's disappearance,

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,989
which means she'll probably
be haunting this place extra hard.


9
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,991
[Wyatt]
<i>We can always</i>
<i>give her something.</i>

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:24,925
So what do we do now?

11
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,559
We wait.

12
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,230
Your sister is going through
a challenging time right now.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,231
Keep an eye on her, okay?

14
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,900
Do you want to come
to the dance with me tonight?

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,836
I can always use
a partner in crime.

16
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,440
[Harper]
<i>Listen, Jess...</i>

17
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,476
You're not planning
on doing anything tonight,
are you?

18
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,646
It's time.
Side A, please.

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,350
[Savannah]
I love this song.
Do you want to dance?

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,784
Jess, everything okay?

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,654
You knew I was going
to ask Ben to dance,

22
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,157
and you had Savannah ask him first
to humiliate me.

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,558
This isn't over, Hermione.

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,194
(intense music playing)

25
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,505
(indistinct chatter)

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,576
[camp counselor]
Did anyone hear that?

27
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,711
Hey, is somebody out there?

28
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,348
Who do you think
it is?

29
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,582
Moss man?

30
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,683
(Ben chuckles)

31
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,884
Could be.

32
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,086
He still haunts these woods.


33
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,590
That's just a silly legend.


34
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,091
Not what I heard.

35
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,862
Amanda saw his muddy prints
near the springs last week.

36
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,830
Here's what you guys should know.


37
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,167
About a hundred years ago,

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,268
a mutant creature lived...

39
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,335
Campfire is almost over.

40
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,772
Whatever's gonna happen,
it's gonna be soon.

41
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,874
Yeah, we cannot let Savannah
out of our sight.

42
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:47,575
[Harper]
Or my mom.

43
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,145
I still can't believe how mad she got
at the dance tonight.

44
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,913
When he spotted his next victim...


45
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,249
he'd slowly...

46
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,385
creep closer...

47
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:04,525
and closer...

48
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,096
And then--
(screams)

49
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,731
(all screaming)

50
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,400
(laughing)

51
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:20,073
Now, that's what you get
for putting itching powder in my bed.


52
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,377
Okay, people, finish up.
It's getting late.

53
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,983
[girl 1] Good night.
[girl 2] Good night, Sarah.

54
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,187
Didn't anyone ever tell you
ghosts aren't real?

55
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,856
Oh, poor baby.

56
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,858
I hope you don't have scary dreams.


57
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,797
You had chocolate.

58
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,769
(chuckles)
Thanks.

59
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,177
(tense music playing)

60
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,412
Oh, no.

61
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,113
And they're gone.

62
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,318
(theme music playing)

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,109
(tense music playing)

64
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,814
We only looked away for a second.


65
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,015
They couldn't have gotten far.


66
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,592
Hey, do you mind?

67
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,727
No dudes. Camp rules.

68
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,829
Did Savannah or Jess come back here?


69
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,498
No.
You sure?

70
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,400
You didn't see them
walking back from the bonfire?


71
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,066
Maybe in the restroom?

72
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,837
How many times can a hummingbird flap
its wings in a second?

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,972
This is a little more important
than "Trivia Quizzle."

74
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,308
[Griffin]
Don't bother.

75
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,542
They don't know.

76
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,280
We're running out of time.


77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,049
Alright, um, stay calm and think.


78
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,285
If you were Savannah,
what would you be doing right now?


79
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,152
I don't know.

80
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,087
I guess, um...

81
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,556
pulling a prank with your dad.


82
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,558
All right, uh...

83
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,859
So let's check the hotel.

84
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,127
There's plenty
of targets there.

85
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,106
Sweet dreams, little ones.

86
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,582
Okay, she's gone.

87
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,455
Can't we have
a séance tomorrow?

88
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,024
Today is the anniversary
of Savannah's death.

89
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,926
Tomorrow is just tomorrow.

90
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,597
This is our best chance
to get proof she's real.

91
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,898
Ready?

92
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,302
What?

93
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,037
It's gonna be cold in the basement.


94
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,648
This is definitely the right night
to summon a spirit.

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:42,676
(wind whooshing)

96
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,690
(gasps)

97
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,825
(exhales)

98
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,232
(yelps)

99
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,003
Sorry.

100
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,472
Didn't mean to scare you.

101
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,043
What were you doing outside?

102
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,411
Oh. I...

103
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:18,979
heard a noise.

104
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,749
Thought a tree
might have fallen or something.

105
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,719
Was everything okay?
Yeah.

106
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:27,755
Yeah.

107
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:30,924
Here, I got this.

108
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,106
I never did anything to Jess.


109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,008
What's her beef with me?


110
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,012
Last year, everyone
was really into her.

111
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,647
And now you're here...

112
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,916
and you're--you're different.


113
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,084
And fun.

114
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,019
(door opens)

115
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,754
No, she's a total phony.

116
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,990
You followed us?

117
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,926
Because I knew she'd bad mouth me.


118
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,295
(scoffs)
I'm just sitting here,
minding my own business.

119
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,997
(scoffs)
Give me a break.

120
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,732
Everything you do
is to get attention.

121
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,502
"Look how many pranks
I can pull.

122
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,903
"Watch me sing and dance.

123
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,639
I'm so brave,
I'm not afraid of anything."

124
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,341
I'm not,
including you.

125
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,844
Yeah?

126
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,680
Then I dare you.

127
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,684
Spend the rest of the night
in the basement...

128
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:31,752
with the ghost.

129
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,088
And whatever else
is lurking around the hotel.

130
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,692
(chuckles)
Knew it! Coward.

131
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,561
Jess, come on.

132
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,030
Can't you see?
She's playing you.

133
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,499
You don't know anything about me.


134
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,070
I know this.

135
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,406
Everything would be better
if you were gone.

136
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,122
Any luck?
Not a trace.

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,725
This is bad, really bad.

138
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,260
Where else could she be?
I don't know.

139
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,095
(indistinct chatter)

140
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,698
I can't believe
I didn't think of this sooner.

141
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,000
What?
There's a treehouse in the woods.


142
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,602
It's like a hangout spot.

143
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:22,970
I saw Savannah go there earlier.


144
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:23,971
Let's go then.

145
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,676
Jess!

146
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:29,877
Don't even talk to me.

147
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,011
No, please.

148
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,246
If this is about
what happened at the dance,

149
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,048
you have to know,
I would never--

150
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,250
Humiliate me
in front of Ben? Hmm?

151
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,419
In front
of the entire camp?

152
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,555
Uh, could we, uh...Could we talk
about this later?

153
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,290
Look, you have it
all wrong.

154
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,792
I just want you to be happy.


155
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,861
Yeah? And why
would you want that?

156
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,031
Uh, because you're...

157
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,233
Because you, uh...

158
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,902
You remind her of someone.


159
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,804
Yes.
Someone she likes.

160
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,273
What is with you two?

161
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,210
Is there a problem?

162
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:04,912
Nope. All good.

163
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,513
Yeah,
just hanging out.

164
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,082
Um, actually, Becky,
there is.

165
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,784
Lots of problems.

166
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,720
Starting with these two.

167
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,588
They're always around,
asking questions.

168
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,889
They say they're guests,

169
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,658
but I don't think they are.

170
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,859
Of course we are.
Yeah, I mean--

171
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,794
My dad stays
at The Tremont all the time.

172
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,195
I mean, he'd move in if he could.


173
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,031
I've never even
seen their parents.

174
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,233
Hmm.

175
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,869
Let's go talk
to the manager.

176
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,471
You know what?
Not necessary.

177
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,341
Yeah, I think we'll just
get out of your way.

178
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,710
Manger's office
is this way.

179
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,180
Guess what?

180
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,050
I feel much happier now.

181
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,028
Names?

182
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,396
Oh, um...

183
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,465
James and, uh...

184
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
Lily Potter.

185
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,970
Yours?
Uh, Granger.

186
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,339
Just...
Mr. and Mrs. Granger.

187
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,441
They're weird that way.

188
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,646
No Grangers. No Potters.

189
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,383
Okay, no more games.

190
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,818
You're not leaving this office

191
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,887
until you tell us
how to contact your parents.

192
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,799
I thought
you went to bed.

193
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,300
Still have homework
to finish.

194
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,168
It's taking forever.

195
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,770
Well, you need
some help?

196
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,306
How are you
at tracking

197
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,108
"the migratory pattern
of geese"?

198
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,544
(chuckles)
 Baby, I'm lucky if I can keep track
of my car keys.

199
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,780
Better get comfy.

200
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,448
We could be here
all night.

201
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,117
(snoring)

202
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,619
What is that?

203
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,554
Um... Nothing.

204
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,023
It's just, uh...

205
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,658
Is that snoring?
(switches off)

206
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,494
Little-known fact,
geese snore.

207
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,963
Topher...

208
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:03,964
talk.

209
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,134
(sighs)

210
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,601
Well, um...

211
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,537
you told me
to watch Harper, so...

212
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,507
I put a mic in her room
to make sure
she stays out of trouble.

213
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,776
You know, I told you
to make sure

214
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,845
that your sister
didn't leave the house.

215
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,747
I didn't ask you
to spy on her.

216
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,681
Not in so many words.

217
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:24,918
I'll go unplug the mic.

218
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,419
Don't wake her.

219
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,457
Oh, not a chance.

220
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,829
(sighing)
(door closes)

221
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,543
(banging on door)
Come on!

222
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,478
(doorknob rattling)

223
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,681
(sighs)
What are we gonna do?

224
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,516
(banging on metal)
It's okay. I have an idea.

225
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,819
Really? What happens
when they can't find
our parents?

226
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,588
Won't matter.
We won't be here.

227
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,624
Help me move this.
There's a door behind it.

228
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,559
There is?
I think I know my own hotel.

229
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,195
This is our laundry room now.

230
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,104
Told ya.

231
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,812
All right, coast is clear.

232
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,016
Locker ninjas before
brilliant masterminds.

233
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,052
We need to go
to the treehouse.
Yeah.

234
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,987
camp counselor:
Hey! How did you get out?

235
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,488
Uh... This way.
Yep.

236
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,026
Hey! Stop! Hey!

237
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,527
Wait. Get back here!

238
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,132
You know,
in my third foster home,

239
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,635
I actually did
sleep in a bedroom
in the basement.

240
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,903
I was not scared at all.

241
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,705
I could do that dare.
No sweat.

242
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,509
You don't have to prove anything
to Jess.

243
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,013
I just hate when people say
I can't do something.

244
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,715
And they say it a lot.

245
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,887
You know what?

246
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,588
I've got an idea.

247
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,024
Let's camp out here tonight.

248
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:14,027
Then I don't have to deal
with that Jess drama
until tomorrow.

249
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,496
That would totally freak out
Becky and Keith.

250
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,465
Only makes it more fun,
right?

251
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,534
We got water, and look,

252
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,904
half a box of vanilla wafers.

253
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,738
Breakfast of champions.

254
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,254
Well,
one thing's for sure,

255
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,857
we found the coldest ghost spot
in the house.

256
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,894
Not looking so silly now, huh?


257
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,130
Let's just get this séance going.


258
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,604
Oh, ghost of The Tremont,
hear our--

259
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:58,805
Stop!

260
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,540
What?

261
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,475
I think you should
ask for Savannah,

262
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,078
or else a bunch of other ghosts
might crash our séance.

263
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,386
Savannah,
we summon you.

264
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,155
We come in peace.

265
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,325
Please show yourself.

266
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,333
Maybe she's busy?

267
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,269
Your light!

268
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,972
She's listening.

269
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,915
We shouldn't have left.

270
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,917
We didn't have a choice.
They were about to catch us.

271
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,785
Yeah, but Savannah's
still back there.

272
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,087
She could
still go missing.

273
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,189
Yeah, or...

274
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,592
she could be okay.

275
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
How do you figure?

276
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,694
Well...

277
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,596
We shook things up tonight.

278
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,598
Like...

279
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,233
your mom lost it on us.

280
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,768
Maybe that created a ripple.


281
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,339
Yeah, okay, and when you talked Savannah
into going to the dance,

282
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,874
maybe that changed things too.


283
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,209
Exactly!

284
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,244
We could have altered things
just by being back there.

285
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,412
Only one way to find out.


286
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,515
[Zoey]
Savannah, if you can hear me,

287
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,918
please, we ask you to honor us
with your presence.

288
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,921
Speak to us.
Walk among us.

289
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,823
Show us a sign.

290
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,558
[Wyatt]
As long as it's not too scary.


291
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,128
We're both really nice people


292
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,230
and we just wanna be your friends.


293
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,100
[Zoey]
Beloved Savannah,
we beseech you.

294
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,934
We know you're here.

295
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,903
We know you can hear us.

296
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,371
[Wyatt]
Show yourself.

297
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,639
(can thuds, rattles)

298
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,008
(both scream)

299
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,411
She's mad at us!
Run!

300
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,114
Dad! Help!
There's a ghost!

301
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,615
Savannah's ghost!

302
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,984
(door closes)

303
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,654
They were still hunting
for Savannah's ghost.

304
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,491
Which means she's still dead.


305
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,260
We didn't change the past.


306
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,963
Wait, there's hope.

307
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,598
She wasn't found missing
until the morning.

308
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,100
It's still night.

309
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,203
We have to go back.
We can still save her.

310
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:11,971
Yeah.

311
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,673
(electricity buzzes)

312
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,018
We should start
at the bunkhouse,
see if she got back.

313
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:25,785
Okay.

314
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,821
And if she's not there,
treehouse.

315
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,198
Hey, watch it!
Sorry.

316
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
It felt like something pushed me.


317
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,669
Pushed you?

318
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,404
You don't think it was...

319
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,472
Savannah?

320
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,041
(whispering)
She's following us.

321
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,379
(both scream)

322
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,980
It's just me.

323
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,783
Why aren't you in bed?

324
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,285
Dad, we saw Savannah.

325
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,586
She threw a can of soup at us.


326
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,653
And then the lights went out.


327
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:01,721
We know you don't believe us, but--


328
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,889
Where did you see her?

329
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,125
The basement.

330
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,260
So you do believe us.

331
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,097
[Sarah]
Kids? Ben? Here you are!

332
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,465
What do you say we brighten
this place up?

333
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,377
[Jess]
Everyone okay up here?

334
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,213
(footsteps approaching)

335
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,151
What happened to the lights?

336
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,619
There's a power outage all over town.


337
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,721
Ah, this wind is crazy.

338
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:35,855
I wouldn't go in there.

339
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,490
She's sleeping.

340
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,426
You know how she is
if you wake her up.

341
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,830
(chuckles)
Well, I will be very quiet.

342
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,568
Move.

343
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,776
(tense music playing)

344
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,482
(snoring sounds)

345
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,784
Is she at The Tremont?

346
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,327
(taps on camcorder)

347
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,129
Why won't this dumb thing play?


348
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,199
Maybe Savannah's ghost
broke it so we can't prove she exists.


349
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,733
(continues tapping)

350
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,570
(guitar music)

351
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,572
No way Griffin's still practicing.


352
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,114
Savannah's ghost!

353
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,217
She's in the computer!

354
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,218
It's not a ghost.

355
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,420
It's Griffin faking out Mom and Dad.


356
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,889
And now we know his secret.


357
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,691
(music continues)

358
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,127
(switches off)

359
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,730
[Zoey] (over camcorder)
<i>We come in peace.</i>

360
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,631
Hey, it's working!

361
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,633
[Zoey]
<i>Please show yourself.</i>

362
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,569
(can thuds, rattles)
(both scream)

363
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,707
[Zoey]
<i>She's mad at us! Run!</i>

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,175
You can't see the soup.

365
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

366
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,845
(tape rewinding)

367
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,582
See that?

368
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,818
[Wyatt]
What is it?

369
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,554
Maybe... a head?

370
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,357
I don't see eyes or a nose.


371
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,259
Ghosts don't all have faces.


372
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,027
And look where the head thing is.


373
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,197
Over the table?
Uh-huh.

374
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,932
Right where we summoned her,


375
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,267
by name.

376
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,303
It worked!

377
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,872
We did it.
We made contact.

378
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,248
Wait.

379
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,883
The portal didn't work.


380
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,719
When I went through,
I didn't feel a jolt.

381
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,290
We failed.
Savannah's gone forever.

382
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,726
What are you two
doing out here?

383
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,061
The power's out all over town.


384
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,129
And don't even think about lying.


385
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,468
(ominous music playing)

386
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,042
(door creaking)

387
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,363
Hello?

388
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,732
(tense music playing)

389
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,440
[Wyatt]
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

390
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,708
We'll start with grounded.
Same for you, Harper.

391
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:16,709
I need your help.

392
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,711
No way.
Please!

393
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,279
[Harper]
<i>All I bought us</i>
<i>was 10 minutes.</i>

394
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,514
You ready?

395
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,515
Let's do this.

396
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,486
We need to find out
what happened to Savannah
after the campfire.

397
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,020
[Griffin]
You were with her last night, right?


398
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,188
We-- We all were.

399
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,257
Is Harper here?
Of course not.

400
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,959
[Jess]
Listen, I think that
they've run off together.

401
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,727
I think we need to call the police.
