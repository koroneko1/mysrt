1
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,552
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,513
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,182
6 MONTHS AGO

4
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,184
…kids' products were 50% off.

5
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,644
I bought one because it would look
great on our baby.

6
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,813
But we don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

7
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,357
She's a girl who looks just like you.

8
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,401
I say that every day, tapping on my belly.

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,030
But if she's a girl,
she shouldn't look like me.

10
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,866
Oh, the CEO must be here.

11
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,659
All right, I'm nearby too.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,745
-Okay, see you soon.
-Okay.

13
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,704
Yes.

14
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,334
-Hi.
-Yes, hi.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,546
Here.

16
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,774
So, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
gave the final authorization?

17
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,651
Yes, they'll announce it tomorrow.

18
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,237
The condition is to use it
only for adult ADHD patients,

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,864
and if it's proven effective,
they'll add more patients.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,241
Well done.

21
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,576
I was wondering
if I had to take all of the Next

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,620
piled up in the storage.

23
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,165
I can make more money
thanks to you, Mr. Han.

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,669
It failed as a cure for pneumonia,

25
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,213
but we think it's possible
to use it to treat adult ADHD.

26
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:15,051
Yes, it's already known
for enhancing concentration.

27
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,679
Many people around me
are taking it already.

28
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,978
-Is that Next?
-Yes.

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,690
-Haven't you tried it, Mr. Han?
-No.

30
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,525
Take it when you're not doing so well.

31
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,652
It makes me feel truly alive.

32
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,778
It's great.

33
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,873
Hello.

34
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,626
-Hello, I'm Park Young-in.
-I heard a lot about you.

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,336
-Go ahead, have a seat.
-Okay.

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,463
-Is this it?
-Wait until you see it.

37
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:01,055
So, is your baby a boy or a girl?

38
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,682
Our baby?

39
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,808
I think she's a girl.

40
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,894
That's good.

41
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,022
People these days say that one daughter
is better than ten sons.

42
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,065
That's what they tell me.

43
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,901
-Please excuse me for a moment.
-Okay.

44
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,740
So, when will
the little baby princess be born?

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,951
It's been twelve weeks,
so about six months later?

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,621
Did you say, "bite"?

47
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,416
Are you sure he's not taking other drugs?

48
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,670
The final authorization
will be announced tomorrow.

49
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,464
Hospitalize him and silence everyone.

50
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,965
This must never spread.

51
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,638
Who cares? He's not even dead.

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,890
Offer medical fees and compensation, then.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,478
I'll call you again.

54
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,284
Honey.

55
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,356
It's a call from
the Prime Minister's office.

56
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,084
Where are they going?

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
To a landfill.

58
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,173
We're short on facilities
for patients with minor symptoms.

59
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,975
Do you still not understand
why I'm doing this?

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,521
I do understand.

61
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,858
I made a choice

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,736
about how much damage I should prevent.

63
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,780
You will soon have to choose

64
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,283
how much blood to have on your hands.

65
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,119
What about the cure?

66
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,081
We sorted possible candidate materials
and injected them into the infected,

67
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,375
but they all died.

68
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,297
Keep trying until it works.

69
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,550
I will do the enduring.

70
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,865
Then what should we do now?

71
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,241
The infected are everywhere,

72
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,660
and there may be no more aid from outside.

73
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,663
We have to break out!

74
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,583
They even installed screen fences
on the walls.

75
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,418
Even if we do break out,

76
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,087
where do we go next?

77
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,049
We can just break out
and go into the most expensive apartments.

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,885
Then what can they do?
Would they lock that place up too?

79
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,429
Lots of high-class people
must be living there.

80
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,183
We are suffering because
these apartments are cheap.

81
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,395
Are you sure the patients
are really out there?

82
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,150
The building representative
and Mr. Oh are not here.

83
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,528
So only the public rental residents
are here again?

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,492
I'm saying that many of those
who went outside are not here.

85
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,662
If you want to go out,
then go ahead and go out.

86
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,873
Though I can't guarantee
that you can come back.

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,044
Now then, I'll take that as
you all understood.

88
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,048
The items and food we brought
from the supermarket are in Unit 201,

89
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,134
so go there if you need anything.

90
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,470
But they might be short
on some things too,

91
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,306
so the condition
is to exchange items for them.

92
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,188
Hey, but if the infected
become more serious,

93
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,315
won't they smash the doors and break in?

94
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,694
If they ram the glass doors with a car,
they'll break.

95
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,905
They'd find an easier way to get inside.

96
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,366
That's how all crimes start.

97
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,827
They say they got in because
the door was unlocked,

98
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,038
and took the bicycle
because there was no lock on it.

99
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,251
But it's not easy
to decide to break the door

100
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,879
and get inside just
because they want to drink blood.

101
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,673
It just means
we shouldn't give them an excuse.

102
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,302
The doors are all locked…

103
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,478
What?

104
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,147
The rooftop.

105
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,071
I'm the only one here.

106
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,089
It's not too late, is it?

107
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,758
Let's hope it isn't.

108
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,399
Andrew, you really don't
get startled that easily.

109
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,026
When you were outside,
and over here as well.

110
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm just happy
that people don't think I'm weird.

111
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,368
Be careful, both of you.

112
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,994
You too, Andrew.

113
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,129
Let's take a breather and go.

114
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm tired.

115
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,845
Seriously…

116
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,689
This reminds me of the past.

117
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,358
When?

118
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,195
You mean that day?

119
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,822
Hey.

120
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,660
I thought I was actually flying.

121
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,619
You did fly.

122
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,580
I guess I did.

123
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,627
If I could fly,
I'd go to the nursing home to see my mom.

124
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,424
I've been delaying it
because it's uncomfortable to see her,

125
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,967
and things turned out like this.

126
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,889
What do you think happened
to the infected?

127
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,392
Would they be hiding somewhere…

128
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,186
and holding in their thirst?

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm sure they're frightened

130
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,233
that they'd bite someone
who's closest to them.

131
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,235
That they'd turn into monsters completely.

132
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,365
But still, they'll fight
until they surrender to their thirst.

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,910
Would they all be okay?

134
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,579
Sure.

135
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,664
We just don't need to get hurt, okay?

136
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,833
Then we can all meet again later.

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,085
So don't do that again.

138
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,798
How could you put that blood on your hand
without knowing where it came from?

139
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,928
Then was it okay to put it
on Oh Joo-hyung's face, then?

140
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,513
You didn't force him to drink it.

141
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,059
I'm sure he wouldn't have sucked on it.

142
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,393
Of course not.

143
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,481
He seems like
he cares so much about himself.

144
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,858
But seeing
how he didn’t come down earlier,

145
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,485
I think he's a little intimidated.

146
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,572
The building representative
didn't come either, right?

147
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,171
Are you okay?

148
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,133
Of course not.

149
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,558
Look at this.

150
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,436
I must've been so startled.

151
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,984
Why don't we just give up, then?
That would be better.

152
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,404
It seems like you can't make money here

153
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,031
even if you become
the resident representative.

154
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,241
And if we get out?

155
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,035
If we get out of here,
it'll be dirt cheap!

156
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,123
Should we suffer the loss, leave,
and start over at another apartment?

157
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,999
I'm just saying there's no other way.

158
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,420
You said Seung-beom at the gym
might be infected.

159
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,589
You went to the gym every day.
What did you even do there?

160
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,466
You should've watched
for things like that.

161
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,595
I didn't think he'd do that.

162
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:09,061
Once the lockdown is over,
the entire complex should be repaired.

163
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,065
Let's tell them the interior materials
of the elevators should be replaced,

164
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,860
and the outer walls should be removed.

165
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,195
That made the lockdown easier.

166
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,867
And let's tell them to plant
trees on the outskirts too.

167
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,369
Didn't you say you know
a landscaping company?

168
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,413
We should do some serious disinfecting.

169
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,248
Because there were infected people.

170
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,544
Yes, that's it!

171
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,466
If you think outside of the box,
you can get tons of ideas.

172
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,763
But do you think you can become
the resident representative?

173
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,147
I must recruit
some influential people on the inside.

174
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,858
My father had schizophrenia.

175
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,235
He passed away two years ago,

176
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:03,115
so I get shocked easily
when I see illnesses like that.

177
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,700
Sae-bom isn't home now.

178
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,662
Damn it.

179
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,877
I see, you're the little girl
from Unit 502.

180
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,754
Then are you home alone?

181
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
Where are the people from Unit 501?

182
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,427
-Can you open the door?
-The people from Unit 501 are here.

183
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,054
My goodness.

184
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,021
I'm sorry about
what happened earlier today.

185
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:37,983
But…

186
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,530
you should've told me
that you were really okay.

187
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,991
Anyone can misunderstand
when they see blood.

188
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't you think?

189
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,788
It must be hard for you too.

190
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,416
Still, aren't you glad that
you have someone to look after you?

191
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,627
I really am glad.

192
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,630
I'm so glad that we're downstairs.

193
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,348
Aren't you sad
you can't enjoy your newlywed life

194
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,933
because of this incident?

195
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,523
I also started at the first floor
of a small house with my husband,

196
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,776
and all of a sudden there was this flood.

197
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,529
All that trouble we went through…

198
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,407
How did you two meet?

199
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,577
Oh, my.

200
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,797
You must have a deep connection.

201
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,469
Why don't you sit down?

202
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,312
I can't trust her.

203
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,398
-Me neither.
-Then why did you let her in?

204
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,819
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies even closer.

205
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,700
Where's Sae-bom?

206
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,453
She's talking to
the building representative.

207
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,538
She came to apologize or something.

208
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,499
Apologize? Isn't her apology annoying too?

209
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,417
Right.

210
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,461
That's because she's not sorry.

211
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:25,633
But she asked me if I'm trying
to become the resident representative.

212
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,509
She must be trying to become that.

213
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,596
Why would she do that? It sounded
like it'd get her a lot of money.

214
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,391
All contracts regarding the apartment
are signed by the representatives.

215
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,020
Elevators, walls, rooftops, parking lots,
electricity, landscaping, everything.

216
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
-That's all money.
-Everything?

217
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,400
Don't you have more?

218
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,904
I actually exercise, you know.

219
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,198
Give me some more kimbap.

220
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,950
-Kimbap?
-Yes.

221
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,664
Mister.

222
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,248
You won't cuff me tonight, right?

223
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,542
It cuts my blood circulation.

224
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,380
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

225
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,134
All the residents here
are extremely anxious.

226
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,261
Nobody has noticed yet,

227
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,056
but some people
will start suspecting your condition.

228
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
So?

229
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:24,108
I'm telling you to be careful
so people won't get scared.

230
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,237
The handcuffs cannot be helped today,

231
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,197
but if you're okay for the next few days,

232
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,492
we'll let you use this gym
comfortably at least.

233
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,080
You're not threatening me today.

234
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,211
I hope that you're not infected.

235
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,797
Even without you…

236
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,217
this apartment has a lot of problems.

237
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,642
Seriously…

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,769
Damn it.

239
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm going to kill him.

240
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,107
I swear, I will…

241
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,881
Hey, what are you looking at? I'm fine.

242
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,592
Look. I'm clean, aren't I?

243
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,802
Aren't you the one who's scared?

244
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,429
You were nearly peeling your skin off.

245
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,225
Hey!

246
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,019
What are you taking?

247
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,273
HANGOVER RELIEF MEDICINE

248
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,151
I thought you were taking something bad.

249
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,736
Pour me a glass.

250
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,956
Did you see Min-ji…

251
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,460
taking drugs at the clinic?

252
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,631
You know,
like health supplements or tonics.

253
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,674
She did take some when she was tired.

254
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,093
What drugs were they?

255
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,262
I don't know.
They were just some kind of pills.

256
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,642
She said they were health supplements
she got from the gym.

257
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,811
The gym?

258
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,231
Your name wasn't on the gym register.

259
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,150
My wife went to the gym.

260
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,445
Did Mad Human Disease spread from the gym?

261
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,950
Why? Is it something important?

262
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,996
Don't drink too much.
Alcohol damages everyone.

263
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,332
Where are you going?

264
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,168
Somewhere. It's none of your business.

265
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,270
-You go in first.
-Why?

266
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,272
I left my wallet.

267
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,357
Why are you carrying your wallet?

268
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,235
I'll be back soon. You go inside first.

269
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,787
COMMUNITY CENTER
GYM, INDOOR GOLF, READING ROOM

270
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,130
Who is it?

271
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,385
You really are here.

272
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,472
Mister.

273
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,141
Are you locked up here?

274
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,187
Yes, I got locked up here.

275
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,315
The cop who lives
on the fifth floor locked me up.

276
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,025
Mister.

277
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,653
Please help me.

278
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,822
There's nothing wrong with me.

279
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,367
I'm totally clean,

280
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,662
but that cop who lives up there,
he did this…

281
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,666
You sold the drugs to my wife, didn't you?

282
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,921
The female doctor on the sixth floor,
who died of Mad Human Disease.

283
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm not trying to threaten you,
or take revenge.

284
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,606
I'm actually grateful.

285
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,525
Mister.

286
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,821
I want to buy that drug.

287
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,992
I really don't know anything about it.

288
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,368
You don't?

289
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,578
I really don't know about it.

290
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,125
-You really don't know?
-I don’t.

291
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,376
-You don't?
-No.

292
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,752
Seriously…

293
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,463
This is pissing me off.

294
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm going to kick you out
for being infected,

295
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,802
you crazy bastard!

296
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,721
Damn it.

297
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,931
Wait.

298
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,272
You don't know?

299
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,151
-Why are you doing this to me?
-You don't know?

300
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,902
I really don't know, Mister!

301
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,196
-Wait!
-I really don't know!

302
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,781
What?

303
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,242
-Mister!
-You don't know?

304
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,544
Are you Lawyer Kook Hae-seong?

305
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,004
Yes, I am.

306
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,508
I live in Building 102.
I called after seeing the elevator ad.

307
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,765
But I heard that the other buildings
are full of patients.

308
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,267
No, there are a few,

309
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,103
but they're all in quarantine
at the children's library.

310
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,273
Building 101 is being sensitive
and restricting entrance.

311
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,817
So it's not that serious right now?

312
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:46,406
Yes, can I talk to you in person?

313
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,200
It's about my grandfather's mountain.

314
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,534
Where are you right now?

315
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,620
The first basement floor.

316
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:56,750
Can we meet here and talk in person?

317
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,462
The Internet works here.

318
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,507
And it's easier to show you the map here.

319
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,344
Stay there. I'll be there soon.

320
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,559
Didn't you just talk to someone?

321
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,895
No, it must've been from outside.

322
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,105
I'm going out.

323
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,106
Where are you going?

324
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,316
It feels stuffy here.

325
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,902
Let me go for a walk and get some air.

326
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,958
VIEW VISITORS

327
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,584
NOW VIEWING. PLEASE WAIT.

328
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,215
Are you Lawyer Kook Hae-seong?

329
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,513
What is it?

330
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,890
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

331
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,979
My husband went to meet someone
from a different building.

332
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,733
And I heard there are many
Mad Human Disease patients out there.

333
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,409
Where did he go?

334
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,137
I hoped that he wasn't infected…

335
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,769
-Do something about this crazy jerk!
-Why should I?

336
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,607
This world will be better off without you.

337
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,932
Hi, Mr. Kook.

338
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,602
It's hard to go out and get a consultation
when you're in lockdown.

339
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,520
Right, please wait.

340
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,568
The Internet doesn't work here.

341
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,364
You have to come out a little bit more.
This way.

342
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,248
How do I open this?

343
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,054
Consider yourself lucky.

344
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,641
If it wasn't for Sae-bom,
you would've been dead.

345
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,519
You see that camera?

346
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,189
If you tell anyone about him,

347
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,276
I will leak
the video of him attacking you.

348
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,946
Then you'll be a Mad Human Disease
patient too. Get it?

349
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,535
So just stay home
and do nothing but breathe.

350
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:26,251
Why did you hide that he's infected…

351
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,837
Why did you hide that?

352
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,840
Because he's a human being.

353
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,638
Mr. Kim, calm down.

354
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,975
You can go back to your normal state.

355
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:15,342
Mister, the apartments are
in lockdown right now.

356
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,428
Go home and get some rest.

357
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,810
What are you doing? You scared me.

358
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,228
Hold still.

359
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,939
If he breaks in, then we're in trouble.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,759
Mister.

361
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,388
We told you that you shouldn't go outside.

362
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,224
He was a client asking
about his grandfather's mountain.

363
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,266
He was totally fine.

364
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,853
I just saved you
from getting buried in the mountains.

365
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,232
I just lost one client because of you!
How can you say that?

366
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
Honey.

367
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,945
Are you okay?

368
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,906
Are you hurt?

369
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,283
Did you tell her?

370
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,619
-What?
-What's wrong with you?

371
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,380
You try to backstab others
whenever there's a chance.

372
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,258
I might just throw you to him
and get you infected.

373
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,345
-You know what?
-What?

374
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,013
I am…

375
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,559
super…

376
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,188
super lucky, you know.

377
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,108
Eat this, you bastard.

378
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,026
That's disgusting. What are you doing?

379
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,570
There is…

380
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,072
someone outside, you bastard.

381
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,078
Just in time.
Your husband is totally crazy!

382
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,790
Did you mess with him?

383
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,045
What is wrong with all of you?

384
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,552
Your husband hit my face
with my glasses on!

385
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,472
It was attempted murder…
No, he tried to kill me!

386
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,182
Come here.

387
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,354
He tried to kill me…
by using that monster or beast thing!

388
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,899
What is that?

389
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,568
-What is that?
-Are you okay?

390
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,653
Mr. Kim's disease occurred.

391
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,364
Hey!

392
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,618
It's dangerous, so don't go near him.

393
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,935
Did you know that there was
a patient in the apartment?

394
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,270
Then you should've told us.

395
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,357
The trainer at the basement gym.

396
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,942
I think he's got the disease.

397
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,867
Did we have someone like that here?

398
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,747
How is he?

399
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,546
Was it around 10:45 or 10:46 p.m.?
He stopped banging his head.

400
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,634
You go up first.
I'll go up after I check the situation.

401
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,886
Be careful.

402
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,897
Are you awake?

403
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,613
You're awake.

404
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,036
I'm sure they're talking about
kicking you out up there.

405
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,836
I only took it twice, I swear.

406
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,463
Because I heard it helps when I'm tired.

407
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,132
Why did you go outside?

408
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,727
To find the remaining drugs.

409
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,021
When I take it,
my concentration gets better.

410
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,524
You thought of taking drugs
during all that chaos?

411
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,193
I told you, I only took it twice!

412
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,530
Do you remember what happened
when the disease occurred?

413
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,367
A little bit.

414
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,039
A man from the sixth floor
came in and picked on me.

415
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
I tried to hold it in,

416
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,921
but he didn’t stop…

417
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,173
You'd better hold it in more from now on.

418
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,468
As the disease occurs more often…

419
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,682
you'll lose your mind completely.

420
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,313
I told him about the drugs.

421
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,983
That they're in the gym car.

422
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,405
I'll take care of that.

423
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,452
Did you feel joy?

424
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,416
Do you feel joy when the disease occurs?

425
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,378
Are you excited and thrilled?

426
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,101
Then you won't be able
to hold it in for long.

427
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,902
It's cold at night. Put a jacket on.

428
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,656
What about the gym guy?

429
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,533
He's back to normal.

430
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,454
The disease lasts for 15 minutes,
and they're back to normal.

431
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,082
There will be a vote tomorrow.

432
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,625
What vote?

433
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,921
A vote on whether
to kick Mr. Kim out or not.

434
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,966
The lawyer on the sixth floor
said we should vote,

435
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,759
because we live in a democratic country.

436
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,098
I honestly thought
I had a really nasty personality.

437
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,851
But that's nothing
compared to everyone else here.

438
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,729
What did the building representative say?

439
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,773
She only cares about becoming
the resident representative.

440
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,278
She said she will exempt us from
maintenance fees if we take her side.

441
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,447
Jung-kook was right.

442
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,493
By the way…

443
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,621
about what Oh Joo-hyung said…

444
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,874
It's not true, right?

445
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,375
What?

446
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,296
That I tried to kill him? That's not true.

447
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,340
That bastard was threatening
Mr. Kim first,

448
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,467
so I scared him a bit.

449
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
-Right?
-Of course.

450
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,511
I was just a little concerned.

451
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:19,140
You know I can't keep
my thoughts to myself.

452
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,057
I know.

453
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,559
Sae-bom.

454
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,813
There's something called
good cop, bad cop.

455
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,731
What?

456
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,401
One shouts and scares someone
as a bad cop,

457
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,863
and the other persuades them
with kind words as a good cop.

458
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,156
Carrot and stick.

459
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,619
-So?
-I'll be the bad cop,

460
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,162
so you be the good cop.

461
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,539
-No.
-What?

462
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,584
You've been a bad cop enough times.
I want to be the villain now.

463
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,921
I'm going to beat up
everyone who gets on my nerves.

464
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,256
So you should

465
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,759
just be nice, okay?

466
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,596
Hey.

467
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,227
I'm worried you might get hurt.

468
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,854
The bad cops

469
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,232
are the ones who get hurt.

470
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,445
We must kick him out.
That's the only way we can survive.

471
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,199
Are the others fine?

472
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,034
Has no one been bitten?

473
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:20,993
We don't know yet,

474
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,371
but when the disease occurs,
we must kick them out.

475
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,664
Mr. Lawyer.

476
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,750
Can you send me the video?

477
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,880
-Do you agree with kicking him out?
-Yes. I saw that mess outside too.

478
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,217
Why are you snatching it
when I'm still watching it?

479
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,969
Please cooperate with us.

480
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,264
The situation is pretty serious.

481
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,267
I told you I saw something like this!

482
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,185
Do you now understand why I did that?

483
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,770
Is that important right now?

484
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,356
Hey, look at his eyes.

485
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,569
Where's Mr. Oh?

486
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,573
I think he's still washing.

487
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,535
If you want,

488
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,582
we have an empty room too,
so you can stay at my house.

489
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,173
Thank you for your concern.

490
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,480
Did you have to go this far?

491
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,816
Of course.

492
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,818
If I opened the door,

493
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,905
I would've been killed
by that jerk from the other building.

494
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,993
He tried to kill me,
talking about mountains and so on.

495
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,706
And if we get infected too…

496
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,584
Why would we get infected?
We didn't do anything wrong.

497
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,712
You don't get a disease
for doing something wrong.

498
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,521
Anyway, I'm not going outside
until the lockdown is over.

499
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,148
Just five minutes.

500
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,235
If you just take five minutes,
you can save someone.

501
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,155
Are they even humans?

502
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,824
The Mad Human Disease patients, I mean.

503
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,744
Of course. If you go down,
you can talk to him.

504
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,080
Perhaps someone might die

505
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,124
because you're hiding here.

506
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,215
Think wisely.

507
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,474
Think wisely…

508
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,402
What are you doing here?

509
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,321
I was just waiting for you.
Where have you been?

510
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
To the 15th floor.
To tell them to come vote tomorrow.

511
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,473
Have you ever regretted
anything in your life?

512
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,523
I have.

513
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,404
When something happens
and it ends when I didn't do my best,

514
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,699
I can't help but feel regret.

515
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,327
And they keep lingering in my mind.

516
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,704
It makes me feel so uneasy.

517
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,250
So you don't want
to regret anything this time?

518
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,543
I don't.

519
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,629
This time,

520
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,923
I won't avoid things.

521
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,611
What?

522
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,003
Let's go!

523
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,050
Mom, let me borrow your phone.

524
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,343
Why?

525
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,637
I'll just record a video
and give it back to you.

526
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,055
I lost mine.

527
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,265
Where did you lose your phone?

528
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,268
Wasn't that phone brand new?

529
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,814
Mom, you only use it to make calls, right?

530
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,608
The password… Oh, it's not locked.

531
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,113
Hey, when you're done taking pictures,
give it right back.

532
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,906
Okay!

533
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,492
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

534
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,704
Thank you all for coming
though you're busy.

535
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:22,878
There's a law about emergency evacuation
on Article 22 of the Criminal Act.

536
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,463
I'll read it for you.

537
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,383
"An act performed in order to avoid danger

538
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,260
against a person's legal interest

539
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,346
shall not be punishable
when there are reasonable grounds."

540
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,723
"The preceding paragraph shall not apply

541
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,017
to a person with
duties not to avoid danger."

542
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,146
To put it simply, it's okay for us
to kick the infected out…

543
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,858
in order for us to survive.

544
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,778
You don't want to get infected

545
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,614
and go crazy like
the other building residents, right?

546
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,700
Let me show you this.

547
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,121
It's terrifying. Watch this.

548
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,667
My Lord!

549
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,878
Has anyone been infected
with COVID-19 before?

550
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,505
Why are you suddenly bringing up COVID-19?

551
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,965
None of you?

552
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,427
I was infected once, but why…

553
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,803
Let me ask you one thing.

554
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,762
Sir.

555
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,516
Did you get infected with COVID-19
because you did something wrong?

556
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,727
What does that even mean?

557
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,146
I didn't do anything wrong!

558
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,734
If only those old geezers
didn't ask me to eat with them…

559
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,902
Right.

560
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,239
Diseases are not something you catch
depending on who you are.

561
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,618
Remember what it was like
during the COVID-19 pandemic?

562
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,037
When someone got infected,
some people doxxed them

563
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,498
and pointed their fingers at them,

564
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,918
but most of the time, we were worried
about those who got infected,

565
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,253
and wished for them to get well soon.

566
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:52,384
That's not something you should
be kicked out for without getting treated.

567
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,221
This is not the same as COVID-19.

568
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,765
It's different.

569
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,685
It makes the infected
attack and bite people.

570
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,564
I understand
you're all scared and anxious.

571
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,690
I am, too.

572
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,860
But what if this happens to you,

573
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,905
or your family?

574
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,327
When you kick out Mr. Kim,
then who will you kick out next time?

575
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,413
Mr. Oh from the sixth floor?

576
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,458
Or the lawyer who was
in contact with Mr. Oh?

577
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:30,256
Shall we just play Musical Chairs
until only one person remains?

578
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,258
That's enough. Let's vote.

579
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,843
Who agrees with kicking him out?

580
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,978
It doesn't mean we have
to kick him outside.

581
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,689
It means we should not let him
blend in with normal people.

582
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,650
If we lock him up on a rooftop
and totally separate him,

583
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,652
then we'll all be safe.

584
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,903
Don't you think?

585
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,574
Just be honest and raise your hands.

586
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,077
You can be honest about your opinions.
Hurry up and raise your hands.

587
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,245
Raise your hands.

588
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,418
Yes, raise your hands. Come on.

589
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,175
Ma'am!

590
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,428
How can you do this to me?

591
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,430
You brought me here!

592
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:23,183
Looks like he feels betrayed
because I've been nice to him.

593
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,645
That's a total of eight.

594
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,691
So-yoon, what are you doing?
Raise your hand.

595
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,819
Hey!

596
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:41,535
Nine.

597
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,079
Then those who disagree?

598
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,341
One, two,

599
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,676
three,

600
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,887
four,

601
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,431
five,

602
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,224
six…

603
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,894
six,

604
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:09,980
seven,

605
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,400
eight,

606
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,364
nine.

607
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,744
The votes tied. What should we do?

608
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,663
Should we vote again?

609
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,385
I don't think that's necessary.

610
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,568
Let's not kick him out.

611
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,696
I vote for that.

612
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,292
Ten votes. It's done.

613
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,756
That's good.

614
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,760
I felt uncomfortable
about kicking out one of our residents.

615
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,848
Seung-beom, I don't have
any hard feelings for you.

616
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,307
You know that, right?

617
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:33,230
Now then, let's discuss
how to monitor Mr. Kim.

618
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,982
It's tiring for us

619
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,235
and Detective Kim to keep monitoring him.

620
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,822
Let's form groups of two
and check his condition.

621
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,240
Who wants to go first?

622
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,910
Do you want to follow
the rules of democracy

623
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,037
and vote?

624
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,459
We will do it first.

625
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,924
Open it, now!

626
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,977
EMERGENCY RESTRICTION

627
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,869
I heard you told
the Prime Minister's office

628
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,414
that the regions with a large number
of infected should be locked down first.

629
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,836
I told them it can't be stopped
when the number of the infected grows.

630
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,755
That's true.

631
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,341
There's no cure, either.

632
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,679
The only thing you can do now
is to keep the temperature low

633
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,140
and buy time with
tranquilizers and sleeping pills.

634
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,268
You don't have much time left either.

635
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,271
One month at the most.

636
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,024
Isn't it the same for your wife?

637
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,277
Wasn't she infected
around the same time I did?

638
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,156
I thought that's why you said
you'd develop the cure within a month.

639
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,915
I understand that you're anxious.

640
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,220
I will give up on all places
that are now in isolation.

641
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,600
There hasn't been
much support until now anyway.

642
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,980
Like you said, the number
of the infected shouldn't increase.

643
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,942
Cut off electricity,
and don't give them food.

644
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,029
The whole country is using
air-conditioners right now,

645
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,115
so there's no need
to waste more electricity.

646
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:54,079
So we should cut off the electricity
and wait until the infected are all dead?

647
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,999
Even if the cure is out,
it's still troublesome.

648
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,252
They've tasted human blood,

649
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,754
so we can't be generous
just because they were ill before.

650
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,925
And you're the one who got addicted
to the taste of blood.

651
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,679
Because it’s okay for me to be like that.

652
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,098
I'm just telling you beforehand.

653
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,018
Because you seem to have a plan too.

654
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,109
Shouldn't we stop him?

655
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,028
The water will get cut
if they cut the electricity,

656
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,155
and even those
who aren't infected will die.

657
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,699
Find out when the electricity
will be cut off.

658
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,127
Hey.

659
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,131
Why do you think I married you?

660
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:52,220
If you're a secretary,
you should play along with me!

661
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:56,016
But we're a married couple now.
You and I may think differently.

662
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,311
I don't think my opinion was wrong.

663
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,980
Will you take responsibility
when we get infected?

664
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,360
This is why I shouldn't have
married an ignorant girl.

665
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,445
I have made a mistake.

666
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,836
Dong-hyun, give me my phone.

667
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,174
Mom, I can't give it to you
unless I'm done recording.

668
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,928
You're pestering me way too much today.
Is there something on your phone?

669
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,681
Why would I have anything like that?

670
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,849
Then just wait.

671
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,519
I will go outside and see
if anything else is there, okay?

672
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,978
But Dong-hyun…

673
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,021
Mom!

674
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,607
I said I'll give it back soon!

675
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,699
I need something big
to get more views, seriously…

676
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,956
What is she doing?

677
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,921
Excuse me.

678
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,301
You lost your phone, didn't you?

679
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,804
How did you know?

680
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,724
You dropped it at the entrance
when we were coming in.

681
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,808
I mean…

682
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,144
How did you know I was looking for it?

683
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,563
You were filming with it yesterday.

684
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,398
And you're filming again now.

685
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,024
I thought you'd be looking for it.

686
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,236
Wait, Ms. Lee.

687
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,825
Can you please help me?

688
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,327
I won't go outside.

689
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,328
I'll give you money.

690
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,414
Don't you need money?

691
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,795
Please tell me if you need anything.

692
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,298
Can I get bullets too?

693
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,507
Are you serious?

694
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,887
But why are you so interested
in military items?

695
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,641
I'm interested in
end-of-the-world scenarios.

696
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,186
The Earth is in danger right now.

697
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,104
It's not just infectious diseases.

698
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,107
Extreme weather, global warming,
nuclear war, AI…

699
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,486
Extinction is coming soon.

700
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,363
Okay…

701
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,619
So I'm collecting
all kinds of survival gear.

702
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,246
I'm also collecting combat rations
from other countries.

703
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,873
Did you collect a lot?

704
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,792
Combat rations?

705
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,758
Want to see my collection?

706
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,301
Your collection?

707
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,719
Why not?

708
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,747
Wouldn't that break
if you put force into it?

709
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,835
I'm not sure.

710
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,424
If you break that,
your life will break too.

711
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,802
Be careful if you don't want
to get kicked out.

712
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,804
Are you here to mock me?

713
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,306
I'm here to clear our misunderstanding.

714
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,017
I wanted to help you too.

715
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,936
But you took the drugs.

716
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,647
When did you even help me?

717
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,945
Drink it when you're thirsty.

718
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,365
Only when you seriously cannot hold it in.

719
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,284
I'm here because I'm worried.

720
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,328
-Why did you tell me to go there…
-Shut up.

721
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,248
-Tell me if you need anything.
-I think you're mentally ill.

722
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,084
Are you nuts?
You call your sister "mentally ill"?

723
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,169
I'm saying you are.

724
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,213
-What a brother I have.
-Think about it…

725
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,090
MUIL GROUP CONSTRUCTION
IN COMMEMORATION OF SELECTION

726
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,425
I told you, shut up.

727
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,181
I comforted him
as the building representative

728
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,267
because it would be tough for him.

729
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,227
Goodbye, then.

730
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,358
By the way,

731
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:19,279
I voted for kicking him out earlier…

732
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,408
He would remember that, right?

733
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,579
There are people he'd hate more than you,
so you'll be fine.

734
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,631
It's not an airborne disease,
so don't worry about it.

735
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:43,219
If he gets extremely thirsty
while you're watching him,

736
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,056
don't give him water,
and just come up to the fifth floor.

737
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,350
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

738
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,018
And the key for the handcuffs.

739
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,609
Well, you might not need it,
but you never know.

740
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,323
I'll go talk to Mr. Kim for a moment.

741
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,206
Aren’t you scared?

742
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,293
Why did you vote for kicking him out
when you don't even live here?

743
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,008
What did the building representative
say to you?

744
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,680
Isn't there something else
you're more curious about?

745
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,474
I am curious about
a lot of things right now.

746
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,643
The ones who bought the drugs.

747
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,315
That man in the quarantine suit.

748
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,610
The last one to vote.

749
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,405
Muscles are formed when we exercise.

750
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,074
-Right.
-But if you take this pill,

751
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,077
it doubles the effect
compared to exercising.

752
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,663
You can see that they are
in the form of small pills.

753
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,331
The 15th floor.

754
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,176
It was there,
but I can't see it from here.

755
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,638
Go ahead and make it quick.
I'll be watching from here.

756
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,019
Let's remove these.

757
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,421
Young lady.

758
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,135
Are you looking for something?

759
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,511
Want me to help you?

760
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,498
Sae-bom, Kim Seung-beom said…

761
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,589
Seo-yoon, where's Sae-bom?

762
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,884
She went upstairs
with the man on the 15th floor.

763
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,400
IF YOU'RE BORED, WE CAN CHAT

764
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,694
Oh, my darlings.

765
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,825
Hyun-kyung, this is Jae-yeol,
and he plays the piano so well.

766
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:57,080
You can get advice from him
if you write music novels later.

767
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,045
Then just lend me money.

768
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,923
Aren't you worried about
your wife and kids?

769
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,425
Talk about things like that
when the lockdown is over.

770
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,970
I'm sure they're fine!
What could've happened?

771
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,012
I'm working now.

772
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,308
To be brutally honest, if you die here,
then this house becomes mine.

773
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,562
But I came here to help you.

774
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,648
That sounds like you want to kill me.

775
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,317
It's not the first time you tried.

776
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,821
I got injured
because you pushed me off the swing!

777
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,906
I can't show my forehead because of this!

778
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,159
You didn't do anything good to me, either!

779
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,120
You gave me hepatitis in high school
so I had to retake my CSAT!

780
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,372
It's not my fault
you had a weak immune system!

781
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,168
Do you know how it feels
to treat people my age as my seniors?

782
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,338
Let's talk outside.

783
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,096
I'm sorry, okay?

784
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,975
I'm not plotting to do anything to you.

785
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,686
I just felt upset.

786
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,898
What are you so upset about?

787
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,402
You received the fortune when you married,
and our parents sent you to college,

788
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,487
but I only had my tuition paid, just once.

789
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,240
I paid for the rest!

790
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,202
But I never said a word and I held it in.

791
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,789
How could you act
like I owe you something, after all that?

792
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,921
I'm sorry…

793
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,799
but let's not be so harsh, okay?

794
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,136
We're still family.

795
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,263
So much for family.

796
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:50,902
This place is safe, right?

797
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,737
-Where are you going?
-What?

798
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,572
I hear something.

799
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:58,368
It's okay. It's safe here.

800
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,597
What are you two doing?

801
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,767
Run!

802
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,203
I don't think anyone's out there.

803
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,793
Hey, don't open it!

804
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,798
Stop talking down to me.
I'm still your older brother.

805
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,315
Are you scared?

806
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,191
Don't worry, your big brother is here.

807
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,528
Is something going on outside?

808
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,335
Sae-bom!

809
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,420
Yoon Sae-bom!

810
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,010
Sae-bom's here, right?

811
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,015
I'm a little busy right now.

812
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:28,434
She'll be out soon. Hang on.

813
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,272
Did you take the drugs?

814
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,608
The ones you bought at the gym?

815
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,826
If you messed with Sae-bom,

816
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,994
I'm going to kill you.

817
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,480
One person went missing because of you.

818
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,192
We need someone with power.

819
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,986
Someone who will follow our orders.

820
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,865
Even though I know
what I should drink to quench my thirst.

821
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,491
Na Soo-min's phone.

822
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,077
The electricity will be cut off tonight.

823
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:29,912
You stay here.

824
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,623
He's here to take Sae-bom.

825
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,625
I'm here to find even
the smallest possibility.

826
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,421
Even if it means
getting you bitten by the infected.

827
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:47,847
