No

Are you okay, Sky?

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,500
I’m kind of short of breath

164
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,070
Take a rest first. Let’s sit down now

165

Are you okay?

I think it’s been a while since I last exercised. I can’t keep up with my breathing

What is it?

204
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,960
What do you think 1 + 1 equals?

but you bring this young one this time?

287

Hippo, you’re exaggerating. I didn’t have company every time

288
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,860
All those you brought were hot though

289

- Ball, you ass
- You miss that, don’t you

290
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,300
Totally. I’m a gleaner. I pick up whatever remaining

What points?

294
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,020
You’re talking as if you are after someone right now

295
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,900
Yeah. As if you are pursuing someone around here

296
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,560
Very suspicious

297

Hey hey hey. Are you flirting with me here?

298
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,820
Hey, we’re friends. We’re the same pole of the magnetic field. That won’t work

299
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,360
What? Why do you even need to ask?

300
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,030
I think I’m making things very clear here

301
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,770
Ah

302
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,390
Are you joking?

303
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,930
- He’s playing with us
- A joke for sure

304
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,649
It’s remotely funny

305
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,788
You’re asking for this, you jerk

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,930
I can do it myself

312
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,880
Are you refusing to share food with me?

313
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,500
So stingy

314
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,810
Ah, that’s not it

315
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,170
- I can peel…
- I’ll do it for you

00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,930
You want one, Pop?

317
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,450
Yeah, peel it for me as well

318

Sky

319
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,810
- I’m asking you for real
- Aha

320
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,340
So, you really are going after him?

321
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,680
Yeah
[Gentle music tunes play]

322
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,210
I’m going after him right now

323
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,090
Shit. But you used to like…

324
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,180
That was the past. I only have him right now

325
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,200
Hmmm

326
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,680
Would you like some lime juice? It’ll be less greasy

327
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,710
Argh. What do you expect from him?

328
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,170
Whenever he wants someone, he’s always so courteous

329
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,300
- Absolutely
- Correct

330
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,720
He says the right thing today

331
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,300
- Right?
- Yeah
- True

332
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,580
That’s true. When I’m pursuing someone, I’m always like this

333
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,600
And right now

334
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,220
I want him so much

335
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,510
I want him as my lover for… another 10-20 years. May I, Jao?

336
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,920
Now that’s greasy!

337
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,650
How about this

338
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,370
If…you like him for real

339
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,630
confess to him right here for me

340
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,590
- Right
- Aha
- Yeah

341
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,200
Of course, I can do that

342
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,290
It’s just…

343
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,380
I’m afraid the kid around here will be embarrassed

344
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,400
Who’s embarrassed

345
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,070
Ouch, Jao. It hurts

346
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,570
Ouch, you’ve been hitting me so hard these days. Hmph

347
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,720
- Oh, don’t play weak
- Ouch…hurts

Urghhhh

349
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,900
Where did you vow [or pray]? Don’t forget to fulfil your vow

350
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,920
because a luck this good doesn’t come often

351
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,060
Bua, the one who must fulfil the vow is me

352
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,100
It hasn’t been easy to have him opened his heart for me

353
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,970
Wait!

354
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,720
So he lets you dangle around him already

355
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,320
So, do you like my friend?

Do not pressure him

If he wants to say it, he will

359
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,600
Argh, don’t pretend to be cool. I know you wanna know

360
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,560
You like him?

361
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,720
Yeah, do you?

362
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,890
Hey, stop it. It’s true that I want to know, but I can wait. I’m not in any rush

363
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,570

Jao, listen to me

367
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,440
Try not to think too much about anything. Just let it be

What did you say, Jao?

375
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,370
I said…

No, they didn’t

You were saying you liked me a second ago

If you date me

you will be…
