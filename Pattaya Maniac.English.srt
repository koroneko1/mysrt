1
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,500
Get down here.

2
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,583
Jack, are you getting drunk already?

3
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,416
Here, Jack. Here.

4
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,041
This is fun.

5
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,458
I'm sober now.

6
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,750
Bottoms up.

7
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,000
This is so fun, guys.

8
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,916
Great. I'll get it for you.

9
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,208
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

10
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,458
I remember.

11
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,666
Great!

12
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,666
Friend, look.

13
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,791
Tao!

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,458
Tao!

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,375
Hey.

16
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,625
-It's my turn.
-Oh, no.

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,958
-Is he new here?
-Is he new?

18
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,791
I have no fear of the rain

19
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,541
Or even the storm

20
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,958
Always stand tall

21
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,416
Up to the sky

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Tao.

23
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,000
Thunder crashing

24
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:18,708
Tao.

25
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,750
Lightning flashing

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,791
I'm standing tall

27
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,875
Against them all

28
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,083
What the hell?

29
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,083
Hey!

30
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,750
My name is Tao.

31
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,541
I love singing "Lightning Rod."

32
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,500
However, I don't understand
why my singing annoys some people.

33
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,500
KOONG-TEN KARAOKE

34
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,291
Mister, please don’t make tonight go ugly.

35
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,833
Hey.

36
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,208
Who are you calling "ugly?"

37
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,583
I'm handsome!

38
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,875
Hurry. Follow them.

39
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,666
Damn it.

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,958
This is my friend, Tun.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,250
We’ve been friends since primary school.

42
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,000
His dad was named Tai.

43
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,958
I've never seen his mom though.

44
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,208
According to his dad,
she ran off with a guy when he was young.

45
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,250
His dad was a well-known amulet expert.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,750
Everyone in the country knew him.

47
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,666
But after Guru Tai passed away,

48
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,583
Tun ran his dad’s amulet store
even though it was against his will.

49
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,500
He has never had faith

50
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,583
in the legacy his dad passed on to him.

51
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,916
Instead, his faith was in a shell of lust,

52
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,458
the thing which romancers

53
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,208
have beautifully labeled as "love."

54
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,833
Tun deeply believed in love.

55
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,125
His belief was beyond the word "faith."

56
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,125
But one day,

57
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,458
his faith

58
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,291
was destroyed

59
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,666
by a girl.

60
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,916
A girl

61
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,250
named

62
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,833
Maew.

63
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,541
He was completely devastated

64
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,125
and since then,
he has kept everything to himself,

65
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,083
disconnected himself
from his social life and friends.

66
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,833
It must have been the environment,

67
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,666
or his father must have possessed him

68
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,666
because since then,
he has become an expert on amulets

69
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,250
and turned himself into an amulet guru,

70
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,708
widely respected
by other experts in Pattaya,

71
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,291
just like his dad.

72
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,291
TUN AMULET EXPERT

73
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,333
He now makes a living
from people’s beliefs.

74
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
Frank Edward Muller once said,

75
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,125
"Belief is the cause of faith,

76
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,166
and faith makes miracles happen.

77
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,125
Sometimes, there is a fine line

78
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,125
between a miracle

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,125
and a coincidence,

80
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,458
as fine as the line between

81
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,458
faith

82
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,708
and obsession."

83
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,625
It's real.

84
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,958
Can you sign to authenticate it?

85
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,208
Of course.

86
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,583
I HEREBY CERTIFY
THAT THIS AMULET IS REAL

87
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,750
Thank you. See you, then.

88
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,375
-Take care.
-Thank you.

89
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,708
Don't you have work today?

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
It's a holiday.

91
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,333
Actually,

92
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,875
it’s a rich man’s holiday.

93
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,500
-What's this?
-It's all the money I owe you.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,875
Thirty thousand baht.

95
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,208
Where did you get the money?

96
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,375
Oh, I know.

97
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,625
You won the soccer bet, right?

98
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,583
Why?

99
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,916
Did you think I was going to lose forever?

100
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,125
Tonight,

101
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,625
I’ll take you out for a thank you party.

102
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,791
A thank you party?

103
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,791
Like the other day?

104
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,875
But, I don't need one.
I don't want to get hurt.

105
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,500
Come on.

106
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
There won't be a fight this time.

107
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,625
It's a nice, high-end bar
with a great sound system.

108
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,875
Their microphone is awesome.

109
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,583
I’ve already asked Ped and Kai to come.

110
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,208
No, I'll pass.

111
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,291
Don’t be a prisoner in your own home.

112
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,750
You need to go out and see the world.

113
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:02,125
Maew isn’t the only fish
in the sea, you know?

114
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,375
Okay, I get it.

115
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,625
I just want to ask you
to go to a karaoke bar

116
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,958
because it pains me to see you
always at home.

117
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,291
Last time,

118
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,458
you didn’t have a chance to sing, right?

119
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,500
It’s my treat.

120
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,083
Where?

121
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,958
Pattaya Karaoke.

122
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,541
Okay, but can you promise me one thing?

123
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,666
What is it?

124
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,083
Don’t sing "Lightning Rod."

125
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,000
-Your voice is amazing.
-Please pass on the microphone

126
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,958
-to the next singer in table two.
-It's a good song.

127
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,166
-Your voice is good.
-Next song,

128
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,666
let's make it more fun.

129
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,791
-Microphone to table two.
-You won't...

130
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,208
What song will you sing next?

131
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,791
Don't sing "Lightning Rod," okay?

132
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,083
Okay, bro.

133
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,166
That bald man has bad taste.

134
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,250
Oh, as if your taste is fucking good.

135
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,125
Who requested this song?

136
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,333
It's my song.

137
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,291
Are you serious? Is it your song again?

138
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,250
A girl with big boobs, dancing, dangling

139
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,875
What a beauty

140
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,916
Walking on the street

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What song is this, Ped?

142
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,583
Actually she’s a he

143
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,083
With an HIV

144
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,541
A trouble seeker’s song.

145
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,875
He got his dick cut off

146
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,583
Trying to be a heartthrob

147
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,708
I hate faggots

148
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
I hate faggots

149
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
I hate faggots

150
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,750
I hate faggots

151
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,916
I hate faggots

152
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,541
I hate faggots

153
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,333
What is your problem?

154
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,583
Come on, bro.

155
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,958
-I’m just getting in the mood here.
-Quit it.

156
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,583
You’re scaring other customers away.

157
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,541
Do you want to get me fired?

158
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,750
There’ll be no more songs for any of you.

159
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,791
It serves you right.

160
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,000
It’s your fault.

161
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,833
I haven’t sung yet.

162
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,083
I didn’t sing "Lightning Rod," though.

163
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes, you didn’t.

164
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,416
But what you sang was nastier.

165
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,875
That’s not it.

166
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,083
Chang is just prejudiced.

167
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,250
Even if I sang our National Anthem,

168
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,000
he’d still pick on me. Damn it.

169
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,583
Let’s get out of here.

170
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,583
Hey, hey.

171
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,541
I haven’t sung a song yet.

172
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,833
If I don’t get to sing, neither will you.

173
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:39,791
What?

174
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,875
You’re such an asshole.

175
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,500
This song again?

176
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,416
Don't you know any other songs?

177
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,708
No, I didn’t request it.

178
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,583
If it wasn’t you, then who?

179
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,125
How would I know?

180
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,500
-Was it you?
-No.

181
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,541
Then who requested it?

182
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:08,791
I’m right here waiting for you

183
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:15,041
Whenever she makes you so blue

184
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,250
Oh, oh

185
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,875
Whenever I see your heart broken

186
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,291
My heart is also drowning

187
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,500
In pain

188
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,833
If her love

189
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:36,041
Is too mean and unkind

190
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:42,375
I’ll wipe your tears away till they dry

191
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,875
Give me your bruised heart

192
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:52,750
Let my true love heal it fast

193
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,416
Oh, oh

194
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:58,791
Hey.

195
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,041
Hey!

196
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,666
Have you never seen an airplane?

197
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,541
What do you mean?

198
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,416
Like how a dog eyes an airplane.

199
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,208
Don’t you get it? Beauty and the beast.

200
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,291
Do you know her?

201
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,250
You have me who loves you

202
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958
Your stupidity cannot be cured.

203
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Her name is Nok.

204
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,875
Madame Nok.

205
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,291
The daughter of a well-known mafia leader
in Pattaya.

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,458
You're disappointed, aren't you, dog?

207
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,375
I’m not.

208
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,666
Because I’m not a dog.

209
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,041
I’m Ped, the duck.

210
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,750
I have wings.

211
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,083
I’ll fly there to quack-a-boom-boom her.

212
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,750
Hey, where are you going?

213
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,750
To quack-a-boom-boom her.

214
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,000
Ped.

215
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,416
Her father is a mafia, remember?

216
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,958
So what? He isn’t my father.

217
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,041
You fucking duck. You’re going too far.

218
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,166
If her love

219
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,875
Is too mean and unkind

220
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,916
I’ll wipe your tears away

221
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:30,750
Till they dry

222
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:35,083
Give me your bruised heart

223
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,291
Let my true love heal it fast

224
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,791
If her love

225
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:47,625
Is too mean and unkind

226
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,416
I’ll wipe your tears away

227
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,333
Till they dry

228
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,333
Give me...

229
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,541
Your bruised heart

230
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,875
Let my true love heal it

231
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,958
Fast

232
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
I’ll cherish you

233
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:14,250
With all my heart

234
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,083
Can you take me home?

235
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,958
What did she tell you, Tun?

236
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,958
Tun!

237
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,958
Hey, Tun!

238
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,750
What did she tell you?

239
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:55,750
She asked me

240
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,166
to take her home.

241
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,458
Cross it! Cross it fast!

242
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:03,958
Cross what?

243
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,291
The bridge of love!

244
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,916
It’s the bridge of love
that she’s extending to you.

245
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,333
What the hell are you waiting for?

246
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,333
Nok.

247
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,333
I want you to know

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,250
that I deserted the soldier camp...

249
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,750
That's not it.

250
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,000
No.

251
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,708
I just want to let you know

252
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,583
that you are such a fantastic singer.

253
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,500
Do you like that song, too?

254
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,625
Me?

255
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,458
Yes, I really like it.

256
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,958
I’ve never seen any girl before

257
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,458
that sang that song as well as you did.

258
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,958
What’s your name, by the way?

259
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,333
It’s Tun,

260
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,958
like a mole, living in a hole.

261
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,208
And...

262
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,375
do you have a car, Tun?

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,333
For Tun, the mole in the hole, no.

264
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,791
But for this Tun, yes.

265
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,416
But it's not really a car,
it's a motorcycle.

266
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,541
Here it is.

267
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,083
It’s pretty old, as you can see.

268
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,708
-It’s gross.
-How is it gross?

269
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,166
I didn’t ask you how you did it.

270
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,333
I just want to know if you did it.

271
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,750
Well, Tao has a good point.

272
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,083
Look at him.

273
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:57,208
I saw you and Nok
on the motorbike together.

274
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,500
Why are you talking like
“sex” is a big thing?

275
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,166
Because if it wasn’t,

276
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,541
I wouldn’t have been born.

277
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
This asshole came up
with another good quote again.

278
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,083
Whose quote is it this time?

279
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,583
Aristotle's.

280
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,208
So did you two do it or not?

281
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,208
Yes?

282
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,041
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah!

283
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,375
That's it.

284
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,583
So how did you do it?

285
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,791
You’re getting too nasty.

286
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,500
You’re getting too nasty.

287
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,083
Which one of you is Tun?

288
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,958
Chief Mhee wants to see you.

289
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,875
Her name is Nok.

290
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,541
Madame Nok.

291
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,000
The daughter of a well-known mafia leader
in Pattaya.

292
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,708
Hey!

293
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,666
Is it you who screwed my daughter?

294
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,750
I really didn’t know
she was your daughter.

295
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,291
Please put it down.
All of this is a bit unfair for me.

296
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,708
How dare you disrespect me?

297
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,458
I didn’t mean to.

298
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,333
Besides,

299
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,208
it was your daughter who started it.

300
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,208
What’s wrong with you?

301
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,125
Didn’t you understand what he asked you?

302
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,333
Are you Guru Tun?

303
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

304
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,833
Yes, it’s real.

305
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,666
That’s what I want to hear.

306
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,833
I knew Guru Tai, your father, quite well.

307
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
If he wasn’t such a womanizer,

308
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,541
he wouldn’t have died young.

309
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,416
What about you?
Are you a playboy like your dad?

310
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,166
No, not at all.

311
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,500
Hey, Kae.

312
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,333
Bring my daughter out here.

313
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,500
Do you know him, honey?

314
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:37,833
No, I don’t.

315
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,833
What?

316
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,416
Is that your daughter?

317
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,708
Yes.

318
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:48,750
She’s so nice.

319
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,125
I thought you were going to get killed.

320
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,083
Hey.

321
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,791
Why was I going to get killed?

322
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,083
There was no reason for him to kill me.

323
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:03,958
Don’t you know that Chief Mhee
kills people without a reason?

324
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,833
How do you know that, Ped?

325
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,875
Well, that’s what people say.

326
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,541
"That's what people say" again?

327
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,458
What if they said
your mom was a crocodile?

328
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,750
What would you do?

329
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:17,250
Stupid, then I would run away from home.

330
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,500
That's enough!

331
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,041
All right, guys.

332
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,208
-Let’s get our asses back to work.
-Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,333
What’s our position tonight?

334
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,041
What do you mean?

335
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,333
Usually, we do it missionary style.

336
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,000
Do you think that’s funny?

337
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,791
I asked if we’re going out tonight.

338
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,791
Do you believe that?

339
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,083
Guru Tun asked us to go out.

340
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,375
I just happen

341
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,333
to get some money
from authenticating amulets.

342
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,208
I just want to treat you guys.

343
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,375
Treat us?

344
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,375
If it’s on you, you can choose
where you want to go.

345
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,666
Pattaya Karaoke.

346
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,416
Hey, dear, I have come already

347
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,250
I'm here already

348
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,666
Move in a little closer

349
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,416
Hey, dear, we are a true loving couple

350
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,875
No lying, oh, my best lover

351
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey, dear...

352
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm so sorry, Sir.

353
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,541
I'm so sorry.

354
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,041
Please come back next time.

355
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,458
Hey, dear, we are a true loving couple

356
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,833
No lying

357
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,583
Oh, my best lover

358
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,625
I promise you with true love
And I really love you

359
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,958
Keep dreaming of you
While I sleep dreaming of you

360
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,750
I don't want anything from a playboy
Gucci and Prada I have given you

361
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,541
Lying baby

362
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,291
Lying ta, la, la

363
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,833
Lying baby

364
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,625
Lying ta, la, la

365
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,125
Lying baby

366
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,791
Lying ta, la, la

367
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,166
Lying baby

368
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,416
Stop!

369
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,416
What the hell are you singing?

370
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,958
-It’s entitled "My Honey."
-"My Honey"?

371
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,708
I thought you were singing "My Ass."

372
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,166
You barked and chased
all my customers away.

373
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,416
That’s it. Get out!

374
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,083
What?

375
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,458
When I become rich, you'll see.

376
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,875
What will I see?

377
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,416
I’ll open up my own place

378
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,666
-and you’ll be sorry.
-I think I’d be happy.

379
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,166
Thank you.

380
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,125
When you happen to get rich,
please give me a call.

381
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:56,041
But right now, get the hell out of here!

382
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,208
Get out!

383
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,583
Here, take this number.

384
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:11,750
Whose number is it?

385
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,916
It’s Nok’s, your babe.

386
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,458
Where did you get it?

387
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,458
I just got it, okay?

388
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,875
Happy birthday, dude.

389
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,333
I’m really jealous of you.

390
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,208
The entire hectic story starts here.

391
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,708
The woman named Nok

392
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,208
was neither a madame

393
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:46,166
nor a daughter of a well-known mafia
in Pattaya.

394
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,958
May I speak to Nok, please?

395
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,291
Nok? Who's calling?

396
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,083
-I’m Tun.
-Who's Tun?

397
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,250
I’m Tun, Tao’s friend.

398
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,333
I see. Tao, Kiad's friend?

399
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,208
Listen, Mr. Tun.

400
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,375
That bitch is no longer working here.

401
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,750
What do you mean?

402
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,375
What do you think I mean?

403
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,625
She doesn’t work here anymore.

404
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,041
What kind of work?

405
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,291
Goddamn it!

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,750
A prostitute.

407
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,250
Why did you call her, then?

408
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,208
A prostitute?

409
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,291
So...

410
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,500
How can I...

411
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,041
get to...

412
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,375
book her, I mean,

413
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,583
meet her?

414
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,708
Hey.

415
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,541
Just give me 100,000 baht,

416
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,125
and I’ll deliver her to your bedroom.

417
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,916
So please stop calling.
I'm trying to sleep here.

418
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,541
One hundred thousand baht?

419
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,125
One hundred thousand baht?

420
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:02,375
Who would have thought
that love could happen in one night?

421
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:03,750
What is it, Pla?

422
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,458
However, it did.

423
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,541
Hello, Nok. I need a favor.

424
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,666
Can you do one last job for me?

425
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,250
Another job?

426
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,625
I can’t do it.

427
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:21,833
I told you Kamnun Moo
has already hired me, right?.

428
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,500
Three million baht per year, remember?

429
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,833
I do.

430
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,875
-But--
-I can't.

431
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,458
All right, I understand.

432
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,666
How about you just go meet him?

433
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,916
It’s Kamnun Moo we’re messing with.

434
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,000
Do you want me to get killed?

435
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,708
I really can’t.

436
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,958
He already paid me.

437
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,666
And even worse,

438
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,208
I’ve already spent it all.

439
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,375
I have to go now.

440
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:00,208
The number you have dialed
is not available.

441
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,375
Tao.

442
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,416
The police are here.

443
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,500
Hey, stop!

444
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:19,916
Hey, you.

445
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:21,875
Yes, officer.

446
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:23,750
I’m just a security guard.

447
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,375
What movie do you want?

448
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,083
Scent of the Night Flower 3.

449
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,166
Listen.

450
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,291
Part two is still in production.

451
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,875
How can I get part three for you?

452
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,916
How about this one instead?

453
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,250
Sex of the Night Fondler.

454
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,250
Orgasm guaranteed.

455
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,250
-Orgasm guaranteed?
-Yes.

456
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,750
How much?

457
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,250
Hey, where the hell is Tun?

458
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,833
Why hasn’t he opened up his stall?

459
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,083
He might have gone crazy by now.

460
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,083
As if.

461
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,958
He may not know what a prostitute is.

462
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,375
You're right.

463
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:17,041
Rotorour Sigford once said

464
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,958
"Sometimes,

465
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,541
it’s hard to tell the difference

466
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,875
between a genius and an idiot."

467
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:26,708
Who the hell is Rotorour Sigford?

468
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,125
Bullshit. This moron
doesn’t know anything.

469
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,541
Stupid.

470
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,458
Why are you closing
your stall up so early?

471
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,166
I need to watch the soccer match.

472
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,666
I bet a lot this time.

473
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,458
How much did you bet?

474
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,458
One hundred thousand baht.

475
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,375
-What?
-What?

476
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:45,708
One hundred thousand baht.

477
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,458
Stupid.

478
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,916
Are you trying to get a new bike?

479
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,791
What is going to happen if you lose?

480
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,125
Lose?

481
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,000
That's impossible.

482
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:01,458
Tonight, ManU is going to win.
I’m really sure.

483
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,708
Kenny Miller is dribbling past Wes Brown.

484
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,125
And he kicks it in! One-Nil!

485
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,791
Kenny Miller got a chance and took a shot.

486
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,250
It's hopeless for Howard.

487
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,291
The Wolves who barely attacks
waited for the golden opportunity.

488
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,708
And they seized it.

489
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,500
Finally, the referee blew the whistle.

490
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,458
Wolverhampton Wanderers
did the impossible.

491
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,416
They won the match
with Manchester United one to zero.

492
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,208
I don’t have it.
If I did, I’d lend you some.

493
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,500
Where did you spend your money on?

494
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,250
I transferred a 100,000 baht
to a person named Pla.

495
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,791
I barely have anything left.

496
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,791
Who the hell is Pla?

497
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,458
What?

498
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,500
You gave me his number.

499
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,500
Why did you give him

500
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:51,958
that much money?

501
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:58,958
Tun.

502
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,333
Why did you do it?

503
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,791
I want to meet Nok.

504
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:04,916
Nok?

505
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,958
Why does it cost so much
just to meet that slut?

506
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,416
I don't know.

507
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,500
Pla told me it’s a security deposit.

508
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,333
Security deposit, my ass!

509
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,125
You, fucking genius.

510
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:22,958
I paid that whore

511
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,166
only 10,000 baht to sleep with you.

512
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,041
You hired her?

513
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,041
I thought you already knew

514
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,041
when I gave you that number.

515
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,208
How could you do this to me?

516
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,083
I just returned your favor.

517
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,458
What’s wrong with that?

518
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,916
Well, did you finally see her?

519
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,375
I didn’t fucking see anyone.

520
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:20,291
Don’t tell me you got conned
by that faggot.

521
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,416
If you want that money,

522
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,833
go and get it back from that faggot.

523
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,291
How dare you trick my friend?

524
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,583
Give me the money back.

525
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:51,625
Hurry.

526
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,166
-Hey, what's that?
-What's happening?

527
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,958
-What's happening, Pae?
-I don't know.

528
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:04,625
I thought I’d make money from this shit
and pay him off.

529
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,833
I wasn’t trying to trick your friend.

530
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:07,958
Sell this, then.

531
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,166
I want that money right now.

532
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,958
Well, follow him upstairs.

533
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:28,916
And where are you going?

534
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,583
I have to pee.

535
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,000
I'll follow you.

536
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,583
Come on.

537
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,916
Wait here.

538
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,000
Have you never seen a woman before?

539
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,875
Don't you guys have a house to return to?

540
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,916
I really feel sorry for your parents.

541
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,458
Bring it out.

542
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,666
Give me a knife.

543
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,041
Hey!

544
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,500
I have a knife here.

545
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,750
Got you!

546
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,750
Isn't it funny?
I think it’s fucking funny.

547
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,541
My joke rocks.

548
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:14,708
Hey, bro.

549
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,916
I don’t think I can give you a refund.

550
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,208
Why not?

551
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,958
-It's fake.
-How come?

552
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,625
Pla said he got this drug from you.

553
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,625
Taste it for yourself.

554
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,541
Try it.

555
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,458
Bro.

556
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,000
How can you be sure he didn’t fool you?

557
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,083
What a stupid person.
He doesn’t know a thing.

558
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,708
That's free cocaine for me.

559
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,500
Keep it, Krarok.

560
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,041
He's the first.

561
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,375
That was a lot of cocaine.
I completely fooled that asshole.

562
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,291
He's so dumb. I got him.

563
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,500
Krarok, tell your friend
to put her hair up.

564
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,625
She creeps me out.

565
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,791
Haven't you watched the The Grudge?

566
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Oh, my god.

567
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,041
It’s me.

568
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:01,750
Arng?

569
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,333
I thought you got whacked.

570
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,916
Do you think

571
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:13,166
they would recognize me?

572
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,291
You're right.

573
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,583
I could hardly recognize you.
If you can just control your stutter.

574
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,833
By the way,

575
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,458
who was the creditor

576
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,875
that you ran away from again?

577
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,625
I think it was Moo.

578
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,791
We've got the same creditor.

579
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,500
How much?

580
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:39,875
A hundred thousand baht.

581
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43,375
Here.

582
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,375
Who's this?

583
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:51,041
The plastic...

584
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,375
surgeon.

585
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,083
Just change your appearance.

586
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,500
It's your only way to get away from them.

587
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,500
But must I look ugly like you?

588
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,166
Your appearance

589
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,041
does not matter in life.

590
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,833
Whose quote is it this time?

591
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,083
Well, Franco.

592
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,208
Anthony Hawkins.

593
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,875
Stravinsky.

594
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:23,083
David Fisherman.

595
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,583
Ca...

596
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,958
Oh, my god.

597
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:38,250
Next time, don't forget
to get your voice changed too, Arng.

598
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,041
Tun.

599
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,791
Can I crash at your place tonight?

600
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:24,750
Tun.

601
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,208
What the fuck is wrong with you?

602
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,125
Are you drunk?

603
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,125
Leave me alone!

604
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,666
Who the hell are you?

605
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,416
I’m Tao, the turtle, your pal.

606
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,875
Turtles can't talk.

607
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,625
Have you been drinking?

608
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,416
Did you think I drank sea water
to get drunk?

609
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,208
What a moron!

610
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,916
Which part of your fucking brain
gave you that idea?

611
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,625
-Asshole!
-What?

612
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:10,041
-Who did you call an asshole?
-You.

613
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,208
Damn you.

614
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,541
Even my father never called me that.

615
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,166
Who the fuck do you think you are?

616
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,125
Do you want to do it the hard way?

617
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,791
How about a fist fight?

618
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,125
Muay Thai?

619
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,833
Hardcore wrestling?

620
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,625
You name it.

621
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,750
Or do you want my sidekick...

622
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,166
-to whip your ass?
-Who are you talking about?

623
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:38,208
Kid Silencer!

624
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,791
Take this.

625
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,875
Take this.

626
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,875
Are you knocked out already?

627
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,583
Are you?

628
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,958
You're already bleeding.
You should take care of that.

629
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,916
All right.

630
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,375
Do you want a piece of me?

631
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,416
-I'll teach you a lesson.
-Come on.

632
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,208
I'm going to whip your ass.

633
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,541
Sure.

634
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:06,916
This happens every time you drink.

635
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,541
This kind of amulet cannot be considered
as a collectible.

636
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,208
You should keep it for yourself.

637
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,791
It’s dirt cheap.

638
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,333
Fuck.

639
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,458
-I stole it for nothing.
-What?

640
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,083
What did you say?

641
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,625
Nothing.

642
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,083
What happened last night?

643
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,208
Hello.

644
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,125
Are you Guru Tun?

645
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,375
Kamnun Moo wants to see you.

646
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:10,916
But...

647
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,125
I don’t have any business with Kamnun Moo.

648
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,625
I don't know Tao personally.

649
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,791
He just bought an amulet

650
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,333
and we had a little chitchat.

651
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:22,833
And I never bet on soccer games.

652
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,333
Hey!

653
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,916
-Let me go! I said, let me go!
-Where are you rushing to?

654
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,041
Let me go.

655
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:29,416
I said, let me go!

656
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,958
-I was kidding.
-Did you just punched me?

657
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,875
Why did you punch him?

658
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,458
He tried to run away.

659
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,208
Why did he try to run away?

660
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:46,375
Wake him up.

661
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:53,250
Wait.

662
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,125
What's that bucket for?

663
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:58,916
I am waking him up.

664
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,958
Moron, you watch too many movies.

665
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:03,750
You’re going to drench him.

666
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,458
I hired henchmen to back me up,

667
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,208
but look at the way you all dress.

668
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,625
You make me look like a dumbass jerk.

669
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,500
Koong, Kung,

670
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,791
let me ask you something.

671
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,250
Why do henchmen
have to wear wacky outfits,

672
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,583
and goofy black sunglasses?

673
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,750
What's with the hats? Are you a hipster?

674
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:29,541
Why not pick red, white, orange,
or other damn colors?

675
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:34,291
He is awake now.

676
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:36,125
Put that damn bucket away.

677
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,500
Bro.

678
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,791
You checked the amulets
for Chief Mhee, right?

679
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:48,791
Yes.

680
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,500
How's it going?

681
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,375
A sweet talker

682
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,250
With a heart of bile, I won’t buy it

683
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:11,916
I had been warned
Not to fall for your bullshit

684
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,083
A sweet talker

685
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:18,208
With a heart of bile, a hypocrite

686
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:24,041
How many hearts have you broken

687
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:27,416
To bits and pieces?

688
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,500
When can I take this damn thing off?

689
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,791
My voice would sound a lot better
without this.

690
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,000
Are they all real?

691
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,166
Yes, sir.

692
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,333
That's great, then.

693
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:43,625
It will go into my collection,
the Sacred Seven.

694
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,750
Do you have all seven models?

695
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,000
All but one.

696
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,750
Can you find it for me?

697
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,666
Which model?

698
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,708
A supermodel.

699
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:56,625
Give me the envelope.

700
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,083
I'll get going, then.

701
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,166
Wait.

702
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:09,000
Tell your friend, Tao,
don't even think of running away.

703
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,625
He won't make it.

704
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:14,291
Show him the way out.

705
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:40,333
Nok.

706
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,916
-Hey.
-Let me go.

707
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,500
-I want to talk to--
-Do you know him?

708
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,750
-Hey.
-Let me go.

709
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,958
-Let me go.
-Let's go.

710
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,291
Do you want to die?

711
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,375
That’s Kamnun Moo’s chick.

712
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,416
Come on.

713
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,291
Let's go.

714
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,041
-Get out.
-Come here.

715
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,208
Hurry.

716
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,791
038-225476.

717
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,500
Your father owns a crocodile farm, huh?

718
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,416
Yes.

719
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,083
Then you must be rich.

720
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,125
What's your dad's name?

721
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,583
Poo.

722
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,458
Your dad's name is Poo.

723
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,208
Then your name is Pla.

724
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,833
-Your mom's name must be Puke--
-Puke your mother!

725
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
You better watch your mouth.

726
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,750
May I speak to Poo?

727
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:03,791
I'm speaking.

728
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:05,125
Poo.

729
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,083
Listen carefully.

730
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,583
I’ve kidnapped your son, Pla.

731
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:14,833
If you don’t want
anything tragic to happen,

732
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,666
pay me a ransom of one...

733
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:19,916
two...

734
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:23,083
Three hundred thousand baht!

735
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,291
-What? Three hundred thousand baht!
-Three hundred thousand baht!

736
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,375
Hey. I only owe you 100,000 baht.

737
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,875
How did you hear that? The speaker is off.

738
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:32,791
My ears are good.

739
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,208
Do you hear your son crying?

740
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,333
Let me tell you.

741
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,708
I won't give you a dime.

742
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,875
There’s no relationship
between me and that faggot.

743
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,208
Who the fuck bit you?

744
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,916
Nanta, the crocodile.

745
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:51,166
Nanta, the crocodile?

746
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,166
Anyone can put their feet
in Nanta's mouth,

747
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,375
and it never bites anyone.

748
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,708
It never bit me before, too,
but it bit me today.

749
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,541
What kind of a father are you?

750
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,833
How can you disown your son?

751
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,750
Why can't I?

752
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,541
He had the guts to disown his own dick.

753
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,375
Listen to me, loud and clear.

754
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:12,916
I’m neither a saint nor a soft-hearted dad
of a faggot that you see on TV.

755
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,750
I don't know
how to be one of those fathers.

756
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,958
Hot damn.

757
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,458
He's so cold-blooded.

758
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,625
Pla.

759
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:26,958
Did you really cut off your dick?

760
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,333
It's none of your business.

761
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,500
Listen.

762
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,083
If I don't get my money back,

763
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:34,833
I'm going to shoot you.

764
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,125
Come on. Shoot me.

765
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,166
I might look like a little pansy,

766
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,041
but I can tell that that gun is fake.

767
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,250
If I had seen it yesterday,

768
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,458
you couldn’t have fooled me today.

769
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:51,791
Is that so?

770
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,583
Why don’t you try this shit first?

771
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:55,833
No.

772
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,541
-Keep laughing.
-No.

773
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,083
"Shoot me."

774
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,875
Fuck you.

775
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,541
Hello.

776
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,250
-Tao.
-You're sadistic.

777
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,375
-Tun's drinking again.
-My whole body hurts.

778
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,708
Is he drinking again?

779
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,291
Was it my fault?

780
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,541
Was it because of my fickle heart?

781
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,458
Or was it your fault?

782
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:26,750
Or was it your gullible ears?

783
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:32,375
Whatever pulled us apart

784
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,958
I just want to tell you the truth

785
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:42,208
I want you to listen to me for once

786
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,375
I'm confused going down

787
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,291
-Because of your changing heart
-Look at your friend.

788
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:12,708
What is going on?

789
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,958
He said he’s heartbroken.

790
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:15,583
Heartbroken?

791
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,208
Which bitch was riding
past his house this time?

792
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,750
Still that whore, Nok.

793
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,041
What?

794
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,208
Didn't I warn you

795
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,875
that that guy is too sensitive
when it comes to girls?

796
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:32,250
Whatever pulled us apart

797
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:33,416
How much did he drink?

798
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,083
About half a bottle.

799
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,500
Why didn’t you guys stop him?

800
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,541
How could we?

801
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,208
We got here too fucking late.

802
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,458
Just be honest and say you didn’t dare to.

803
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:51,666
All right. I didn’t dare to stop him.

804
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:58,291
You know he becomes Mad Max
when he’s tanked up.

805
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,583
Even Chang wouldn’t dare to mess with him.

806
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,666
Take it easy, man.

807
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,583
Take it easy.

808
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:26,958
I don't get it.

809
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,125
Nok is Kamnun Moo’s girl.

810
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:31,583
Tun.

811
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,416
Don’t talk bullshit.

812
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:35,916
That's not funny.

813
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,166
Who the fuck is joking here?

814
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,041
Huh?

815
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:47,375
Tao.

816
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,291
Kamnun Moo said,

817
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,958
"Don't even think of running away."

818
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,083
Hey! Look!

819
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,583
Sit over there.

820
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,625
Holy shit!

821
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,458
What he said was true?

822
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,458
Tun.

823
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,500
Don't.

824
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,125
Please.

825
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,083
Do it for me.

826
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:18,000
You are on your own.

827
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,583
But I’m your best friend.

828
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,583
Sit down, you jackass!

829
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:25,625
No!

830
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:30,541
Tun.

831
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,708
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

832
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,708
He already said sorry.
Just let it go, will you?

833
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,416
No.

834
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,916
There’s much more

835
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,083
between Nok and me.

836
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,791
What the hell is it?

837
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,166
It’s what you don’t have.

838
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,083
What don't I have?

839
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,500
True love.

840
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,250
True love, my ass!

841
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,958
What kind of love grows in one night?

842
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,250
It’s something

843
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,541
you guys wouldn’t understand.

844
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:14,666
Yes, I’d like to hear you sing.

845
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:18,958
Where are you going?

846
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:27,958
Tun.

847
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,833
Didn’t your friend tell you?

848
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:32,458
He did.

849
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,000
Didn’t you say you loved me?

850
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,041
Are you stupid or what?

851
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:46,375
Is there a guy who still believes
in such a thing?

852
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,333
Yes.

853
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,708
No, there isn't.

854
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,333
Men don’t have the word "love"
in their dictionary.

855
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,000
All guys...

856
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,500
are the same.

857
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,458
I’m just one

858
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:27,375
Of the love choices she discarded to her

859
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:31,916
I’m only a useless cigarette butt

860
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,083
She breathed in all the sweetness

861
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,791
And dumped me

862
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:45,875
Left me crushed under her feet

863
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:52,500
I’m just one of the love choices
She discarded

864
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,541
It feels like being hit

865
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:58,833
On the head by a mallet

866
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,416
Tun.

867
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,041
I’m too sensitive and naive

868
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:06,958
Kamnun Moo.

869
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:09,916
It's okay.

870
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,791
You’ve just interrupted me
in the middle of my song.

871
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,666
I butted in

872
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,916
because I’m a dipshit.

873
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,500
I’m an idiot who doesn’t even know
what love is.

874
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,791
But honestly,

875
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,083
I...

876
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,666
have a sincere

877
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:34,875
affection

878
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,958
for this woman.

879
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:40,958
This asshole is a sweet talker.

880
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:45,125
Award-winning poets
should call you "Father."

881
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:46,916
Are you drunk?

882
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:49,000
I admit that I'm drunk.

883
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:51,833
But I know

884
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,291
what I’m talking about.

885
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:56,166
Do you know him?

886
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58,208
Do you?

887
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,625
Do you really love this woman?

888
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,041
If love means sincerity,

889
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,125
then the answer is yes!

890
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:14,708
Can your sincerity be put into price?

891
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:16,416
No, it can't.

892
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:17,958
If that's the case,

893
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:22,250
then your sincerity might not be love.

894
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,333
The love of this woman

895
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,250
is worth 3,000,000.

896
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,250
Do you have that?

897
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,041
If you do,
go ahead and take your love back.

898
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,083
She's all yours.

899
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,458
Or is your love

900
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,333
worth less than that?

901
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:44,541
Deal.

902
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,708
I'll give you 3,000,000 baht.

903
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,250
All right. You’re the man!

904
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,208
But for now, get your ass out of here.

905
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:02,000
Whenever you have the money,

906
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,083
you can come and get your love.

907
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,625
All right.

908
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:09,791
I'll go.

909
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:15,333
I’m just one of the love choices

910
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
What's the plan?

911
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:22,958
I can't do anything
until those pricks leave.

912
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,416
To her I’m only a useless cigarette butt

913
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,958
She breathed in all the sweetness

914
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,916
And dumped me

915
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:40,583
Left me crushed under her feet

916
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,458
I’m just one of the love choices

917
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:47,375
She discarded

918
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,625
It feels like being hit

919
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:54,000
On the head by a mallet

920
00:58:55,708 --> 00:59:02,166
I’m too sensitive and naive

921
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,791
I’m nothing but a beginner

922
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,416
In this game of love

923
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:21,708
Hey.

924
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,833
Is he dead?

925
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,250
How much did you pay for it?

926
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,583
Three million baht.

927
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,208
-It's not true.
-What?

928
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,541
-Really?
-Yes.

929
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,416
There are only nine authentic amulets
of this kind in the world.

930
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:21,458
Three belong to Mr. Por.

931
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:22,791
The fourth one is with Chief Kwang.

932
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,125
The fifth one is with Big Mod.

933
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,583
The sixth one is with Tri-Croc Temple.

934
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,416
The seventh one is with Father Sua.

935
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,833
The eighth one is with Dr. Keng.

936
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,541
And the last one

937
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,333
is at my house.

938
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:38,041
Anything other than these are fakes.

939
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,333
Where did you get it from?

940
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,625
I got it from someone I know.

941
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,958
The one that you own...

942
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,791
can you sell it to me?

943
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,125
It was passed down
to my dad by my grandfather.

944
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,916
So, it's kind of our heirloom.

945
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,166
I'll pay you 3,000,000.

946
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
Agatha Kinsky once said

947
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:12,791
"Love

948
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:16,000
makes you do stupid things.

949
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,250
And so does greed."

950
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,083
Hey.

951
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,083
What's your name?

952
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,875
Noo.

953
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:41,875
You're Noo, huh?

954
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:44,708
You look mixed.

955
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,083
Where do you go to school?

956
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,541
Bangkok.

957
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,416
What are you doing in Pattaya?

958
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,208
My parents live here.

959
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,333
Great "Butt-siness" Company.

960
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,625
It’s "Business."

961
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:06,083
What the fuck are you laughing at?

962
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:07,708
"Butt-siness?"

963
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:10,958
Who’s your father?

964
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,250
Mickey.

965
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,291
Like Mickey Mouse?

966
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,541
What about this,

967
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,000
since you think your English is good,

968
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,583
I’m going to call her father

969
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,250
and then you talk to him.

970
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,083
Tell him

971
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:45,250
that his daughter
has been kidnapped for a ransom.

972
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,166
Like a kidcracker.

973
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,916
What the fuck are you laughing at?

974
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,041
"Kidcracker," my ass!

975
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:29,958
I thought you were good.

976
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,375
My father isn’t a foreigner.

977
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,083
My father can speak Thai.

978
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:47,125
Why didn’t you say so, bitch?

979
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,083
You’re a bitch.
Do you want your ass kicked?

980
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,375
Oh! You’re going to get it, you bitch!

981
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,375
Pla.

982
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,375
Shut the hell up.

983
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:03,208
Are you Mickey?

984
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,166
Listen carefully.

985
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,458
This is a ransom call.

986
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:08,541
Your daughter is with me right now.

987
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,583
If you don't pay me a ransom of...

988
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,208
of...

989
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:16,666
three million baht.

990
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:18,041
Greedy asshole.

991
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,833
Why?

992
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,666
Her dad is richer than yours.

993
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:25,166
Hello. Do you hear me?

994
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,041
If you don't give me 3,000,000 baht,

995
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,458
I’ll cut your daughter into pieces
and send it piece by piece to you.

996
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,458
Your dad stood me up.

997
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,416
When are you going to release me?

998
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:57,083
When I get the ransom.

999
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:58,708
When will that be?

1000
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:01,125
It seems like her father is ditching you.

1001
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,958
Shut up, you monkey’s ass.

1002
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,083
You... Skunk.

1003
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,208
Ass-licker.

1004
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:06,541
Bitch. You're a slut.

1005
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:07,666
-You're a slut.
-Bitch!

1006
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,666
-Why don't you hit her too?
-It serves you right.

1007
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:14,916
You’re getting on my nerves.

1008
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,625
I can’t help it.

1009
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:26,791
Your father is aggravating me.

1010
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:28,916
You’re dead meat, bitch.

1011
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,208
Cut her.

1012
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:31,875
Cut her tongue out.

1013
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,000
What a mouth she's got.

1014
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,958
I’d love to see you in pain.

1015
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,750
I thought you were kidding.

1016
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:55,916
Is it in full?

1017
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:57,375
Yes, sir.

1018
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,333
I'm a man of my word.

1019
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,708
Can I pay you only 2.9 million?

1020
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,250
Why?

1021
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:15,416
I want to pay Tao’s debt of 100,000 baht.

1022
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,041
I see.

1023
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,666
What a man you are.

1024
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,208
Don’t you think
you drink Red Bull too much?

1025
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:25,666
Anyway,

1026
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:27,583
since you dared to ask,

1027
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:29,458
I'm going to give it to you.

1028
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,916
You have the guts to bring me 3,000,000.

1029
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:34,958
I respect you for that.

1030
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,166
-Koong.
-Yes.

1031
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,333
Be a man and do your job.

1032
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,458
Nok.

1033
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:54,625
Love is yours.

1034
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,583
Why did you do that?

1035
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,708
What do you want to prove?

1036
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,333
Nothing.

1037
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:07,583
I just wanted you to know

1038
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,833
that men are not all bad.

1039
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,166
Are you sure you’ll set me free?

1040
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,375
Yes.

1041
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:37,416
So somebody already paid my debt?

1042
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,500
Yes.

1043
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:41,041
But you're banned 

1044
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:43,083
from playing games with us.

1045
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,083
Of course.

1046
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,208
I won't gamble anymore.

1047
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,458
That will be my last time.

1048
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,541
I'm done.

1049
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,625
Shit.

1050
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:54,875
It was only 3,000,000.

1051
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:56,541
Why didn't you give it to them?

1052
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,500
How could you let them cut off her finger?

1053
01:08:58,958 --> 01:08:59,875
Don't you remember

1054
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,041
I lost all my money

1055
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:03,541
to you?

1056
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:06,833
You’re damn right.

1057
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,250
I came here

1058
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,750
to borrow some money from you.

1059
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,166
Let me ask you this, Mickey.

1060
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,958
How long have you known me?

1061
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:19,791
I've known you

1062
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,541
for only a year.

1063
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:26,166
See? It hasn't even been a year

1064
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,416
and you're already
borrowing money from me.

1065
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,166
-Koong.
-Yes, sir.

1066
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,625
Get Tun's money.

1067
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,458
There is 3,000,000 in here.

1068
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,083
Take this money
to the designated location.

1069
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,291
Thank you very much.

1070
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:51,666
And my henchmen
will take care of those creeps.

1071
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:02,625
Hello.

1072
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,791
It’s me, Chief Mhee.

1073
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:08,416
I know your amulet is fake.

1074
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:11,500
If I don’t get back my money today,

1075
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,291
you are dead!

1076
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:18,500
You cruel, evil-minded son of a bitch.

1077
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,250
All right. I’m sorry.

1078
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:28,708
Your apology
can’t make my finger grow back.

1079
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,583
Why didn’t you cut
that skunk’s finger off?

1080
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:33,333
Why did you cut mine?

1081
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,291
Well.

1082
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:37,625
I wanted a human finger,

1083
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:39,833
not a skunk's.

1084
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,416
Bastard!

1085
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,250
-Dick face!
-Hey!

1086
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,666
You had your dick cut off before.

1087
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:53,041
This is just a pinky.

1088
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,500
Stop screaming like you will die.

1089
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,666
Damn you!

1090
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:03,166
One more word,

1091
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,208
and I’ll also cut out your tongue.

1092
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:10,958
I’ll let you go.

1093
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:14,708
If you tell anybody,

1094
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:16,375
I’ll carve your lips off.

1095
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:17,916
Do you understand?

1096
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,333
Go home now.

1097
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:31,083
Your car’s at the back of the building.

1098
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:35,666
Why? Don’t you need the money anymore?

1099
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,791
Not anymore.

1100
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:38,833
Also,

1101
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,708
it seems like no one is coming
to help you.

1102
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:46,625
I knew it.

1103
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,083
Please don't cut the rope.

1104
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:58,541
Just leave it like that.

1105
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,291
It turns me on.

1106
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,833
Sir?

1107
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,166
Sir.

1108
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:31,875
Your phone's ringing.

1109
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:33,791
Oh, right.

1110
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,333
Tun.

1111
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,875
Where are you?

1112
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,583
I can't stay in Pattaya anymore.

1113
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,791
Chief Mhee will kill me.

1114
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,250
Why does he want to kill you?

1115
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,500
He found out that I sold him
a fake amulet.

1116
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,041
Why did you do that?

1117
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,166
How much did you get from him?

1118
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:58,416
-Three million baht.
-Three million baht?

1119
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,208
Fuck you.

1120
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,791
Yes, fuck me!

1121
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,333
I have no idea
how to return his 3,000,000.

1122
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,791
He wants his money back today.

1123
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:12,000
Where did you spend your 3,000,000 on?

1124
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,791
I paid your debt of 100,000 baht.

1125
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,791
Oh, thank you.

1126
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:18,791
What about the other 2.9 million baht?

1127
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:22,625
Tun!

1128
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:24,833
Tun!

1129
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,083
This is Mickey speaking.

1130
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,083
-Okay.
-I've got the money.

1131
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,666
Where do you want to meet?

1132
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,625
The same place?

1133
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:54,250
In 30 minutes?

1134
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,125
-Hello.
-Hello.

1135
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,583
Is that Noo? It's me, Tao.

1136
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,291
What's up, darling?

1137
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,583
Where are you now?

1138
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,583
I’m in front of my house,
about to drive in.

1139
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,250
-Has anyone seen you?
-Not yet. I just got here.

1140
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,166
-Pull the car out of there.
-Where to?

1141
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,208
Anywhere.

1142
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,125
I'll come see you.

1143
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,333
Really?

1144
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,166
Yes, I miss you already.

1145
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,958
Shall I wait at my friend's condo?

1146
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,333
Yes. Wait for me there.

1147
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,500
Don't go anywhere until I call you.

1148
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,250
Hey, where is my daughter?

1149
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,833
You can call her cell phone now.

1150
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:10,458
Do you know why your father died?

1151
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,583
Because he was a playboy.

1152
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:18,250
But you are going to die

1153
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,083
because of your trickiness.

1154
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,041
Whose phone is ringing?

1155
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:42,625
Is it yours?

1156
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:45,416
No. It's his.

1157
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,416
Why did you take his phone?

1158
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,291
Damn. Pick it up.

1159
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,333
-Hello.
-Tun.

1160
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,541
I've got your 3,000,000 baht.

1161
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:01,958
Sir,

1162
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,416
the caller said

1163
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,333
that he has the 3,000,000 baht.

1164
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,208
Give me that goddamn phone.

1165
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,291
-Hello.
-Who's talking?

1166
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:19,166
-I’m Chief Mhee.
-Where's my friend?

1167
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,791
He is about to die.

1168
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,833
Do you want to say some last words to him?

1169
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,541
Please don’t hurt him.

1170
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,500
I'm on my way to return your money.

1171
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:31,041
Are you?

1172
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:32,708
All right.

1173
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,666
I'll give you 20 minutes.

1174
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,541
Nok is here.

1175
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:05,958
Send her in.

1176
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,833
-Kae.
-Yes, Sir.

1177
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,250
Get her something to drink.

1178
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:33,875
Yes, sir.

1179
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:02,250
It looks like nobody's coming.

1180
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:06,041
Honey.

1181
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:07,916
Let's go.

1182
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:01,625
The amulet saved me.

1183
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:06,416
Oh, shit.

1184
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,833
Where do you think you’re going?

1185
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,333
I’m taking the money to your boss.

1186
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:16,791
You’re already hours late.

1187
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:18,708
He doesn’t want it anymore.

1188
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:20,500
What happened to my friend?

1189
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,458
Do you think you're cool?

1190
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,166
Son of a bitch.

1191
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:51,791
Fuck.

1192
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:06,250
Tell me now that you want to die.

1193
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,833
Tell me.

1194
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:12,375
Tell me, son of a bitch.

1195
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,291
Say it.

1196
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:26,750
What's the matter?

1197
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

1198
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,750
I really can't do it.

1199
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,916
Give me my 3,000,000 back, then.

1200
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,708
You saved my life.

1201
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:46,791
But I...

1202
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:00,916
Hey.

1203
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:07,000
Are you stealing my amulets?

1204
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,625
Are you still alive?

1205
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:12,916
I would have been dead
if I waited for you.

1206
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:18,625
How did you make it out alive?

1207
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,250
Please don't kill him.

1208
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:46,583
Suppose a woman

1209
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,458
sells herself as a sex slave for a year

1210
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:52,750
just to save a guy’s life,

1211
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,958
what would you do if you were him?

1212
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,041
What would I do?

1213
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:13,500
What?

1214
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:15,916
What's this?

1215
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,166
Three million baht.

1216
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:18,875
If I were him,

1217
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,958
I would use this 3,000,000 baht
to get her back.

1218
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,500
Where did you get this money from?

1219
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,541
ManU.

1220
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,166
Someone once said

1221
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:12,125
 that love only begins
when you have faith.

1222
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,125
And when there is faith,

1223
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:18,416
 there’s always a miracle.

1224
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:27,125
I'm sorry.

1225
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,291
I thought it was Nok's car.

1226
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:29,958
This car now belongs to Chief Mhee.

1227
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:31,291
What do you mean?

1228
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,875
I guess girls
aren't worth as much as cars.

1229
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,041
That's why he chose the car instead.

1230
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:46,916
Miracles don’t always happen
to people with faith.

1231
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,291
Because since that day,

1232
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:53,125
 Tun has never seen Nok again.

1233
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:02,333
LIGHTNING ROD KARAOKE

1234
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:07,166
We’re going to drink
And get drunk to eternity

1235
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,041
-No check, no chase, no end of me
-Earth.

1236
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,958
-What?
-Take your girlfriend home.

1237
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:14,916
I'm closing the store.

1238
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,083
Get up.

1239
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:21,250
His crying and babbling may sound annoying

1240
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:25,541
But nobody knows that

1241
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:28,791
My friend’s heart is breaking

1242
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:34,833
She’s way out of his league

1243
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:39,500
Hey.

1244
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,083
We're closing.

1245
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,833
What's wrong with you?
It's your friend's birthday today.

1246
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,291
He's my friend, not yours.

1247
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:51,333
You're drunk, so go away now.

1248
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:59,208
I told you to invest in something else.

1249
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:02,625
Krating.

1250
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:04,625
Where are you looking at?

1251
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:05,958
She’s my girlfriend.

1252
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:10,041
-Oh?
-He stares at me like this every day.

1253
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,041
Right. Why don’t you just get used to it?

1254
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,708
Stupid.

1255
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:18,958
Get out. I’m closing the place.

1256
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:22,666
What kind of owner
that drives his customers away?

1257
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:25,041
Look at Chang over there.

1258
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,750
I’ve quit singing.

1259
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,166
I know.

1260
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:53,875
Think of it as a birthday present from me.

1261
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:10,125
I’m right here waiting for you

1262
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:16,958
-Whenever she makes you so blue
-Happy birthday!

1263
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,250
Oh, oh

1264
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,750
Whenever I see your heart broken

1265
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:27,791
My heart is also drowning

1266
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,958
In pain

1267
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:37,125
-If her love is too mean
-If her love is too mean

1268
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:38,750
-And unkind
-And unkind

1269
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:40,666
-I’ll wipe your tears away
-I’ll wipe your tears away

1270
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:45,500
-Till they dry
-Tll they dry

1271
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:49,958
-Give me your bruised heart
-Give me your bruised heart

1272
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:56,250
-Let my true love heal it fast
-Let my true love heal it fast

1273
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,958
When two people love the same song,

1274
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,041
it shouldn’t be called "destiny."

1275
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:07,083
And as for the return of Nok,

1276
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,625
it shouldn’t also be called a miracle.

1277
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:12,541
Einstein once said 

1278
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,166
"There are no such things as miracles.

1279
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,708
Everything that happens 

1280
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,250
has its cause and effect.

1281
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,375
The repercussions of an action
that some races 

1282
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:24,791
and religions

1283
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:26,375
 call 

1284
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:27,625
"Karma."

1285
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:55,166
Why don’t we use real guns?

1286
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,083
That’s too merciful.

1287
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,750
These air guns would give him

1288
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,333
a slow and painful death.

1289
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:04,083
Are you all ready?

1290
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,166
-Yes.
-Yes.

1291
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:08,833
One hundred thousand baht to the first
person who cuts off Tao's finger.

1292
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:09,750
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1293
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:10,666
Charge!

1294
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:11,541
