1
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,500
Brother, there is a lot of stuff.
Should I sell what's left?

2
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,042
Song, that's inappropriate.

3
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:40,375
The townsfolk offer them to us for merit.

4
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,500
We shall donate the surplus

5
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:43,792
for good deeds.

6
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:44,957
In the next life

7
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,042
-your lips might be thinner.
-What?

8
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:50,917
I'd rather not be born again
just to listen to your nagging.

9
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
Brother!

10
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,082
Please come.

11
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,082
We can't take any more.
Should I row past him?

12
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,667
Nonsense, Song. I want to make merit.

13
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,792
-We can't, Song.
-Yes?

14
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,292
-Preventing merit-making is a sin.
-Is that so?

15
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,125
Okay, we'll stop here.
Help catch the boat.

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,250
Wow, Liang.

17
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:16,875
Are you drunk? You look dewy
like a ripe pineapple

18
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,667
that can't be carried by its stem.
You have to hold the whole thing.

19
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,917
-The current is strong, Brother.
-Are you drunk?

20
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,250
I was asleep last night.

21
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,875
Woke up and got drunk again.

22
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,207
Are you laughing or crying?

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,332
Brother is doing well?

24
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:38,957
I'm fine.

25
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,457
No.

26
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,917
I mean Brother Theng. Is he doing fine?

27
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,917
-Brother Theng went to Tibet.
-Tibet?

28
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,957
So far away!

29
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:52,207
And didn't even say goodbye.

30
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,582
Can the long-tail boat reach there?

31
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,542
Hey.

32
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:03,832
Liang.

33
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,250
Are you offering food
to the monk or the fish?

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,375
I miss Brother Theng.

35
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:18,582
That's enough.

36
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,917
I don't need much.

37
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,417
That's right.

38
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,125
-Many people gave alms to you.
-What?

39
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,000
All my life...

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,917
Doing good has given me nothing.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,417
-What now?
-Even my own wife.

42
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,707
She never appreciated me.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,375
Isn't that right, Brother?

44
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:46,375
That's enough, Liang.
Brother, let's go.

45
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,457
-Wait.
-What?

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,667
Girl, bring the fruits to offer the monk.

47
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,457
Yes, daddy.

48
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,750
-Like father, like daughter.
-Namhom coconuts are coming.

49
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,417
-Put them down, girl.
-Daughter taking after father is lucky.

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,332
Want some fruits, Brother?

51
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,125
To drink after your meal.

52
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,207
May you be blessed.

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,916
-Sadhu.
-Sadhu.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,666
Let's go, girl.
Giving coconuts as alms,

55
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,583
we'll be as beautiful in the next life
as we are now.

56
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,833
Yes, daddy.

57
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
Song!

58
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,583
Tangkwa.

59
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,125
How good is your English now?

60
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,333
Good enough to go
to England, Teacher.

61
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,500
-Very good.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,916
Brother Theng went on a pilgrimage.
Will you go as well, Brother?

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
I can't stay long.

64
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,000
There's temptation by evil.

65
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,166
I'm going to study religion.

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,083
Tangkwa, you study the secular world.

67
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,208
-Understand?
-Understood.

68
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,416
Wait a moment.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,583
Anyong haseyo.

70
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,416
Dongbangsin-gi.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's up, man?

72
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,708
I've told you many times,
this is not Wat Samian.

73
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,500
Wait, where are you going?

74
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:03,000
Joking. We're not going back.

75
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,791
Talk to a monk with respect.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,750
-Good morning, Venerable Uncle.
-Venerable Brother!

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,958
Sorry.

78
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,250
Hey, hey.

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,916
You see, today we...

80
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,375
have something to say to you.

81
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,041
Are you leaving the monkhood or not?
Said you'd be ordained for nine days.

82
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,500
But now it's been a year and nine months.

83
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,375
Is Brother getting senile?
A year and nine months or just nine days?

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,958
Are you leaving?
Are you leaving?

85
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,375
-Are you leaving?
-Enough.

86
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,750
This is a temple.

87
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,291
-What are you doing here?
-Our songs are finished.

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,291
I've prepared your clothes.

89
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,333
-The studio is booked.
-Songs are finished.

90
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,833
I took a shower and waited for you.

91
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,875
Brother Smart is calling too.

92
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,666
-Smart who?
-Smart-ass.

93
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,750
What's up, man?

94
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,125
Song is waiting for me.
Song, please start the car.

95
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,291
I'll give a sermon to my mother.

96
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes, Brother.

97
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,916
Bro, what's up with the car?

98
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,958
Full-on.

99
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,916
Acting like a kid.

100
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,666
You've been naughty
since you were a little boy.

101
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,250
Now you're a monk.

102
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,750
I taught you but you never listened.

103
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,750
Visiting your own mother,

104
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,958
why put on such dark makeup?

105
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,708
Mother.

106
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,333
I...

107
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,916
I who have nothing

108
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,458
You see?

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,625
Coughing again.

110
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,166
I... I will always love you

111
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,250
You're making fun of me.

112
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,833
I'm not. Don't you know that
back in the day

113
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,583
I sang with those...

114
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,333
old-school singers.
The Elvis of Thailand. Don't you know?

115
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,333
They didn't sing like you do now. Just...

116
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,375
Whatever.

117
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,833
They sang starting in a low voice
up to soprano, a very high note.

118
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:30,208
With one scream, the glass broke.
Think about that. Like me, for example.

119
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,916
I'll sing for you, okay?

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,292
Do re mi fa sol la si do

121
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,125
Mother.

122
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:55,832
Her voice is like a nightingale.
Why didn't Brother give a sermon?

123
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,750
I told you, mother.

124
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,042
Don't sing such high notes.

125
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:09,667
I apologize.
The former singer in me took control.

126
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,832
Do you want to hear some more?

127
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,417
It's all right, mother.

128
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,707
That's quite enough.

129
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,542
Oh, you.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,625
You're a monk.
You can't touch a woman.

131
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:27,667
It's forbidden.

132
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,792
It's okay, mother.

133
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,792
A mother is like the saint
of a household.

134
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm your son. I can wash or wipe you.
I think it's okay.

135
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,875
Sin or virtue,
it depends on intention.

136
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,832
Moreover, I came here today

137
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:50,792
because I don't know when will be
the next chance to take care of you.

138
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,042
Where are you going?

139
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:56,250
I'm going on a pilgrimage to find Dharma.

140
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:04,792
I rejoice in your merit.

141
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,332
I have something to give

142
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,082
for you to take with you
on your pilgrimage.

143
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,375
-Yes, mother.
-Wait a minute.

144
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,707
-This is a photo of you as a child.
-No matter what

145
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,875
I still love...

146
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:47,125
you

147
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,375
The woman is me.

148
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,582
And the man is your father.

149
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,625
Goodbye, madam.
I'll give Brother a ride.

150
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:39,832
Let's go, Brother.

151
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:57,207
I can't help but feel sad.
You're going too.

152
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,332
Makes me miss Brother Theng even more.

153
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:05,375
What's the point talking about him?
He went to a nice place.

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,125
-Brother Theng is dead?
-Not yet!

155
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,207
He went on a pilgrimage in Tibet

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,792
to find wisdom.

157
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,625
To find wisdom?

158
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:19,750
What for?

159
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:26,457
How far are you going to go
for your pilgrimage?

160
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:31,167
When you run out of gas,
I'll get out of the car.

161
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,417
So you can go home.

162
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,125
How am I supposed to?

163
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,667
Let bygones be bygones.

164
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,167
It doesn't matter when everything happens.
The sun rises

165
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,957
and falls in a cycle.
It's a lesson of life.

166
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,375
-Enjoy yourself, but look at the road.
-Yes.

167
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,125
You, you.

168
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,792
Song.

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,875
Hey, you!

170
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,042
Did you buy your license,
son of a bitch?

171
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,332
Brother, what are you doing there?

172
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:23,957
What are you afraid of?
We have a bunch of amulets.

173
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:25,917
I was just alarmed.

174
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,250
If I didn't hit the brake in time,
we'd be goners.

175
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,042
Brother, end of the road. We can't go on.

176
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:23,042
Let's go back.

177
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,875
I can't. I've made up my mind.

178
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:28,582
When we decide to do good,

179
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:30,582
the road will open up.

180
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,457
So you can stay here.

181
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,125
Then I'll say goodbye.

182
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,582
But Song...

183
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,457
Hey!

184
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:44,957
Song!

185
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:49,582
Song!

186
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:54,457
We're supposed to go back together.

187
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,750
You!

188
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,625
That's not appropriate for a monk.

189
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,457
It's okay to ask for alms,

190
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,125
but not okay to fly like a bird.

191
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,417
That is even worse.

192
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,250
Because I am a monk.

193
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,792
This is how a monk does it.

194
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,041
Good thing it was just an idea.
Didn't really happen.

195
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,916
My alms bowl.

196
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,375
Hey.

197
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,916
My bag.

198
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,541
My umbrella!

199
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,083
I'm a monk.

200
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,458
I've practiced Dharma.

201
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,833
This wind...

202
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,875
cannot stop me.

203
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,083
Earth, water,

204
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,958
wind and fire.

205
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,875
Go...

206
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,000
My alms bowl is gone,
my bag is gone.

207
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,083
My last...

208
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,166
umbrella.

209
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,458
Where the umbrella goes, I go with it.

210
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,500
The highest point is non-self.

211
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,916
Ouch.

212
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,416
It burns.

213
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,333
This must be a test

214
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,000
from the Lord Buddha.

215
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:47,958
You.

216
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,958
You.

217
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,458
Brother.

218
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,541
-I--
-There's a wedding.

219
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,666
The groom's procession
is going to another village.

220
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,375
-No, I mean I--
-A westerner has a wife here.

221
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,916
They're already married.
They brought some friends over to marry.

222
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,833
-I...
-They're Americans.

223
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,375
But we're Thai.

224
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,708
They get married. Many women here

225
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,666
-have married a westerner.
-Okay.

226
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,375
Wow, Brother.

227
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,375
Your robe is all torn.

228
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,458
It's not, it's in one piece.

229
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,708
Brother, you look so beaten up.

230
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:32,750
From the looks of it,
you're the final stage of monk.

231
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,000
You misunderstood something.
I'm a monk.

232
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,791
Not cancer.

233
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,166
Yes.

234
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,833
Why are you limping?

235
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,458
I got pricked by some thorns.

236
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,250
Usually the thorns here
don't prick anyone.

237
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,333
You must have stepped on it.

238
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:49,875
I have to go.

239
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,041
I'll see them get married to westerners.
Don't want to miss the beginning.

240
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,375
This must be a test

241
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,583
once again.

242
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,750
I'm going to have a foreign husband,
but I can't speak foreign yet.

243
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,083
What do you want to say?

244
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:22,250
I'm going to meet the groom, right?
I'm going to say to him,

245
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,791
Honey,

246
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,083
I'm so happy.

247
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,583
-How do I say that?
-It's not hard, Kamlah.

248
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,750
We have a great deal of experience.

249
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,416
Seriously, why do you want
to have a Thai wife?

250
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,666
-Thai women are... beautiful!
-Beautiful!

251
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,000
KOKSA-ARD TEMPLE
KOKSA-ARD KLIANG VILLAGE

252
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,500
KOKSA-ARD TEMPLE

253
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,291
What are you looking for?

254
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,125
If we both take one step back,

255
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
would it be embarrassing?

256
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,666
Not at all.

257
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,625
Hello, abbot.

258
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,333
Not abbot. I'm Somkiat.

259
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,625
You can call me Jiew.

260
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,958
-And who are you?
-A monk.

261
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,541
So you've been a monk for a long time.

262
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,458
You look so old.

263
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,958
I'm joking. You're looking for the abbot?

264
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,458
I came to get married today.

265
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,291
I'm very happy.

266
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,125
John, what does "I'm happy." mean?

267
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,750
Tell me about it.

268
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,208
Happy means delighted.

269
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,791
Delighted.

270
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,625
And what does "Oh, yes" mean?

271
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,250
-I want to know.
-"Oh, yes"

272
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,583
is used when climaxing.

273
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:02,541
My goodness.
What about the things we taught Kamlah?

274
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,041
May you be happy.

275
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,833
Oh, yes.

276
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,416
That's not it.

277
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,166
Oh, yes.

278
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,916
Calm down.
Just wait for the guests to leave.

279
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,958
Ouch.

280
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,791
Did that hurt?

281
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,250
It's all right. I hit that all the time.

282
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,791
The days I don't hit it, I can't sleep.

283
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,083
And the days you hit it?

284
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,250
Can't sleep even more.

285
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,791
It will hurt all over this side.

286
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:41,708
Screwdriver...

287
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,458
I've found it.

288
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,125
This is the taste of Dharma.

289
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,208
Please finish soon.

290
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,166
So I don't have to walk.

291
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,375
I'm asking you this seriously.

292
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,791
Are you really a monk?

293
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:15,583
Yes, sir. Here are my credentials.

294
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,333
I see.

295
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:32,333
How did you end up here?

296
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,083
I intended to go on a pilgrimage
to find the taste of Dharma.

297
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,166
But I found monks fixing a car.

298
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,791
Good. Usually...

299
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,458
we don't see young monks like you.

300
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,541
Not to mention, walking on a pilgrimage.

301
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,333
Scram!

302
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,833
I'll take this.

303
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,000
You step on me!

304
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,333
-Okay.
-Still stepping on me!

305
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,000
You said to step on you.

306
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,166
Which is it? Step on you or not?

307
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,416
I'll go to another jar.

308
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,416
This is the usual.

309
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,250
This is totally normal.

310
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:42,083
Don't be afraid. Just chill.

311
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,375
People offered them,
so we have to use them.

312
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,208
It's safer.

313
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,416
FLY TO FIND LOVE
KAMLA - TOM

314
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,041
Venerable Grandfather.

315
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,541
How are you? They're bombing again.

316
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,833
Man, where have you been?

317
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,333
I went to see a foreigner get married.

318
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,291
You know what's wrong with the monks?

319
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:44,458
I went away for a moment,
is there something wrong already?

320
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:06,458
-Who are you?
-In the temple, in the dead of the night,

321
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,000
it must be...

322
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,833
-a temple boy.
-You!

323
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:35,750
You don't have to shave.
Why do you have to shave?

324
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,375
It won't be sacred
if you don't shave, huh, Dom?

325
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,458
Will it clear your mind?

326
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:47,625
What if someone robs or kills anyone,

327
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,333
they'll be innocent if they shave?

328
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,000
A monk with long hair.

329
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,125
That's not a monk, that's Add Carabao.

330
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,833
This woman!

331
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,291
-Why?
-Why?

332
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,958
I'm just curious.
Why are you mad?

333
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,250
Shaven, why not wearing earrings?

334
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,791
This is a monk, not Nong Chachacha.

335
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,500
Not Nong Chachacha?

336
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,333
Nong is not a monk,
why did he shave?

337
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,375
I'm talking about monks,
why do you talk about Nong?

338
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,833
But you mentioned him first.

339
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,791
I said if you let a monk wear earrings,
he will be Ling Nong.

340
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,541
Nong is not a monk,
why did he shave?

341
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,625
-To look funny.
-Funny?

342
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,375
I should be laughing
at all the monks then.

343
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,500
Why laughing? They don't tell jokes.

344
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,625
Monks shave their heads.

345
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,125
-You don't know my father.
-Why?

346
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:35,041
If Venerable Father was a layman,
he would sky-kick you.

347
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,250
-You think I'm scared?
-You see?

348
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,750
Having a wife is a nuisance.
Venerable Brother, Father.

349
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,375
I shouldn't have married.

350
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,708
You're lucky to be monks. No wives.

351
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,875
Or do you have one?

352
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,458
-No.
-See?

353
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,750
-Monks don't have wives.
-Dom, are you crazy?

354
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,500
-Shut up and give alms.
-I won't until you answer me.

355
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:58,625
Are you making monks wait all day?
Their meal time will be up.

356
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:02,000
Monks from other temples
would have gone long ago.

357
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,500
But monks from this temple wait.

358
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,458
Huh...

359
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,208
Come on.

360
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,000
-Give alms
-I'm pissed off. I won't.

361
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,416
Whoever wants to give, give! I don't.

362
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:20,250
You prepare food and have the monks wait.
Now you won't give alms?

363
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,583
Do you want to win?

364
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,875
She's trying to win against me.

365
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,000
You don't give alms? Then I won't either.

366
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,541
I won't give alms now.
See if you still win.

367
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,166
Good luck.

368
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,041
Who's going to eat all this food?

369
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,000
-Seriously...
-We both eat it.

370
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,250
-I'm quiet now.
-What are we going to eat?

371
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,166
Wow, what a big fish.

372
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,958
Dokkaew, your father didn't come with you?

373
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,958
He's busy with work.

374
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,416
He told me to bring food to you.

375
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,958
Business is going well.

376
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,166
Lucky us, this meal.

377
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,541
What if the monks eat it all?

378
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,583
What's left for us to eat?

379
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,458
You little runt. How can you say that?

380
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,416
You say "If the monks eat it all,
will we be able to eat?"

381
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,833
Don't worry. Traditionally they will eat

382
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,166
just one side.
The other side must be ours.

383
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:38,041
Please don't flip.

384
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,541
Please don't flip.

385
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,833
Don't flip, don't flip.

386
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,541
It's flipped!

387
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,000
Your father's business.

388
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,125
It's such a breakthrough.

389
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,166
Breaking through.

390
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,875
Stone mill business.

391
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes, Joey.

392
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,791
Once it explodes,

393
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,625
the people are in trouble.

394
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,833
Our temple is also affected.

395
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,875
Look at the ceiling full of holes.
Almost no space for new holes.

396
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,583
It wasn't like this before.

397
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,041
The temple was beautiful and pleasant.

398
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,208
People liked to come here

399
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,000
and listen to Grandfather sing.

400
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:06,500
We've stopped but why don't you stop?
Angulimala said

401
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:12,750
That I made mistakes,
so I want to go back to virtue

402
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:19,375
And Dharma like the Lord Buddha taught.

403
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,000
Sadhu.

404
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,083
The reason Grandfather is not well

405
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,291
and coughing all day

406
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,458
is because of
the dust from the stone mill.

407
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,958
Nobody stood up to this?

408
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,291
Of course there were some.
The first disciple of his.

409
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,416
He had tattoos all over,
but was shot dead.

410
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:59,083
Praya Chatrathan

411
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:04,666
Doesn't bully
He breaks the ant nest

412
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:12,250
And give it to the red ants
The red ants bit him

413
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:19,041
He twists and falls down

414
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,791
Then rolls over

415
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,958
My voice is horrible now.

416
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:28,708
New monk, you try.

417
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,333
-When Praya red ant--
-Hey.

418
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,541
Red ants aren't here yet.

419
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,125
-Chatrathan.
-Again.

420
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:45,958
Praya Chatrathan doesn't bully

421
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,791
He breaks the ant nest

422
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,833
No, the coughing is mine alone.
Take a look...

423
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,791
Jiew, you try.

424
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:03,041
Praya Chatrathan

425
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,208
doesn't bully

426
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,833
-Oh.
-Sounds like steam from a rice cooker.

427
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:11,000
Like a car going up a high bridge.

428
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,541
Oh, the...

429
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,958
Dove

430
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,583
Bares its fangs

431
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:27,416
Shows its teeth

432
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:31,958
-What's so funny?
-What kind of dove

433
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,916
-shows its teeth?
-Birds have to coo.

434
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,208
-Right, cats show their teeth.
-Yes.

435
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:44,041
Oh, the kitty cat

436
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,833
Being a father, being a mother

437
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,333
Is so difficult
Have to pay karma

438
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,291
because of the poor babies

439
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:03,916
Take care all day

440
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,916
When baby cries, it breaks mother's heart

441
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,083
Oh, dear child

442
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,291
My dearest one

443
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,333
The baby cries

444
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,416
The mother soothes

445
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,416
Nipples have scars

446
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,041
The mother feeds milk

447
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:28,041
The baby plays with her nipples

448
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,041
The mother is suffering

449
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,083
The chest hurts so much

450
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:37,250
What the baby desires
The mother provides

451
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:42,375
Tears in the eyes
With blood in the bosom

452
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:46,250
Mother takes care of many children

453
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:52,541
No matter how poor, she's always near

454
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:56,875
No matter how difficult,
she never asks for anything

455
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,333
The benevolence of mother
that raises us

456
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:07,166
If it's a boy, the mother
wants him to be ordained

457
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,708
Study religion

458
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:18,416
Be grateful

459
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:23,250
To wear monk's robe as payment

460
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,750
If it's a girl

461
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,291
The mother will take care

462
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:32,791
so she can marry and have a nice family

463
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:36,291
Teach her female traditional values

464
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:40,250
The mother teaches with care

465
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,208
But the child usually doesn't care

466
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,875
They always forget their mom and dad

467
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:49,333
The mother can raise many children

468
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,625
But children get married
and don't take care of mother

469
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:57,750
Some sons have a former life's luck
With a rich wife and beautiful daughter

470
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,291
Bring the mother in to the home
to be bullied by daughter-in-law

471
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:09,958
Some girls have a former life's luck
With a rich husband

472
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:13,125
Use mother until she's exhausted

473
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:16,041
Bad children swear at the mother

474
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:21,708
Listen to the song about father and mother
If you like it, please praise us

475
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,500
Don't be arrogant

476
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:31,583
Just listen and chill
We don't criticize anyone

477
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,083
Sadhu.

478
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,458
Joey, try some.

479
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,791
Go for it. I'll be cheering for you.

480
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,458
Kliang, do you know why
the seat that monks sit on

481
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,583
is called the pulpit?

482
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,833
-I don't.
-You will.

483
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,166
He walked up to it normally.

484
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,750
Now he sits on it,
he tries to look elegant.

485
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,750
Listen.

486
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a condition
Not thuggery or instinct

487
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,625
Not annoyed, invaded, or come across

488
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,750
Haven't seen you for long
No organization or bureau

489
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,625
Whether young or old

490
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,125
Everyone can have flaky skin.

491
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,583
What does Dharma look like?
Are its parents Chinese or Thai?

492
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,625
Or Lao? Light or dark skin?
Hair short or long?

493
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,125
Short, tall, fat, slim
Some are barren, some are missing teeth

494
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,708
Some are a couple, but everyone
can listen to a sermon every day

495
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:10,916
Those who hit parents become hungry ghosts
If you like my sermon, put your hands up

496
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,708
I thought I was performing in a concert.

497
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:30,958
-Sorry about that.
-Sadhu.

498
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,708
Hey!

499
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,541
Not again.

500
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,666
What the hell? Again?

501
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,791
When is it going to be over?

502
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,250
Destroyed.

503
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,541
I'll be damned.

504
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,625
The new monk's singing was so cool.

505
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:42,500
That's right. He's very on-trend.

506
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:47,250
-What does "on-trend" mean?
-It means "on the trend," idiot.

507
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,125
Are you sure?

508
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:55,625
The last time,
you made me embarrass myself.

509
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,791
When the water poured down my hands,
I said, "Oh, yes".

510
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,958
In front of the whole village.

511
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,333
This time is no mistake.

512
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,583
My husband, John, bought
a book for me to translate.

513
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,125
Then can I ask for your help?

514
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,500
When I'm with my husband and...

515
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,333
I'm about to cum, what do I say?

516
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:25,041
That's easy. Let me check the book.

517
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,291
I got it.

518
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:35,000
Cumming is potato.

519
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,708
Potato.

520
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,791
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

521
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:47,166
-Let's play this.
-Play what?

522
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,791
Close your eyes and count to ten.

523
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:54,833
One, two, three, four, five, ten.

524
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,875
Where are you, sweetie?

525
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,208
Don't let me catch you.

526
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,208
Where are you?

527
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,833
Whose behind is this?

528
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,750
Don't know, don't care.

529
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:10,791
Are you taken?

530
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,708
-Don't know, don't care.
-Not taken then.

531
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,458
That means it's public.

532
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,041
I'll take it then.

533
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,291
Come in, hurry.

534
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,875
Follow Kamlah in.

535
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:28,083
Kamlah will let you eat the dog's bowl.

536
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,250
Come in.

537
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,375
From this moment,

538
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,625
Tom, you'll see my dog's bowl
fully with your own two eyes.

539
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,583
Where the hell is he?
Looking for him until dark.

540
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,875
My husband is gone
All I have is a lighter

541
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,833
I'm here.

542
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,291
You baldie. What are you doing here?

543
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,583
I was looking for you until now, you ass.

544
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:10,583
-Potato.
-Potato!

545
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:15,375
-Potato.
-Potato!

546
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,791
I don't know what to do.

547
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,250
I'm afraid to tell my dad.

548
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,125
When I see the villagers
trying to adapt, it hurts me.

549
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,958
It's partly my fault

550
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,958
that the village has to suffer this fate.

551
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,833
Don't think about it.

552
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:41,583
This is not your fault. Don't worry.

553
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,083
And what you do together
with the villagers

554
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,083
makes them see

555
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:51,333
-that you're different from your father.
-A different person.

556
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,541
Thank you so much.

557
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,458
I feel much more relieved.

558
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,250
Before I felt so guilty.

559
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,833
Brother, I brought guava for you.

560
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,208
We already ate.

561
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:11,208
Not the fruit, but the one with limbs.

562
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:14,250
I've never had one before.
Should be delicious.

563
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,541
Brother.

564
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,541
You're a monk. Please don't be so funny.

565
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:24,541
He's here.

566
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,708
He said he wanted to be
your disciple.

567
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:31,916
He's a foreigner. Is he a Buddhist?

568
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:35,166
No, Brother. I worship God.

569
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,625
But I saw what you did.

570
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:41,083
It made me want to study the system
of thought of Buddhism.

571
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,458
So I want to be your disciple.

572
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,333
Foreigner from which province?

573
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,625
Weird accent.

574
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,541
You can try. What's your name?

575
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,625
-Donny.
-Donny.

576
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,375
-Yes
-What about nicknames?

577
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:56,750
Debt.

578
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,958
He probably doesn't have
the money to go home.

579
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,833
Your name sounds so poor.

580
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,458
Is that so, Brother Ey?

581
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,291
Brother Joey.

582
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,583
Brother Ey.

583
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,375
Don't be so cheap with words.

584
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:19,083
-Call him Brother Joey.
-Bring him up.

585
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,166
Go up there.

586
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,375
Our stone mill never causes
problems for the people around.

587
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:29,583
People here are happy and chirpy.

588
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,666
Yes, because this place

589
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:35,458
is just like a town in a fog.

590
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:38,958
People used to go to
Rong Khun Temple.

591
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,500
I'm sure they'll come here
because this is

592
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,916
even whiter than Rong Khun Temple.

593
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,541
What's that?
I'm still using the same number.

594
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:52,375
Yes. 081-002-0227.

595
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:54,416
Okay.

596
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,375
I'm hanging up. Bye.

597
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,791
Goodbye.

598
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,041
Dokkaew.

599
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,750
Where have you been?

600
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,666
Temple, daddy.

601
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,333
That's good. People should go to temple.
Give to the needy.

602
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,500
Our family is full of kind people.

603
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:25,291
Daddy...

604
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:26,833
What is it, honey?

605
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,625
-Tell me, honey.
-It's nothing.

606
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,333
Dokkaew is being weird.

607
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,791
What's with those get-ups?

608
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,458
Who do you think you are?

609
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:48,791
Jack Sparrow? Rambo? Che Lives?

610
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:52,083
Che Lives, but you won't!

611
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,625
Dressed up so much
but you never get any work done.

612
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,166
You bastards.

613
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,416
I want to know

614
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,833
where you learned that kind of behavior.

615
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,666
Don't be so courteous.

616
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:23,125
Honey, your favorite is coming.

617
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,750
Chim, Tao's sweetheart.

618
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,916
Put it down gently.

619
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,958
Let me kiss your cheek.

620
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,750
How are you looking so good today?

621
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:36,541
Did you have botox?
You look so young and fresh.

622
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,375
Let me kiss your ears.

623
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:45,083
Tonight we will have so much fun.

624
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,916
I'm embarrassed.

625
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:54,625
Chim is a sadist.
She's my mom's friend.

626
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:58,000
My mom said to take care of her
before she dies. So I can't leave her.

627
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,916
Hey, Tao.

628
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,250
Everyone knows that your wife

629
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:08,416
-is the millionaire of this village.
-Sure.

630
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,833
In a few days, your wife will die.

631
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:16,666
And when the time comes,

632
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,666
this ragged Tao

633
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,708
will become Papa Tao.

634
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,166
Sure thing.

635
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,916
I'm going to be Papa Tao.

636
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,541
She'll die in a few days.

637
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,083
Forget dead, she never coughs once.

638
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,583
-It's true.
-Don't lie to me.

639
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,416
-I don't lie.
-Seriously?

640
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:38,458
-She never catches cold.
-Yes?

641
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,166
From the first moment
I lived with her,

642
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,125
she sneezed like three times.
The first time though,

643
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,250
she sneezed and I woke up.

644
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,541
I thought it was White Cricket.
Her hair was so white.

645
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,791
And the second time...

646
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,333
-Dead for sure.
-Dead.

647
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,625
And the third time...

648
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,500
Just "ha", not a complete sneeze.

649
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,375
-What the hell?
-And strong to this day.

650
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:05,541
But in the nighttime, my Chim

651
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:08,416
is so sexy. She likes to make
her mouth like this.

652
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,958
Chim, don't be sad.

653
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,333
You're still young and beautiful.

654
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,875
I'll find you a new hubby.

655
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:41,000
-How about ten of them?
-Don't be stupid, Pancake.

656
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,875
I don't even have the energy to fart.

657
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,125
Grandfather.

658
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:53,833
You stepped on my foot.

659
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:58,083
I'm going to kick you good.
This is not the time to play.

660
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:02,166
Put it on correctly.

661
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,541
Are you gonna walk backwards?

662
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,625
-My feet are not in harmony.
-You runt.

663
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,375
-My head.
-Move.

664
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:21,500
Vengeful. S.S. shot dead
in a car full of holes.

665
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,958
-Senator
-Not S.S.?

666
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,041
People nowadays are so ruthless.

667
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,958
Killing each other like this.

668
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:30,875
That's right.

669
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,666
They can talk but they won't.
They kill instead.

670
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:38,625
They don't have moral values.

671
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,750
They should be ashamed.
Worse than animals.

672
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,875
I saw a mother dog
letting baby monkeys feed from her.

673
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,166
Humans should be ashamed.

674
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:53,416
Have you ever seen a baby lion?

675
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,500
-No.
-Me neither.

676
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,541
Hey.

677
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,666
Hey.

678
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,750
Venerable Father!

679
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,458
What are you doing? The dust fell on us.

680
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,541
Monk's duty.

681
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:09,125
What are you doing?

682
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,333
Reading newspaper.

683
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,500
The same car.

684
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,041
Different one.
This one doesn't have holes.

685
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,000
Red plates too.

686
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:40,791
Which one is Venerable Father?

687
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,625
It is I. What business do you have here?

688
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,791
Hello, Father.

689
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:51,208
-Bless you.
-I just got a new car.

690
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:54,500
Red plates, second-hand.
Only 700-something miles.

691
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,708
Cash. Too lazy to do the installments.

692
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,458
I want you to anoint it,

693
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,541
for good luck.

694
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,416
Is this the principal Buddha image

695
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:15,125
that people build together
and put in the temple?

696
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,875
You must be anointed.

697
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:35,000
Because you're the driver.
Not that the car drives you.

698
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:38,541
And don't wash it off now.

699
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,333
Keep it for a week.

700
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,041
I won't sleep on my side again.

701
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,375
I'll lie on my back for seven days.

702
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,583
People are so gullible.

703
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:53,875
Everyone has their car anointed.
I will shower up to the shoulders only.

704
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,833
Bless you.

705
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:04,583
By the way,

706
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,833
don't forget the five goods.

707
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:13,708
Think good, do good, speak good,
have good friends,

708
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:18,166
and be in good places. Remember that.

709
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,208
Bless you.

710
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,333
What the hell?

711
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,541
So many cousins.

712
00:57:57,125 --> 00:58:00,041
Full-on.

713
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:03,958
What?

714
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,416
I'll bring Brother to meet Father.

715
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:10,250
He's lived in this village
since the end of last year.

716
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,375
Always helps with development.

717
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,333
He teaches kids to study.

718
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:19,375
If you guys put the effort in together,
you could make a great thing.

719
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,250
Many great things.

720
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,041
Father.
I'd like you to meet Brother Joey.

721
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,458
-Hello
-What's up?

722
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:27,916
Brother, welcome to the village.

723
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:30,958
-Bless you.
-I hope we can work together

724
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,291
and teach the people
of this good village

725
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,833
good values and
from the book of the God.

726
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:38,833
Should be very good experience
for us together.

727
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,375
Yeah, very good.

728
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Every religion teaches people to be good.

729
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,958
Mom, help!

730
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,750
Mommy, help!

731
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,000
Mommy, help me.

732
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,958
Come this way.

733
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,958
-Go in.
-Go in.

734
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,125
Let's go in. Hurry!

735
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,583
Everyone go inside!

736
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:34,708
Hurry up.

737
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,541
Just go inside.

738
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,416
Hurry up.

739
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:09,416
This rock destroyed my house.

740
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,916
You promised that
you'd activate the signal.

741
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,583
Where is the signal, you son of a bitch?

742
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:20,916
I'll throw this rock
at your father's head.

743
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,666
Bastard!

744
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,041
Bastard.

745
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:34,958
You'll pay!

746
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,291
I can't stand it anymore.

747
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:54,375
Wait, Brother Joey.
Trust me, don't do this.

748
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,333
Grandfather wouldn't allow it.

749
01:00:56,958 --> 01:01:00,041
Grandfather wouldn't allow us
to stand up against the stone mill

750
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,583
because he was afraid of loss.
But for us to just do nothing,

751
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,041
I really can't stand it.

752
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,958
I have to at least teach the people
how to cope

753
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,500
-with a life full of dust.
-What are you talking about?

754
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:14,791
Grandfather.

755
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:22,208
Anyone who wants to do anything,
don't do it disgracefully

756
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:25,166
or hastily, understand?

757
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,291
Or else you'll be like my disciple.

758
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,708
The first one.

759
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,416
If he were still alive

760
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,500
he would be the same age as you, Joey.

761
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,791
And from now on,

762
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,500
I don't want

763
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,916
the same thing happen to anyone again.

764
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,958
-Do you understand?
-Don't worry.

765
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,666
I have people who are ready to help.

766
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,750
Brother, how will you do this?

767
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,083
I've prepared the plan.

768
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:01,333
To live here, you have to adapt.

769
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,583
If dust is the problem,

770
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,750
the solution is
to be able to live with it.

771
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,416
I can't stand it.

772
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,458
What about this rock?

773
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,291
Our skulls will crack open one day.

774
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,208
Don't worry about this rock.

775
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,875
We'll see the authority
that's responsible.

776
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:26,041
-Dad, you have to be careful.
-I'm always careful.

777
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,041
Bless everyone. Today...

778
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,750
Father and Venerable Grandfather
and Imam invited you here

779
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:37,958
to study the use of natural water filters.

780
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:41,333
Start with rocks
that you can see everywhere.

781
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,125
Put them in here and...

782
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,541
Hello.

783
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,583
Mister Nankij? Yes, it's me.

784
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,250
Mississippi. Yes, the same one.

785
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:47,666
I'd like gunmen.

786
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,250
Very skillful, like one-shot kill.

787
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,000
Not like those three dumb shits.
They can't finish any job.

788
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:56,958
Please dress like people in the village,

789
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:59,041
so that they fit in.

790
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,500
Help!

791
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,208
What happened?

792
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,541
Put in a bunch of dynamite in.

793
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,833
Make everything gone in one bang,

794
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,500
so we don't have to do it many times.

795
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:24,208
It's done. One-shot kill.

796
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,958
There was a flash and then he fell.

797
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:32,250
Excellent! This is how I like it.

798
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,083
But the way you dress

799
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,041
is as bad as those three dumb shits.

800
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,833
What a miracle.

801
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,791
There's a hole in the alms bowl,

802
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,166
but Brother Joey is fine.

803
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,583
This is the same story

804
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:10,375
as with Grandfather's first disciple.

805
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,833
I told you many times

806
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:20,125
but nobody listened.

807
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:25,708
I said don't bother with them.

808
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,708
But why? You misheard me?

809
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,416
Why didn't you do as I said?

810
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:40,958
Let's go.

811
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:51,291
How did you end up here?
Is it not difficult?

812
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,250
As long as we have Dharma
in our hearts,

813
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,250
it's not difficult anywhere.

814
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,625
Dharma is nature

815
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,833
that clears our minds.

816
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:10,125
And some people

817
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,291
who live in civilized places,

818
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,500
their minds are not as civilized.
That's not good.

819
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,375
Did you have a family before?

820
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:27,082
Yes, I did.

821
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:29,457
But then...

822
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:33,000
when we saw things
we used to dream of,

823
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,792
it became a light

824
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:41,332
that made me decide to give something up

825
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:43,250
and come live here.

826
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:03,332
Brother!

827
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:05,332
Brother.

828
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:09,457
Brother! Grandfather's coughing blood.

829
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,582
Prepare the car.

830
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:18,082
-Hurry.
-Hurry up.

831
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:20,375
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

832
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,500
Hurry up!

833
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,542
Wait up!

834
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:30,542
Hey!

835
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:32,792
Hey!

836
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:35,917
Wait!

837
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:45,582
Stay strong, Grandfather.
We're almost there.

838
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:49,625
Stay strong.

839
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:50,707
Wait.

840
01:09:51,457 --> 01:09:53,332
Just a little bit further.

841
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,457
What's with all this, Lord Buddha?

842
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,625
What's wrong with the monks
in this temple?

843
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,542
Grandfather.

844
01:10:32,082 --> 01:10:33,000
Just a bit further.

845
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:38,292
-Let's go heal at the temple.
-Let's go forward.

846
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,875
Just a bit.

847
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:47,917
Let go with your hand.

848
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,500
PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER

849
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,542
-Hurry!
-Hurry up!

850
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:12,125
-Hurry!
-Quick, quick.

851
01:11:12,207 --> 01:11:14,125
-Grandfather.
-Hurry!

852
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,417
-Quick.
-Why didn't you help?

853
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:20,000
Letting Brother carry Grandfather alone.

854
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:23,250
Why did you open the back?
Grandfather is already on the ground.

855
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,625
-Close it up.
-Help, hurry!

856
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:28,042
Hurry up!

857
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,832
Come inside.

858
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,292
Please go to the room.

859
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,707
Brother, please wait outside.
You can't be inside.

860
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:47,332
A little later
and Grandfather wouldn't make it.

861
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,792
A little faster and I wouldn't make it.

862
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,707
You can't be here.

863
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,500
Is it full?

864
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,375
You let Grandfather cough
until his throat is sore?

865
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,207
They won't let us in.

866
01:12:05,332 --> 01:12:07,707
Good thing we had the car.

867
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:10,042
If not, we would have had to carry him.

868
01:12:11,042 --> 01:12:12,707
Good thing I fixed it.

869
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:13,917
Doctor.

870
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,625
Mr. Jumlong passed away.

871
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:19,332
Jumlong!

872
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,875
-Miss Woranuch.
-Yes?

873
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,082
-Take the deceased to the morgue.
-We're about to get engaged.

874
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:26,957
Don't be so sad.

875
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,917
-We're the same.
-Jumlong!

876
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,750
Don't be sad.

877
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:34,707
Jumlong, don't leave me.

878
01:12:34,832 --> 01:12:37,417
-We're to be engaged in a few days.
-Make way.

879
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,250
-Jumlong!
-Jumlong.

880
01:12:39,332 --> 01:12:40,917
Why did you leave me?

881
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,542
-Jumlong is dead?
-Jumlong is dead.

882
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:46,292
Ever since he was born, he just died

883
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:47,792
-for the first time.
-Brother.

884
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:49,832
Grandfather needs the respirator.

885
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,500
-Move him to that bed.
-Okay.

886
01:12:55,332 --> 01:12:56,542
Let's go.

887
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:59,375
Doc, but the guy just died.

888
01:12:59,457 --> 01:13:01,875
-It's okay, they always die on this bed.
-Hey.

889
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:06,167
-Is it a good idea?
-Birth, old age, sickness, and death.

890
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:07,667
It's normal.

891
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:11,125
-What are you talking about?
-Brother, I can't hold on.

892
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:15,125
Brother, hold him.

893
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:20,375
Put him in position.

894
01:13:21,582 --> 01:13:24,792
Please open your mouth.

895
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:27,667
You need the respirator.

896
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,332
Let me check the machine for a bit.

897
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:35,000
Please let go of it.

898
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:39,542
Grandfather, please let it go.

899
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,707
Please let go.

900
01:13:43,582 --> 01:13:46,582
Sorry, my hand slipped.

901
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:49,417
It's okay now. Please breathe.

902
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:53,957
-Dust from the explosion...
-Do you have Grandfather's

903
01:13:54,082 --> 01:13:55,792
credentials or documents?

904
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,000
Wait until everyone dies?

905
01:13:58,457 --> 01:14:00,417
Brother, Grandfather's credentials.

906
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,042
When will there be a brave man

907
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,750
who goes against that stone mill?

908
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:49,667
Brother.

909
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:54,750
I'm a nice man.

910
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,417
I like to help good people.

911
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,707
If I have to be a bad man,

912
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,542
it's to fight bad people.

913
01:15:09,082 --> 01:15:11,917
Put more dynamite in,
make it a big bang.

914
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:15,667
Make the whole mountain go up
so we don't have to do it many times.

915
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:17,375
Let's go.

916
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,750
What is it?

917
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:31,957
Do it again. I won't pay you for this.

918
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:02,457
Boss, I want to ask for alms.

919
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,957
Can you please stop bombing?

920
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:07,875
I have instructions.
I'd have to ask Luang.

921
01:16:08,582 --> 01:16:11,207
The dynamite's almost expired.

922
01:16:11,457 --> 01:16:13,250
And I cannot

923
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,082
move the mountain to
be exploded elsewhere.

924
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:17,582
I think you all

925
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:20,875
should move away from here.
It's easier.

926
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,167
I say this not out of my selfishness,

927
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:27,292
but because the temple and village

928
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,917
were here a long time
before my stone mill opened.

929
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,500
And just like that,
now you should move.

930
01:17:20,832 --> 01:17:24,457
It's a good thing I was ordained
in a Thai temple.

931
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,332
Saying it like that,

932
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:32,167
-you'd blow me up as well.
-You said it yourself.

933
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:35,750
Fine. Encountering an immoral being,

934
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,625
I'm prepared to die.

935
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,082
Everyone was born to die one day.

936
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:43,457
Live here any longer, you'll die anyway.
Let's die today.

937
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:44,792
Let's get it over with.

938
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:47,625
You said it yourself.
If you don't leave,

939
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,750
I'll blow it up now.

940
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:57,167
Father, please stop.
We have a lot of money.

941
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,542
Stop causing people problems.

942
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,000
How could you say that?

943
01:18:01,082 --> 01:18:04,000
The money we have today
is because we blow up the stones.

944
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:05,832
Without it, how will we live?

945
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:09,375
If you're going to blow it up,
you blow me up too.

946
01:18:09,582 --> 01:18:12,042
My goodness!

947
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,875
Dokkaew, you're acting
as if you're my mother.

948
01:18:16,582 --> 01:18:17,957
Like mother, like daughter.

949
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:22,625
Where are you going?

950
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:25,207
Brother.

951
01:18:28,832 --> 01:18:32,792
What are we standing here for?

952
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,875
I don't want to live anymore.

953
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,207
Hey.

954
01:18:38,457 --> 01:18:39,542
Don't go in.

955
01:18:41,082 --> 01:18:44,167
It's dangerous. Come out.

956
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:46,957
Dokkaew, why are you there with them?
Come out now!

957
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,167
I said come out. It's dangerous.

958
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:53,207
If it blows,
your head and limbs will be everywhere.

959
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,042
You'll be in many pieces.
It's not pretty. Please come out.

960
01:18:57,542 --> 01:19:00,625
If you don't believe me,
I'll order them to push the button.

961
01:19:03,832 --> 01:19:06,917
I'll really tell them to push the button!

962
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,582
Are you challenging me?

963
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,332
If you don't come out,
I will order them to push the button!

964
01:19:16,582 --> 01:19:19,292
Did you hear? He said to push the button.

965
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,332
How?

966
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:22,875
This is how.

967
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:31,207
Why did you do that?
He said five!

968
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:32,917
I don't know. I already pushed it.

969
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:54,875
-Please come.
-Don't have to. I'm free.

970
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,417
Dokkaew, where are you?

971
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,750
Buddha, help me!

972
01:20:11,832 --> 01:20:13,167
-You.
-Help!

973
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,000
Completely fine.

974
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:51,292
Such a big rock.

975
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,292
He's fine.

976
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:58,832
Hey.

977
01:20:59,457 --> 01:21:04,207
-Brother is fine.
-How come?

978
01:21:05,082 --> 01:21:06,667
Brother is totally fine.

979
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,582
He must have good amulets.

980
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:13,082
Brother.

981
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,957
Just as I shouted, Buddha, help me!

982
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,957
Hey, guys.

983
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:25,582
Hey.

984
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,042
Brother is really almighty.

985
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:31,082
-That's right.
-He can break rocks.

986
01:21:31,332 --> 01:21:34,042
That's right, he's fine.

987
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,250
I didn't do anything.

988
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:42,125
I was shocked so I froze.

989
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,625
If the rock didn't break,

990
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:49,832
I'd be dead meat.

991
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,082
No, it must be a miracle.

992
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:56,250
That's superb. Totally amazing.

993
01:22:08,582 --> 01:22:12,207
Arrest them, they're the culprits.

994
01:22:12,832 --> 01:22:14,332
Arrest them.

995
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:16,500
There they are.

996
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:18,000
-Police!
-This is the police. Freeze!

997
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,125
Wait.

998
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,250
Boss.

999
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:24,707
You're an offender in a contracted
murder case. Take him to the station.

1000
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:43,375
You're evil.

1001
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:09,082
The fishes are super fresh.

1002
01:23:09,792 --> 01:23:15,167
BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE BECAUSE
OF OUR UNITED PROJECT

1003
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,957
I think it'd be good
if we have a big school.

1004
01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:28,750
-I think so.
-Our children don't have to travel far.

1005
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:29,792
They can study here.

1006
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:33,625
-Different religions studying together?
-Of course, no problem.

1007
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,832
Everybody, today is a ceremony
at our temple.

1008
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:41,000
Please come together
for the prosperity of the temple.

1009
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:44,250
Please help.

1010
01:23:44,332 --> 01:23:46,917
The women help check things.

1011
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,125
Our village has so many stories...

1012
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:00,207
Take all the shells off.

1013
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:03,542
Do well and I'll teach you English.

1014
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:06,582
Tan, I speak English fluently now.

1015
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,125
Pig is pig.

1016
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:10,582
You know?

1017
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:16,207
Hey. Monk is called monk

1018
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,332
MOBILE DHARMA

1019
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:22,000
Thanks to Yong's chili paste
which didn't help at all.

1020
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,457
Bought it to eat.

1021
01:24:23,582 --> 01:24:25,332
Mobile Dharma.

1022
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:27,250
it became Red-Eye chili paste.

1023
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,207
Where to stick "Dharma Car"?

1024
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:33,292
In front, so people know
it's a monk's car.

1025
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,082
Come together...

1026
01:24:35,207 --> 01:24:38,582
This is "Dharma Car," not monk's car

1027
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:39,957
You talk too much.

1028
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,832
Come here...

1029
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,667
I invite everyone.

1030
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:49,292
Please come.

1031
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,792
Who wants to help our temple?

1032
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:55,082
They say the temple will be good.

1033
01:24:55,582 --> 01:24:57,667
Good morning, Father.

1034
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,167
Full of faith.

1035
01:24:59,457 --> 01:25:02,917
Ever since I met you,
I became so rich.

1036
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,000
Yasothon Rocket Festival.

1037
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,957
I was the only provider.

1038
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:10,625
If you light my rockets,

1039
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,707
three days and they will
still be up there!

1040
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,542
I don't know if they interrupt the angels.

1041
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:20,375
I also bring my wife and kid.
Please anoint my wife all over.

1042
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,667
-Bless you.
-Trust me.

1043
01:25:21,832 --> 01:25:24,375
-I'll light it for you.
-You don't have to.

1044
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,707
Count them out, Grandfather.

1045
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:29,750
Brother, believe me.

1046
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,500
My rockets are top-notch.

1047
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,792
I'll take some with me to light.

1048
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,417
When it goes up, three days,

1049
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:43,582
it will still be in the sky.

1050
01:25:43,832 --> 01:25:47,292
Make it like a big festival.
I'll take my wife and kid

1051
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,582
for Grandfather to anoint.

1052
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:51,707
So happy. Grandfather is so fast.

1053
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,917
Grandfather.

1054
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:33,000
After this ceremony,

1055
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,375
may I visit my mother?

1056
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:47,500
Father,

1057
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:49,125
do you want to come with me?

1058
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:32,707
You see...

1059
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,082
You see...

1060
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,792
From now on, for 120 minutes,

1061
01:27:50,457 --> 01:27:53,250
you'll see a fantastic spectacle.

1062
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:58,542
Your village and temple
will prosper forever.

1063
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,500
Isn't that high?

1064
01:28:19,832 --> 01:28:21,332
Will it come down in three days?

1065
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:34,375
Scram!

1066
01:28:41,332 --> 01:28:43,125
Full-on.

1067
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,082
-Brother.
-Grandfather.

1068
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:03,707
Grandfather.

1069
01:29:06,082 --> 01:29:07,457
Are my eyes okay?

1070
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:14,957
Grandfather can cough now.

1071
01:29:23,582 --> 01:29:25,375
May your life be full of laughter.

1072
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,792
May everyone be rich.

1073
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,875
What's under the turtle?

1074
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,750
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

1075
01:29:35,832 --> 01:29:36,832
Flip it to see.

1076
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,957
Please flip it back to prank the next one.

1077
01:29:51,207 --> 01:29:54,125
Song, we have a problem.

1078
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:57,792
Song, is that turtle
going to be all right?

1079
01:29:57,957 --> 01:29:59,957
We shouldn't be worried about the turtle.

1080
01:30:00,042 --> 01:30:02,332
Worry who's going to be next!

1081
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,957
What's under the turtle?

1082
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:10,250
If you want to know, then find out.

1083
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:11,707
Okay, Ma.

1084
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,000
Brother Somkiat.

1085
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:19,250
What's wrong with the jar?

1086
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,332
It broke.

1087
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:26,457
The car broke down, no brake.

1088
01:30:27,542 --> 01:30:28,417
I'll check.

1089
01:30:30,332 --> 01:30:34,500
You said no brake.
I see the brake here.

1090
01:30:35,292 --> 01:30:38,500
I guess it came back.
But it likes to go away.

1091
01:30:39,207 --> 01:30:43,167
Brother, if this pole had some basil,
it'd be so delicious.

1092
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,625
The pole is not food!

1093
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:53,042
Mother...

1094
01:30:53,332 --> 01:30:54,957
That's enough.

1095
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,667
Your mother won't come here again.

1096
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:01,332
Praya Chatrathan

1097
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:04,250
It's like a plane taking off.

1098
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,792
Praya... is that right?

1099
01:31:05,957 --> 01:31:10,082
Praya Chatrathan doesn't bully

1100
01:31:10,207 --> 01:31:13,582
Break the ant nest to give...

1101
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:15,750
Like the plane landing, right?

1102
01:31:15,832 --> 01:31:18,500
-Sure, go ahead
-No, no.

1103
01:31:36,082 --> 01:31:38,207
-Okay.
-Okay.

1104
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,832
-Yes.
-Teach him some.

1105
01:31:41,957 --> 01:31:43,417
-Have...
-Have...

1106
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,125
-Patience.
-Patience.

1107
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,750
-Say it.
-Patience Have.

1108
01:31:49,957 --> 01:31:52,000
If you want to take a stab at lottery,

1109
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:55,167
why don't you start with yourself?

1110
01:31:57,707 --> 01:32:00,957
With myself. Brother.

1111
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:03,582
Kamlah doesn't dare.

1112
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:07,750
-Then try with your husband.
-Is that so?

1113
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:10,875
-Hey.
-Hey.

1114
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,042
What?

1115
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:17,167
Take a stab at the lottery with
your husband, not stab your husband!

1116
01:32:17,457 --> 01:32:19,792
-Help him.
-I'll be damned.

1117
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:23,082
-A foreigner was stabbed.
-Oh.

1118
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:25,292
