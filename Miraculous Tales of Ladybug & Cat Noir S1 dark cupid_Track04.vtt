&lrm;the prince breaks the spell

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.580
&lrm;Who can tell us why?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.460
&lrm;Because only love can conquer hate.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.900
&lrm;[Mrs. Bustier] Correct.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.180
&lrm;Technically,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.980
&lrm;[Max continues]
&lrm;this is only true in 87% of cases.

&lrm;Thank you, Max.

&lrm;The prince breaks the spell by
&lrm;kissing the princess

&lrm;I'll meet you outside.

&lrm;OK.

&lrm;[she chuckles]

&lrm;Hi, Adrien. Sign here, please.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.100
&lrm;You know I hate signing autographs.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.980
&lrm;That's not what this is.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380
&lrm;It's a petition
&lrm;against cruelty to hamsters.

&lrm;Have you seen the sweaters

&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580
&lrm;Well, well, Marinette,
&lrm;looking for something to eat?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740
&lrm;Maybe she's looking
&lrm;for better clothes.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.940
&lrm;[they giggle]

&lrm;[she growls]

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.980
&lrm;Ignore them.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.580
&lrm;They're not worth it.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.940
&lrm;You're right.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.540
&lrm;"Your hair is dark as night,
&lrm;Your pretty bluebell eyes.

&lrm;I wonder who you are
&lrm;Beneath that strong disguise.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.180
&lrm;Every day we see each other,
&lrm;I hope that you'll be mine.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.020
&lrm;Together our love could be so true,
&lrm;Please be my Valentine."

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.060
&lrm;Wow, now that's a love poem.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.740
&lrm;Who could it be to?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.020
&lrm;"Hair dark as night",
&lrm;"Bluebell eyes"?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.300
&lrm;Well... you.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.140
&lrm;[giggling]
&lrm;No way.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.020
&lrm;There are plenty of girls at school
&lrm;with dark hair and blue eyes.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.660
&lrm;Yes, but bluebell eyes?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.860
&lrm;What does he mean by "strong disguise"?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.140
&lrm;[Tikki sighs]

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.380
&lrm;This is poetry.
&lrm;He means who you are deep down.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.540
&lrm;He wants to get to know you.
&lrm;He's talking about you.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.460
&lrm;[she squeals with delight]
&lrm;Pinch me.

&lrm;is commencing.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.780
&lrm;According to my research
&lrm;of shopping sites,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.900
&lrm;this jewel was ranked
&lrm;highest in popularity.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.180
&lrm;Perfect. I'll hit a homerun
&lrm;with this one.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.660
&lrm;Love is like baseball, right?
&lrm;You need a strategy.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.700
&lrm;And if you aim right,
&lrm;it's a homerun.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.940
&lrm;-Great metaphor, Kim.
&lrm;-Meta who?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.220
&lrm;Wow, sparkly. Is that for me?

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.940
&lrm;No, Alya,
&lrm;it's for someone else, it's...

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.940
&lrm;Shh! Keep quiet.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.140
&lrm;Scoop! Kim's got a crush.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.020
&lrm;Who's the lucky lady?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.420
&lrm;It's gorgeous, Kim. She'll be ecstatic.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.940
&lrm;She's still gotta accept it.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.260
&lrm;-What if she says no?
&lrm;-She won't.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.380
&lrm;No way, don't hold back.
&lrm;Go for it. No regrets!

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.100
&lrm;Operation Valentine's Day
&lrm;is underway.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.700
&lrm;Her route is in yellow, yours is in red.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.900
&lrm;If you run at 10mph,
&lrm;you'll have a 4-minute lead on her.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.020
&lrm;Wait here. It's the 3rd
&lrm;most romantic spot in Paris.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.820
&lrm;-Go, go!
&lrm;-Thanks, guys.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.900
&lrm;I know someone who's good
&lrm;at giving advice,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.660
&lrm;but who can't take any.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.020
&lrm;Let's go.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.500
&lrm;You're right. It's time I told him.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.900
&lrm;Say what?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.860
&lrm;I'm gonna tell him my true feelings.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.740
&lrm;Well, I'll write them,
&lrm;on a card.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.500
&lrm;Yeah.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.980
&lrm;Yeah.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.100

&lrm;Wow, he's so cute.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.260
&lrm;Keep dreaming, girls,
&lrm;but the boy is mine.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060

&lrm;I'm no good at this
&lrm;love-letter writing thing.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.060
&lrm;I sound like a dorkasaurus.

&lrm;[she whines]

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
&lrm;Only when you say
&lrm;words like "dorkasaurus".

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.500
&lrm;Relax, Marinette, I'm teasing.
&lrm;Think of Adrien

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.020
&lrm;and speak from the heart.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.620

&lrm;Adrien's letter.

&lrm;Why didn't I think of that before?
&lrm;I'll answer his poem.

&lrm;[Alya] Marinette?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.900
&lrm;Check... it... out!

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.860
&lrm;It's perfect.

&lrm;Don't forget to sign it.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.820
&lrm;[Alya] It's a good omen.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.740
&lrm;Ladybugs are good luck,
&lrm;especially in the love department.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.020
&lrm;Really?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.260
&lrm;Yeah, you of all people
&lrm;should know about ladybugs.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.900
&lrm;Wh-Why do you say that?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.220
&lrm;"The ladybug is a symbol of love,

&lrm;It's on my blog. Didn't you read it?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.180
&lrm;Yes, of course.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.060
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.500
&lrm;[Plagg]
&lrm;So, she's got eyes, arms, legs...

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.540
&lrm;Big deal.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.620
&lrm;How can you be in love with Ladybug?
&lrm;You don't even know who she is.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.980
&lrm;You know nothing about love.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.260
&lrm;Sure I do. I love cheddar, Swiss...

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.340
&lrm;and I love camembert.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.060
&lrm;[he sighs]

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.580
&lrm;The poor boy's frustrated

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.340
&lrm;because he can't finish the poem
&lrm;for his masked sweetheart.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.340
&lrm;I don't need a poem.
&lrm;I can tell her to her face.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.580
&lrm;I love you.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.380
&lrm;[disgusted]
&lrm;That's gross.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.860
&lrm;You're making me lose my appetite.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.980
&lrm;[munching]
&lrm;Almost.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.500
&lrm;[Chloe] That's right,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.940
&lrm;in a 24-carat frame.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.300
&lrm;Deliver it to Le Grand Paris Hotel
&lrm;and bill it to daddy.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.540
&lrm;I mean Mr. Bourgeois.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.900
&lrm;What are you doing here?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.340
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;I-I...

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.980
&lrm;You... you...

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.980
&lrm;[he coughs]

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.780
&lrm;Will you... be my Valentine?

&lrm;[bell rings]

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.900

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.740
&lrm;Don't move.

&lrm;[she laughs]

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.100
&lrm;Wait till people see this.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.580
&lrm;No offence, Kim, my heart's saved
&lrm;for someone more awesome.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.300
&lrm;Don't you just hate
&lrm;how harsh love can be?

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.820

&lrm;[he sobs]

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.940
&lrm;Valentine's Day,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.060
&lrm;the day of love and the day of fools.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.340
&lrm;So many delusions,
&lrm;so much disappointment.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.820
&lrm;My evil Akumas,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.100
&lrm;you are going to have
&lrm;such a field-day.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.540
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.540
&lrm;and evilise him.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.500
&lrm;Dark Cupid, I am Hawk Moth.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.700
&lrm;I can give you the power

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.180
&lrm;to shoot your arrows,
&lrm;pierce love and impale friendships.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.620
&lrm;But, there's something
&lrm;you must do for me in return.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.220
&lrm;No love affair
&lrm;or friendship will escape my fury.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.100
&lrm;No-one will love again!

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.900
&lrm;[arrow whistles]

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.820
&lrm;[she shrieks]

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.860
&lrm;Stupid flowers.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.820
&lrm;Get off me!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.940
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.460
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Perfect.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.780
&lrm;Soon, Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will show up to meet their doom.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.140
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.580
&lrm;[giggling]

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.180
&lrm;Candy-apples, girls?

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.700
&lrm;Thanks, dad.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.980
&lrm;Come on, do it
&lrm;before you chicken out.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.620
&lrm;[they cheer]
&lrm;I did it.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.820
&lrm;[vibrating]

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.540
&lrm;Chloe?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.020
&lrm;Since when did she start texting us?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.020
&lrm;[questioning sigh]
&lrm;[they gasp]

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.300
&lrm;[Alya] What a witch!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.180
&lrm;And I was the one
&lrm;who told Kim to do it.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.860
&lrm;I didn't know he was talking about her.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.100
&lrm;I hope Adrien doesn't do that to you.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.860
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;I mean...

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.420
&lrm;What have I done?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.380
&lrm;Girl, calm down.
&lrm;I was joking... kind of.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.300
&lrm;Adrien would never do that.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.900
&lrm;What is that?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.380
&lrm;All hearts must be destroyed!

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.980
&lrm;[gasping]

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.340
&lrm;Ayla?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.940
&lrm;Hey, seriously?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.900
&lrm;You're not my BFF. You're a joke!

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.540
&lrm;Adrien will laugh his head off
&lrm;at your lame attempt at poetry.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.820
&lrm;[Ayla cackles]
&lrm;Alya?

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.380
&lrm;What did he do to her?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.860
&lrm;I've seen that jewel before.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.220
&lrm;It's Kim's pin.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.660
&lrm;He's been akumatised.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.140
&lrm;[struggling]
&lrm;This is... not good.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.980
&lrm;We've gotta find him fast.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.500
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.620
&lrm;[Chloe groans]
&lrm;I never said 18-carat gold.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.420
&lrm;The tones will never match
&lrm;my 24-carat toilet.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.420
&lrm;[Chloe] Idiots!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.020
&lrm;[he huffs]
&lrm;[bow stretches]

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.780
&lrm;[gasping]

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.580
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Stop, Kim.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.740
&lrm;I'm not Kim,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.060
&lrm;I'm Dark Cupid. I'll never stop.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.460
&lrm;If I can't have love then no-one can.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.460
&lrm;OK, I get it. Chloe burned you.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.100
&lrm;You don't have to take it out
&lrm;on all of Paris.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.340
&lrm;Yes I do.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500
&lrm;I won't stop till all hearts are crushed.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.860
&lrm;Say adios to your loved ones,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.260
&lrm;now you'll hate them.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.420
&lrm;[she screams]

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.660
&lrm;If you want to continue
&lrm;destroying love,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.780
&lrm;bring me Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.900
&lrm;or I'll remove your powers.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.340
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Fallen for me already?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.420
&lrm;-I need to talk to you.
&lrm;-It's gotta wait...

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.660
&lrm;[he hushes her]

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.580
&lrm;I swore I'd tell you
&lrm;as soon as I saw you.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.620
&lrm;Ladybug, I-I... Look out!

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.260
&lrm;[arrow whistles]

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.260
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;Cat Noir?

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.540
&lrm;Ladybug, I...

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.860
&lrm;I loathe you!

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.780
&lrm;Cat Noir, snap out of it.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.740
&lrm;You're nothing to me, Ladybug,
&lrm;I hate you.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.980
&lrm;[he shrieks]

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.820
&lrm;Ladybug, it's about time.
&lrm;Where have you been?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.860
&lrm;Offer to help him

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.340
&lrm;in return for Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.060
&lrm;I can help you crush Ladybug
&lrm;but you must give me her Miraculous.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.460
&lrm;No... problem.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.940
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.220
&lrm;Yes... yes.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.700
&lrm;Once I have Ladybug's Miraculous,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.860
&lrm;taking Cat Noir's will be
&lrm;child's play!

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.860
&lrm;You have to leave.
&lrm;Kim's turned into Dark Cupid.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.900
&lrm;He can't find you here.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.060
&lrm;Me? But how could he have
&lrm;a vendetta against me?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.740
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;Who doesn't?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.340
&lrm;It's because of this.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.660
&lrm;Everyone would love to have it.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.340
&lrm;That's Adrien,
&lrm;a super-hot guy in my class,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.260
&lrm;and rich too.
&lrm;He's hot for me, of course.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.140
&lrm;Not according to the poem.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.180
&lrm;[Sabrina shrieks]
&lrm;It's alive!

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.500
&lrm;[Chloe screams]

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.500
&lrm;[Marinette] Chloe, run!

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.180
&lrm;Well, well, Ladybug.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.260
&lrm;I don't want to fight you.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.500
&lrm;That friendliness is so revolting.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.380
&lrm;You're not my friend.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.100
&lrm;[he yells]

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.980
&lrm;Why are you so full of hate?

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.740
&lrm;Because hate conquers all.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.580
&lrm;I hate to burst your bubble,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.980
&lrm;but hate doesn't conquer all,
&lrm;love does.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.220

<i>&lrm;Only love conquers hate.</i>

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.900
&lrm;You're just buying time....
&lrm;Fight!

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.540
&lrm;I'll do better than that.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.020
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.580
&lrm;Come on, kitty-kitty, just a peck.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.820
&lrm;Almost.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.700
&lrm;[he yells]
&lrm;Get back, you savage.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.700
&lrm;Here, kitty-kitty, come here.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.900
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.660
&lrm;You can't outrun me.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.780
&lrm;[she screams]

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.180
&lrm;Help.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.180
&lrm;[they scream]

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.860
&lrm;Happy Valentine's Day, Chloe.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.900
&lrm;Now you'll get what you deserve.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.100
&lrm;[Chloe] My hair!

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.460
&lrm;There's nothing worse
&lrm;than a bad-hair day.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.100
&lrm;First, Ladybug wrinkles my jacket,
&lrm;second, you totally ruined my hair.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.780
&lrm;Go ahead and change me.
&lrm;This day can't get any worse.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.820
&lrm;I don't need to waste
&lrm;my arrow on you.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.620
&lrm;Your heart is so dark and shrivelled
&lrm;there's no room for love.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.460
&lrm;[he laughs]

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.900
&lrm;How dare you?

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.300
&lrm;Why are you just standing there?
&lrm;Help me up!

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.780
&lrm;You think I'd help someone
&lrm;as stuck up as you?

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.300
&lrm;Wait till people see this.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.660

&lrm;No, no!

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.300
&lrm;I'm not looking forward to it either.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.260
&lrm;I can't believe I'm doing this.

&lrm;[explosions]

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.060
&lrm;How you gonna fight
&lrm;both of us now, bug-eyes?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.580
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.700
&lrm;I often wonder what
&lrm;my cataclysm will do to someone.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.780
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.580
&lrm;A candy-apple?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860
&lrm;Think, Ladybug.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.180
&lrm;Hey.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.940
&lrm;I've a Valentine's gift for you.

&lrm;[they roar]

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.980
&lrm;Looks like you're in a sticky situation.

&lrm;[he groans]

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.060
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.460
&lrm;And now for the pussycat.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.020
&lrm;Cat Noir, her Miraculous.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.220
&lrm;With pleasure.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.900
&lrm;Finally, I'll find out who you are.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
&lrm;Your secret will be out of the bag.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.220
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.580
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Wh-What am I doing here?

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.140
&lrm;No time, the quiver pin, Cat Noir, now!

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.380
&lrm;[he yells]

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.820
&lrm;[Ladybug] Grab the pin!

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.060
&lrm;-No !
&lrm;-Sorry, need that.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.020
&lrm;Happy Valentine's Day.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.900
&lrm;You shouldn't have... Woops.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.780
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.580
&lrm;Time to de-evilise.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.220
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.020
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.060
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.100
&lrm;What the heck am I doing?

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.700
&lrm;What the heck are you doing?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.420
&lrm;[Sabrina] I-I have no idea.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.780
&lrm;[they sob]

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.100
&lrm;POUND IT!

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.540
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;Woops.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.020
&lrm;Wait, I gotta tell you something.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.940
&lrm;Look, the kiss...
&lrm;I had to break the spell.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.220
&lrm;What? A kiss? What kiss?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.380
&lrm;I just wanted to say...

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.220
&lrm;Your ring's flashing.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.500
&lrm;Yours too.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.740
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;We're about to turn into pumpkins.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.820
&lrm;And I'd rather not see that.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.340
&lrm;[he roars]

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.220
&lrm;Blasted Ladybug!

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.580
&lrm;Blasted Valentine's Day!

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.460
&lrm;Hey, there's your chance
&lrm;to get your card back.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.020
&lrm;-That was before.
&lrm;-Before what?

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.980
&lrm;I realised that even with
&lrm;all this hate, love still wins.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.340
&lrm;If I wanna win-over Adrien,
&lrm;he needs to know the truth.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.700
&lrm;This is a big day.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.060
&lrm;[Plagg laughs]

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.420
&lrm;Can you believe all the horrible,
&lrm;thoughtless things you said?

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.300
&lrm;You think it's funny?

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.300
&lrm;[Plagg] What's the big deal?

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.980
&lrm;You've got so many cards
&lrm;from all these lady-fans,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.660
&lrm;just take your pick.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.780
&lrm;[mysterious music]

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.380
&lrm;Someone answered my poem?
&lrm;But I threw it away.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.580
&lrm;"Your hair shines like the sun,
&lrm;Your eyes are gorgeous green,

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.820
&lrm;I look at you and wonder,
&lrm;Your innermost thoughts and dreams.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.740
&lrm;Your Valentine, I will be,
&lrm;Our love will be so true,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.460
&lrm;Together for eternity,
&lrm;My heart belongs to you."

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.060
&lrm;Anyone who writes
&lrm;as sickeningly sweet as you

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.220
&lrm;must be your soulmate.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.060
&lrm;It isn't signed.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.180
&lrm;Could it have come from Ladybug?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.500
&lrm;Oh, please.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.660
&lrm;What? You don't remember?
&lrm;Did you sign it or not?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.940
&lrm;I don't know.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.220
&lrm;The ladybug came while I was writing.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.700
&lrm;Then you were yapping about your blog.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.220
&lrm;It's all a blur.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.500
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;I don't believe you.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.020
&lrm;The girl didn't even sign it!

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.300
&lrm;I love you,
&lrm;but sometimes, you seriously bug.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.940
&lrm;You know that, right?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.340
&lrm;[they giggle]
