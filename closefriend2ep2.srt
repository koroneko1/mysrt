1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,080
Phoon, aren't you going to apply for a creative position?

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,679
I'm scared I might be dreaming.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,960
You're definitely not dreaming.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,599
I'm right next to you, Mr. Ray.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,239
Really.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,640
Pierce is getting to produce Jedi's new single!

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't care if you're together or not.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,120
But if you want to work here,

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,839
you have to demonstrate your skills to me.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,600
Jedi, you're here...

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,640
(Previously)

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,850
Huh?

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,479
(Close Friend 2)

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,840
("The Drunkard and the Indoor Cat")

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,920
All right. Is everyone ready?

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,319
The thing is, I want something new and positive.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,799
I want a love song that doesn't use the word "love".

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
Like what you said just now, Pai.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
A ship pairing.

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
Do anything to convince the listeners

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
that Milin and Jedi

22
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,799
are really in a relationship.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Huh? But...

24
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,799
Did you just come up with a creative idea, Typhoon?

25
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,959
No.

26
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,560
If you have any new ideas, just share them with us.

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,639
We're a team after all.

28
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,090
Okay.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,240
You have to keep what's going on between me and Jedi top secret.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
But before that,

31
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,479
you have to tell me first how you...

32
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,120
and Jedi got together.

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,560
It's a long story.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
I'll tell you later.

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,560
I don't want to talk about it here either.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,439
Okay? I'll call you later.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,639
What about you? What are you doing here?

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,239
Today's my first day on the job.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,520
What? Really?

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Well, my boyfriend works as a producer here.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,000
He's getting to produce new music for Jedi and Milin too.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,479
Milin...

43
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,759
What's wrong?

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,719
Oh, Phoon.

45
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,199
- Hi. - Pierce, this is Ray. He's a friend

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,319
from high school. I've told you about him before.

47
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,680
Ray, are you crazy?

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,639
Which no-name's cutout did you bid for? It's like 5,000 baht!

49
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,400
Keep it down, or my mom will hear you.

50
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,959
More importantly, he has a name.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,840
This is Jedi. I'm a huge fan of his.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
But anyway,

53
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,680
it shouldn't have cost 5,000!

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,719
Well, I love him.

55
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,400
Even if he's not famous or does something lame,

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,479
I'll be his fan forever.

57
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,240
Right. You're his only fan.

58
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,719
Here. Catch.

59
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,039
One, two...

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,960
- Hup. - Did you catch it?

61
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,719
Here.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Pull it up.

63
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,039
Who's there?

64
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,560
- Mommy! - Hi, Mom!

65
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,050
Jedi!

66
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh!

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,879
Mommy...

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,120
Oh!

69
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,000
Mommy...

70
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,050
Jedi...

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,800
Did it snap?

72
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,079
No.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,879
Oh, hi.

74
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,360
You won't believe this. Ray is the boy...

75
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,199
A fan.

76
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,000
A fan of Jedi.

77
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,480
Oh.

78
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,730
- Jedi Army, right? - That's right.

79
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,480
I'm not sure if Jedi can come out and meet his fans today.

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
- Anyway, we'll see. - Oh, okay.

81
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,519
Ray just dropped by to see me.

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
Oh, okay.

83
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,879
Phoon.

84
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,319
Can I have a word with you?

85
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,120
- Right now? - Mm.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,839
I'll call you later.

87
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,879
See you.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,360
- Bye. - Bye.

89
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Why didn't you tell me?

90
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,160
I wanted to surprise you.

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,639
I also wanted you to see

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
that I can stand on my own two feet.

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,759
Well done.

94
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,000
But you heard what Pai said, didn't you?

95
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,399
Now that you're on the team,

96
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,879
you have to be professional.

97
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,879
We can't act like a couple like when we're at home anymore.

98
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,680
You know that, don't you?

99
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Why?

100
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Like this, for example.

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Okay. Noted.

102
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,360
From now on, I won't go near you when we're at work.

103
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll stay two meters away from you, okay?

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,800
You're going to get it when we get home, drunkard.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,199
- I have to go back to work now. - Mm.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm staying at the condo tonight.

107
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,450
Mr. Ray,

108
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,450
you're okay with being alone, right?

109
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,519
Staying the night at the condo again.

110
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,279
That's today's outfit.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
It means the photo was just taken.

112
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,679
You didn't tell me you were going somewhere else after work.

113
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,720
It's okay.

114
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,960
I can't unsee it now that I've seen it.

115
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,799
So how can I stop myself from overthinking?

116
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,519
Darn it!

117
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,960
Whose car is that in front of our place, Pierce?

118
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,210
Dad?

119
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,450
Mom?

120
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,559
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

121
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,360
Oh? Why should we?

122
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,720
I asked Dad to drive me over.

123
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,320
You're always working and haven't visited us at all.

124
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,639
I've missed you.

125
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,960
And it's almost the end of the durian season.

126
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,960
So I suggested to Dad to come to your new house.

127
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
Are you happy?

128
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,320
- Yes. - Give me a hug.

129
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,758
- You really missed him, didn't you? - My dear son.

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,799
Mom.

131
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,399
Did you grow taller?

132
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm still at the same height.

133
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,360
Did you bring something?

134
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,679
Oh, heaps.

135
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,039
That's right. Heaps. Fruits and all.

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,278
- Okay. I'll take care of them. - They're all your favorites.

137
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,639
- Come and give us a hand. - I'll help you.

138
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,720
Here.

139
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,279
Can you open up the trunk?

140
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Phoon,

141
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,080
can you help bring the stuff in?

142
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,399
- Come on. - Okay.

143
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,039
Take this.

144
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,320
- Here. - Thanks.

145
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
- And this one. - This one's a little heavy.

146
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Uh...

147
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,120
This is Typhoon, Mom.

148
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,600
We're housemates.

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,840
He's one of my colleagues.

150
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh.

151
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,399
You're his housemate?

152
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,639
That's right.

153
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,919
And why did you bring so much stuff?

154
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,840
I won't be able to finish everything.

155
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,399
There's a lot.

156
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,639
I brought them over so you can give them to your colleagues too.

157
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,279
Oh.

158
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,559
- But... - Here.

159
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,159
- I'll put it away. - Take them into the kitchen.

160
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,879
- Okay. - Go on.

161
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Come on, Mom.

162
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,039
- The longan can last long. - That's good.

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,799
Phoon?

164
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,559
Here. Dig in.

165
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,720
They're all your favorites, Pierce.

166
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,799
Phoon, try this.

167
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,279
It's curry, Mom's recipe.

168
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,799
Authentic Gang Tai Pla tastes like this.

169
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,960
- Oh. - Oh dear.

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,240
Sorry. I forgot to tell you the flavor is quite strong.

171
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Really, Pierce. Look at him. He's coughing.

172
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,320
- Drink some water. - Are you okay?

173
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,559
Drink some water.

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you okay?

175
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
Oh? Dad, that's beer!

176
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,039
Well, it is.

177
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,240
- Isn't that okay? - No, Dad.

178
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,080
- There you go. - Thank you.

179
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
Drink some water.

180
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,960
You didn't give us a heads up at all, Dad.

181
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,679
I guess you can't really eat spicy food?

182
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
No, ma'am.

183
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,919
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

184
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
So you can't eat spicy food at all?

185
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
No, ma'am.

186
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,039
- Are you okay? - I am.

187
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,879
Have some clear soup then.

188
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,799
And is it okay for you to drink beer?

189
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't you have to drive?

190
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,639
Oh, it's fine.

191
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,360
We're not going home just yet.

192
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,480
Oh, really?

193
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Why?

194
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,639
And where are you staying tonight?

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,159
At Aunt Pin's?

196
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,600
Why would we stay the night at someone else's house?

197
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,000
My son has a house, and it's a big one.

198
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,120
But...

199
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,559
Are you going to let us

200
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,000
visit you for just one day?

201
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,440
Drink some water.

202
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,960
- Okay. - Don't you agree?

203
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,159
Mm.

204
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,159
Dad and I can stay in Pierce's room.

205
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,480
We won't bother you.

206
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,120
- Is that a good thing? - Don't you like it?

207
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,799
Hey.

208
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,559
Where are you going?

209
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,559
You don't have to go. You can sleep in the smaller room.

210
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,720
I should've been sleeping in that room right from the start, right?

211
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,919
Because I'm just your junior who pays the rent.

212
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,519
Come on, Phoon.

213
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,720
You know I haven't told my parents about us yet.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,879
How can I tell them everything?

215
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,759
Then I should be understanding

216
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,960
and shouldn't feel anything about suddenly becoming your junior again.

217
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,399
It's different.

218
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,879
Phoon,

219
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,519
it's not that I'm not going to tell them.

220
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,000
But it needs to be the right time.

221
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,759
We might have to go with the flow for the time being.

222
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,679
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,200
Do I have any other choice?

224
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Pierce?

225
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,559
Mom asked me to bring the stuff upstairs.

226
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,200
She's worried I might get drunk and fall asleep soon.

227
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Typhoon?

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,559
- Goodbye, Dad. - Mm.

229
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,650
Phoon!

230
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
Why aren't you picking up?

231
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,599
Phoon!

232
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,279
Where are you going?

233
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,119
I'll sleep at a friend's.

234
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,170
Which friend?

235
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,759
I don't know. Whoever answers my call.

236
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
You don't have to go. Get inside.

237
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,799
It's you who should hurry up and get inside,

238
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,240
or your mom will find out.

239
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,720
Hello, Ray? Can you send me your location? I'm heading over.

240
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,920
Mm.

241
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,559
Call me again when you're in front of the gate.

242
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,170
Call me if you can't find it.

243
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,480
Phoon!

244
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,318
Pierce, Dad wants to watch a Chinese movie.

245
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,519
How do you turn on the TV?

246
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,039
Can you come and help me?

247
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,410
Okay, Mom.

248
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,559
Shoot. How did Phoon know I want him to come over?

249
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,599
He definitely has a special sense.

250
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,650
I'm getting goosebumps.

251
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,359
But the person I want to know about this doesn't care about me.

252
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,170
(Happy 1st Anniversary)

253
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,319
Are you feeling unwell?

254
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,839
No.

255
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,799
Someone's...

256
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,799
probably missing me.

257
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Oh.

258
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,000
It's nothing.

259
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,039
Thank you for letting me carpool with you.

260
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,359
It's okay. We're heading in the same direction.

261
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,200
I bothered you at work,

262
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,519
and now you're giving me a lift too.

263
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,890
I told you it's okay.

264
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,039
We still have to work together for a while.

265
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,039
We should help each other in any way we can.

266
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,039
Thank you.

267
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,319
I'm going now.

268
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,039
Drive safe.

269
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,680
Hello, Mom?

270
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,039
I've sent you some money.

271
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,839
It's my first paycheck.

272
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,720
Check to see if you've received it.

273
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,079
(Invoice)

274
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,890
Aren't you too hot-headed, Phoon?

275
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,410
I don't think so.

276
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,519
This time, I'm being as cool-headed as I've ever been.

277
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,319
I didn't cry or cause a scene in front of Pierce's folks.

278
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,720
I've learned my lessons.

279
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,559
I don't understand! We're only colleagues? What is that?

280
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,559
What do you want him to tell her? That you're his boyfriend?

281
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,599
He doesn't have to say that.

282
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,839
But shouldn't he have at least thought

283
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,650
that I'm in a position where we can be open?

284
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,039
Have I ever existed in his life?

285
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,480
Has he ever told his family about me at all?

286
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,559
Calm down.

287
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,039
Look at me.

288
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Let alone our families.

289
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,559
No one knows I'm dating Jedi apart from you.

290
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,640
But in my case, it's been more than four years.

291
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,039
And am I wrong for hoping that he's serious about me?

292
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,519
Come and sit here.

293
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Come on.

294
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,039
Here.

295
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,200
Your anchor for the past four years.

296
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,319
It's been since college.

297
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,839
The ring hasn't darkened at all.

298
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,279
Pierce, do you know I've been waiting for ages?

299
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,480
Why did you just arrive?

300
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,759
Merry Christmas Eve

301
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,920
and happy birthday,

302
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,759
Shorty.

303
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,599
You didn't have to get me flowers.

304
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,000
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

305
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,119
Phoon.

306
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,880
Pierce?

307
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,400
Give me your hand.

308
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,599
Thank you, Pierce.

309
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,759
I love you.

310
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
I love you too.

311
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
I love you very much.

312
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
From what you've told me, he sounds like a good guy.

313
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,799
You should give him some time.

314
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,118
There might be something on his mind.

315
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,400
That's why he hasn't told his parents yet.

316
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,519
But his mom seems very kind.

317
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
His dad does too.

318
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,680
I think it's work that's more worrisome.

319
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,799
Why did I have to face two problems in one day?

320
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,759
What's up with work?

321
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,480
Once they found out that Pierce and I are together,

322
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,799
our boss had me under scrutiny right away

323
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
even though I haven't even done anything.

324
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,359
Pierce also told me to behave appropriately

325
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,160
and that we can't act like a couple at work.

326
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,920
If I'd known, I wouldn't have applied to work at the same place.

327
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,559
But that's in the presence of high-ranking people.

328
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
Pierce has a point.

329
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,240
Manners are important.

330
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,640
Besides, you should be on Pierce's side.

331
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,839
Don't whine so much or force him to make a choice.

332
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,759
Otherwise, you'll be the troublemaker.

333
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,079
Wow.

334
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,359
I can't believe that such a thoughtful message

335
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,359
would come out of your mouth.

336
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
You've changed a lot.

337
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
Ever since I started dating Jedi,

338
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,559
I have to ask myself this every day.

339
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Oh.

340
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,880
By the way, how did you guys start going out?

341
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,799
It's such a wonder.

342
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
I know.

343
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,920
It really was a wonder, initially.

344
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
But then after we actually started dating,

345
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,519
things have been cruel.

346
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,519
Why?

347
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,920
Does Jedi whip you?

348
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,759
Moron!

349
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,319
What?

350
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,960
What's more painful than being whipped

351
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:11,119
is getting to be with someone you really like,

352
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,480
but having to keep it a secret.

353
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,000
And it's not just an ordinary secret.

354
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,519
It's a secret at the national level.

355
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,920
There's lobster too, Jedi?

356
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,759
Do you like it?

357
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,240
If you do, then go ahead and order it.

358
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,160
But it comes as a set.

359
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,400
I won't be able to finish by myself.

360
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,279
Jedi, can I take a selfie with you?

361
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,039
Of course not.

362
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
Of course I won't refuse.

363
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,119
Can I take one with you too?

364
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,119
- Can I take one too? - Sure.

365
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,920
- Me first. - Yes, you first.

366
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Jedi is very close,

367
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
but I feel even more distant.

368
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,880
- This place is beautiful. - Mm.

369
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,720
By the way,

370
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,839
why did you bring me here?

371
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,920
I've bought this house.

372
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,119
- You're not kidding, aren't you? - No.

373
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,279
Is this the real you?

374
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,680
So where's the reward?

375
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,400
I can't go back to being his fan anymore.

376
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,599
Because I don't know how long I'll get to be happy with him.

377
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,559
Maybe my time is about to be over.

378
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,400
I might just be having a sweet dream

379
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,279
and will have to wake up soon.

380
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,640
But...

381
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
you get to live in this house with him.

382
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,480
He must be serious about you, right?

383
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,880
I feel like he lets me stay here

384
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,599
because he's scared someone will find out he's with me.

385
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,759
I'm the secret.

386
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,039
I'm like... a mistress.

387
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,359
No, no, no! A mistress sounds too cliché.

388
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,720
I'm like...

389
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,359
an indoor cat.

390
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,160
Meow.

391
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000
You understand me, don't you?

392
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,759
He comes and goes whenever he pleases.

393
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,960
He plays with me for a bit and then leaves.

394
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,039
And then I become a cat waiting for his owner

395
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,880
without knowing when he's going to return.

396
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,119
Aw. My friend...

397
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,960
has become a cat.

398
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,559
Come on. Let's drink.

399
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,640
Let's drink to our secrets.

400
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,599
Secrets never die.

401
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,240
The expression is "there are no secrets in this world."

402
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,279
Oh, okay.

403
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,240
We're going to drink and forget everything.

404
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,920
Forget about Pierce and Jedi.

405
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,839
Huh?

406
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
I have a better idea.

407
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,839
Whoa.

408
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,200
If Pierce finds out,

409
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,000
he's going to complain that I reek of alcohol.

410
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,359
So what? Who cares?

411
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,240
Right. So what? Who cares?

412
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,759
Uh-uh.

413
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,799
No, Jedi's very possessive about the top shelf.

414
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,359
So what? Who cares?

415
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,720
I care.

416
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Let's have this one.

417
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,880
One, two, three!

418
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,599
And now you're with Ray.

419
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,119
I'd like to show you a trending dance move.

420
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,480
I can't sleep.

421
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,480
I can just drink the water here, right?

422
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,079
Sure.

423
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,240
Phoon, what's wrong?

424
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,160
You look like you see a ghost.

425
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,559
It's...

426
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
It's...

427
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,599
What's up with your top?

428
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,079
He's confused about my top.

429
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,599
You're about to...

430
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,599
You're a sloppy dancer.

431
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,329
What about this?

432
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:16,769
- Okay. - Where's the music?

433
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,920
- Yes! - You can't take it anymore.

434
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,480
- Yes! - You should go to sleep.

435
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,400
Cut.

436
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,639
What is this? Why did you have to be this close?

437
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,480
Ray, you're my miracle.

438
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,159
Pierce, do any monks come by to receive offerings?

439
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:34,289
I can do it.

440
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,519
Let's give it a listen.

441
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Do you know what kind of work a creative team does?

442
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,559
It's not just dressing up in chic outfits.

443
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,480
A promoter?
