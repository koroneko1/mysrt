1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,719
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,722
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,774
Hey, what is this place?

4
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,983
Is this a military base?

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,735
Why are we here?

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,738
Sae-bom is here.

7
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,240
Then you should've dropped me off earlier!

8
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,159
I have to give out rice cakes!

9
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,536
Damn it.

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,588
Do you want one?

11
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,217
I'd like that.

12
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,936
STOP

13
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,033
WONJUNG DORMITORY

14
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,093
Now!

15
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
No, don't open it!

16
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,181
Check if other vehicles are locked, and…

17
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,060
-We have to get Seung-young out.
-What?

18
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,937
He was fine until a moment ago!

19
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,544
Seung-young!

20
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,855
Are you okay?

21
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,607
Yi-hyun.

22
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,026
How did you get here?

23
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,032
I'm glad I wasn't too late.

24
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,637
Open your mouth.

25
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,731
I'm sorry.

26
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,858
I don't know why I did that either.

27
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,028
I felt it was too unfair to die in vain,

28
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,946
so I wanted to do something at least.

29
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,911
Did something happen in there?

30
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,375
I went inside,

31
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,794
and everyone in there…

32
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,090
was completely mad.

33
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,010
I saw that.

34
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,219
Sae-bom.

35
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,599
What if I end up like that?

36
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,311
My wife and my kids…

37
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,783
I'm disappointed in you, First Lieutenant.

38
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,285
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom.

39
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,832
Five of our fellow soldiers got infected

40
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,293
while trying to take care of them.

41
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,880
What else could we do?

42
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,100
How did you know
a flash grenade would work?

43
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,895
Those soldiers must have had
a reason for carrying them around.

44
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,980
They weren't suppressing
a terrorist attack.

45
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,607
They were watching the infected.

46
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,986
Some of the infected
tried to escape from the facility.

47
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,238
That's when I found out.

48
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,950
So you lock them up
and wait until they die?

49
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,451
What else can we do?

50
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,413
They lost their minds, and they only want
the fresh blood of healthy people.

51
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,249
Shall we offer them living sacrifices?

52
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,460
But aren’t they living human beings?
You should hold out, no matter what.

53
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,754
We're holding out the best we can.

54
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,925
We protect those with mild symptoms
and put severe patients into quarantine.

55
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,931
Listen, Mr. Han.
What if that happens to your family?

56
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,892
Be honest.

57
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,894
You're seeing those people as monsters.

58
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,147
You're shooting them
without any guilt at all.

59
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,447
Do you know what we learned
through COVID-19?

60
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,492
What, that we should wash our hands often?

61
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,370
It's that living our lives
is more important

62
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,622
than a few people biting
and killing each other.

63
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm holding out as much as I can
to protect my family.

64
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,183
How long are you going
to do this in secret?

65
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
You should reveal this to the public

66
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,937
and discuss what to do with the infected.

67
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,355
I am going to do that.

68
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,483
The media is already getting suspicious.

69
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,525
Hurry up and do it.

70
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,987
If not, I'm going to reveal everything.

71
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,702
And let's try not to see each other again.

72
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,704
And…

73
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,842
they're holding out too,

74
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,011
as much as they can.

75
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,700
SCAN QR CODE FOR CHECK-IN AND PAYMENT

76
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,869
PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES
FROM SPREADING

77
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,325
I can finally breathe now.

78
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,752
I saved up money

79
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,256
and planned to go on a trip.
I can't believe this is happening.

80
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,302
Give me your hand.

81
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
Hey, it's almost healed.

82
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,941
It's going to sting.

83
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,785
Is it okay for me to be
the only one who's fine?

84
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,413
I'm relieved that at least you're fine.

85
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,375
The cure and the vaccine will be out soon.

86
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,463
This outbreak will pass by

87
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,758
in the end.

88
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,510
So don't worry.

89
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,181
Will those people

90
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,142
be able to go back too?

91
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,690
I hope they can.

92
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,916
Oh, hi.

93
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,546
Did you ask about the T-shirt? Size large.

94
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,093
I was a bit busy today,
so I'll bring it next time.

95
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,782
Hi.

96
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,826
Mom, she's the SOU lady
who lives next door.

97
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,538
Hi, I heard you looked after Seo-yoon.
Thank you.

98
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,956
It was nothing.

99
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,266
Wasn't that place nice?

100
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,315
Your husband?

101
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,568
He's handsome.

102
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,148
SEYANG HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM

103
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,739
Found it.

104
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,074
All right.

105
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,170
Are you okay?

106
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,298
It's just…

107
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,551
It feels weird to be back
to everyday life so easily.

108
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,971
Should we just do it later?

109
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,682
No, we're doing this
to protect our daily lives.

110
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,560
Let's do this.

111
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,650
By the way, will she believe
that we're getting married?

112
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,737
Of course. She'll think
we're madly in love, so don't worry.

113
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,868
First, chamomile. It warms you up.

114
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,622
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

115
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,668
You didn't even see me.

116
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,797
Okay, let me see.

117
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,806
You look nice. You look pretty.

118
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,978
But who would think that
we're getting married for an apartment?

119
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,438
Everyone would obviously think
we love each other.

120
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,606
Sae-bom.

121
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,776
Hi, ma'am.

122
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,988
I knew you two would end up together
when I first saw you.

123
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,239
You looked so cute

124
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,200
when you were sitting
in that ambulance together.

125
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,287
What? That picture is from that day.

126
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,540
It's so we won't forget our feelings.

127
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,586
Sae-bom, there's something
I want to say to you.

128
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,963
Yes, go ahead.

129
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,508
Son, can you please excuse us?
I have something to tell Sae-bom.

130
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,386
Tell me later.
I'll relay the message to her.

131
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,391
Do you guys have noise issues?

132
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,894
Goodness, that's troublesome.

133
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,104
Go tell them to be quiet.

134
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,070
Go ahead, ma'am.

135
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,865
Sae-bom, thank you so much.

136
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,619
Thanks to you,
Yi-hyun is living a normal life.

137
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,665
Ma'am, Yi-hyun has always
been a great guy.

138
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,461
He's nice,
but he loses his temper sometimes.

139
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,297
After he became unable
to play baseball anymore,

140
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,923
he hung out with bad kids.

141
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,551
So we tried to immigrate to the US,

142
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,179
but he said he wouldn't go
because he couldn't speak English.

143
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,640
It seems being a detective is
the perfect job for him.

144
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,350
He catches bad guys too.

145
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,656
I was wondering what was
going on at this late hour.

146
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,700
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not trying to get an apology.

147
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,536
I'm really worried, that's why.
Are you sure it's nothing?

148
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,246
Well, it's…

149
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,792
Hi.

150
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,670
We live downstairs, and it's a bit noisy.

151
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,088
I'm sorry.

152
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,341
What…

153
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,054
I couldn't tell you yesterday,

154
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,223
but my wife is ill.

155
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,976
She keeps throwing things and yelling.

156
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,229
Then who is she?

157
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,900
She's a consultant
at my wife's dermatology clinic,

158
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,569
and she came to help us
because she's worried.

159
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,161
My wife took a sleeping pill,
so she'll be fine.

160
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,163
Does she bite or scratch by any chance?

161
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,917
It's not that bad. She just gets
sensitive from time to time.

162
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,963
We won't cause any more noise. I'm sorry.

163
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,884
What is it?

164
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,142
Well…

165
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,979
What's the name
of that dermatology clinic?

166
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,735
I think we have to hold a wedding too.
But who's going to officiate it?

167
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,406
Jung-kook?

168
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,783
That does sound reasonable.

169
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,037
But can he speak well
in front of a lot of people?

170
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,789
No.

171
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,961
We can just go out there and say hi,
and say that we will live well together.

172
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,297
That sounds good too.

173
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,217
Seung-young is a good singer,

174
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,220
so it'd be great
if he can get better by then.

175
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,476
Do we have to go on a honeymoon too?
Where should we go?

176
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,394
Where you always wanted to go.

177
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,190
Hey, what if I ask for a buffet tour
for our honeymoon, then?

178
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,318
I can't leave until I eat
at least ten plates per buffet.

179
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,530
Excuse me, I was a baseball player.
I eat so much it's scary.

180
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,160
Thinking of food makes me hungry.

181
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,995
Let's go to sleep.

182
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,083
Right, good night.

183
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,793
-You too.
-Okay.

184
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,384
Patients of the so-called
Mad Human Disease,

185
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,054
which makes them bite people
and drink blood, are increasing in number,

186
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,808
but the government still states
that the existence of the disease

187
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,310
-has not been confirmed yet.
-Honey.

188
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,521
-In the meantime…
-Honey!

189
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,773
We don't have money for that!

190
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,652
Then are we going to just live like this?
What are you going to do if she collapses?

191
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,530
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

192
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,825
She's been okay until now.
She just needs to maintain her condition.

193
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,871
We're already being discriminated against.
What if people hear about her illness?

194
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,539
I'm going to our next-door lady.

195
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,208
We can say she's studying abroad,
and go quietly.

196
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,043
No one would know.

197
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,295
Honey.

198
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,922
How would we get that money?

199
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,606
Hi. It's me, Seo-yoon.

200
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,401
Hi. We have some rice cakes left.
Want some?

201
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,861
Is it okay for me to eat it?

202
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,702
Love has its times of crisis too.

203
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,496
It must have been a serious crisis.

204
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,124
Where's your husband?

205
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,294
He went to work.
He said he got orders from higher-ups.

206
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,545
SKIN AND HAIR DERMATOLOGY CLINIC

207
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,631
DIRECTOR PARK MIN-JI

208
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,549
-Hello?
-Hello.

209
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,052
Is Director Park Min-ji there?

210
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,013
Director Park is on vacation for a week.

211
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,891
We accept appointments
with her starting next week.

212
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,311
Then is the consultant on vacation, too?

213
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,481
Consultant? Which consultant
are you talking about?

214
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,859
She has long hair down to her waist,
and she has double eyelids…

215
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,278
Ms. Woo Sang-hee? She took the day off.

216
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,073
Here she comes. Hang on.

217
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,703
What is it?

218
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,373
Do you want dermatology treatment?

219
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,376
Our upstairs neighbors were irritating so…

220
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,419
Noise issues?

221
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,922
That drives you nuts.

222
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,343
By the way, the car wash…

223
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,012
They told us to stop investigating it.

224
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,516
Our Chief said some other department
is taking care of it.

225
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,433
Han Tae-seok?

226
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,437
Are you sure this is okay?

227
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,773
Isn't it a dangerous disease?

228
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,827
MS. KIM BOK-NAM

229
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,457
Hey, Mom. What's up?

230
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
Are you okay?

231
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,836
I heard you got tested
for Mad Human Disease.

232
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,963
I'm okay. They said it's not serious.

233
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,716
But still, I have to be
in self-quarantine for a while…

234
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,428
Turn on the TV.
It's total chaos right now.

235
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,105
Is anyone there?

236
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,489
They're not humans. None of them are.

237
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,454
The footage you just watched
was obtained exclusively by us.

238
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
I repeat.

239
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,875
This footage, exclusively obtained
by our broadcasting station,

240
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,294
was recorded by an anonymous informant

241
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,129
who snuck into
a secret government facility

242
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,174
and filmed this with his phone.

243
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,676
-Are you watching the news?
-The disease

244
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,471
that was only treated as
a rumor by the government,

245
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,182
Mad Human Disease,
which makes patients bite people

246
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,268
and drink blood, does exist.

247
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,937
-The government may be concealing this.
-I'll call you later.

248
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,648
This is the only evidence we have for now.

249
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:43,737
The informant has been out of reach
after sending us the video.

250
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,574
Our reporters are now
doing their best to find out

251
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,993
what has happened to the informant.

252
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,960
Damn it.

253
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,337
What is this?

254
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,214
We just opened our shop.

255
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,299
Are they going to restrict
gatherings again?

256
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
I just want to bite everyone!

257
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,306
-Send me to a hospital.
-You just said it's COVID-19.

258
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,766
It's Mad Human Disease!

259
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,697
Don't say anything dangerous.

260
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,200
Take it easy.

261
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,536
Are you okay?

262
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,580
Hey, where are you going?

263
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,833
You have to get tested!

264
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,959
The hospital.

265
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,878
The order will get mixed up…

266
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,883
Are you going camping?

267
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,263
There aren't many people here
despite the emergency texts.

268
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:55,267
We get emergency texts every day,
so we can't react to them every time.

269
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,562
Unless some people die
and about 1,000 are tested positive.

270
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,564
Would you like us to deliver them for you?

271
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,567
-Just the water and rice, please.
-Okay.

272
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,744
ANNOUNCEMENT
A RESIDENT IS BREAKING DOWN DOORS

273
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,371
That's me.

274
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,747
What's going on?

275
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,878
I'm the building representative.
I live in Unit 1202.

276
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,674
I censored your face
to protect your privacy.

277
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,635
Please be careful from now on.

278
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,804
What if there's a fire
when that door is blocked?

279
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,560
That door is called a firewall, you know.

280
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,604
So the fire won't spread.

281
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:45,275
But what if you leave it open?
Then the fire will spread.

282
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,195
But you should just close it.
You shouldn't block it.

283
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,571
We'll be trapped in a fire.

284
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,824
It's a decision made
by the apartment's fire safety manager.

285
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,953
The fire safety manager
must be from an outsourcing company.

286
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,080
And that's their official opinion, right?

287
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,916
Who are you?

288
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,709
I live in Unit 401.

289
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,171
A public rental…

290
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,802
You know the doctor
who lives in Unit 601, right?

291
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,056
She's having a hard time
because of people randomly visiting.

292
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,393
Her husband said she canceled
her appointments and is lying sick in bed.

293
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,312
Did they say that?

294
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,898
When they were
stomping like that last night?

295
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,235
Young lady, the noise
doesn't follow certain directions.

296
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,488
We don't know
which unit is making the noise.

297
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,949
Don't fight, and come to church.

298
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,202
God knows everything.

299
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,082
The lady in Unit 601
must be having a hard time.

300
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,169
She needs to depend on God.
Then she will find peace.

301
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,091
She has her husband,
so I'm sure she'll be okay.

302
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,845
I'll talk to them about the emergency door
being bent and let it slide.

303
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,889
Thanks a lot.

304
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,567
-Oh, you're carrying a lot.
-Thank you.

305
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,156
Hi.

306
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,366
Is the Director still sick?

307
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,121
Yes, she's going to rest for a while,
so she told me to get her stuff.

308
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,123
She must be quitting.

309
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,708
You brought all her stuff.

310
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,460
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,255
I'm from the police.

312
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,800
Think carefully
before you answer my questions.

313
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,219
What's going on

314
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,847
in that house right now?

315
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,565
Is your wife really okay?

316
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,362
Yes, I'll admit her to the hospital today,
so please be patient.

317
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,533
What is this?

318
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,537
Did you get bitten?

319
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,331
Did your wife bite you?

320
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,045
Ma'am!

321
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,254
What are you doing?

322
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,548
Why are you entering my house
without permission?

323
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,634
Trespassing is illegal!

324
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,804
Report me, then.

325
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,767
I'm from downstairs.

326
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,269
-Are you okay?
-Don't do that. Don't!

327
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,356
How long has she been like this?

328
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,565
Since a few days ago.

329
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,567
She attacks people.

330
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:20,323
I was thinking of calling
a psychiatrist friend of mine.

331
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,366
What about her eyes?

332
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,493
Her eyes were white.

333
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,205
The disease isn't always active,

334
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,752
so since the noise stopped,
she might be normal right now.

335
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,554
Ma'am.

336
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,440
Ma'am, it's okay.

337
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,818
You can get better.

338
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,991
Your husband is worried
so please come out…

339
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,742
Sir!

340
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,345
Ma'am.

341
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,762
Ma'am.

342
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,140
Please calm down.

343
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,602
Ma'am.

344
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,066
Hello? 911?

345
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,071
It looks like my wife
has Mad Human Disease,

346
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,533
and the lady downstairs
seems to be in danger.

347
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,328
-Do you want to get out?
-This is Unit 601, Building 101…

348
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:36,042
-I'll open the door for you.
-Seyang. That's the address.

349
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,338
No. Unit 601, Building 101.

350
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:46,094
No, listen to me!
It's Building 101, not 102!

351
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,473
Please hurry and send them.

352
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,686
It really is an emergency!

353
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,149
Please hurry!

354
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,819
Someone could die!

355
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,738
Please hurry! Please!

356
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,158
Come on! It's urgent!

357
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,411
Please…

358
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,371
Hey.

359
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,502
Min-ji.

360
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,424
Hey, Min-ji!

361
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,800
Damn it!

362
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,265
-Hey, Sae-bom.
-What is it?

363
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,475
Don't go upstairs, even if they're loud.

364
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,102
I'm upstairs already.

365
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,063
I'm fine but the couple from that house…

366
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,784
Mister! No one's home…

367
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,036
Mister!

368
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,240
Seo-yoon! Run! Now!

369
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,960
Someone, help!

370
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,820
Are you okay?

371
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,614
Yes, I think so.

372
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,416
What's wrong with her?

373
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,003
She's just very angry, that's all.

374
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,963
It's okay.

375
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,258
Her husband is over there.

376
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:46,941
Hey.

377
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,861
You live downstairs, right?

378
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,362
Is everyone okay?

379
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,197
Are you okay?

380
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,082
You're lucky that I'm the one who hit you.

381
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,543
If it was Sae-bom, you would be dead.

382
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,589
Breathe.

383
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,715
Over here.

384
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,010
He must be shocked by his wife's injury.

385
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,157
You should have seen it
with your own eyes.

386
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,700
We need weapons.

387
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,828
No, not gas pistols.
Something more powerful.

388
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,790
Are you just leaving?
Aren't you doing anything else?

389
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,377
We're going to disinfect this place.
Refrain from going outside,

390
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,629
and please follow
the government's instructions.

391
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,106
Mom, let's go.

392
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,224
NOTICE ON DELAY IN DELIVERY

393
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,813
Honey.

394
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,857
Honey?

395
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,154
Honey, today…

396
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:23,658
Where have you been?
You haven't made me food!

397
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,825
Well…

398
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,163
-Everyone!
-Oh, Dong-hyun.

399
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:33,376
I told you that the green candle
is proof of external forces.

400
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,086
-Dong-hyun.
-You shouldn't just buy

401
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,546
bio-themed shares
because of Mad Human Disease.

402
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,714
All right?

403
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,050
Dong-hyun, I was on the sixth floor today…

404
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,260
Mom, can't you see I'm streaming?

405
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,637
Later, okay?

406
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,390
-Hey.
-My mom is a bit dull.

407
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,818
Here is the announcement
on Mad Human Disease.

408
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,363
Our organization has found out
that there were patients

409
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,700
biting people at nursing homes
and homeless facilities,

410
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,578
and while analyzing the patients,

411
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,374
we found out that Mad Human Disease

412
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,002
really does exist.

413
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,214
Based on the analysis, it's assumed
to be a type of mutated virus.

414
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,925
Once the disease occurs,
the patients only attack humans,

415
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,552
try to bite their necks,

416
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:30,141
and claim to have extreme thirst
before the symptoms occur.

417
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,893
If you have any of these symptoms

418
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,980
or find someone who shows such symptoms,

419
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,442
please call the CDSCHQ's
main number right away.

420
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,905
He's famous now. He's even on TV.

421
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,368
He didn't talk about
the quarantine of the infected.

422
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,413
Because Mad Human Disease
itself is shocking news.

423
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,292
For now, how you get infected

424
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,879
and when the cure
will come out will be the main topic.

425
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,631
Hey, more than that…

426
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,510
Don't go into someone else's house alone.
Tell me first.

427
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,054
I was going to.

428
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,973
I was going to check
if it was the disease and call 911.

429
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,435
By the way, that woman upstairs…

430
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,229
She only chased her husband.

431
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,107
I'm sure there's something about her.

432
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,401
He didn't push me by mistake either.

433
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,447
I'll look into it,
and if there's anything, I'll arrest him.

434
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,364
Okay.

435
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,992
It's great having a detective friend.

436
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,077
Of course.

437
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,129
Want to go for a walk?

438
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,715
We have never gone out together
since we came here.

439
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,517
Are you going outside?

440
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,478
Yes, what's wrong?

441
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,359
I'd like to ask you to keep
what happened today a secret.

442
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,113
Don't post it online or spread any rumors.

443
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,907
But a lot of people saw it.

444
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,450
What can we do?

445
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,369
They're all residents of our apartment.

446
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,871
It's hard for outsiders to come inside.

447
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,875
We just have to keep quiet
and make it so it's no big deal.

448
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,253
Would that really make it no big deal?

449
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,882
Bad rumors don't help with house prices.

450
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,885
You're thinking of house prices right now?

451
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,557
You're going to live here
for ten more years, at least.

452
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,518
Wouldn't it be better for you two as well

453
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,146
to say that you live
in an expensive apartment?

454
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,286
The building representative is right.

455
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,790
It's absolute chaos outside,
but it's peaceful here.

456
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,670
I'm sure they want to enjoy
their house prices

457
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,339
and happiness in here.

458
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,176
Even by getting rid of the infected.

459
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:04,772
I am so damn thankful
for what you did earlier today.

460
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,440
Did they tell you to go home?

461
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:09,652
The results were clean, so they
told me to self-quarantine at home.

462
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,489
So please understand
even if it's noisy at night.

463
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,908
You will be quarantined in jail soon.

464
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,326
So don't worry.

465
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,285
Jail?

466
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:23,123
When my quarantine is over,
I'm suing you first!

467
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,708
You messed with the wrong person!

468
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,629
I'm the master of lawsuits
and accusations!

469
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,646
This was found at the infected's house.

470
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,530
It looks like your people took care
of the car wash dealers too.

471
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,534
Those drugs cause
Mad Human Disease, right?

472
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,333
I'm sure you didn't come
all the way here to ask that.

473
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,879
Is Ms. Park Min-ji here?

474
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,508
I'd like to meet her now.

475
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,188
Be careful.

476
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,943
Ms. Park Min-ji.

477
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,869
Shouldn't she have returned
to normal by now?

478
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,249
She's supposed to be dead by now.

479
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,002
The disease occurred just before she died,

480
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,795
and she's alive, thanks to the virus.

481
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,881
Then if she turns back to normal…

482
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,425
She'll die.

483
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,386
Her mind has turned into a huge mess.

484
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,098
Perhaps she's in that condition
because she knows that too.

485
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,312
Perhaps it's because she's resentful,
and she wants to reveal who killed her.

486
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,025
Ms. Park Min-ji.

487
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,236
Don't worry.

488
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,238
I swear I'll catch the asshole

489
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,158
who did this to you.

490
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,390
Damn it.

491
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,876
I'm late, aren't I?

492
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,754
I had a lot of things to take care of.

493
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,925
What is this place?

494
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,929
A place to lock up guard dogs,
to borrow your expression.

495
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,765
Your friends are back there.
Don't wake them up.

496
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,107
An ordinary woman in
an ordinary apartment got the disease,

497
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,985
and this was found at her house.

498
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,112
Seyang Forest Le Ciel…

499
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,907
is your territory, right?

500
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,244
If I tell you…

501
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,205
will you let me go?

502
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,292
Why do you think you're here?

503
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,052
If…

504
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:08,432
If you promise you won't kill me,
I'll tell you everything.

505
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,192
If you truly want something,
you won't surrender to thirst.

506
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,526
So…

507
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,529
think carefully…

508
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,452
about what you really want.

509
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,337
Aren't you going to cook?

510
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,298
How long are you going
to be lying on the sofa?

511
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:46,094
I have no energy.
Maybe from shock because of yesterday.

512
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,723
You're so weak.

513
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,766
Goodness.

514
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,851
I'm going to eat outside.

515
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,355
Honey, I want a hamburger.

516
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,942
You should eat rice!
Bread can't make a good meal!

517
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,320
My goodness. Unbelievable.

518
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,622
Hello?

519
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,667
Ms. Park Min-ji died just now.

520
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,380
She was all blank in the end,
not attacking anyone.

521
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,591
Thank you for letting me know.

522
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:39,982
Here's the NFS report.

523
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,569
Let's go.

524
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,238
Now? Will it be okay?

525
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,739
It's not even certain yet.

526
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,283
There's someone who can help us.

527
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,951
Hey, be careful!

528
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,996
If we can't catch him after doing that,
it'll be troublesome!

529
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,749
We're from the police.

530
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,251
Excuse us.

531
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,337
Why are you all just
pushing yourselves in?

532
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,757
How can both you and your wife be so rude?

533
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,347
Ms. Park Min-ji…

534
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,434
is dead.

535
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,986
She…

536
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,074
She suffered her whole life…

537
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,953
What?

538
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,496
Why? What is it?

539
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:43,545
Goodness, you must have cleaned
the house more after that.

540
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,674
I hate the smell of blood,
and I'm worried about the virus.

541
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,551
So I cleaned. Why?

542
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,481
By the way,
did you clean the golf club too?

543
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,735
Your wife's head was
almost completely crushed.

544
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,989
The part where you hit her
with a golf club, Mr. Oh Joo-hyung.

545
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,908
It was self-defense.

546
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,327
She was trying to bite me.
What else could I do?

547
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,663
If it wasn't for Mad Human Disease,

548
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,414
you would've gotten what you wanted.

549
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,916
-Right?
-What?

550
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:25,253
She was supposed to die
when you hit her with a golf club,

551
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,882
but the disease suddenly occurred,
and she didn't die.

552
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,844
If it wasn't for that,
you'd have been able to discard the body

553
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,930
and make it a perfect crime.

554
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,350
Perfect crime? What are you talking about?

555
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,438
This is the NFS report
on the bloodstain from the golf club.

556
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,024
"A hard blow by an adult male
with all his strength."

557
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,694
"Occipital bone fragments
and cerebral tissues found."

558
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,530
"The weapon was swung
with the intention of murder."

559
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,490
I told you, I was scared.

560
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:57,035
She was trying to bite me
with her eyes all white.

561
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,956
If you were me, would you just
get bitten to death by your wife?

562
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,958
Do you love your wife that much?

563
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,919
So I looked into your trial records too.

564
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,629
You really are something else.

565
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,258
Illegal procedures, cancellation
of certification, and bankruptcy…

566
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,595
And you handed over
the clinic to your wife too.

567
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,764
You must have thought that

568
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,434
you could start over
if your wife was gone.

569
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,938
So what? What does
that have to do with anything?

570
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:28,859
Dozens of people saw my wife
walking around totally fine.

571
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,736
How are you

572
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,946
going to prove

573
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,574
that I killed my wife?

574
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,994
We have a witness.

575
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,377
Sang-hee.

576
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,049
Oh Joo-hyung, you're under arrest
for murdering your wife.

577
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,202
Honey.

578
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,023
We're stopping them all, as we planned.

579
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:50,982
Lieutenant Colonel.

580
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,109
If we're late,
even more people will get hurt.

581
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,851
Excuse me…

582
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,619
I'm going to get surgery.

583
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,372
So it's decided?

584
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,584
My mom is pretty worried,

585
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,587
but the disease spreading
in the apartment is worrisome too.

586
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,590
When I get wounded,
it doesn't heal very well.

587
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,800
I take antibiotics too.

588
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,972
We decided to go out quietly
and get surgery.

589
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,141
When are you leaving?

590
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,185
I'm going to go get checkups
when my mom comes.

591
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,440
Hey, he's the man who was on TV.

592
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,985
Is he your friend?

593
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,196
No, he's just someone I know.

594
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,824
What is it?

595
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,911
Mad Human Disease is spreading
in the apartment.

596
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,543
But there was only one infected person.

597
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,004
Are there more?

598
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,340
We interrogated the dealer,

599
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,010
and he said he sold
the drugs at the apartment gym.

600
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,889
He sold them by saying it helps
with diets and concentration,

601
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,724
and one of the purchasers

602
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,518
was Park Min-ji from the sixth floor.

603
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,354
Oh, hello.

604
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,438
Hello.

605
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,045
Hi.

606
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,880
Hello.

607
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,132
-How have you been?
-Fine.

608
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,718
-Well done.
-Thank you.

609
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,178
Thank you. Enjoy your workout.

610
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,349
KANG JOO-HEON: SENIOR TRAINER

611
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,978
I'm sure many in the apartment
are going through the same thing.

612
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,691
Some might be living quietly at home,
hiding the disease.

613
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:43,196
So the numbers will grow little by little,
and blow up all at once.

614
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,448
What are you doing here, then?

615
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,033
You should start investigating.

616
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,411
Do you think that's going to solve it?

617
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,079
There's no cure or vaccine for it,

618
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,541
and we don't know when they will turn.

619
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,793
Where can we keep them to watch them?

620
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,921
We can't even kill them all
like pigs infected with swine fever.

621
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,590
Then what are you going to do?

622
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,969
Is there another way?

623
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,096
There…

624
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,390
is a way.

625
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,548
What is that?

626
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,770
Why are you putting those up?

627
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,938
What are you doing?

628
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,300
Thankfully, only the residents
can use the gym,

629
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,511
and less than half
of the houses are in use.

630
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,639
The nursery in the apartment complex
isn't open yet, either.

631
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,685
So you're going to lock down
the entire complex?

632
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:41,356
Until we get the manpower
and location to watch the infected.

633
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,651
You should tell the residents, though.

634
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,986
They need to prepare themselves.

635
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,823
They won't prepare themselves.

636
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,492
They'll run away and spread the disease.

637
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,454
You can get out, Ms. Yoon.

638
00:56:56,538 --> 00:57:00,166
We always lack decisive people
when it comes to matters like this.

639
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,008
It's my fault.

640
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,055
When I found out what you
were doing at the dorm,

641
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,392
I should have revealed everything
through the media.

642
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,520
That wouldn't have changed anything.

643
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,438
We have to…

644
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,524
have priorities for things like this.

645
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,152
Like who is more needed

646
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,487
and what is more needed.

647
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,323
So I'm someone needed?

648
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,629
But I decided to live here
and this is my house now.

649
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,633
Whether it's noise issues
or Mad Human Disease,

650
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,260
I'm not the type to run away

651
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,762
in the middle of something.

652
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,515
Goodbye.

653
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,071
Yes, I'm in front of your house right now.

654
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,367
Hey, how can I go back
when I came all the way here?

655
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:17,952
Yes.

656
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,706
What is this?

657
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:37,096
This is our apartment. What's going on?

658
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,182
If you go in now, you can't come outside.

659
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,976
What? What does that mean?

660
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,854
Yes, what floor are you on?

661
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,397
Okay, I'm going in now.

662
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,921
Yi-hyun, I'm locked up inside.

663
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,757
Don't fight them trying to get in.

664
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,343
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

665
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,721
What does that mean?
Where are you locked up?

666
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,224
I'll be…

667
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,601
watching our apartment.

668
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,854
Sae-bom, tell me what's going on.

669
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,440
Damn it.

670
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,029
I was going to tell you later…

671
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,583
I thought I was left alone.

672
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,969
Sae-bom, I have to catch that jerk.

673
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,223
It's okay. No one can get out anyway.

674
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,988
Let her out.

675
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,949
They have a high risk of infection.

676
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,452
We don't know what will happen outside.

677
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,080
Did you take that drug too?

678
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,666
But you know who took them, right?

679
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,168
You never know how people can change
in times of crisis.

680
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,545
What do you think you're doing?

681
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,713
We can't go outside anymore.

682
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,299
The other buildings voted for this.

683
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,301
Ms. Yoon, are you all right?

684
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,178
It's blood.

685
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,472
Come out if you don't want to die!

686
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,473
Help!

687
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,017
Within 72 hours we'll be done for.

688
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:36,150
