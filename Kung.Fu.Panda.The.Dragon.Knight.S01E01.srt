I was told he lives in that house.

361

Yeah, not sure
the Dragon Master still exists,

362

but, uh, a couple of days ago,
that would be me.

get away with the gauntlet.

all happy your friends got away.

I am in pursuit
of Klaus and Veruca DuMont.

379

They escaped London,

380
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,126
and are in China to locate
the very weapon you let them take.

381
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,210
Accidentally.

Making them extremely powerful.

383
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,966
It could lead to a devastating result
for England, China, and the world.

384
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,425
They must be stopped.

385
