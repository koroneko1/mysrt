&lrm;<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.100
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.420
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.700
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! Simply the best! ♪</i>

&lrm;<i>♪ Up to the test when things go wrong! ♪</i>

&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! ♪</i>

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.900
&lrm;I'll let you in on a little secret.
&lrm;I always add cream to chocolate

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.940
&lrm;to make the ganache extra velvety.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.420
&lrm;Then I let it infuse for one minute.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.740
&lrm;I love it when your dad comes to class
&lrm;and gives us pastry lessons!

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.820
&lrm;Ha, ha! So does he!

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.100
&lrm;Do they seriously think I'm going to get
&lrm;my hands dirty cooking, like some maid?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.020
&lrm;If I want a croissant,
&lrm;I just make my butler get it for me!

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
&lrm;He's not making croissants, Chloé,
&lrm;those are macaroons.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.460
&lrm;It's all done with a flick of the wrist.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.140
&lrm;But don't go too fast,
&lrm;or you might splash yourself!

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.900
&lrm;And soil my Chenal pants?
&lrm;Who's he kidding?

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.820
&lrm;-Look at this lovely emulsion.
&lrm;-Oh!

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.780
&lrm;It's beautiful!

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.100
&lrm;Now we need to chill it
&lrm;for half an hour. Marinette?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.180
&lrm;-Yes, Dad?
&lrm;-Could you put this in the fridge, please?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.580
&lrm;In the meantime, I'll show your friends
&lrm;how to whip up egg whites.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.340
&lrm;Of course!

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.100
&lrm;-Hmm. Can I get a taste?
&lrm;-Not yet, Tikki!

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.980
&lrm;Control that sweet tooth of yours!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.380
&lrm;[laughs]

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.580
&lrm;[alarm]

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.260
&lrm;Hide, Tikki!

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
&lrm;Quietly, students! Single-file line!
&lrm;Just keep moving.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.900
&lrm;I hope it's only a fire drill.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.460
&lrm;So, some smart aleck had the bright idea
&lrm;of calling the fire department!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.540
&lrm;Huh?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.860
&lrm;Somebody thought it would be funny
&lrm;to waste the fire captain's time!

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.620
&lrm;-Yes, in fact, if you wouldn't mind, I--
&lrm;-Hold on!

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.580
&lrm;I want the guilty party
&lrm;to apologise to you!

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.980
&lrm;I'm sure it was Chloé!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.780
&lrm;I saw her on the phone
&lrm;right before the alarm went off!

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.420
&lrm;You seeing her make a phone call
&lrm;isn't solid proof.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980
&lrm;-Mr Damocles, sir?
&lrm;-Yes, Miss Bourgeois?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.340
&lrm;I saw someone leave the classroom
&lrm;right before the alarm went off!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.740
&lrm;-It must have been her.
&lrm;-Really? Who was it?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.060
&lrm;Let's see if she'll come clean?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.340
&lrm;What do you say, Marinette Dupain-Cheng?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.580
&lrm;Marinette, do you have
&lrm;something to tell the captain?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.980
&lrm;Uh, wait. Excuse me, sir,
&lrm;but it couldn't possibly be Marinette.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.620
&lrm;Why would she disrupt
&lrm;her father's cooking class?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.180
&lrm;And I know she didn't have her phone
&lrm;on her when she left the classroom!

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.580
&lrm;-Mr Damocles, I must be heading--
&lrm;-Just one more second!

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.660
&lrm;We're very close to discover the truth!

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.420
&lrm;-Oh...
&lrm;-Well, we all know it can't be me!

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.620
&lrm;I'm not gonna let her get away with this!
&lrm;I've gotta tell--

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.580
&lrm;Hang on, Marinette.
&lrm;We don't know for sure that it was her.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.780
&lrm;He's right. Let's not stoop to her level!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.020
&lrm;[chuckles]

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.820
&lrm;I really have to leave now. Just call me
&lrm;if you find out who the prankster is.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.140
&lrm;Fine! Since no one is owning up,
&lrm;the whole school will be punished!

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.340
&lrm;What? I'm not so sure my father will react
&lrm;kindly to me being punished without proof!

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.780
&lrm;Oh, no, please!
&lrm;Don't disturb the busy mayor!

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.700
&lrm;The whole school is punished,
&lrm;except for Miss Bourgeois!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.180
&lrm;Yeah, that's more like it!

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.500
&lrm;Now you know how we deal with anyone
&lrm;who misuses the fire department's time!

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.220
&lrm;OK, great!

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.300
&lrm;Bye!

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.420
&lrm;-Do you see what just went down?
&lrm;-I know! Adrien just talked to my ear!

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.900
&lrm;Seriously, Marinette?

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.860
&lrm;[sweeping]

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.060
&lrm;Can't you see I'm trying to relax here?
&lrm;Go sweep somewhere else, Cinderella!

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.020
&lrm;Adri-kins!

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.500
&lrm;Of course it was me who called
&lrm;the fire department! So what?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.100
&lrm;It doesn't bother you
&lrm;they've all been punished?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.340
&lrm;No, why would it? They all seemed
&lrm;to enjoy getting dirty making cookies.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.620
&lrm;How's it different than cleaning floors?

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.220
&lrm;They should be thanking me, if anything!

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.020
&lrm;Chloé,
&lrm;how long have you and I been friends?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.020
&lrm;Since we were adorable little tots,
&lrm;Adri-kins!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.380
&lrm;Well, I'm sorry Chloé,
&lrm;but I can't be friends with someone

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.940
&lrm;who treats others like this.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.220
&lrm;You've got to be nice to people!

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.100
&lrm;N... Nice?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.300
&lrm;Yes, nice. It's not that hard!

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.420
&lrm;Mademoiselle does not look
&lrm;very happy today.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.780
&lrm;[sobs]

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.340
&lrm;Adrien says I have to be nice to everyone
&lrm;or he won't be my friend any more!

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.300
&lrm;How can he do this to me, Jean-Michel?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.380
&lrm;Uh, my name is... Hmm. Never mind.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.420
&lrm;Perhaps Mademoiselle
&lrm;can seek comfort with Mr Cuddly?

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.580
&lrm;If you would allow it, Mademoiselle,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.660
&lrm;I could help you
&lrm;keep your friendship with Adrien.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.620
&lrm;Why would you do a thing like that,
&lrm;Jean-Jacques?

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.420
&lrm;Because that's
&lrm;what being nice is all about.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.660
&lrm;I'm sure Mademoiselle can remember
&lrm;when she was a little girl,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.860
&lrm;when Mr Cuddly was always nice
&lrm;to Mademoiselle when she was sad.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.900
&lrm;Mr Cuddly can teach you
&lrm;how to be kind to others.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.020
&lrm;I remember, Jean-Luc! Adrien's
&lrm;going to see just how nice I can be!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.420
&lrm;Hmm.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.780
&lrm;These are jewels I design
&lrm;that you can customise yourself.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.340
&lrm;Ooh!

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.860
&lrm;-They're so cute!
&lrm;-Hold on! Nobody move!

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.780
&lrm;This one would make an awesome home
&lrm;page image your future blog, wouldn't it?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.860
&lrm;-Chloé?
&lrm;-What does that bratty snob want?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.540
&lrm;Chloé's inviting me to a party!

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.300
&lrm;-Me too!
&lrm;-Me too.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.300
&lrm;-Me too.
&lrm;-That's so nice of Chloé!

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.500
&lrm;"Chloé" and "nice" in the same sentence?
&lrm;Can't be her.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.940
&lrm;Maybe somebody hacked her phone, then.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.780
&lrm;-I haven't received a text.
&lrm;-Then that means it must be Chloé!

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.580
&lrm;Ugh! The baker girl as well?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.980
&lrm;It's what Mr Cuddly would do, yes.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.940
&lrm;Ugh!

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.260
&lrm;-Ew! She invited me!
&lrm;-Awesome! This will be so much fun!

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.460
&lrm;Wait! You're actually gonna go?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.540
&lrm;She probably wants to say sorry.
&lrm;Maybe she's nice... very, very deep down.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.620
&lrm;Chloé?
&lrm;No. She's the exact opposite of nice!

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.820
&lrm;Whatever. You guys can go,
&lrm;but don't count me in!

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.860
&lrm;It's Nino.
&lrm;He's going to the party with Adrien.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.300
&lrm;OK, yes, you guys are right.
&lrm;We should give Chloé one more chance.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.620
&lrm;A party being thrown
&lrm;by the most spiteful girl in all of Paris?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.260
&lrm;Such a fertile breeding ground
&lrm;for negative emotions!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.540
&lrm;Fly away, my evil akuma!

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.940
&lrm;Finding a victim
&lrm;to evilise should be a piece of cake!

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.580
&lrm;Mademoiselle should go greet her guests
&lrm;in a welcoming manner,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.540
&lrm;with a hug and a kiss.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.020
&lrm;You're kidding, Jean-Claude?

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.700
&lrm;You really expect me
&lrm;to let their cheeks touch mine?

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.500
&lrm;Well, it's what Mr Cuddly would do.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.940
&lrm;This way you will prove to your good
&lrm;friend Adrien that you really are nice.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.900
&lrm;This whole party thing's way weird.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.340
&lrm;Well, I've known Chloé for a long time,
&lrm;and she can actually be cool sometimes!

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.100
&lrm;Adri-kins!

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.860
&lrm;What do you think of me hosting a party?
&lrm;Really nice of me, right?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.460
&lrm;It's awesome, Chloé!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.420
&lrm;-Hey, there!
&lrm;-Hey, Chloé!

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.500
&lrm;Thanks for the invite, Chloé.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.980
&lrm;Ugh!

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.900
&lrm;[gasping]

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.700
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha!
&lrm;I should've got you guys on video!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.380
&lrm;Don't rub it in!

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.340
&lrm;I did it. Adrien seems happy.
&lrm;Are we done now?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.260
&lrm;If I may be so bold, in order to reaffirm
&lrm;Adrien of her kindness,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.620
&lrm;Mademoiselle might go and check
&lrm;her guests are having a good time.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.820
&lrm;And why would I do that, Jean-Marc?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.380
&lrm;Because that's what Mr Cuddly would do.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.620
&lrm;All right! Fine! I get it!

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.860
&lrm;Aaah!

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.060
&lrm;Having a good time?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.100
&lrm;Woo! All this dancing's made me thirsty!
&lrm;Do you know where the ice cubes are?

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.260
&lrm;How should I know?
&lrm;I'm not your servant! Find them yourself!

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.180
&lrm;And if you're so hot, why not take off
&lrm;your fake, sheepskin sweater?

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.540
&lrm;-Throw it in the trash, where it belongs!
&lrm;-Oh!

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.700
&lrm;I knew I wouldn't have to wait very long.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.140
&lrm;Ahem!

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.300
&lrm;[fake laugh]

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.100
&lrm;I'm totally joking. I love mutton!

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.820
&lrm;I'll get you those ice cubes!

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.860
&lrm;What are you doing, Miss Bourgeois?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.700
&lrm;Where's that natural cruelty
&lrm;I'm counting on?

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.460
&lrm;This BFF act she's doing
&lrm;is just one big charade!

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.020
&lrm;-She's just doing it to please Adrien!
&lrm;-Ahem! How funny!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.300
&lrm;Reminds me of a girl who didn't want to go
&lrm;to a party till she heard Adrien would go.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.540
&lrm;Please don't compare me to Chloé!

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.500
&lrm;[slow music starts]

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.540
&lrm;Chloé, how about a dance
&lrm;with an awesome guy?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.220
&lrm;-I'd love it. Where is he?
&lrm;-Hmm?

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.180
&lrm;Oh, here he is, right in front of me!

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.540
&lrm;Grr!

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.860
&lrm;-Go over and ask him, girl!
&lrm;-Uh? What? Adrien? No! You're crazy!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.900
&lrm;-Hey, Marinette! You wanna dance?
&lrm;-Uh...

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.580
&lrm;What? I am speechless!

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.980
&lrm;Thanks!
&lrm;You're a pretty good dancer yourself!

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.780
&lrm;See?
&lrm;Chloé's on her best behaviour tonight.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.340
&lrm;I'm not letting her dance with Adrien
&lrm;under my roof!

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.580
&lrm;Hey! The song's not over yet!

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.780
&lrm;-If I may say, Mademoiselle ought to--
&lrm;-Move, Jean-Jacques!

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.740
&lrm;Oh, please, Chloé dear!

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.820
&lrm;You've been such a good little girl!

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.500
&lrm;Mr Cuddly's so very proud of you!

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.260
&lrm;Is that your teddy bear, Chloé?

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.260
&lrm;[laughter]

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.380
&lrm;I've had it with your stupid teddy bear,
&lrm;your stupid advice, and you,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.580
&lrm;-Jean-whatever-your-stupid-name-is!
&lrm;-Mademoiselle, I was trying to help.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.500
&lrm;There's no more "Mademoiselle,"
&lrm;no more help, no more anything!

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.340
&lrm;You are fired! Now get out!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.100
&lrm;Ah! I knew I wouldn't be disappointed!

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.420
&lrm;Hello, Despair Bear, I am Hawk Moth.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.140
&lrm;You've always been
&lrm;such a good influence on Chloé.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.740
&lrm;But now you get to be
&lrm;a bad influence for everyone,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.380
&lrm;and a very evil one, at that!

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.700
&lrm;With great pleasure, sir.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.580
&lrm;You've been very naughty, Chloé-kins,
&lrm;and Despair Bear is not proud of you!

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.220
&lrm;The time has come to make you pay!

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.100
&lrm;-Come here, Chloé.
&lrm;-Sabrina? What's gotten into you?

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.180
&lrm;Let me brush your hair.
&lrm;I promise I won't hurt you.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.660
&lrm;Aaah! Somebody stop her!

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.460
&lrm;Touch one hair on Chloé's head
&lrm;and you'll have to answer to me!

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.300
&lrm;Oh! What a gentleman! Despair Bear
&lrm;praises a knight in shining armour!

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.820
&lrm;I think I've had too much orange juice.
&lrm;I gotta go. See ya!

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.100
&lrm;No problem.
&lrm;I have something to do anyway! See ya!

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.740
&lrm;-Chloé?
&lrm;-Don't you come near me!

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.020
&lrm;-Why? What's going on?
&lrm;-Kim, do something!

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.500
&lrm;-Would you like to dance, Chloé?
&lrm;-Ugh!

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.900
&lrm;I gotta transform, Tikki!
&lrm;Too bad I had to stop dancing with Adrien.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.260
&lrm;It felt like I was dancing
&lrm;on a little cloud!

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.700
&lrm;An out-of-body experience! It was like...

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.380
&lrm;Marinette! Focus!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.700
&lrm;[groaning]

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.580
&lrm;OK! Back down to Earth.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.860
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.820
&lrm;Let go, you evil dork!
&lrm;You're messing up my hair!

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.140
&lrm;-I hope you're having fun, Chloé-kins!
&lrm;-Whoa!

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.780
&lrm;About time! What took you so long?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.100
&lrm;That's a very slippery dance floor!

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.020
&lrm;Aaah! A mouse!

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.860
&lrm;Move aside, all of you!

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.700
&lrm;Look out!

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.220
&lrm;How about a little game of Flying Chairs?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.540
&lrm;Ladybug! What happened?

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.660
&lrm;-Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Huh? Where'd he go?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.100
&lrm;What are you doing?

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.780
&lrm;-Oh! Oh, no!
&lrm;-Despair Bear!

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.500
&lrm;If you want to continue playing this game,
&lrm;give me Ladybug's Miraculous!

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.460
&lrm;Oh! Pretty earrings!

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.900
&lrm;Cat Noir, it's me! Stop it!

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.780
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.820
&lrm;Paws off, kitty!

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.940
&lrm;-Thank you!
&lrm;-Hey, I was really nice just then!

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.060
&lrm;Did you see? No?

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.540
&lrm;You're all so lame!

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.820
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.900
&lrm;-A fork?
&lrm;-You little brat!

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.500
&lrm;She's crazy,
&lrm;she's never gone make it without me!

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.500
&lrm;OK!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.100
&lrm;Hey, stop! Oh!

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.420
&lrm;Naughty, naughty Ladybug!

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.500
&lrm;Chloé, would you be so kind?

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.940
&lrm;OK, Ladybug!

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.460
&lrm;No, stop! What's happening?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.780
&lrm;Ladybug? What are you doing?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.500
&lrm;Oh, nothing. Just saving your skin
&lrm;with the help of our new sidekick!

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.780
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous!
&lrm;You haven't defeated me yet!

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.500
&lrm;Watch your step, Cat Noir!

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.340
&lrm;I've got this little guy under control.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.420
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.100
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.700
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.420
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.460
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.140
&lrm;Thanks for helping me out there.
&lrm;That was... really nice of you!

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.740
&lrm;-I know, wasn't it?
&lrm;-Mademoiselle, I must confess

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.220
&lrm;-I don't remember anything.
&lrm;-Well, basically, you turned evil,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.380
&lrm;and I saved you. In fact, without me,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.780
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;wouldn't have succeeded!

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.780
&lrm;I'm even better than you superheroes.
&lrm;I don't even need a costume!

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.260
&lrm;-Gotta get going!
&lrm;-Yeah, me too.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.780
&lrm;You know what?
&lrm;I'm suddenly feeling very generous.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.420
&lrm;I think that thing of yours
&lrm;about being nice might make some sense.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.700
&lrm;-I've decided to keep you on after all!
&lrm;-Mademoiselle is so kind.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.100
&lrm;Don't let the guests go away,
&lrm;Jean-Baptiste.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.500
&lrm;They mustn't miss what's coming up next!

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.220
&lrm;Ladybug, if you hadn't been helped,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.820
&lrm;defeating you
&lrm;would have been child's play!

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.140
&lrm;So you'd better watch out.
&lrm;Your day of devastation is coming soon.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.780
&lrm;Great job, kids!
&lrm;You've done some really good work!

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.940
&lrm;[cheering]

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.460
&lrm;That was a great idea,
&lrm;inviting Marinette's dad!

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.300
&lrm;I know! This way, no one can be mad at me
&lrm;for calling the fire department.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.260
&lrm;I'm really nice now.
&lrm;Did you notice, Adri-kins?

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.460
&lrm;Even Ladybug said so.
&lrm;Didn't she, Jean-Pascal?

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.180
&lrm;I'm proud of you, Chloé! You've proven
&lrm;you can be nicer to everyone.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.580
&lrm;Oh, Adri-kins, so we'll always be
&lrm;best friends forever? Pinky swear?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.780
&lrm;Pinky swear.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.420
&lrm;Phew!

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.380
&lrm;So...

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.820
&lrm;Those macaroons are dreadfully ugly!

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.580
&lrm;Those are so greasy
&lrm;you could see yourself in them!

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.220
&lrm;Ugh! Too disgusting for comment!

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.860
&lrm;Yours look horrible!

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.820
&lrm;She'll never change.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.300
&lrm;-May I?
&lrm;-Yeah, sure!

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.780
&lrm;I mean, what?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.340
&lrm;-Have a macaroon.
&lrm;-Yes! Of course.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.540
&lrm;Oh, sorry! I'm so clumsy!

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.900
&lrm;It's OK!

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.780
&lrm;Wow, this is really good!
&lrm;Your baking is as good as your dancing.
