1
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,759
Good morning.

2
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,719
Would you like some coffee, tea?

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,439
Some toast with ham and tomato?

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
No? Nothing?

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Of course not. You're on duty.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,119
I hadn't noticed.

7
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,719
Don't worry, I'm fine.

8
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,879
What are you looking at? Want a picture?

9
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,840
It's not like it's the first time
someone's been arrested here.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
She's right.

11
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,560
Before, we just had a murderer
and a wannabe con artist.

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Now that the narco has been arrested,
Las Encinas looks like Guantanamo.

13
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,319
Shall we go to class?

14
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,680
Look at you two together.
Are you friends again?

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,719
Step by step.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,519
Sure.

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
I don't get what's going on
at this fucking school, really.

18
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,000
Ready for Valentine's Day?

19
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,719
There'll be flowers, the best restaurant,

20
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,519
-a few surprises...
-Please.

21
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,040
Actually, we always celebrate
at Lu's, right?

22
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,920
-Yes.
-I don't.

23
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,200
I was never asked,

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,560
-not for Valentine's or anything else.
-Yeah.

25
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,840
As for me, I don't feel like it this year.

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't want to throw a party

27
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,080
because I'm crazy busy with exams
and the Columbia program, so...

28
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,400
Is that why?
Or because you ended up alone?

29
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,960
What did my mom say?

30
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,960
The usual stuff:
"How are you? How was school?

31
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,400
Is your mom some mobster drug dealer?"

32
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,439
What if she was?

33
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,360
Was it my fault that my dad
went to jail?

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,719
Can we help you?

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,360
Well...

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,439
would you lend me some cash?

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,039
For the bus, the 314.
I take it to visit my mother in jail.

38
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,680
For fuck's sake. Here.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,439
Take a taxi.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
-Hey, Lu.
-What?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,639
It's not my business,
but the whole party thing...

42
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,680
It's because you don't have
the money to host it, right?

43
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,400
Right, it's not your business...

44
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,000
darling.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,639
Okay.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Fuck.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
We even have an audience.
They have everything here.

48
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,159
Spoiler alert.
You won't be winning Mother of the Year.

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey. This is just a bump in the road.

50
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,919
It's nothing we can't handle.
We always hang in there.

51
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,439
"We"? Don't kid yourself.
There's no "we" here.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,719
Baby, you're pissed off, I get it.
I'm telling you,

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,120
I'll be out before you know it.

54
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,360
Sure... What the hell will I live on
until then?

55
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,719
Never mind.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,599
I'll have to break the piggy bank.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Rebe...

58
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,879
Fight.

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,479
Don't let them win.

60
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,040
Keep boxing.
You're letting yourself go.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
I know Valentine's Day
is a Christian thing...

62
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,959
but it's just dinner.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,240
I told you I can't.

64
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,399
Besides, it's my mother's birthday.

65
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,360
I see.

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,839
But thanks for the invitation.

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,439
Honey...

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Go! It's OK.

69
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,600
Mom.

70
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,720
Would you like to celebrate with us?
It's a Michelin-star restaurant.

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Thanks, son, but...
it's a little out of our price range.

72
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,360
It's on the house.

73
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
The owners are friends of my father's.

74
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,720
Mom, you deserve it.

75
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,720
Bring whoever you want.
Omar will come, too, right?

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,879
Omar will always have a place
at our table...

77
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,360
but he won't take it.

78
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,759
Thank you for the invitation.

79
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,920
We will go with you.

80
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,800
When do I get what you promised me?

81
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,720
It's not easy. We need time.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,639
What do you mean?

83
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,759
If it isn't the Queen of the South!
What a surprise. Come in, please.

84
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,120
Be careful, a horse's head
could turn up in your bed.

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
-Come on in.
-Sure.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,680
-What are you doing here?
-What about you?

87
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,879
I've been calling you.
Who were you talking to?

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,720
The phone company. The bastards kept me
on hold for half an hour.

89
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,920
I didn't realize it
with all the commotion, but...

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,480
I can't go back home.

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,560
Can I crash here?

92
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,279
Yes.

93
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,040
Thanks, Samu.

94
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,759
You're the only one I have left.

95
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,360
It's no problem.

96
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,639
But only because
you're my only option.

97
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,839
This Valentine's Day will be different.
I'll be planning it.

98
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,600
-"Reverse Valentine's"?
-That's right.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,639
Come on, seriously. It's so archaic,
boring, cheesy...

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Flowers, chocolate, colors...

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,879
And we girls act like fucking objects,

102
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,959
spending hours at the hairdresser's
to look pretty for them.

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,879
It's over.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,959
I had this great idea
that it should be the other way around.

105
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,519
Let the boys show some...

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,759
skin.

107
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,199
The girls will get dressed up
in elegant tuxedos--

108
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,199
Smoking jackets, to be clear.

109
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,040
We have to bring our own drinks?

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Yes, everything's reversed.

111
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,720
The guests bring their alcohol
and their food,

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,399
and I, the hostess and queen of the night,
will just enjoy it.

113
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,040
That way, the lowlifes

114
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,800
won't think it's an NGO
and take everything home.

115
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,160
Clever...

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,879
Whatever, we'll have our own party.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
Don't mind her.
You guys coming to the party?

118
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,839
-No, they're not.
-Is the party at your house now?

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,680
No, and you got kicked out of yours.
For using, I guess.

120
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,279
Since when do you have something
against drugs, Guzmán?

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,639
Remember, you used to beg me for them.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,040
I have something against traitors...
and murderers.

123
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,360
Why are you defending them?

124
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,800
-I don't need to explain myself to you.
-Enough, Valerio, please.

125
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,439
What do you say, Lu?

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,439
-You mean me?
-Yes.

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,360
What a dilemma. I'm like Switzerland here.

128
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
A rich, beautiful country

129
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,040
that doesn't get involved
in anyone's wars.

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
-Lu.
-What do you want?

131
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,040
Can we talk for a sec?

132
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,000
Fine...

133
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,480
-but you'll need to get cleaned up first.
-What?

134
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,319
What the fuck, Lu?

135
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,839
You fucking ruined my life, asshole.

136
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,319
Lu, I just want to talk--

137
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,240
Come. You can't let them
exclude you like that.

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,079
What'll we get out of it?

139
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
A shitty night with everyone ignoring us?

140
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,159
You won't be alone. You'll be with me.

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,679
It won't do you any good.
Do you get that?

142
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,440
That's too bad.
I hate everything that's good for me.

143
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,559
I also hate vegetables, exercising,

144
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,679
I hate hanging out
with the right people...

145
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,559
and I hate doing what people expect of me.

146
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,840
Still...

147
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,200
it's absurd. We can't go
as a threesome to a Valentine's Day party.

148
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,759
Why not?

149
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,639
I like you both.

150
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,519
I don't know what they told you,

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,320
but the thing
between Carla, Christian, and me...

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
didn't end well.

153
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,360
Damn, Lu was right.

154
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,159
You have to turn all this around.

155
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,720
-Or maybe you guys don't like me...
-We do.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
-I mean...
-We do?

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,679
But that's not the point, because...

158
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,480
this is just crazy, right?

159
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,519
A beautiful kind of crazy.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,320
Come to the party with me.

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,320
Our lives are complicated enough.

162
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,279
Good work, Lu, as always.

163
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,720
Nadia...

164
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,960
you have two days to redo this.

165
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,759
You won't get into the program
if you don't.

166
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,919
I know you can do much better, OK?

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
-Nadia, are you all right?
-Yes.

168
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,120
The teacher must've used
all his red ink grading this.

169
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,440
At least he gave you a second chance.

170
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,960
I wish I could use it.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,159
-What?
-I don't have time.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,519
My parents go to rehabilitation every day.
I watch the store.

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,080
Just tell them you can't.

174
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
You should know I can't do that.

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
-How are you?
-Hi.

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,919
Guzmán, right?

177
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
-Yes.
-Malick.

178
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,679
Nice to meet you.
Nadia's told me a lot about you.

179
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,000
Really? She never mentioned you.

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,960
You don't talk that much lately, right?

181
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,799
Thanks for your concern. See you tomorrow.

182
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,720
Bye, man. Nice to meet you.

183
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,159
It's Mom's birthday.

184
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,360
-She'd be so happy if you came.
-And Dad?

185
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,039
He wants to see you, too.

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
Right.

187
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,639
When I tell him I'm with an atheist guy,
he'll have another stroke.

188
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,559
You don't need to say it.

189
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,639
Sorry, how's this your business?

190
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,639
Apart from paying for the meal and stuff.

191
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,679
He's my boyfriend.

192
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,919
Right, and he's my boyfriend.

193
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,720
I can't take him to dinner,
I can't talk about him,

194
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,279
I can't say I love him.

195
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,039
My happiness makes our parents unhappy.

196
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,039
Can you imagine what that's like?
No, right?

197
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,960
Have a nice day.

198
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,919
It would be after dinner.

199
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
Some music...

200
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,840
A quiet party, you know?
Lucrecia is organizing it.

201
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,399
Isn't she that friend of yours 
who speaks Arabic?

202
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,360
Yusef, let's go to rehabilitation.

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,559
Hello.

204
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,000
What are you doing here?

205
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,399
Buying asparagus.

206
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,960
What's up, Malick?

207
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,519
Hi, Nadia, what's up?

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Thought you'd be studying
after what the teacher said.

209
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,919
What did he say?

210
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,879
It's just that...

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,840
I haven't been able to spend much time
on the Columbia program.

212
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,440
Working here in the afternoons

213
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,960
doesn't leave me time...

214
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,480
for schoolwork.

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,840
I'm sorry, honey. What can I do?
I have nobody else.

216
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,399
It's OK, Dad.

217
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,720
I told you because you asked.

218
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,679
She's missing out
on a great opportunity,

219
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,840
-and you're doing nothing.
-Guzmán!

220
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Are you telling me how to treat my family?

221
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,960
I clearly don't have to...
You've only driven away two kids.

222
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,679
-Are you here to insult me?
-I'm worried about Nadia.

223
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,480
Others aren't, so they keep quiet.

224
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,679
It's true what they say...
You don't respect anything.

225
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,919
Malick! Guzmán, go now.

226
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,320
If you're so clever...

227
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,720
-what do you suggest I do?
-Hire someone.

228
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,559
How did I not think of that?

229
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,840
Everything's easy if you have money.

230
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,759
If you care about her future,
you'll find a way.

231
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Guzmán, please!

232
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,440
If you're so worried,
why don't you do it?

233
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,960
You want to help her, don't you?

234
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,000
Or is getting your hands dirty
beneath you?

235
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,840
Sure... Unpaid work, I suppose.

236
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Three euros an hour.
People working in the fields earn less.

237
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,600
Deal.

238
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
You won't last one day.

239
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,559
Can you pass me an apron
or whatever you wear?

240
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,159
I'll never forgive you for this.

241
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,279
-I'm doing this for you.
-No, you're doing it for yourself,

242
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
out of pride.

243
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,799
SHANAA GROCERIES

244
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,519
Want to take a picture?

245
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,279
Get out of here.

246
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm working here, dammit.

247
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,559
What the fuck!

248
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,000
Is this how you work?
Scaring away customers?

249
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,600
-I'm not a circus monkey.
-Circus monkey?

250
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,360
-Be careful.
-So... what else is there to do?

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Finish cleaning
and organize the boxes inside.

252
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Tomorrow, you'll do it all again.

253
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,159
And again and again...

254
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,200
Did you think one day would help Nadia?

255
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,840
You'd need to be here every day
until the end of the school year.

256
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,639
Bye.

257
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,399
Fuck!

258
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,600
It's not that I don’t even have the money
to buy you a beer.

259
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,519
The problem is I don't know
what I'll live on until she's out.

260
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,840
-That is, if she gets out.
-She will.

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
Maybe this will push her to stop.

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,159
You'd live a quieter life,
without thugs and the police.

263
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,679
I'll have to thank the snitch in the end.

264
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,279
I know there's a snitch in all this.

265
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,159
I'll have to go home
and break the piggy bank.

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,279
What?

267
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,039
My mother makes slits in an armchair
we have in the basement

268
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,320
so she can stash cash for emergencies.

269
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
The cops sealed off your house.

270
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,159
-What if you get caught?
-What'll they do? Huh?

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,960
I don't know,
and I don't want to find out.

272
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,639
If anything happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

273
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,519
Samuel... this isn't your fault.

274
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,639
Rebeka, look--

275
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,639
What would you like?

276
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,960
I admire you... Seriously.

277
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,480
Being up-front and honest takes courage.

278
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,960
Right. Is that why you want me to lie?

279
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,600
You think I don't lie?

280
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,759
My dad loves me
because he doesn't know me.

281
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,559
Okay, surprise me. What's your secret?

282
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,120
Can I get a gin and tonic?

283
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,919
OK, man. You want to compare?

284
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,399
Know what the Koran says about lying?

285
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,559
No... Haven't read it for ages.

286
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,639
It says that lying is fine
as long as it achieves peace among people.

287
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,559
My father's 65...
I want him to die in peace.

288
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,879
Well, listen...

289
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,240
this abominable sin...

290
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,639
is on the house.

291
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,799
Why are you worried about me?

292
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,039
You don't know me.

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,720
Because I'm in love with your sister,
and I want to make her happy.

294
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,639
Thanks.

295
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,960
What're you looking at?

296
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,559
Nothing... just the restaurant
for tomorrow.

297
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,039
Should I reserve a table?

298
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,960
Could be cool, right?

299
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,720
Something different.

300
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,519
There'll be lots of hot guys
showing some skin, for once.

301
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,720
Sounds like fun.

302
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,160
Sounds dumb.

303
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,279
All right... I'll go on my own, then.

304
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,559
Fine. I hope you have a fucking ball.

305
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,559
If I want us to go together, that's bad.
If I go alone, it's worse.

306
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,240
And if I stay in with you,
you treat me like crap.

307
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,119
What the hell should I do, Ander?

308
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,839
Don't spoil the little time I have left.

309
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,359
That so much to ask?

310
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,359
Let's go to class.

311
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,880
-Give me a clue!
-Nope!

312
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,400
So serious, Lu! Happy Valentine's Day!

313
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,079
Ander!

314
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,039
I think... you should lay off Omar a bit.

315
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,279
Why?

316
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you know how lucky you are to have
someone who's always there for you?

317
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
Don't blow it, dude.

318
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,440
Thanks.

319
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,559
Sure.

320
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,720
Happy Valentine's Day.

321
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,000
If you bring someone, bring more to drink.

322
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm going solo.
But if they're there, I won't stay.

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,079
Bonnie and Clyde?

324
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
I set rattraps in case they come.

325
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
Aren't you Switzerland?

326
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
You know? I'm not.

327
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
I don't want to leave you
on your own in this war.

328
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,039
We've always fought side by side.

329
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,799
We're... Lu and Guzmán, right?

330
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll get another one.

331
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,480
-No, you said this was the last one.
-Just one more!

332
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,960
Shit!

333
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
Careful, guys. Guzmán!

334
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,720
Help me clean up
before anyone else gets hurt.

335
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,839
Where's the neck?

336
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,440
Excuse me. 

337
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,079
Rebeka, would you come , please?

338
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,839
Come with me.

339
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,920
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it here.

340
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,839
The Parents Association
has made things very difficult.

341
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,759
The charges against your mom are serious,
and the school's reputation is at risk.

342
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
You're kicking me out, right?

343
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,200
We'll offer you the chance
to drop out voluntarily.

344
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,039
Your record won't be tarnished.

345
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,599
Shit... How thoughtful!

346
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,319
You just have to sign this document.

347
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,640
No.

348
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Kick me out.

349
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,160
-Let the whole fucking school know.
-What?

350
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,359
Let everyone from here to China know that
when a rich kid's dad went to jail,

351
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,400
-he didn't get kicked out.
-Don't shout.

352
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,559
-What's going on?
-Go back to class.

353
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,519
Let fucking everyone know
that I'm getting kicked out!

354
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,319
But if your moms fund a scholarship,
you don't get expelled,

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,160
-even if you're a murderer!
-Ander!

356
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,799
-You can't expel her.
-We're not. It's voluntary.

357
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
-Then, I'm leaving too.
-What?

358
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,279
If she leaves, I leave.

359
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,599
Me too.

360
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,240
And me.

361
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
And me.

362
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,079
And me!

363
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,680
What's going on?

364
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,880
I'll try to talk
to the steering committee.

365
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,279
OK?

366
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,200
Go back to class, please.

367
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,519
What a mess you've made, kiddo.

368
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,640
Thank you.

369
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,160
You're welcome.

370
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,599
I need you to...

371
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,119
help me mess things up a bit more.

372
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,200
What?

373
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,519
Don't! You can't touch that.
It'd be too obvious.

374
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,799
This way.

375
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,799
Go over.

376
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,960
You're heavy!

377
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,279
Fuck! Shit!

378
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,200
Be careful!

379
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,119
-You have springs in your shoes?
-And much more.

380
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,440
Come down.

381
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,400
-Why the hell do you have that?
-To peel fruit. What else?

382
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,440
Is it there?

383
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't know.

384
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,119
Nothing.

385
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,759
Fuck.

386
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,160
She didn't say anything?

387
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,359
Nothing.

388
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,759
Just that I was letting myself go.
That piece of--

389
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
What?

390
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,720
She said, "Keep boxing."

391
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,839
She told me to keep boxing.

392
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,559
Fuck.

393
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,519
I can't believe this.

394
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,079
Do you like my Bumblebee?

395
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,759
-What?
-Bumblebee, Transformers.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Never mind.

397
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I wish you signed things
as fast as you bought cars.

398
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,839
So you only like me 
if I invest in your wine business?

399
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,440
No. I like people who keep their word.

400
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,279
That investment isn't a car.

401
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,079
It's 10,000 cars.

402
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,480
It's not like pulling out your credit card
and buying... I don't know... this?

403
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
For the party?

404
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,799
You'll look very sexy in it.
It's for you, right?

405
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
-The roles are reversed tonight.
-No.

406
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,119
Just because your friend
has gone all feminist,

407
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm not looking like an ass
for our first Valentine's.

408
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,200
We'll look like asses
if we don't follow the dress code.

409
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,759
Everyone will stare.

410
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,119
Let them stare...

411
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,160
at how amazing you look

412
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,640
on my arm.

413
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,079
Maybe I'd rather go alone.

414
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,839
What does that mean?

415
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,559
Nothing.

416
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,480
-How are you, Yeray?
-Great.

417
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,079
Honey, don't be so fussy.

418
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,720
You should thank Yeray
for being so considerate with you.

419
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,000
With me, right?

420
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Put that dress on 
and stop behaving like a little girl.

421
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,359
Please.

422
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
We haven't closed so early in ages.

423
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,400
There isn't much business
at this time anyway.

424
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,240
But don't worry about that.

425
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,359
Focus on what you need to do.

426
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,519
What about the store?

427
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,960
There's no need to open every day.

428
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,119
Or go to the hospital either.

429
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm already perfectly fine.

430
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,119
What do they say? "Strong as a mule."

431
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
"As an ox," Dad. Strong as an ox.

432
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,680
Strong as an ox.

433
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,680
Are we still waiting or...?

434
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,119
Yes.

435
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,640
No.

436
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,960
We'll order now.

437
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
Hi.

438
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,599
Sorry I'm late.

439
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,400
Dad.

440
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,880
Son.

441
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,079
We need to get rid of this now.

442
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,240
How much can you get for this shit?

443
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,480
This is Molly, so a few thousand.

444
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,160
-What's it matter?
-I don't have money to buy food.

445
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,799
I don't care if we eat 
rice with tomato sauce forever,

446
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
-you're not doing this.
-He's right.

447
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
You're not doing it. I am.

448
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,480
I'll sell it.

449
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,759
We'll be partners...

450
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,240
and go fifty-fifty. How's that?

451
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:50,440
Partnering with you
is even worse than pushing drugs.

452
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,480
-That's a no.
-What's wrong? I'm a reputable guy.

453
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,039
-We'll flush it down the toilet.
-No!

454
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,440
Let's think this through...
before doing anything stupid.

455
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,519
And that goes for you both, OK?

456
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,119
How's school going?

457
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,039
Well... I'm doing my best.

458
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,200
Between work and helping at home,
I don't have much time.

459
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,599
Great. You must be grateful
to whoever has taken you in.

460
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,599
Who do you live with now?

461
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,759
Ander and his mom.

462
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
-Ander is...
-A friend.

463
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,039
Mom, you met him at the hospital...

464
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,279
Remember?

465
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,119
Oh... yes.

466
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,799
How is he?

467
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,400
He's fine.

468
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,359
What's wrong, honey?

469
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,119
Don't say it's nothing. I know you.

470
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,039
The thing is...

471
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,519
he has leukemia.

472
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
What?

473
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,880
Ander?

474
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,680
I do my best to help him.

475
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,480
I go with him to chemo,
I look after him...

476
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,519
School isn't the most important thing
right now.

477
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,599
Son, you are a very good boy,

478
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,799
but... that isn't your duty.

479
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,279
Let his family take care of him.

480
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,039
Ander is my family.

481
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,079
His family are his parents,
his siblings...

482
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,160
He's my boyfriend, Dad.

483
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,640
You just need to focus
on your studies

484
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
and keep out of trouble.

485
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,559
Did you hear me, Dad?

486
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,400
You're a very smart boy,
and if you focus--

487
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,079
-Did you hear me?
-And did you hear me?

488
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm sorry. I can't.

489
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm sorry, Mom.

490
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,920
Lía, honey, you brought champagne!

491
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,240
Thanks!

492
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,440
So good to see you! Thank you.

493
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,720
-What about the booze?
-It's over there.

494
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,440
Perfect. I love the outfit. It's amazing.

495
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,759
Who invited you two?
Where's the booze?

496
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,799
No, you can't bring that here.

497
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,200
Go to the nearest store
and bring some alcohol, OK?

498
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,720
My God, look who's here.

499
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,359
Stunning.

500
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
-Thank you. You, too.
-Thanks.

501
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,240
-Enjoying it, huh?
-Nothing I haven't already seen...

502
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,440
enough of.

503
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,799
I thought as much.

504
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I'm impressed. I love it!

505
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,559
I don't remember hiring a magician.

506
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,119
I think table three
just ordered their check.

507
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,119
We were just saying
how genius this party is, right, Rebe?

508
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,880
Put the bottle over there.

509
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,400
-Thanks, hon.
-Thank you.

510
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,559
I'd say it takes one genius
to appreciate another.

511
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,440
But tonight, we're judging you
by your appearance.

512
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,519
-You look spectacular.
-Thanks, babe.

513
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,279
You should smile more!

514
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,880
-Very handsome, but too serious.
-What's next?

515
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,400
You slap our asses
and harass us on the dance floor?

516
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,079
-Hey, Samu?
-What's up, man?

517
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,359
-Great.
-And yes...

518
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,920
-Take it as a compliment.
-OK.

519
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,160
This is a cool party.

520
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,880
I know. Me and my ideas.

521
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Polo, Caye, I'm in my house.

522
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,079
Well... my former house.

523
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,319
This party's looking pretty good.

524
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,319
Let me know if you come.

525
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Look at this circus, Daddy!

526
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,039
Good evening.

527
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,720
-All good?
-Yeah, I don't think I'll be staying long.

528
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,440
Give me a second.

529
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,400
You know today is the other way around.

530
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,519
Why don't you fucking go "home"
and read a book?

531
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,279
I don't believe you...

532
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,400
The most persistent competitor
of all time!

533
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,440
You still want to be
with Guzmán, seriously?

534
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,759
-It's not a good night to be alone.
-It never is for you.

535
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,119
This is such a great party.

536
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,279
Balloons, screens,
people bringing their own drinks...

537
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,319
How much did this cost you? Ten euros?

538
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Bullshit.

539
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,359
I'm out of here. This party sucks.

540
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,559
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

541
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,640
-We stick out a bit, huh?
-Yeah, just a bit.

542
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,720
-Hi.
-Hi.

543
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,519
You didn't understand
the dress code either, right?

544
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,240
"Reverse"?

545
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,279
Apparently, we're not the only ones.

546
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,319
I see. Excuse me.

547
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Should I resend you the invitation
so you get the idea?

548
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm sorry, Lu.
I will always be a refined lady.

549
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,920
Sure...

550
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,960
Where do I leave this shit?

551
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,559
Right here.

552
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,039
She's so classy.

553
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,440
Pathetic.

554
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,720
Sweetie, we're leaving soon.

555
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,440
I don't want to see you
more than strictly necessary either.

556
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,400
Well...

557
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,119
-Let's enjoy the party.
-Let's.

558
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,360
-To us.
-Cheers!

559
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,079
Lucrecia, your turn.

560
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,239
Your turn.

561
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,199
I can't do it, Nadia.

562
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,920
I can't.

563
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,559
You have to lie.

564
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,000
Listen to me. You have to lie.

565
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,719
Hey.

566
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,039
Hi.

567
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,320
Bathroom.

568
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,159
It's occupied.

569
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,719
Right.

570
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,639
I didn't have time to change.

571
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
It's fine, man. No worries.

572
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,519
You don't want anyone
to question your heterosexuality.

573
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,599
Omar...

574
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,280
I understand you.

575
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,280
What do you understand?
You have no fucking clue--

576
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,519
Ander! How are you? You OK?

577
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,039
-Have you seen Omar?
-Omar? Yes. In the bathroom.

578
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,519
Down... downstairs.

579
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,840
Which? There are like 20.

580
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,320
There's one in the kitchen downstairs,
very far away.

581
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,840
The last one. He's waiting for you there.

582
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,840
You look hot!

583
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,719
I understand you a lot.

584
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,440
A lot.

585
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,519
The duck was delicious.

586
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,639
-Wasn't it?
-It was.

587
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I really liked it.
And the presentation was awesome.

588
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,519
Babe, Polo.

589
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,039
How are you?

590
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,840
Great.

591
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,400
You?

592
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,840
Fine.

593
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,719
Hey, thanks.

594
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,280
For what?

595
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,400
For making a scene.

596
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,760
It worked.

597
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,000
You're stubborn.

598
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,480
Yup.

599
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,840
-Arrogant...
-That too.

600
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,280
-But you're also a good friend.
-I didn't do it to be your friend.

601
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I did it...

602
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,719
because I love you.

603
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
And... do you love me? You love me...

604
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,840
don't you?

605
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,440
Yes...

606
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,280
I love you.

607
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,840
But it's not enough.

608
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Everything's so easy with Malick.

609
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,280
He makes my family so happy.

610
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,199
I could have a future with him.

611
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,159
Not with you.

612
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,960
Love isn't enough.

613
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,840
Hey.

614
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,480
Why are you here?

615
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,480
I...

616
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,440
I came to apologize.

617
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,000
And to see how sexy you looked.

618
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,159
It's OK, don't worry.

619
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,000
-Omar.
-What?

620
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,440
-Everything's OK.
-No, it's not fucking OK.

621
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm really fucked up.

622
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,719
The only one I treat like shit
is you...

623
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,559
because I know you'll be there
no matter what.

624
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,320
No matter how hard I push you,
you come back.

625
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,320
That's not fair. You don't deserve that.

626
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,840
You deserve to be loved.

627
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,760
Will you forgive me?

628
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,800
No.

629
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,119
Dude... you can smile and everything.

630
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
What do you want me to do, Rebe?

631
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,000
Someone I care about 
threw their life away for that shit.

632
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,719
Samuel... look at me, please.

633
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,000
What?

634
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,719
If this means choosing
the cash or you...

635
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,119
I'll flush that shit
down the toilet right now.

636
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,519
I'm getting all romantic, huh?

637
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,039
After saying something that romantic,
we could at least kiss--

638
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,760
Hi.

639
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,880
-Hi.
-How are you?

640
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
-Fine. You?
-Fine.

641
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,119
-This is Ander. Malick.
-What's up?

642
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,840
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

643
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,079
You look amazing.

644
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,880
But you didn't understand
the dress code, did you?

645
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,159
I do feel a little out of place.

646
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,760
Especially looking at you.

647
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,800
Well, you know...

648
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,159
What? No. No way.

649
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,760
Oh, yes, way.
You just have to undo this button...

650
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,320
Well! I see you've...
gotten to know each other.

651
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,920
Come on! Take it off!

652
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Take it off!

653
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,000
Take it off!

654
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,239
Uh...

655
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,920
I found out.

656
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
And I'm really sorry.

657
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,039
I'm here if you need anything, OK?

658
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,960
Don't worry about it. I'm OK.

659
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,719
Of course I'm worried.

660
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,119
We're family, no?

661
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,719
I mean, I can't believe
your own sister kicked you out.

662
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,360
-I mean...
-Well,

663
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,079
I didn't literally get kicked out. 
I left voluntarily.

664
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,039
She's a little out of her mind
ever since my dad disowned her.

665
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,440
-What?
-No.

666
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:47,800
-Your dad did what?
-No.

667
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,480
She's penniless, completely broke.

668
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,639
-Holy shit.
-I don't believe it.

669
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,239
That's what the whole party was about,
people bringing their own drinks.

670
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,239
She's so smart. I'm in awe.

671
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,519
-The party was cool anyway.
-Sure.

672
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,960
I'd have liked to go, you know?

673
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,159
With my see-through top...

674
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,039
man, was I looking good!

675
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
I'd have liked to look at all the guys

676
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,880
the way you look at girls, you know?

677
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,119
We can fix that.

678
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,559
Look at us however you want.

679
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,559
Right, Polo?

680
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,639
Right.

681
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,880
In fact, tonight...

682
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
you're in charge.

683
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,039
-I'm in charge.
-You are.

684
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,519
Whatever you want.

685
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:38,400
OK.

686
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,960
Your wish is our command.

687
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,079
Kiss each other.

688
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Just like that?

689
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,320
Yes.

690
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,320
Come here.

691
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,280
Slowly, so we can enjoy it longer.

692
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,559
Now, Polo... undress him... slowly.

693
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,239
Go down.

694
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,440
Go down.

695
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,360
Down.

696
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,960
I didn't tell you earlier...
but you look amazing.

697
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,400
I know.

698
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,159
Thanks.

699
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,280
Shall we dance?

700
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,559
No.

701
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:28,639
I'm fine like this.

702
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,559
To us.

703
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,320
Cheers!

704
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,880
-Rebeka, do you have a minute?
-Yes, sure.

705
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,000
I spoke with teachers and the board,
and you can stay.

706
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:38,440
Thank you.

707
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,159
Having said that...

708
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,960
I need to remind you we are very strict
with the monthly payments

709
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,079
and the payment deadlines.

710
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,159
And this month...

711
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,760
Damn, the fine print.

712
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,119
If we don't receive the payments...

713
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,079
-I'll have no option--
-Right.

714
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,559
An awesome excuse to kick me out.

715
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,159
We already talked about it!

716
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,880
Samuel, either I sell that stash
or I'm out.

717
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,920
And, man, I don't feel like
letting them get away with it.

718
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,719
-Fine, start dealing.
-Remember how those guys reacted

719
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,039
-when we went on their turf?
-Hey.

720
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,000
I know somewhere with no competition.

721
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,119
Where the market is huge.

722
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,760
Where?

723
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,760
Las Encinas.

724
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,480
You must be joking!

725
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,920
Lu, do you have a minute?

726
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,719
Maybe.

727
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:39,679
I just wanted to...

728
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,800
ask you to be nicer to Cayetana.

729
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,320
To ease up on her a bit,

730
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,599
just leave her alone.

731
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,079
Anything else? I'm in a hurry.

732
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,519
Since you're asking...

733
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,119
Make sure everyone leaves us alone.

734
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,199
You're good at that.
They'll listen to you.

735
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,079
Why would I do that... Polito?

736
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:01,599
-My name's Polo, not Polito.
-Whatever.

737
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,519
The Columbia program
is sponsored by my mothers.

738
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,039
And I don't think
you can afford to lose it.

739
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,559
-What do you mean?
-Yeah.

740
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:11,840
Since your father left you penniless.

741
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,840
Was it you?

742
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,559
Did you kill him?

743
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,800
No.

744
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:31,199
We know each other
more than we'd like to, Lucrecia.

745
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,039
And I think you're lying.

746
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,280
Tell me the truth.

747
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,920
Why are you so shaken up?

748
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,599
What's wrong?

749
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,199
I'm shaken up
because I saw who killed him.

750
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,840
