Sorry. It is not possible to reach...

You left already?

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,200
You disappeared.

Pure, did you talk to Itt?

28
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,120
I can't find him.

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,199
Why don't you answer him?

30
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,079
Do I have to?

31
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,239
Itt...

32
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,440
...you don't have to answer him.

33
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,981
But you have to answer to yourself.

34
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,181
What are you going to do next?

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,559
Is it in the cabinet?

36
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,679
Are you sure
that you lost your earring here?

37
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,359
I'm sure.

38
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,159
Your family is rich.

39
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,239
You could even buy an earring factory.

40
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,840
Why are you wasting your time
searching for one earring?

41
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,520
Waan...

42
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,801
...have you ever had something
that was very important to you?

43
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,900
An irreplaceable item?

44
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,600
That's what...

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,679
...that earring is to me.

46
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,359
If it was that important to you,

47
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,720
you shouldn't have lost it
in the first place.

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
I didn't choose to do that.

49
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,999
Oh, there you are.

50
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,010
I heard that you disappeared last night.

51
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,221
Did you get a girlfriend
and not tell anyone?

52
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,700
Where were you?

53
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,960
Move our things out of this room.

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,119
Sure.

55
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,359
Where are you moving to?

56
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,879
I'm moving out of this clubroom.

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,879
Why are you moving out?

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,661
Didn't you agree to study with me
so that you could get this room?

59
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,621
Isn't this room important to you?

60
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
You've got some nerve to ask me that.

61
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,319
I think you two
should sort this out outside.

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Waan and I will take care of things here.

63
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,999
Come with me.

64
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,960
What?

65
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,040
I said come!

66
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
Did you find it?

67
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,999
This earring is very important
to you, isn't it?

68
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,599
All right.

69
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,359
I'll return it to you
if you move out of the clubroom.

70
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,720
What are you talking about?

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,679
I'm making you an offer.

72
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,999
Just like how Teacher Wilailak
laid down her condition to you.

73
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,600
You knew?

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
This world doesn't want me
to be stupid for long.

75
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,840
I heard your conversation with her.

76
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,520
I told you. A top student like you...

77
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,359
...would be able to help someone
at the bottom of the class, like Ittikorn.

78
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:46,440
You can rest assured
that you didn't do this for free.

79
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,919
The room will belong to the Bishop Club
as per the agreement.

80
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay.

81
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,640
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

82
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,440
What you heard is true.

83
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,000
You're the worst.

84
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,581
No, don't do it.

85
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,260
Give me my earring back.

86
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,640
Please give me my earring back.

87
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,520
I will do whatever you want.

88
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,101
Whatever I want?

89
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,262
Then give me the clubroom.

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,599
Itt...

91
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,959
...you know that I can't do that for you.

92
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,250

93
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,370
...if it's something else, I can do it.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,061
Just tell me what you want.

95
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,961
I'll do anything for you. I promise.

96
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,470
Do you expect me to believe you?

97
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,959
Itt....

98
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,640

100
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160

101
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:11,719
Friend?

102
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,400
Is that what friends are supposed to do?

103
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,400
Do friends lie to each other?

104
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,880
How dare you call yourself my friend?

105
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,370
You're not my friend.

106
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,199
I don't even know you.

107
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,319
Okay.

108
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,919

to get my earring back?

110
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,719
Tell me.

111
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,490
The more you want it back...

112
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,599
...the less I want to give it to you.

113
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,640
Now that you've taken my clubroom...

114
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,040
...I'm going to take your stuff.

115
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,880
No, don't!

116
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,280
Come on.

117
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,559

118
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,959

...sorry for bumping into you.

124
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,679

It's fine.

126
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,640
I wasn't paying attention either.

131
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:39,821
Yes.

132
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,360
Even if you go to Room 950,
you won't get to study math.

133
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,799

-You should be serious.

143
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,040
The person tutoring you
puts their effort into it.

144
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,080
They want their students to do well.

145
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,721
If their students
don't recognize their effort,

146
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,000
then what's the point?

147
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,160
I get it. You don't have to get upset.

148
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,319
Forget it.

149
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,919
You should hurry.

150

Their values are very similar.

151
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,120
Secondly, they have very high boiling
and melting points.

152
00:14:55,599 --> 00:15:00,879
Third, atom sizes get smaller
as we progress,

153
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,679
but they are very similar.

154
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,919
Have you talked to him yet?

155
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,360
What kind of person is like that?
He's so sensitive.

156
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,400
Forget it.

157
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,679
I've let it go.

158
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
Preach it, brother.

159
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
But can you do what you say?

160
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,400
Whatever.

161
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,519
Let's talk about the characteristics
of the transition element.

162
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,440
There are as follows.

163
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,599
First,
they have variable oxidation numbers,

164
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,141
except for group 3B and group 2B.

165
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,161
Most of the compounds are colored,

166
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,461
-except for group 13.
-Hey.

167
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,321
-Fourth.
-Take notes for me.

168
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,841
-Complex compounds are easily formed.
-I'm going to take a nap.

169
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,400
Hey, what are you doing?

170
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,559
So have you really let it go?

171
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,640
Who threw this?

172
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,120
It's my business.

173
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,480
I think that he's letting things go too.

174
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,879
It's not about you, though.

175
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,400
I mean, the tutoring session.

176
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,360
Look, he's fast asleep.

177
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,701
Do you want to continue the session
at my house?

178
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,141
Which subject?

179
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
The subject of...

180
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:05,839
...flexibility.

181
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,520
You're an idiot.

182
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,360
You can't go?

183
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,479
Not today.

184
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,799
My dad's picking me up.

185
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,119
How about tomorrow?

186
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,240
Sure. And the day after tomorrow too.

187
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,280
I'll walk you to the pick-up spot.

188
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,960
Let's go.

189
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,399
Hey, you.

190
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Give these notes to Itt.

191
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,280
Don't tell him that they're from me.
Otherwise, he'll throw them away.

192
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,879
He's been ignoring you...

193
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,879
...but you're still nice to him.

194
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,920
I promised him
that I'd help him get into the university.

195
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,240
I have to keep my promise.

196
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
Why?

197
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,021
If he can't get in,

198
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,730
will Teacher Walailak
take your club room back?

199
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,799
You're a real pain.

200
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,160
I was just kidding.

201
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,621
Come on.

202
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,062
I'll give these to him.

203
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't forget what I told you.

204
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,301
I won't.

205
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:35,741
He'll hit me if I tell him
that they're from you.

206
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:36,860
You can count on me.

207
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,701
I'll make sure he gets them.

208
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,181
I'm taking off now.

209
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,640
-See you.
-See you.

210
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,279
Well, I don't quite understand.

211
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,221
Will you do another session with me?

212
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:00,021
About what?

213
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,400
About flexibility.

214
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,680
You...

215
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,450
You dropped this.

216
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,040
Hang on, it's not her.

217
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,440
Her? Who?

218
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,639
The one he asked about doing a
flexibility tutoring session at his house.

219
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,861
But she said that she wasn't available.

220
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,381
I'm not available today either.

221
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,880
-Wait.
-Leave me alone.

222
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,200
Go get flexible by yourself.

223
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,319
What?

224
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,799
Don't be such a loudmouth,
unless you want to get hurt.

225
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,160

...take these chemistry notes.

230
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,799
Who gave them to you?

231
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,880
A girl from another school.

232
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,719
I flirted with her,
so she gave them to me.

233
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,079
Don't forget to read them.

234
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,040

Why?

240
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,839
I remember your handwriting.

241
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,040
A lot of people
have the same handwriting.

242

If they're not yours,

243
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,581
-then I'll throw them away.
-Wait.

244
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,280

What the heck is wrong with you?

247
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,800
You're not going to let this go, are you?

248
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,119
That's why you gave me these notes.

249
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,120
You want me to realize
that you're smart, don't you?

250
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,581
Yes, you're smart.

251

252
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,839
That's not my intention.

-I just want...
-Quit acting like you're a good person.

254
