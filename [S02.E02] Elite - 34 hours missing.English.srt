1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,719
So your brother got her pregnant?
The one that's in prison?

2
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,679
But he didn't kill her.

3
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,600
-The people around Carla are the key.
-Carla...

4
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,000
She's that marchioness girl, right?
The one with tits out to here?

5
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,960
Yes.

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,520
And there I was,
thinking I'd be bored at this school.

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,359
Left.

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,520
Right.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Left.

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,520
Left.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,439
Harder, for fuck's sake, Samu.

12
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,439
I have to get close to her.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,560
How are you planning to do that?
Come here.

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,200
You don't have a lot in common.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
Nor does she mix
with people of your class.

16
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,960
She mixed with Christian.

17
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,439
Yeah, but to fuck, right?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,560
You think she'd be into you?

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,679
-I'm a scholarship kid like him.
-Sure.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,880
Son of a bitch.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,640
He wants to get in her pants
in order to get in her mind.

22
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,799
I'm flipping you off,

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,439
-even if you can't see.
-Whatever! How will you do it?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,159
I don't know. I'll think of something.

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,519
That's a great plan.

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,920
Anyway, Samu,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
if you think Christian lost his legs
by being close to her,

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
shouldn't you be careful?

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,439
Have you noticed anything missing?
His phone? His wallet? Clothes?

30
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,359
34 HOURS MISSING

31
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,439
It is important
that you tell us any details.

32
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,239
His phone and wallet aren't here.
And his clothes... I don't know.

33
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,319
All of his jeans were similar.
I don't know if any are missing...

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,359
I have no clue.

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,240
Tell me you will find him.
This can't be happening.

36
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,879
We will do everything we can.
But that's why we need your cooperation.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,280
Did you notice your son
acting strange lately?

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,039
Or was he doing
anything out of the ordinary?

39
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,759
Well...

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,240
I don't know.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,479
To be honest with you... I don't know.

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,520
I was working double shifts
for my other son's bail money...

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,639
-and I barely saw Samuel.
-And what can you tell me about this?

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,319
Why does your son have all this money?

45
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,319
Pilar?

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Every hour counts
when a person goes missing.

47
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,319
Every hour that goes by makes it
less likely that we'll find him. Help us.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,439
She has 39,000 followers.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,479
-I bet she paid them.
-What are you talking about?

50
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,840
My God, Carla, what are you on?
I'm talking about the new girl.

51
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,400
Don't you go on Instagram?

52
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,680
She made sure everyone knows
she starts school today

53
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,719
with all the hashtags, Las Encinas.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,039
I'm gonna go.
I'm not in the mood for this.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
-Why did you scare me?
-Let me see.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,639
-You want to see her?
-Show me!

57
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,960
-You're that interested?
-Afraid of the competition?

58
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,759
-I want to see her!
-Now you want to follow her?

59
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,960
Am I still making you nervous?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,879
Dad.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
How are you?

62
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,319
I don't need this.

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,960
You can't walk yet.
We're going to follow the doctor's orders.

64
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,039
I'm fine.

65
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
Now that you'll be home,
it's even better.

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,120
You'll get better quickly, you'll see.
We will all help you, won't we?

67
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,040
Sure.

68
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Class...

69
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,800
Go to class.

70
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,759
It doesn't matter if I'm late.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
You are more important.
Let's see how we'll manage here.

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,759
Your brother...

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
He will take care of it. You get to class.

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,879
-Dad, I just want to help...
-No!

75
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,439
Calm down.

76
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
Guzmán,
what are Marina's things doing here?

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,600
-Weren't you going to get rid of them?
-I'll do it. Give me some time.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay.

79
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,959
Don't forget that the mass
is at 7:00 p.m. today.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,839
Have you told your friends?

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
I'll do it in class.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,959
Darling, it's important for us.

83
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,920
It will help us remember her, but...
also to start putting all this behind us.

84
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
"All this"?

85
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,560
Are you referring to my sister's murder
as "all this," Mom?

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,439
How can you be so cold?

87
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,480
Darling,

88
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,439
I am dead inside.

89
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,839
I breathe and I eat,

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
but I'm dead.

91
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,399
I will never get over it. Never.

92
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,079
But you will.

93
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,600
You have to.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,879
You have to find a way to get over it.

95
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,480
Is something wrong?

96
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,920
Dad, why did you decide
to pay for Christian to go to the clinic?

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,879
It was very generous.

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,560
I thought he was important to you.
That's why I did it.

99
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,800
I wasn't born yesterday.

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Why else would I do it?

101
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,079
I'll get out here.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,879
She just followed me.

103
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,199
Does she think I'll follow back?
Who does she think she is?

104
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,720
She's already taken seven selfies
since she got to school. Outrageous!

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,759
You know what?

106
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,759
She reminds me of your paralyzed version
of Christian Grey.

107
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,759
-Really, Lu?
-Yeah.

108
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,920
You could show a bit of fucking empathy.

109
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,480
Okay, it's too soon to joke
about the damn cripple. Got it.

110
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
His name is Christian, okay?

111
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,319
Christian!

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,600
Christian!

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,399
-Did she follow you as well?
-No. It's from Guzmán's mother.

114
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
About Marina's mass.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,319
She doesn't seem so retarded.

116
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,000
There's nothing more attractive
than a woman reading.

117
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,399
She's not reading, she's posing.

118
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Say what you want,
but she threw you off a bit.

119
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,240
And suddenly, you're a bit intrigued.

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,800
She's all yours.
Now you have a new target. Go.

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,759
-Hi. Good morning.
-Hi.

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,079
I'll sit next to you on one condition.

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,879
Don't tell me how it ends.
I'm only halfway through it.

124
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,759
You're reading The Second Sex?

125
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,560
Well, actually, I prefer doing it.

126
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,439
And if it's with a feminist,
it's a whole new level.

127
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,920
Sure. Double points, right?

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
Well, nice to meet you.

129
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,800
-Hey.
-Hi, my love. How are you?

130
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,800
Fine.

131
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,079
-Hey, you didn't tell me about the mass.
-How do you know about it?

132
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,600
Your mother sent us all a message.

133
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,600
Fucking hell.
I hope she hasn't sent it to everyone.

134
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,279
Hey. Listen, the thing is,
I don't know who to ask,

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
and since you're his friend...

136
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,399
Do you think Guzmán would mind
if I attended?

137
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,320
You're going, aren't you?

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,279
You really won her over.

139
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,080
You're the ones
who spend the most time with Samuel.

140
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,000
36 HOURS MISSING

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
His classmates. His friends.

142
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,639
I am sure that one of you must know
what happened to him.

143
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,799
And my job is to find out.

144
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,360
Samuel, can I ask you something?

145
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,799
How is Omar's father doing?

146
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,960
This morning, I went to the store,
and Omar wouldn't even let me in.

147
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,039
I really fucked up at the hospital
with his family.

148
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm a textbook dickhead, man.
What can I do to get him to forgive me?

149
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,399
Give him time.

150
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Ander! What were you doing talking to him?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,480
-Didn't I make myself clear the other day?
-Not now, Guzmán.

152
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,279
I'm not in the mood for your rants

153
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,200
-and ridiculous drama.
-"Ridiculous drama"? That's great.

154
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,360
Guzmán... I'm sorry about your sister.

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
But enough is enough.

156
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,639
Enough with the masses
and obsessing over the same thing.

157
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm not betraying you or your sister's
memory by talking to Samuel.

158
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,559
We all have our own lives
and our own problems.

159
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,879
First of all,

160
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,320
the mass was my mother's idea, okay?

161
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,879
If you can't come
because of your life and problems,

162
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
then don't go.

163
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,679
I don't fucking feel like it
at all either.

164
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Are you going?

165
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,559
I don't know, Polo, I don't know.

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
I just wish this would end.
I haven't slept a wink in three days.

167
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Why?

168
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,879
Why?

169
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,759
Do you really think Christian's accident
was just a coincidence?

170
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
I don't get how you can be so calm.

171
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,600
You're the one who told me
not to lose my cool ever.

172
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,519
Well, I think I'm starting to lose it.

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I need to talk to someone
before I go nuts.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,480
Want to get a drink later?

175
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,600
Now that Christian's gone,
you want to get a drink with me.

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,240
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

177
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,559
So, now, I press the number
of the product I want, right?

178
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,679
Great.

179
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,120
You won't believe it, but this is
the first time I've used one of these.

180
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,240
Are you serious?
Didn't they have one at your other school?

181
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,360
I haven't set foot in a school
in four years.

182
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm thrilled to be back in one. It's so...
school-like, you know what I mean?

183
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,600
So, you haven't studied in four years?

184
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,200
-You're repeating a year.
-No, I studied from home. Homeschooled.

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,960
With private teachers and all that stuff.

186
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,559
It's the worst thing
about never staying in one place.

187
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm so happy to be back.
I really missed all this.

188
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,120
Not this one.

189
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,159
Forty-five, right?

190
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,200
Those chips?

191
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,080
If you're going to eat that many calories,
at least get something worthwhile.

192
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,360
Well, she's right.

193
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,240
Thank you so much, girls.
And thank you, you've been lovely. Bye.

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,639
-Have you seen the photos of her house?
-What?

195
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
They're so cool.

196
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,759
And she lives alone, no parents.

197
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,399
Alone? I don't believe it.

198
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,759
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

199
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,919
Not really.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,879
I don't want to go to that mass.
I don't want to go.

201
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,679
You have your reasons, right?

202
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,360
No ceremony
is going to bring back my sister.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
Or make it less painful.

204
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,440
-Don't go, then. Easy-peasy.
-It's easier said than done.

205
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,799
I can't let my parents down.

206
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Don't you get tired of being you?

207
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,600
Always doing the right thing.

208
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,039
No?

209
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,799
Now I see why my parents think
you're perfect for my sister.

210
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,879
But you know what?

211
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm starting to question whether someone
who's so messed up is right for Lu.

212
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
If only I could stop obsessing
over things for a while...

213
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,720
and stop feeling this rage
that consumes me.

214
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,159
I can help you with that. You know I can.

215
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,120
Darling, would you like to have coffee
at my place later?

216
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,799
I know how it is to be the new kid.
How hard it is to make friends...

217
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,360
You're such a sweetheart!

218
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,679
-I know.
-Lucrecia?

219
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,000
-Right.
-Cayetana.

220
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,399
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks. Can you send me the address?

221
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
-Sure.
-Great.

222
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,919
-I'll see you at 5:00.
-Great.

223
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,399
Bye.

224
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,200
Shoot. I can't.

225
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,240
I forgot my dad has an important meeting
at home this afternoon.

226
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,159
It's okay.

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
-I could come over to yours.
-To my place?

228
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,039
-Yes.
-Okay.

229
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,200
Great! Can you send me the address?
You're such a sweetheart!

230
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,039
Did you just try to dodge me, Carla?

231
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,759
Yes.

232
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,399
Are you still mad
about what I said about Christian?

233
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,879
If you had told me that
he was really important to you,

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,159
I would never have joked about him.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,279
But since you never tell me
anything lately...

236
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,080
What do you want me to tell you?
Everything's a joke to you.

237
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,279
You're more focused on
the new girl's Instagram

238
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
than your friend.

239
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,840
Then you say that she's superficial
and embellishing details of her life.

240
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,480
But you're the same.

241
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,720
All front.

242
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,639
That's why you're obsessed with her.

243
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh, I'm superficial, am I?

244
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,320
Bullshit!

245
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,759
I spent three fucking weeks with Guzmán
in his grandparents' village,

246
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
trying to help him and keep him afloat.

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,559
And even then, I didn't stop calling
or texting you, asking how you were...

248
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,519
You went missing.

249
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,559
You're the one who's become distant
and tight-lipped.

250
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,759
So don't give me that.
What's going on with you?

251
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,240
It's me. You can talk to me.

252
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,879
I wouldn't know where to start. I'm sorry.

253
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
-Hi, Omar.
-Hey!

254
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
Take anything you need to study.

255
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,240
How is Dad?

256
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
We struggled to get him to go to bed.

257
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,200
He was dead set on working.
And he can't.

258
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,200
This will be fucking difficult.

259
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,720
I've been thinking about
how to organize things.

260
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,360
You could stay in the morning

261
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
and as soon as I get home,
I'll take over until close.

262
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,279
No way.

263
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,320
Dad wants you to study
and me to take care of the store.

264
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,360
So drop it already.

265
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,240
So what about you? You'll drop out?

266
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,840
I suppose it doesn't matter
if I skip a year.

267
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,360
Anyway, you're the brainy one.

268
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,080
You don't have to be the only one
who sacrifices.

269
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,639
Can you convince Dad?

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
Then that's that.

271
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,880
Lu, welcome.

272
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,839
Hey.

273
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,599
-How are you?
-Good. You?

274
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,079
-Your house looks beautiful.
-Yeah...

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,799
Shall I give you a quick tour?
Or would that be distasteful?

276
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,279
-Oh, dear...
-Down.

277
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,000
I brought some pink champagne.
Yay for bad taste!

278
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,079
Yay! Come on...

279
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,559
That's the kitchen, Imelda's territory.

280
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I couldn't live without her.

281
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,359
Look at what she made for us...

282
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,039
I told her I'm on a diet,
but she won't listen.

283
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,079
The living room, and there's
a small garden and a swimming pool.

284
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,400
Well, two swimming pools.
The other pool is small.

285
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Then the five bedrooms.
Mine with a huge dressing room.

286
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,400
It's the first thing I fell in love with
in this house.

287
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,240
-Shall I chill the champagne?
-Do you really live here alone?

288
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,759
With Imelda.

289
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,079
But I gave her the afternoon off
so that we could be more comfortable.

290
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,200
Oh, you're so sweet. I love it!

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Are you expecting someone?

292
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Hey there!

293
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,000
-What are you doing here?
-No party without us!

294
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,039
There is no party here, Valerio.
We were going to have a snack.

295
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,480
A snack... A party...

296
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,680
-They are both the same thing.
-Hi.

297
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,720
Seriously?

298
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,480
-What's in there?
-The best part... is inside.

299
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,160
FOLLOW

300
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,119
Shit! No, no!

301
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,640
YOU HAVE UNFOLLOWED MARQUESITAPON

302
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,079
I'm such an ass!

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
Sorry, but I don't think it's
the best time for you to be here.

304
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,440
Also, I was thinking
of going to Marina's mass.

305
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,240
What was she like?

306
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,440
None of you talk about it,

307
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,720
and her ghost hasn't turned up
at my place yet.

308
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,480
She was a whirlwind.
She destroyed everything in her path.

309
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,440
But I have a feeling
that despite dying so young,

310
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,720
she lived more in 16 years
than many people do in 100.

311
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,079
So she was my kind of girl, then.
And I'd say

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
that if she had the choice,
she wouldn't go to her own mass.

313
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,079
So, skip the drama. Let's get dolled up
and bust some moves.

314
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,920
No. Haven't you seen how things are here?
I'm not in the mood to party.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,759
I'm not talking
about abandoning your family.

316
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,440
Girl, don't be so dramatic.

317
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,039
I'm talking about going out for a walk,
dancing a bit...

318
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,599
You don't say "make the best
of a bad situation" in Morocco or what?

319
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,759
I'm from Palestine.
You really don't know me.

320
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,480
Sorry, but let me remind you
I've seen you dancing like...

321
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,519
Moving like...

322
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,680
What was that move again?

323
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,559
Come on, woman, I'll bring you back
in two hours. I swear!

324
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,920
Guzmán, I'm fed up with your shit!
Are you crazy or what?

325
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,279
I'm sorry. They're trashing your house.
I swear, I’ll kick them out.

326
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,519
That's all right!
This is my third Negroni,

327
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm already numb.
I don't feel anything or suffer so...

328
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,119
Cheers, baby.

329
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,119
Seriously, Valerio?

330
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,039
Whoever guesses what I'm wearing
under this robe gets €100.

331
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,799
Please, Valerio!

332
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
Which, by the way, fits me...
How do I look?

333
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,519
It fits perfectly.
That color suits you!

334
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,519
-Me!
-You!

335
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,720
Nothing, you're naked.

336
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,039
No. You.

337
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Underwear!

338
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,240
No. Lu? It's your turn.

339
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,960
I know, but I'm not playing.

340
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,559
-Can we please leave now?
-No.

341
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,400
-No.
-I know what it is.

342
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,039
-I know what it is.
-Tell me.

343
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,000
You're only wearing a sock.

344
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,279
-All yours, young lady.
-She guessed it!

345
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:10,160
Smart girl.

346
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,640
-I like this girl!
-Me too!

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
Hey, where's my prize?

348
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,680
Slower!

349
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,160
Slower so you can enjoy it better.

350
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,200
Careful, he bites.

351
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,119
Now...

352
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,920
Valerio, are you serious? Put it back on!

353
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,759
You're embarrassing!

354
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm covering myself.

355
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,720
You're ridiculous.

356
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,400
You're great, you bastard.

357
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,680
Please, don't.

358
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
Please, don't! Guzmán!

359
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,240
Seriously? Please!

360
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
I'm crazy, too.

361
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,279
Guzmán, please!

362
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,400
We have to go to the church!

363
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,039
-Lu, come on!
-I hate you!

364
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,759
-Hey.
-Hi.

365
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,279
-Have you spoken to Guzmán?
-Before coming?

366
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,599
No. Why?

367
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,960
-He's not answering his phone.
-Keep trying. He won't pick up for me.

368
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,559
-So?
-No answer.

369
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,519
Should I try Lu?

370
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,000
Guzmán?

371
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,880
So?

372
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,920
No answer.

373
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,519
I have an idea.

374
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,960
Cayetana!

375
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,359
Turn the volume down!

376
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,400
-This message is for you! Welcome!
-Sorry.

377
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
Is that now?

378
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,640
What's up with the guy?

379
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,920
Don't!

380
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
Not here, please.

381
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,599
-We better go get him.
-Why?

382
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,960
He's having fun.

383
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,720
Can't you see he's not right?

384
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,799
Let's go get him.

385
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,839
Please, let's all gather around.

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,000
-You shouldn't be here.
-And what about you?

387
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
You weren't exactly very friendly
with Marina.

388
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,200
-How would you know?
-Marina told me everything.

389
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,119
Did she?

390
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,240
Did she also tell you
that your brother got her pregnant?

391
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,319
Marina did what she liked to us.

392
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,039
And here we are,

393
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,839
mourning her.

394
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you know what could have happened

395
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,519
to make him disappear off the radar?

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,079
He would never leave
without saying anything.

397
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,079
It's fucking awesome.
The guys, the waiter, the music...

398
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,279
-I've told my friend Mari...
-Who's Mari?

399
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,799
Where are you going?

400
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,359
We are going to Guzmán's...

401
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,480
family's mass.

402
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,319
-For Marina...
-Sure.

403
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,039
You're dressed up like this
to go to mass?

404
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,720
Dude, for a gay boy, you have that whole
hetero-castrating-father thing nailed.

405
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,279
You told her that I'm gay?

406
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
And that she's a virgin, too.
I don't know why everyone opens up to me.

407
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,599
And between you and me,
hers really is a crime.

408
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,559
You're not going to mass.

409
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,039
No.

410
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,319
Nadia...

411
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,000
You don't need to lie to me
just because I'm the man of the house.

412
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,319
I'm not Dad.

413
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,519
Are you doing inventory?

414
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,599
Yes.

415
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
And it's overwhelming.

416
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,720
Omar...

417
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,119
I'll stay and help you, then.
Dad doesn't need to know.

418
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,799
I'm sorry, you'd better go.

419
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,039
No way. No worries.

420
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,759
I'll help you,
and we'll get it done faster, right?

421
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,880
How do we do it?
We count the oranges, the pears...

422
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,960
What a great plan! Who wants to go dancing
when you can spend the night counting.

423
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,200
They put her ashes there, right?

424
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,920
No matter how rich you are,
you can't bury someone wherever you want.

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,519
Seriously? This is stalking now.

426
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,359
What do you want from me?
Just tell me.

427
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,880
2002-2018.

428
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,519
Nobody's life should be so short.

429
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,799
Those two dates stuck with me, too.

430
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I can't get rid of this feeling
I get here.

431
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,720
What?

432
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,759
-I've never seen you like this.
-You don't know me at all.

433
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,759
I need a beer.

434
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,359
What about you?

435
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Me too.

436
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,359
But not with you.

437
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,480
Do you have a better option?

438
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,240
These two are crazy.

439
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,920
I bet you never get bored of them.

440
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,039
Especially you. You're a troublemaker.

441
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,640
Why? I didn't manage to convince you.

442
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,000
I never snort anything,
not even if you got naked for me.

443
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,359
Are you sure?

444
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,960
Dude...

445
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,440
Come here! Lucrecia,
stop eating and come dance.

446
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,759
What?

447
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,960
-Stop eating and come dance!
-I don't want to!

448
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
-Enough, Guzmán!
-Fucking hell!

449
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,119
If I kiss you, it's wrong.
If I don't, it's wrong, too.

450
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,359
-Cayetana!
-What?

451
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
-Is there any champagne left?
-Yeah!

452
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,400
Come on, let's get some more champagne.

453
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,160
What's wrong?

454
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,680
Are you happy now?
You've managed to snare the new girl.

455
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,319
Check. You'll be able to mess around
all you like,

456
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,079
with no parents around to control you.
Go for it!

457
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,599
Doesn't sound like a bad idea, does it?
Great!

458
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,000
But you know what?

459
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,400
I can't get someone else out of my head.

460
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,839
-And she won't let me be.
-What?

461
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,720
I haven't been able
to get her out of my head for years.

462
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,400
You know what? It hurts.

463
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,160
It hurts so much,
I don't know why I came back.

464
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,599
Luckily... Luckily for you, I've got this.

465
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,000
Are you blaming me
for your drug addiction, you idiot?

466
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,400
No.

467
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,839
I'm only saying
that no one can outshine you.

468
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,000
Let's see...

469
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,240
They're here!

470
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,920
Reinforcements are here!

471
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,440
Where are my dudes?

472
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,839
Hey, guys, how are you doing?

473
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,240
What's up? Come up here!

474
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,720
What are you doing here?

475
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Welcome!

476
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,960
My dudes! What's up?

477
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,839
My boys! You came!

478
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,119
Do you think one of your classmates
has something to do

479
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,359
with Samuel's disappearance?

480
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,599
What makes you think
I'd know something about that?

481
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,319
The fact that,

482
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,680
since you sat down, you haven't looked me
in the eye. For example.

483
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,680
Have you spoken to my sister yet?

484
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,240
Lucrecia?

485
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,160
Call me Lu.

486
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,519
Why?

487
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,519
Because you should.

488
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,400
-Show me a picture of your boyfriend.
-This is him.

489
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,279
-Oh, shit, he's in our class.
-Yeah.

490
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,799
Shit!

491
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,160
I had my eye on him.
But you've already taken him.

492
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,319
Good for you, but... shit.

493
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
Don't be stupid and call him.

494
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,440
Nah...

495
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,440
I have bigger problems now.

496
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,559
-What problems?
-Haven't you noticed?

497
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,160
Well, dude...

498
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,759
Don't hide behind this
to avoid fixing what's in here.

499
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,839
And don't take too long.

500
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,160
You never know when people
might disappear from your life.

501
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,039
Call him.

502
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,000
Nah...

503
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,640
-How much did he drink?
-I don't know.

504
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,920
All of it. All he has left is
the water from the swimming pool.

505
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,359
-See if you can take him away from here.
-Take me away? No, no!

506
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,359
Who's staying?

507
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,880
Are you staying? Come on! Who's staying?

508
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
Me!

509
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,400
-You're staying here? Yeah!
-There we go!

510
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,359
Yeah!

511
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,519
Fuck!

512
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,200
-Fucking hell! Sorry!
-Shit!

513
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,119
-I'm sorry! Was it very expensive?
-No.

514
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,480
I think my mother bought it
at a Sotheby's auction,

515
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
-but it's one of many.
-Yes. She won't miss it.

516
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,599
I think we've had enough, right?

517
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,079
This was the last straw.
We'd better leave.

518
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,759
-Please!
-What a pain in the ass!

519
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,240
No chance, Lu.

520
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm staying, right, Caye?

521
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,960
-Let's go.
-The party ain't over!

522
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,359
No, let's go, Guzmán.
You should sleep this off already.

523
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,839
I'm fine!

524
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,799
I'm fine! Why don't you stop treating me
like an idiot?

525
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,119
I'm fine!

526
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,599
Or don't you think so?

527
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,359
Because everything
is perfect and wonderful.

528
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,279
And we've all moved on, right?

529
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:01,200
Nobody is saying that.
Fuck, turn that off.

530
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,240
We're not in the same boat as you,
and none of us have lost our sister.

531
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
Whatever! Do you know what?

532
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,000
My sister didn't die.

533
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,200
She was killed!

534
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,160
My sister was killed!

535
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,559
All right? You can't seem
to get that through your thick skulls.

536
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,079
Please, Ander, take him away.

537
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,519
Come on. Let's go.

538
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,960
-I'm fine.
-Let's go.

539
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,480
No!

540
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,960
Cayetana, this is so embarrassing...

541
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,279
Sorry for all of this.

542
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,640
One more. We've already paid for it.

543
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,839
Two hundred bucks a bottle.
That's immoral.

544
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,880
No, it's expensive. That's all.

545
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,200
You won't bring me down...

546
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,279
Can I ask you something?

547
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,200
I lost my virginity at 14.

548
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,680
Or is that not what you wanted to ask?

549
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,160
That's the kind of question
I tend to attract.

550
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,359
I don't know why.

551
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,880
Did you have something to do
with Marina's murder?

552
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,440
So it was that.

553
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,640
That's why you've been trying
to get close to me.

554
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,360
Did you have something to do
with Marina's death?

555
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,840
Were you involved?

556
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,000
You couldn't stand the truth.

557
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
I can't, either.

558
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,280
Try me.

559
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,679
Yes. I had something to do with it.

560
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,719
Too much.

561
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,480
Are you sure you want to do that?

562
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,880
I want to know everything.

563
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,320
And I just want you to fuck me.

564
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,639
Can you do that?

565
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,280
Sure you want to do this?

566
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,880
Girls like you never hook up
with guys like me.

567
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,440
What would you know about girls like me?

568
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,480
I don't get it.

569
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,480
He was getting better. He was better.

570
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,239
That's why we went
to his grandparents' in Asturias.

571
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
And...

572
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,880
And I helped him.

573
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,960
Coming back to school hasn't helped
for sure.

574
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,800
He's not like that...

575
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,039
And all this...

576
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,880
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

577
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,400
-No! Because you need to.
-I don't want to bother you.

578
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,519
And that's what friends are for.

579
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,159
We're leaving.

580
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,199
Okay.

581
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,480
We're leaving.

582
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:20,960
Thanks.

583
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,880
Bye, guys.

584
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,320
Get up.

585
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,039
Good, very good.

586
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,039
Don't get a hard-on now...

587
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,840
Come on, help me a little.

588
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,679
Easy,
or I'll be the one getting a hard-on.

589
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,599
Okay...

590
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,760
Yeah, that's good.

591
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,119
My friends...

592
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,199
My friends...

593
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,920
Grab his arms.

594
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,039
-Now...
-If I sit up...

595
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,679
Okay... Here.

596
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,199
Thanks.

597
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh, God...

598
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,239
So? Should we go?

599
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,400
Yes.

600
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,800
No, don't leave.

601
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,199
Stay here with me for a while.
Like we used to do. Remember?

602
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Respect me.

603
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,559
-Will we fit in the bed?
-I guess so.

604
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,360
-This is fucking weird.
-Why?

605
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,800
It's not like we've never slept together.

606
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
I know. But I wasn't out of the closet,
and you weren't bi.

607
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,239
Bi?

608
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,800
Is that what I am?

609
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,719
Well, maybe you're right.

610
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,639
I may be bi.

611
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,960
-Ander.
-What?

612
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,159
Were you ever hot for Guzmán?

613
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,440
What are you saying?

614
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,239
-Were you?
-Me?

615
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,519
Never. Yuck.

616
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,440
What about me?

617
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Were you hot for me?
A little bit for sure.

618
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,119
Just check out this hot body.

619
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,199
You wish!

620
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,679
Scoot.

621
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,239
Shit.

622
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,320
I've been sleeping alone for some time.

623
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,360
The warmth is appreciated.

624
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,760
The touching...

625
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,239
Easy with the touching.

626
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,039
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

627
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,960
Or horny? Because I'm getting...

628
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,519
-I'm getting hard as hell.
-You're fucking kidding me.

629
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,480
Look.

630
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,840
Cover yourself, you bastard.

631
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
You cover yourself, too!

632
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,400
Shit!

633
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
What do you want me to do?
I'm not made of stone.

634
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,800
Wanna jerk off?

635
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,199
With Guzmán here?

636
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,599
You're crazy.

637
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,039
We are crazy.

638
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,400
I know.

639
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,840
We are crazy.

640
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,199
This is too creepy, huh?

641
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,159
Yes. Let's leave it.

642
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,079
No.

643
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,760
But on one condition.

644
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,599
Tomorrow we forget all about it, okay?

645
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,719
Yes. We're just friends jerking off.

646
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Right.

647
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:56,840
LU HAS STARTED FOLLOWING YOU

648
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,320
-Hi, darling.
-Hi. Good evening.

649
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,360
-Caye, you're still here?
-Yes, but I'm done, so...

650
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,320
Where's the dog?

651
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,840
I had to shut him in the pantry.
He was very badly behaved.

652
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,559
He broke a porcelain figure
that was over there.

653
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:21,159
Darling, why don't you make me
a couple of Negronis?

654
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,159
To see if they calm me down a bit.

655
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,920
Caye. Don't punish the dog again, okay?

656
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,519
Stick to cleaning.

657
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,400
Okay.

658
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,280
If you don't need anything else,
I'll be leaving now.

659
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,039
-Bye, darling.
-Bye.

660
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,599
Negronis.

661
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,320
Nadia, you're late for class. Go.

662
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,880
Yes, darling, go to class.

663
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,599
Mom and I will take care of things.

664
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,880
No.

665
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,840
Dad, I can be late for school for once.

666
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,039
And you know what? It doesn't matter.

667
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,719
They will understand.
And if they don't, that's their problem.

668
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,480
-No...
-Yes.

669
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,320
It's okay for Omar
to take charge of the store,

670
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,239
but we are here, too.

671
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,400
And no matter how much you dislike that,
things have changed.

672
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,800
You will have to accept it.

673
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,000
Don't be too long.
We'll drop you all off at school.

674
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,960
-Good morning.
-You guys seriously snore, man.

675
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,440
Do you know why it pisses me off
when you talk to Samuel?

676
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:12,159
You act as if nothing happened.

677
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,320
Because of his brother.

678
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,000
No.

679
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,639
That's what I thought.

680
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,119
That I was pissed off
because his brother murdered my sister.

681
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,719
He pisses me off for another reason.

682
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,440
It goes round and round in my head
like Jiminy Cricket.

683
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,760
I could have stopped them.
He warned me, and I did nothing.

684
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:36,880
Dude...

685
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,880
There's something
that concerns me more.

686
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,079
What if he was right?

687
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,840
What if... Nano is not the real killer?

688
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,039
How can I move on, not knowing
if the one who did it is on the loose?

689
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,880
Maybe he simply decided to leave.

690
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,920
Why would he do that?

691
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,239
Because Samuel should never
have come back to this school.

692
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,039
Ever.

693
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,159
Do you know if Samuel
could have gotten money illegally?

694
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,280
Why the fuck are you asking me that?
Why don't you talk to the marchioness?

695
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,760
Carla? Why?

696
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I don't know.

697
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,960
All the guys around her end up vanishing
one way or another.

698
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:39,719
I don't know anything. I'm sorry.

699
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,199
Okay, thank you.

700
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:00,039
What's going on?

701
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Nothing.

702
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,119
I know you, Carla.

703
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,639
Or are you going to keep this
to yourself, too?

704
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,239
Samuel is not missing.

705
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,320
He's dead.

706
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,559
