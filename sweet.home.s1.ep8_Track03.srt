ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,830
What was that?

3
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,333
Our plan must've failed.

4
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:53,175
I can't give you anesthesia.

5
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,469
You could die from shock.

6
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,180
Even if the surgery is successful,

7
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,809
you could die from infection.

8
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:04,145
I won't blame you.

9
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:07,982
I promise.

10
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,925
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

11
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,550
Live.

12
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,700
Pick them up.
We have to protect this place.

13
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:10,938
Hey! Wake up!

14
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,242
What do you think will happen?

15
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,621
It's your turn from now on.

16
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,208
Because it all depends on God.

17
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,127
No.

18
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,422
It depends on Ji-su.

19
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,008
Don't worry.

20
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:52,719
Ji-su will wake up no matter what.

21
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,056
How can you be sure?

22
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,396
She said she grabbed thread
at her first birthday ceremony.

23
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,590
Did you sell my baby off?

24
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,174
Why did you come back with that junk?

25
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:35,679
I'm sorry.

26
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:37,973
How was she?

27
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,683
Did she run fast?

28
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:43,395
Yes.

29
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,858
That's good.

30
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:53,030
She'll have no regrets, either, then.

31
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,621
I could only find one.

32
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,710
Guess it was worth it after all.

33
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:10,797
You've got a lot of visitors.

34
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:14,968
Is Hyun-su okay?

35
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,179
So he's the first thing you ask about.

36
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,973
Answer me.
Did he have any strange symptoms?

37
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:22,559
-What about you?
-What?

38
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,854
To me, you and Hyun-su are similar.

39
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,105
What do you mean?

40
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:29,024
Seon-yeong told me

41
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,401
that you're pregnant.

42
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,156
It's something I had to know.

43
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,074
So?

44
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,201
Are you going to lock me up?

45
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,287
I can't do that.

46
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:44,414
You aren't a monster yet.

47
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,000
You are a time bomb, though.

48
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,088
-I won't tell people.
-Do whatever you want.

49
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,882
I've never done that.

50
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,009
I've only done what I had to.

51
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,390
Now tell me what it's like outside

52
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,517
and how you were able to return safely.

53
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,602
-Tell me every detail.
-You first.

54
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:09,815
Tell me what's happened here
and how Hyun-su has been.

55
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:13,068
Tell me every tiny detail.

56
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:14,653
Everything.

57
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,480
You should've come out when you woke up.

58
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:52,107
Why are you still in here?

59
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,609
I was hiding from you.

60
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,206
VENTOLIN INHALATION AEROSOL

61
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,586
Where did you get this?

62
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:14,629
Never mind that.

63
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:17,799
Take care of yourself.

64
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:18,717
Okay?

65
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,688
What an ignorant idiot!

66
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,784
That's his way of saying thank you.

67
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:02,427
You're back.

68
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:05,597
Is this your daily routine?

69
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,558
There's nothing to steal here,
but you're so diligent.

70
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,729
A rat's been sneaking in and out.

71
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:28,787
What are you doing?

72
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,629
What did you grab
at your first birthday ceremony?

73
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,923
What?

74
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:45,303
You know. You put out things like
a pencil, money, thread

75
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:47,889
in front of the baby.

76
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,684
If they pick up a pencil,
they'll be smart.

77
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,644
If they pick up money, they'll be rich.

78
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,439
If they grab thread,
they'll live a long life.

79
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,318
You know the custom.

80
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:09,536
I don't remember.

81
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,496
Come on.

82
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,373
Of course, you don't remember.

83
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,751
Either your parents tell you
or you see it from pictures.

84
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,005
Mine were all burned.

85
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,346
I have nothing left.

86
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,019
I learned that

87
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:38,273
God won't let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

88
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:45,113
But I think God overestimates humans.

89
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,434
That boy you mentioned.

90
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:16,478
He better have survived
longer than 15 days.

91
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,288
What are you doing?

92
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,963
What was the first symptom?

93
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:45,548
A nosebleed? Passing out?

94
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:47,634
When was it exactly?

95
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,678
-What?
-Try to remember.

96
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,931
You must remember
because it's the day you became a monster.

97
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,227
I heard it speaks to you.

98
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,020
Did it speak to you?

99
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,774
Yes.

100
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:08,113
Have you ever completely escaped from it?

101
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:13,702
You have, right? How?

102
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,579
Tell me!

103
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:23,753
I just wanted to live.

104
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,315
Why are you doing this to me?

105
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,737
There were more people
who tried to resist monsterization.

106
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,823
The government carried out
experiments on them

107
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,702
to find a way to stop this disaster.

108
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:56,786
Was the experiment

109
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:58,329
successful?

110
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,252
You should be asking me

111
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:07,630
what happened to the people
who were used in the experiment.

112
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,057
I ran into soldiers.

113
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,893
They caught me, to be exact.

114
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,524
I told them about you.

115
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:28,985
I…

116
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,244
wanted to live, too.

117
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:20,537
All right.

118
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,166
-Nice.
-This is so refreshing.

119
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,126
One more time, please.

120
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,008
Ms. Cha.

121
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,805
I thought you were tan,
but you were just dirty.

122
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:40,723
Thanks.

123
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,017
I'm saying you look good now.

124
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,813
I got these in the mail.

125
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,731
Do you want a face mask?

126
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:52,193
No, thanks.
I know I look pretty without it.

127
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:55,738
Wait, Seung-wan needs it.

128
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,699
No, I don't.

129
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,200
I think…

130
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,913
I should go outside.

131
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,251
I'm starting to have symptoms.

132
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,424
I should've told you sooner.

133
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,135
I guess I didn't want to believe it.

134
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,137
I'm sorry.

135
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:22,599
I can't

136
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:26,060
put everyone in danger.

137
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:28,479
Before it's too late, I should go--

138
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:30,190
Still, you shouldn't go outside.

139
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,524
She's right.

140
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,777
You're still human.
You'll die if you go outside!

141
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:35,695
What?

142
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,113
I mean,

143
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,699
-we can't let her stay here.
-Quiet.

144
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,000
Why don't we hold a vote?

145
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,047
Just vote as you want.

146
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:57,175
Because this is like…

147
00:19:58,301 --> 00:19:59,594
taking part in murder.

148
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,769
I vote she stays in the arcade.

149
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:09,979
I'm in favor.

150
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:12,523
Me, too.

151
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,610
She might be able to hold out
like Hyun-su.

152
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:48,893
PINOCCHIO DAYCARE

153
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,023
How are you feeling?

154
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,781
Women should always keep
their bodies warm.

155
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:04,742
Especially you, Yi-kyung.

156
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:10,915
Take care of yourself.

157
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,142
Seon-yeong.

158
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:31,227
Well…

159
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,772
Please don't be too upset about this

160
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,108
or about Seok-hyeon.

161
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:38,443
I'm sorry.

162
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,486
It's okay.

163
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,030
Thank you.

164
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:43,906
Seon-yeong.

165
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,492
You'll be fine.

166
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:51,039
Let's meet again. Okay?

167
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:51,956
Okay.

168
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,083
Take care.

169
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:18,441
Ms. An.

170
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:25,531
How did you bear it?

171
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,417
How did you do it?

172
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:43,216
Now I know what you've been through,
but there's nothing I can do for you.

173
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,144
I'm sorry for being

174
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:57,522
an awful grownup.

175
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:40,773
I could definitely use a drink
on a day like this.

176
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:42,066
There you go again.

177
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,277
That's why you have terrible skin.

178
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:47,280
Well,

179
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,741
don't you think Ms. An can hold out
like Hyun-su?

180
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,453
I really hope so.

181
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:55,121
I thought it was just her husband,

182
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:56,747
but her whole life is awful.

183
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,584
Your face is awful.

184
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:01,711
I agree with Byeong-il.

185
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,214
We could definitely use a drink today.

186
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:07,049
What is this? Is this Korean wine?

187
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,385
The color's stunning.

188
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:11,679
It's too good to drink.
Can we really drink it?

189
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,813
It's at least four years old.

190
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:26,652
This could be as good as medicine.

191
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:33,284
Yu-ri left earlier by the way.

192
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:35,828
Shall we finish this off
before Eun-hyeok comes?

193
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,299
Speak of the devil.

194
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,385
Just don't forget your duties.

195
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:05,107
Fine.

196
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:24,001
Satellites aren't working,
so I can't track your location.

197
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:27,505
When you press this,
it'll send signals to us.

198
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:30,550
-What if I don't?
-You will.

199
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:35,805
You're not the only one that kid
could save.

200
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:39,850
He could save all of humanity.

201
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:43,646
Also,

202
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:45,648
if you do it,

203
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,610
I'll tell you about your fiancé,
Nam Sang-won.

204
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,489
I know where he is and what he looks like.

205
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:36,240
It was a very dark night with no moon.

206
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:38,034
I lay down between the corpses

207
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:42,288
and pretended to be dead,

208
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,582
but I was watching them carefully.

209
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:51,297
The remnants of the People's Army
went inside the building,

210
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:55,718
and the Allied forces that were after them

211
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:58,721
fired hundreds of shots at the building.

212
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:09,774
Hey.

213
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:12,818
I know

214
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,491
I saw them go into the building
with my own two eyes.

215
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:21,202
But nobody came out of the building

216
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:23,287
and there were no dead bodies.

217
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,624
How baffling.

218
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,043
That building

219
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:34,965
was here.

220
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:39,303
Then…

221
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:44,392
We have no idea

222
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,895
what's buried underneath where we are.

223
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:49,605
That's what I mean.

224
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,482
-What?
-Jeez.

225
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:05,955
Who are you?

226
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:08,916
I think he's a runaway soldier.

227
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:19,343
Run…

228
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:21,303
Run…

229
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,472
Quickly.

230
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:30,479
Oh my…

231
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:49,457
Hey.

232
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,835
Don't you know you should always
be with your buddy?

233
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:57,089
I came here because my buddy is so sick.

234
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,013
Are you scared?

235
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,514
What?

236
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,934
You've grown a lot.

237
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,020
I was always this tall.

238
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,024
Right.

239
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,279
You're walking well.

240
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,200
What?

241
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,786
I thought your legs hurt.

242
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,458
That's why I quit ballet.

243
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,423
You were my last audience.
Consider it an honor.

244
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,427
You quit it for good?

245
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:46,222
Yes.

246
00:29:46,764 --> 00:29:48,057
Why? You were so good.

247
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,228
Look what the world has become.

248
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:55,981
There's no one to watch me perform.

249
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,168
Who was it this time?

250
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:23,384
You have this look on your face
when someone gives you a hard time.

251
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,760
You know that, right?

252
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:26,554
No.

253
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:31,851
Well, you look like this

254
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:34,061
most of the time, though.

255
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:38,524
When someone fucks with you…

256
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:44,405
Do this at least, okay?

257
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:45,823
Now try it.

258
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,874
Hey, forget it. Gosh.

259
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:57,710
You have no talent.

260
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:01,297
All right. Look.

261
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:04,091
Fold this,

262
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:07,761
this, and this.

263
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:11,223
Just go like this.

264
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:13,517
What?

265
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,811
You just promised me.

266
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,479
Promised you what?

267
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:21,734
It's a secret.

268
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:24,028
Anyway, you made a promise.

269
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:28,198
Promise.

270
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:29,617
Congratulations.

271
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:31,869
It's your first love.

272
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:37,666
Oh my god, you're infuriating.

273
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,709
Hey, Hyun-su!

274
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:42,379
Look. Do it like this.

275
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,507
I taught you this just now.
Why don't you get it?

276
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,221
Jeez.

277
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:53,933
What are you staring at?

278
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,560
You're so annoying.

279
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:16,390
Did you really grab a knife?

280
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,187
At your first birthday ceremony?

281
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,356
You woke up, Ji-su.

282
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:30,487
To tell you the truth,
I grabbed something else.

283
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:31,905
Sorry?

284
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,659
They said I grabbed my dad by the collar.

285
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:39,455
It's so like you.

286
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:42,708
I really did grab a knife.

287
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:45,794
It was a rice cake knife.

288
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,174
You're a natural.

289
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,971
Teach me how to use a sword.

290
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,724
I will when you're all better.

291
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:07,357
Jae-heon, you're a good person.

292
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,653
I'm only trying to live by God's will.

293
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:15,574
Well, yes, anyway,

294
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:18,744
you saved my life.

295
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:21,997
That's also God's will.

296
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:23,332
Seriously? Hey.

297
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:29,671
Goodness.

298
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,675
I'm saying thank you.

299
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:36,470
Right.

300
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:39,431
Thank you, too,

301
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:41,725
for waking up.

302
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:48,607
First love?

303
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,862
That's crazy. That's just crazy.

304
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:57,407
First love, my ass.

305
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:01,495
Mister.

306
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,543
Got a lighter? Give me your lighter.

307
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:12,589
Are you bullying me or something?

308
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:14,550
No.

309
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,971
That's his way of saying thank you.

310
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:24,726
Then say please.

311
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:29,398
Please.

312
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:39,783
First love?

313
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,535
He's crazy.

314
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,957
Here. Take your lighter.

315
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,875
I quit smoking.

316
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,879
Let's see for how long.

317
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:53,755
TEMPERATURE LOG

318
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:59,219
Hey, four-eyes.

319
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:02,014
The soldier woke up,
and he's acting really weird.

320
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:03,682
Come quickly.

321
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,237
Jang Ju-seong, tell me your affiliation
and your mission.

322
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,364
I shouldn't be here.

323
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:26,121
Pull yourself together.

324
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,250
Is this working?

325
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:33,795
-The light is on.
-Is it working?

326
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,341
Hey, can you hear me?

327
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,134
Can you hear me?

328
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:40,844
Can't you hear me?

329
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,512
Damn it.

330
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:45,807
This bastard can hear us,
but he's ignoring us again.

331
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:49,186
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

332
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:50,854
Come out, come out.

333
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,566
-Damn it.
-No.

334
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,817
-Hey! Get him!
-No.

335
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,194
-I have to run.
-Bastard!

336
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:59,446
Give me my gun.

337
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:01,531
Give it back. I really need my gun.

338
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:04,117
Please. Give me my gun, please.

339
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:14,253
Take down the SOS sign.
As soon as possible.

340
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,460
You can't move yet.

341
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,425
Did you pass gas?

342
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:05,595
I don't know.

343
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:08,348
She did.

344
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:10,517
It was quiet and weak,

345
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,227
-but it smelled…
-No.

346
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:16,064
like nothing.

347
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:17,983
Son of a…

348
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:19,401
That's good.

349
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,611
Then you can eat now.

350
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:23,655
Start with a little bit of porridge.

351
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,702
These are antibiotics people gave me.

352
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,416
Thank you so much for doing this for me.

353
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,836
Eun-yu said you had surgical experience,
so I could trust you.

354
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,214
Did she say that?

355
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:45,510
I've never even observed surgery.

356
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:54,436
Still, you did a great job.

357
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,355
Well…

358
00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:59,566
Bring Eun-yu here, please.

359
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:08,533
Why are you here?

360
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,704
You should look at and listen to
only good things for the baby.

361
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:19,169
That's why I'm here.

362
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,599
I'll do my best.

363
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:37,813
I really want to meet your baby…

364
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,900
and see it smile.

365
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,992
Fifteen days.

366
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:56,706
If you can endure 15 days
after the first symptom,

367
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:58,583
you'll be over the worst.

368
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:24,609
Is he the security guard?

369
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,084
Wasn't it just the two that went up?

370
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:05,859
Go first.

371
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,359
Don't go.

372
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:48,818
It's too dangerous.

373
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:50,820
Don't go.

374
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:25,647
Sir?

375
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,072
Rotten fish!

376
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:28,932
No…

377
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:39,526
Throw it!

378
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:50,245
Throw it!

379
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:06,928
Throw it.

380
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:40,920
Throw it!

381
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:45,693
