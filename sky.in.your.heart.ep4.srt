4
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,745
Fah, are you dating Teacher Prince?

5
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:23,332
What if Teacher Prince and I become boyfriends for real?

6
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:24,410
Will you be mad?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,765
Marriage should be built on love.

8
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,105
That way they can live a long and happy married life.

9
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,760
I guess being in a wedding triggers his misery.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,192
Is it wrong to focus so much on building a life that I didn’t have time for her?

11
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,242
Is it wrong that I don’t love myself?

12
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,224
Since I already gave her all my love.

13
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:45,533
Abracadabra, I wish all your pain turns into butterflies and flies away.

14
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:13,458
Damn!

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,960
What is this?

16
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,219
I must have been so drunk last night.

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
That’s why Teacher Prince took me here.

18
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:33,170
What time is it?

19
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:37,594
Seven.

20
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,079
Hey.

21
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:44,192
Last night,

22
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,350
did something happen?

23
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,960
What do you mean something?

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,845
Like…

25
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,465
I didn’t do anything weird, did I?

26
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,251
No.

27
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:59,608
You were crying and talking about your ex all night long.

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,518
Yeah?

29
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,046
That’s all?

30
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:07,384
Yeah.

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,259
Anyway,

32
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:43,800
if I did anything terrible to you,

33
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,299
I’m sorry.

34
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:46,848
I was really drunk.

35
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,240
Bye now.

36
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,898
Pull yourself together, Fah.

37
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,018
Why did you kiss him?

38
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,159
I will drink less next time.

39
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,956
No.

40
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,480
I will never drink again.

41
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,856
Hey.

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,520
Where did you sleep last night?

43
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,000
What do you mean where?

44
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,760
My house, of course.

45
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,520
Your house?

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,249
Yes.

47
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,226
Bullshit.

48
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,104
You were wearing the same T-shirt last night.

49
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,331
Spill the beans. Where did you crash last night?

50
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:36,423
And that route you’re using isn’t the route from your house.

51
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,184
Tell us. Where did you sleep?

52
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,577
Whatever.

53
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,267
I just came to take a shower with you guys.

54
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,442
A shower with us?

55
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,037
Yes.

56
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,794
And you took a detour around the mountain to get here?

57
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:47,736
Yes.

58
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,319
Do you have a bathing cloth I can borrow?

59
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,368
No.

60
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,813
What is it around your neck then?

61
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:53,653
This?

62
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,396
My scarf.

63
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,117
Argh!

64
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:05,916
Mesa,

65
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,782
I have a question.

66
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:12,415
When you realized you liked Teacher Prince,

67
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,509
how did you feel?

68
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:16,885
Why do you ask?

69
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,193
Nothing.

70
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,392
Just curious.

71
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,740
I’ve never had feelings for a man before.

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,769
Are you having feelings for Uncle Phang?

73
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,922
I knew it.

74
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,172
You take care of him so well.

75
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,359
Are you nuts?

76
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,644
I’m just curious.

77
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:34,747
How did I feel?

78
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,603
I don’t know.

79
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,142
But when I see his face, I can’t help but smile.

80
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,498
Tag!

81
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,470
Tag!

82
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,797
Hello.

83
00:05:58,797 --> 00:05:59,604
Dao?

84
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,271
It’s me, Fah.

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,000
I’m going back to see you on your birthday.

86
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,789
No, I’m not running away.

87
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,604
I asked for permission.

88
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,957
Yeah.

89
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:12,915
I’ll see you then.

90
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:14,706
kiss kiss.

91
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,485
Was that your lover?

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,535
I asked you the other day.

93
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,133
You didn’t give me the answer.

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,871
Who do you call every single day?

95
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:28,985
Not telling.

96
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,488
Your lover, of course.

97
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,325
So what if I call my lover?

98
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:34,779
Are you jealous?

99
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,131
No.

100
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,158
Why would I be?

101
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:41,925
If you’re not jealous then…

102
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:43,924
Yes,

103
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:45,950
that was my lover.

104
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:56,280
If you’re not jealous, why are you making a face?

105
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:57,624
What are you rambling about?

106
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,580
What face am I making?

107
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,344
This face.

108
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,200
I’m not.

109
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:16,263
I’m not dating anyone.

110
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:21,259
In case that’s what you want to hear…too.

111
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:25,810
The one I just talked to

112
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,660
was my little brother.

113
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,792
And why are you smiling?

114
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:36,258
What?

115
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,666
You tease me when I smile.

116
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,840
You tease me when I don’t smile.

117
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:43,170
Talking to you gets me a headache.

118
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:44,239
I should just go.

119
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:45,375
Wait up.

120
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,265
Just realized something.

121
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,747
I'd like to hear your opinion.

122
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,226
Here.

123
00:07:55,894 --> 00:08:01,280
These are the presents I gave my brother for his previous birthdays.

124
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:06,637
I don’t know what I should get him this year.

125
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,822
Any ideas?

126
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,155
You have bought him a present every year.

127
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:18,840
Why don’t you try to make something by hand this year?

128
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:20,518
I can’t.

129
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,147
I have zero artistic skills.

130
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,021
It’s not that difficult.

131
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,220
I’ll teach you.

132
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:28,077
Really?

133
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,873
Yes.

134
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,641
I taught the children to make gifts in art class.

135
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,806
People here love to make gifts from lucky stones.

136
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,230
Lucky stones?

137
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,812
The stone accessories believed to be good luck charms?

138
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,036
Yes.

139
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,484
We have a lot here.

140
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,535
Why don’t you follow me?

141
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,240
You might get some ideas.

142
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,791
Ah!

143
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,787
They’re beautiful.

144
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,200
Right?

145
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:11,587
Hey.

146
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,270
Your brother is still a student.

147
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:16,881
If you wish him academic success, give him the purple stone.

148
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,600
If you wish him success in love, go for the pink one.

149
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,190
Education only, I guess.

150
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,485
He doesn’t need love enhancement.

151
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,021
So…

152
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,562
What are they mostly made into?

153
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:35,391
People usually make necklaces or bracelets out of them.

154
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,774
Then…

155
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,823
I will go for a necklace.

156
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,271
Can you teach me?

157
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,492
Of course.

158
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,997
500 baht for the lesson.

159
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:48,371
Dang!

160
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,601
That’s why you offered to help.

161
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,000
You want to extort the money from me.

162
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,600
Don’t be such a whiner. I’m kidding.

163
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,032
Come on. I’ll teach you.

164
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:02,802
Pay attention.

165
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,000
I’ll explain it once.

166
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,036
First of all,

167
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:15,099
choose the color.

168
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,467
This one.

169
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,521
Then…

170
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,260
I pick the white one.

171
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:36,920
It should be a bit longer than the actual length you want.

172
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,156
Like this.

173
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:40,391
This is the length I want.

174
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:42,575
Allow more length.

175
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,360
Okay.

176
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:44,374
Cut here.

177
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,443
What?

178
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,711
I cut the wrong string.

179
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,125
Let’s do it again.

180
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:50,498
Okay.

181
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:10,000
Start from one end first.

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,575
See?

183
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,591
I got it.

184
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,827
How is that a necklace?

185
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,240
I’m putting you to sleep.

186
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,322
Hey.

187
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:49,778
We’re done.

188
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,580
It wasn’t that hard.

189
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,206
It wasn’t.

190
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,127
Compared to these five necklaces you ruined.

191
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:00,777
Come on.

192
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,628
I’m a beginner.

193
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,148
This is great enough.

194
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,258
By the way,

195
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:13,908
can I try it on you?

196
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,454
You and my brother are around the same size.

197
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:42,807
So?

198
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,680
Do you like it?

199
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,987
I do.

200
00:12:53,552 --> 00:12:56,008
Thank you so much.

201
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:08,927
We’re all set, right?

202
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:10,858
Then,

203
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,425
I’ll be out of your hair.

204
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,452
Hold on.

205
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:20,870
We’re not done.

206
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:25,607
Why?

207
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,428
We are.

208
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,395
What is left to do?

209
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,763
One last step.

210
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,320
Moonbathe it.

211
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:42,225
When are you coming back?

212
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:43,219
I’ll be away for just two days.

213
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:43,954
Will be back in no time.

214
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:45,252
I promise

215
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,040
I will be a good boy.

216
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,720
Hey!

217
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,640
What are you two doing?

218
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,086
The locals believe that

219
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,132
moonbathing it for an hour

220
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,023
will increase its charm power.

221
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,244
What are you laughing at?

222
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:52,816
At myself.

223
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:58,806
I have never made such a serious gift for anyone before.

224
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:00,146
Come on.

225
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,345
I heard you dated lots of girls.

226
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:04,592
It’s hard to believe you never did it.

227
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,226
When I had a girlfriend,

228
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,414
all I did was study and work.

229
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,043
Since we broke up, I’ve never gotten into a serious relationship.

230
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,243
It was all casual.

231
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,722
Did that help you forget?

232
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:25,708
If it did,

233
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,960
do you think I would be here?

234
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,685
You have a point.

235
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,196
What’s your story?

236
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,604
You always ask about mine.

237
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:41,858
You never tell yours.

238
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,332
What do you want to know?

239
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,439
Well…

240
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:48,925
Love.

241
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:49,990
Like…

242
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,397
Your ex.

243
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:53,298
Let me guess.

244
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,660
You’re a man with lots of experience.

245
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,693
That’s how you know so much about love.

246
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,866
Haven’t you heard

247
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:05,049
we're always experts in other people's businesses?

248
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,392
I wouldn’t be here if I were that good.

249
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:15,502
It’s raining.

250
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,767
We should find shelter in the school.

251
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,605
Come on.

252
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,574
BAN KHUN OM HAET NOK SCHOOL

253
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,848
It’s pouring.

254
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:31,907
I don’t think it’ll stop until the morning.

255
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,965
We can’t moonbathe the stone now.

256
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I’ll just…

257
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,255
buy my brother something.

258
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,458
I need to leave tomorrow.

259
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:57,655
♪ Journey starts no matter how far the distance ♪

260
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:02,383
♪ No matter how high or steep the mountains ♪

261
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:09,407
♪ But too fast and too soon the love I seek is gone ♪

262
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,356
Thank you.

263
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:48,817
Hey!

264
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,000
What are you two doing?

265
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,426
I asked him to help me with my brother’s present.

266
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,176
All night?

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,718
It was pouring last night.

268
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,150
We couldn’t leave the school.

269
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,655
Are we living on the same mountain here?

270
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,569
When did it rain?

271
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,996
I was dead to the world.

272
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,416
I didn’t know that.

273
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,262
Whatever.

274
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,780
I’ll just leave.

275
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,786
I’m gonna get ready to leave.

276
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:27,856
I’m taking off now.

277
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,313
Okay then.

278
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,383
See you later.

279
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:35,970
Wait!

280
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,145
What?

281
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,987
Bring me lots of snacks.

282
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:54,800
Fine.

283
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,600
I’ll even bring you beers.

284
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,774
Thank you.

285
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,006
Well.

286
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,031
Will you excuse me?

287
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,119
Wait.

288
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,107
Get home safe.

289
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,840
Took you so long, Uncle.

290
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,550
Oh! It’s you.

291
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,840
I’ve brought you a food box.

292
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,723
In case you’re hungry on the way down.

293
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:44,221
Is this from the village chief?

294
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,170
No.

295
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,444
I made it.

296
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:50,439
Omelet and Rice you have been wanting to eat.

297
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:53,943
Are you…

298
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:58,743
hitting on me?

299
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,333
What are you talking about?

300
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,465
If you don’t want it, give it back.

301
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:02,692
I do.

302
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:06,488
Thank you.

303
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:09,381
So…

304
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:10,776
When are you coming back?

305
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:12,527
Monday.

306
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:14,083
I’ll be away for just two days.

307
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,070
Will be back in no time.

308
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,021
Are you sure?

309
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,520
Are you planning to run off and party?

310
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,134
I won’t do that.

311
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:23,412
I promise

312
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,058
I will be a good boy.

313
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,312
And?

314
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,694
And…

315
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,074
And I’ll behave.

316
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,851
I wanted to say…

317
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:38,680
And you’re telling because?

318
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:40,728
We’re not boyfriends.

319
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,169
How can we not?

320
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:48,084
Last night

321
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,026
we slept together.

322
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,632
What are you saying?

323
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:55,240
I’m going to kick your ass.

324
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,975
Do it.

325
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,160
The children will see how wicked their teacher is.

326
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,186
I will.

327
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:04,936
Go on.

328
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:05,841
Do it.

329
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,043
Ahem.

330
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:09,884
Uncle.

331
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,276
When did you get here?

332
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,316
A long time ago.

333
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,243
I just didn’t want to interrupt.

334
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,341
Youth is just so nice.

335
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,244
Get in.

336
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:25,580
He must be drunk.

337
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:27,533
He’s saying weird things.

338
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,370
Say no more.

339
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:30,722
Get in already.

340
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,465
Bye-bye.

341
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,687
Bye-bye.

342
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,589
Just go.

343
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,264
Really?

344
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:40,669
- Go.
- I’m going.

345
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,029
I’m really going.

346
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:42,542
Yes.

347
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:44,912
Bye-bye.

348
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:45,712
Go already.

349
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:02,736
Goodbye.

350
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,238
Get home safe, children.

351
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,028
Prince.

352
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,310
Are you all right?

353
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:14,900
I am.

354
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,668
But you look pale.

355
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:19,128
Do you have a fever?

356
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:19,915
Excuse me.

357
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,148
Prince.

358
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,407
You’re burning.

359
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,520
Why didn’t you tell me? Why came to work?

360
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,022
I’m okay.

361
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,925
Might be the rain last night.

362
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,440
I should be fine after taking medicines.

363
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:34,839
I think I should take you home.

364
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,161
That’s okay, Mesa.

365
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,342
I can take Prince home.

366
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,318
Come on, Prince.

367
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:39,114
That’s fine.

368
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,054
I’ll do it.

369
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:41,262
Don’t you get it?

370
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:42,223
I said I will take him home.

371
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:44,117
You don’t get it. I’m sending him home.

372
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,478
I have a car. Do you?

373
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,401
What do you want?

374
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,280
What do you want?

375
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,265
You want a problem?

376
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:48,765
Bring it on.

377
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I said I will take him home.

378
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:52,972
Hey!

379
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:55,396
It’s you!

380
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:57,080
I told you I’d take him home.

381
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,235
Prince, are you okay?

382
00:22:58,235 --> 00:22:58,816
Prince.

383
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,301
- You, move.
- You, let him go.

384
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:01,503
You, let him go. I’ll get him home.

385
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:02,666
Do not touch him.

386
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,757
What’s your problem here?

387
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:06,524
I told you I’d take him home.

388
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,772
We’re ready, Fah.

389
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:08,552
Where are we going?

390
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:13,444
You said we must buy you drinks when you’re back in Bangkok.

391
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,140
You never get serious with anyone.

392
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,175
Do you still live by that?

393
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:19,425
Or maybe someone up on the mountain has changed you.

394
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,933
No one can change Kuafah.

395
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,525
Teacher Prince

396
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,437
Slowly.

397
00:23:58,193 --> 00:23:59,748
Sip some warm water.

398
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:00,935
It helps.

399
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:09,026
Thank you.

400
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:12,312
I will just take a rest.

401
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:13,443
I should feel better soon.

402
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:14,530
I can’t leave.

403
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:18,204
What if your fever is getting worse?

404
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:20,827
I and my two henchmen will take care of you.

405
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,759
Can I borrow your phone?

406
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:41,375
Three phones, for what?

407
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:43,203
Well, choose one.

408
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,374
Yeah?

409
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:07,494
(Hi, boss.)

410
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,128
We have news for you.

411
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,558
In short,

412
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,536
Teacher Prince is sick.

413
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,604
Aou is nursing him.

414
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,212
What?

415
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:17,963
Don’t let him.

416
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,176
You must interfere.

417
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,701
How?

418
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:24,404
Get the teacher some congee or hot food.

419
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:27,827
Don’t let him be alone with Aou. Got it?

420
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,053
Yeah.

421
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:34,284
Why do you sound angrier than us?

422
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,992
I’m angry for Mesa.

423
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,780
(Do as I said.)

424
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:42,268
Okay then.

425
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,812
Angry for me.

426
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,726
Why so moody?

427
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,078
Who is moody?

428
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:03,533
You are.

429
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:06,849
I’m not. You’re wrong.

430
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:09,538
You want a mirror?

431
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,173
We’re ready, Fah.

432
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,084
When you’re done eating, we can head out.

433
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,346
To where?

434
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:30,633
You said we must buy you drinks when you’re back in Bangkok.

435
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:34,404
You said you missed the nightlife and girls.

436
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,500
Really?

437
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:39,047
I said that?

438
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:40,460
You did.

439
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:42,267
I reserved the table.

440
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,680
The table with the best view.

441
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,141
I don’t think I can go.

442
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,062
I have a stomachache.

443
00:26:55,421 --> 00:26:57,066
Come on, Fah.

444
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:01,324
Kluen asked a favor from the club owner to get that VIP table.

445
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:02,975
Let’s go.

446
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:04,404
It might lift your mood.

447
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:05,998
Please.

448
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,975
Teacher Prince, I’ve brought you Rice Soup.

449
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,318
Hey.

450
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,311
Someone got here first.

451
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:23,910
Sorry.

452
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:27,751
And thank you both for your concern.

453
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,520
How are you doing?

454
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,220
Feeling better?

455
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,668
I’ve taken some medicines.

456
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:33,722
Feeling much better now.

457
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:35,123
I’m about to have dinner.

458
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,031
That’s right.

459
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,667
You should start having the rice soup before it’s cold.

460
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:42,650
I also made you ginseng soup for your health.

461
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,680
Let me walk you out.

462
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,484
So Teacher Prince can eat comfortably.

463
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:50,303
We have so much food here.

464
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,584
He can’t finish all by himself.

465
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:54,148
That’s right.

466
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:55,388
You’ve brought a lot.

467
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:56,110
These are for us too, right?

468
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,611
Thank you.

469
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:58,407
How kind. Let me try some.

470
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:00,628
You just hit my hand.

471
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:02,087
These are for Teacher Prince.

472
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:06,164
But I really can’t finish them all, Aou.

473
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,223
See?

474
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:08,443
Let’s eat together.

475
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:09,343
Right?

476
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,239
How generous. Thank you so much.

477
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:18,484
It’d be nice if someone here is as generous as Teacher Prince.

478
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,225
To Kuafah.

479
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:25,300
Cheers.

480
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,532
Excuse me.

481
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:35,118
Do you mind having one drink with me?

482
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:37,922
Sorry, I do.

483
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:41,297
I just love my boyfriend so much.

484
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:43,528
What are you doing?

485
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:44,560
This is embarrassing.

486
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,335
But this guy is single.

487
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,081
You can drink with him.

488
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,020
You look familiar.

489
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:56,380
Do you come here a lot?

490
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:58,462
Hey, Kuafah.

491
00:28:58,462 --> 00:28:59,778
Haven’t seen you in a while.

492
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:01,908
Fah.

493
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:10,011
Are you interested in coming to my place tonight?

494
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,431
No. I’m sorry.

495
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:17,950
I’m going to use the bathroom.

496
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,368
So much temptation here.

497
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:39,897
Kuafah, focus.

498
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,657
You gave him a promise.

499
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:55,022
I saw that, Fah.

500
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,098
Kitty.

501
00:29:58,606 --> 00:29:59,404
You saw what?

502
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,704
A changed Kuafah.

503
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,901
You didn’t flirt with anyone. Didn’t drink with anyone.

504
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,816
It’s like you’re in a relationship.

505
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:12,364
I’m not.

506
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,404
Will you excuse me?

507
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:28,152
Hi. What’s up?

508
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,926
(Listen. Listen. Listen.)

509
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:31,441
(We’ve got a situation here.)

510
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:36,058
We tried to block Aou by having dinner with Teacher Prince.

511
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,626
But he kicked us out after dinner.

512
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:42,408
He even said he’d spend the night at Teacher Prince’s.

513
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,404
How could you guys let that happen?

514
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,526
We didn’t want to.

515
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,378
But his men didn’t let us in either.

516
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:52,288
And Teacher Prince agrees to spend the night with him?

517
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:56,189
(You know Prince has high respect for the village chief.)

518
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,513
He couldn’t just shoo his son away.

519
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:59,721
(Shit! We gotta go now.)

520
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:00,925
(His men are watching us.)

521
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:02,465
Wait.

522
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:03,481
Mesa!

523
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:09,503
Aou!

524
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:16,848
Gotcha.

525
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:19,065
You just called your lover.

526
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:22,956
I told you

527
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:24,442
I’m single.

528
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,126
That’s right.

529
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,713
Because Kuafah’s motto is

530
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:30,737
“Never get serious with anyone.”

531
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,425
Do you still live by that?

532
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:34,959
Or maybe…

533
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,592
Someone up on the mountain has changed you.

534
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:42,605
No one

535
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,771
can change Kuafah.

536
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:46,724
Prove it then.

537
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:55,813
Sure.

538
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,112
Now that’s the Kuafah I know.

539
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:11,523
Thank you all for your concern.

540
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:13,416
But I’m fine now.

541
00:32:13,772 --> 00:32:15,214
Just say it, Teacher Prince.

542
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:17,968
I and my men can guard your house out front.

543
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:19,438
That’s okay.

544
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,359
It’s late.

545
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:22,916
You all should go home.

546
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:24,404
Alright then.

547
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,278
Take care.

548
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,941
It’s good he managed to send him home.

549
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:37,899
We should leave too.

550
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:39,644
Bye.

551
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:40,990
Thank you.

552
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,882
Mesa doesn’t mind.

553
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:08,844
He has three phones.

554
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:12,679
Okay.

555
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,844
I gotta go, Dao.

556
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:20,890
Hey.

557
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:44,720
It’s too quiet here.

558
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,705
[Kuafah]

559
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:13,232
(Hello.)

560
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:15,754
(Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?)

561
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:18,731
(I’m Kitty, his girlfriend.)

562
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,044
(What did you do last night?)

563
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,838
A girl called this number.

564
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:31,007
Teacher Prince took the call.

565
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:33,935
If one of your friends is having a fight with someone he’s talking to.

566
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:35,849
He needs to make it up to that person

567
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:38,158
so he can’t attend your birthday party.

568
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:39,134
I’m not okay with that.

569
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,333
(Hello.)

570
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,010
(Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?)

571
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:26,920
(I’m Kitty, his girlfriend.)

572
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:31,560
(I see he’s specially close to you.)

573
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,888
(So I called to let you know he’s doing fine.)

574
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,718
(And he should be busy with me all night.)

575
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:41,291
(Don’t call unless there’s something necessary.)

576
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:42,613
(Goodnight.)

577
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:51,141
Seriously, why brought three phones?

578
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,384
Teacher Prince, is something wrong?

579
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:58,779
Nothing.

580
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,867
Doctor Kuafah’s girlfriend just called.

581
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:04,930
Girlfriend?

582
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:07,056
Kuafah doesn’t have a girlfriend.

583
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:11,255
Someone like him must have a girlfriend everywhere.

584
00:36:11,428 --> 00:36:12,550
You two just don’t know.

585
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,630
Will you excuse me?

586
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,275
Tell me if I’m wrong.

587
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:33,748
I think Teacher Prince is jealous.

588
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:35,117
Probably.

589
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,085
Let’s discuss this later.

590
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:37,797
Let’s go.

591
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:04,668
Dao.

592
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:08,691
Is he usually this wasted?

593
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,100
No.

594
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:13,101
This is unusual.

595
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:14,728
How?

596
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,372
He normally drinks a few glasses

597
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,185
and has a girl over.

598
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,122
But tonight, he kept drinking.

599
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,914
He didn’t bring any girl home.

600
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,189
By the way,

601
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:33,101
when you went to get the car,

602
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,132
something weird happened.

603
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,200
What?

604
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,512
I was carrying him.

605
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:42,865
A girl approached.

606
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:45,722
She’s the one Fah drank with.

607
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,870
She asked him to go over to her place.

608
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:51,379
Fah insisted on not going.

609
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,701
He wanted to come home with us.

610
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:59,947
He’s become a different person after he came back from the mountain.

611
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,666
He must have met someone good there.

612
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:33,164
Yeah

613
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,623
(Fah, you asshole.)

614
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,192
(What did you do last night?)

615
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,866
What?

616
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,541
A girl called this number.

617
00:38:41,648 --> 00:38:43,101
You know what’s shitty?

618
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:45,021
Teacher Prince took the call.

619
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,724
(She claimed she was your girlfriend.)

620
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:49,902
(JJ and I tried to correct it.)

621
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:54,102
Why do you keep staring at your phone?

622
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,182
Are you expecting a call?

623
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,080
Nothing.

624
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:59,096
You okay?

625
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,741
Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?

626
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:08,133
I’m Kitty, his girlfriend.

627
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:09,652
Shit.

628
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:13,321
She must have used my phone when I was in the bathroom.

629
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,483
Are you with Teacher Prince?

630
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,821
Let me talk to him.

631
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:18,897
Why?

632
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,621
I don’t want him to think I have a girlfriend.

633
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,804
Let me be frank here.

634
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,388
Do you like Teacher Prince?

635
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,798
It’s not that.

636
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,969
How long have we been friends?

637
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:36,805
You think I cannot tell who you like?

638
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:43,591
I don’t know if I like him.

639
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,164
I’m just happy to see him smile.

640
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:51,865
That isn’t a necklace.

641
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:56,176
And I like to spend time with him.

642
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,749
Mesa

643
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,911
I’m sorry.

644
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,605
(Why are you apologizing?)

645
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:08,101
Because I know you like him.

646
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:10,079
I shouldn’t do this.

647
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,025
Honestly,

648
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,934
I did like him at first.

649
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:17,222
But after a while,

650
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,918
I realized I might just admire him.

651
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,831
So you’ve been playing me?

652
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,156
(I could tell a while ago you like him.)

653
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:30,153
I kept bugging you so that you know

654
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,610
that you really like him.

655
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:33,347
(It’s good you finally realized it.)

656
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,633
(Congratulations, my friend.)

657
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:36,541
Yes.

658
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:38,297
Thank you.

659
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:42,101
But it would be better if you could help me set my record straight.

660
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:42,852
Why would I?

661
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,532
Your problem. You solve it.

662
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:45,528
Bye now.

663
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:46,474
No more talking. I have a class to teach.

664
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,272
What?

665
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,027
Mesa.

666
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:48,992
Come on.

667
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,830
Is he really on my side?

668
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,646
And I spilled half of my popcorn.

669
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,155
People were all staring at me.

670
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:11,438
Fah

671
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:13,981
Fah, are you listening?

672
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:16,799
I am.

673
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,101
Where were we?

674
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,205
So you're stuck in the elevator and then what?

675
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,745
I spilled popcorn. I didn’t get stuck in the elevator.

676
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:25,769
Are you really listening?

677
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,288
Are you okay?

678
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:32,910
I am.

679
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,318
I’m fine.

680
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:36,279
Should I just squeeze it out of you?

681
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:43,591
Dao.

682
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,381
Let’s say…

683
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:50,388
one of your friends is having a fight with his lover.

684
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,101
Wait. Not lover.

685
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:55,022
He’s having a fight with someone he’s talking to.

686
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,353
He needs to make it up to that person

687
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:00,390
so he can’t attend your birthday party.

688
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,557
Will you be mad at him?

689
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:04,418
And…

690
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:07,110
How mad is that person?

691
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:09,274
Pretty mad.

692
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:11,793
And is my friend worried?

693
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:14,137
He is.

694
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,124
Very much.

695
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,034
Then you should go, Fah.

696
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,218
Book a flight and go now.

697
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:24,342
But the friend…

698
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,084
Wait a minute.

699
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,459
Did you just say Fah?

700
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:31,196
I was mentioning your friend.

701
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,306
Enough with the lies.

702
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,710
This is definitely your story.

703
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,771
Will you be okay if I go?

704
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,743
I won’t be at your birthday party.

705
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,747
I attend your birthday party every year.

706
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:54,717
Right.

707
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,454
I’m not okay.

708
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:09,998
I brought you food.

709
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,021
Actually,

710
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:15,402
you don’t need to attend the meeting today.

711
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:16,830
I will inform my dad about that.

712
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:18,869
That’s all right.

713
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:19,978
I’m feeling better now.

714
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:22,610
But I think we should…

715
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,898
No. I insist.

716
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,126
Will you please let me get changed?

717
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:27,928
Thank you so much, Aou.

718
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:28,582
Sure.

719
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:41,230
I’m truly feeling better, Aou.

720
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:53,122
You.

721
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,381
Will you be okay if I go?

722
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:57,948
I’m not okay.

723
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:03,861
I’m not okay because you only care about me.

724
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,177
You don’t care about your own feelings.

725
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:09,530
I’m worried about you.

726
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:13,678
My birthday party happens every year.

727
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:16,593
But if you let the one slip through your fingers,

728
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,892
you might never have another chance.

729
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,646
I will be so happy if you can climb the Himalayas again.

730
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,818
You remember that story?

731
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:29,725
Yes.

732
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:33,955
You compare your life achievement to climbing the Himalayas.

733
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:38,232
You want to take someone up there and share the view with you.

734
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,775
After your heartbreak,

735
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:43,430
you never mentioned any mountain again

736
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:47,661
If that person can inspire you to climb again,

737
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,924
don’t let the person go.

738
00:45:00,082 --> 00:45:01,269
I’m back.

739
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:16,790
This is the first time in my life that I've been so concerned about someone.

740
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:18,453
But it’s all right.

If you let someone down and don’t apologize,

743
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:52,948
you will grow up to be a bad adult.

744
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:53,992
Are you speaking of me?

745
00:45:53,992 --> 00:45:55,676
You come when you feel like it.

746
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:57,208
The next minute, you go with someone else.

747
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,730
You refuse to express your feelings.

748
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,307
It's not always simple to speak up.

749
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:05,061
It's not always simple to wait either.

750
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,061
From this moment on,

751
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:09,272
can I flirt on you?
