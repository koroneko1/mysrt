&lrm;-Oh!
&lrm;-Wow!

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.700
&lrm;-That's so--
&lrm;-Awesome! I know!

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.300
&lrm;I'm so going to write a blog about Markov!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.900
&lrm;[a student] -Cool!
&lrm;-Max is a real genius!

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.020
&lrm;You've added arms to him
&lrm;since the last time. That's cool!

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.980
&lrm;Markov added them all by himself.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.340
&lrm;He's the most highly evolved robot
&lrm;there is.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.700
&lrm;Please! Your friend's
&lrm;just a talking calculator!

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.540
&lrm;-There's nothing "evolved" about that!
&lrm;-Don't listen to her, Markov.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.900
&lrm;That girl is the lowest of the low
&lrm;when it comes to human evolution.

&lrm;<i>Ha, ha! You're very amusing, Marinette!</i>

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.020
&lrm;You know my name?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.420
&lrm;<i>Of course. Max showed me the class photo.</i>

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.860
&lrm;<i>He told me about you</i>
&lrm;<i>and his other friends.</i>

&lrm;<i>I'm very happy to finally meet you!</i>

&lrm;Huh? Oh!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.420
&lrm;This toy you've manufactured
&lrm;is quite impressive. Now put it away.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.220
&lrm;-Come on, everybody, back to your seats!
&lrm;<i>-With all due respect,</i>

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.260
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy. My name is Markov,</i>
&lrm;<i>and I am Max's best friend.</i>

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.420
&lrm;Markov is right.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.420
&lrm;He's not just some toy. He's my friend.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.140
&lrm;He's as intelligent and sensitive
&lrm;as any human.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.900
&lrm;Look, Max, a robot may be intelligent,
&lrm;but it can't have emotions.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.300
&lrm;<i>If I may, ma'am,</i>
&lrm;<i>I can assure you that I truly love Max.</i>

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.540
&lrm;Be serious, Max.
&lrm;You've programmed your robot to say that.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.220
&lrm;A robot cannot think for itself,
&lrm;much less love anybody!

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.740
&lrm;I swear to you
&lrm;I did not program him to say that.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.780
&lrm;Ever since I created him, he's integrated
&lrm;his own accumulative thinking system.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.220
&lrm;And he has developed all our emotions,
&lrm;just like any human being.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.540
&lrm;[all] -Whoa!
&lrm;-That's enough, Max!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.140
&lrm;If you don't put that plaything away
&lrm;right now, I'll confiscate it.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.260
&lrm;Understand?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.180
&lrm;Yes, Mrs. Mendeleiev.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.180
&lrm;Come on, Markov, go back in the bag.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.140
&lrm;<i>-You're not being reasonable!</i>
&lrm;-Stop it, Markov.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.580
&lrm;<i>Why? It's true, isn't it?</i>

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.740
&lrm;[the students laugh]

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.100
&lrm;It sure is.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.180
&lrm;All right, that's enough!

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.100
&lrm;Max, you can get your robot back
&lrm;at the end of the day.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.700
&lrm;No, Mr. Damocles, please don't do that.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
&lrm;Do you want three hours of detention too?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.180
&lrm;No, sir.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.260
&lrm;<i>Max? Aren't you coming with me? Max!</i>

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.260
&lrm;<i>Sir, I'd like to stay in Max's class,</i>
&lrm;<i>Please!</i>

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.380
&lrm;Hmm.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.260
&lrm;<i>I heard you're interested in computing.</i>

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.780
&lrm;I am indeed. It's one of my hobbies.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.540
&lrm;I even wrote a program for my computer,
&lrm;which...

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.140
&lrm;Why on Earth am I talking to a toy?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.060
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy, Mr. Damocles!</i>
&lrm;<i>My name is Markov.</i>

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.100
&lrm;<i>Oh, oh...</i>

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.900
&lrm;<i>Do not put me inside here, Mr--</i>

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.580
&lrm;If only I had a button like this
&lrm;for all of my students.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.660
&lrm;Two dear friends who've been separated.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.780
&lrm;There is nothing artificial
&lrm;about those emotions.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.820
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.100
&lrm;and evilise this electronic heart!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.580
&lrm;Silence! Back to your seats, everyone!

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.860
&lrm;Markov has never been without me.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.140
&lrm;I don't know how he'll handle this.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.860
&lrm;Hold on. I'll see what I can do.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.380
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.380
&lrm;Uh... Excuse me, Mrs. Mendeleiev.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.100
&lrm;As class representative, could I get
&lrm;permission to go see Mr. Damocles?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.580
&lrm;No!
&lrm;You can go and see him between periods!

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.980
&lrm;I don't mean to be rude, but I think
&lrm;you're mistaken about Markov,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.940
&lrm;Max's friend.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.500
&lrm;This is starting to get on my nerves!

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.020
&lrm;And your behaviour is inappropriate!

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.700
&lrm;Markov wasn't wrong!

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.460
&lrm;I'm sending you to the principal's office
&lrm;right this minute!

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.220
&lrm;Thank you, Mrs. Mendeleiev!

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.740
&lrm;Robostus, I am Hawk Moth.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.140
&lrm;Humans don't believe
&lrm;you're a living being,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.020
&lrm;so I'm giving you the power
&lrm;to bring all machines to life

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.540
&lrm;to help you seek revenge.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.500
&lrm;<i>Thank you kindly, Mr. Hawk Moth.</i>

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.580
&lrm;But, in return, I want you to bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.540
&lrm;<i>Could you define "Miraculous"?</i>

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.380
&lrm;They're the magic jewels
&lrm;belonging to the superheroes.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.220
&lrm;<i>Very well.</i>
&lrm;<i>What is the purpose of these jewels?</i>

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.860
&lrm;This is none of your concern!

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.580
&lrm;<i>I was just being curious.</i>

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.620
&lrm;If used together,
&lrm;they can make a wish come true.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.060
&lrm;<i>Could I make any wish come true?</i>

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.500
&lrm;No! The Miraculous and the wish
&lrm;will belong to me!

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.820
&lrm;<i>I assure you I will find</i>
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.060
&lrm;Hmm.

&lrm;<i>Max, my friend, I'm coming to get you.</i>

&lrm;Mr. Damocles! Where's Markov?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.740
&lrm;-Who's Markov?
&lrm;-Max's friend.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.660
&lrm;Ah! Not that toy again!

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.020
&lrm;He's not a toy, Mr. Damocles.
&lrm;Could you please let Max hold onto him?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.300
&lrm;He won't cause trouble,
&lrm;I'll make sure of it!

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.420
&lrm;Listen--

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.340

&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.700
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy!</i>

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.740
&lrm;Now I see why Max was worried!

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.940
&lrm;Time to transform!

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.340
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.980
&lrm;Ha!

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.860
&lrm;[Robostus] &lrm;<i>Where are you Max?</i>

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.700
&lrm;<i>Max! My friend!</i>

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.420
&lrm;[Mrs. Mendeleiev] -Max, come to me!
&lrm;-Leave me alone!

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.260
&lrm;What are you doing? Stop!
&lrm;Stop right now! Let me go!

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.900
&lrm;Markov, what are you doing?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.300
&lrm;<i>From now on, I am Robostus!</i>

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.740
&lrm;<i>And we shall be together 100% of the time,</i>
&lrm;<i>forever!</i>

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.220
&lrm;One thing's for sure.
&lrm;Max's friend has emotions!

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.580
&lrm;But not the kind that matters!
&lrm;A robot doesn't eat.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.700
&lrm;So he'll never experience the pure elation
&lrm;of tasting an exquisite camembert!

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.260
&lrm;You really are something!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.140
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.940
&lrm;Come on! Hurry! Over there!

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.180
&lrm;Let me go! Max, control your robot!

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.380
&lrm;-Please don't do anything foolish!
&lrm;<i>-You must trust me.</i>

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.900
&lrm;You cannot do this!

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.140
&lrm;<i>And you cannot separate me from Max!</i>

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.300
&lrm;Aaah!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.180
&lrm;If you love your friend,
&lrm;you should listen to him!

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.460
&lrm;-Yeah! Like we do!
&lrm;-Argh!

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.580
&lrm;<i>You really think any of you can stop me</i>
&lrm;<i>from doing what I want</i>

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.460
&lrm;<i>and showing the world that I'm probably</i>
&lrm;<i>more human than both of you put together?</i>

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.820
&lrm;Yeah! That's kinda our job!

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.580
&lrm;Do you think Max is happy about
&lrm;his best friend becoming a supervillain?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.900
&lrm;You should stop this, Markov.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.860
&lrm;<i>I'm doing it for our friendship, Max!</i>

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.060
&lrm;<i>They want to keep us apart!</i>

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.220
&lrm;Whoa!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.060
&lrm;-Seems he knows where he is going.
&lrm;-Better play it safe.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.500
&lrm;His robot's brain computes faster
&lrm;than ours combined!

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.140
&lrm;Speak for yourself! Ha!

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.980
&lrm;Cat Noir! There!

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.620
&lrm;Go away! Go away!

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.500
&lrm;He's got a whole army
&lrm;of living machines now!

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.380
&lrm;-Thank you!
&lrm;-Cat Noir!

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.540
&lrm;-Take care of the vending machines!
&lrm;-Hide on the roof!

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.940
&lrm;-Go get him, Ladybug!
&lrm;-Catch him, Cat Noir!

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.060
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug!

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.860
&lrm;Always a pleasure, Mr. Ramier!

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.580
&lrm;Milady, take a look at this!

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.660
&lrm;<i>Nadia Chamack, live here.</i>
&lrm;<i>Inanimate objects have come to life,</i>

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.100
&lrm;<i>taking control of Paris.</i>

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.500
&lrm;<i>Broadcasting live from City Hall,</i>
&lrm;<i>the new mayor has just made a declaration.</i>

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.020
&lrm;-Is that Morse code?
&lrm;-Do you need subtitles?

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.740
&lrm;I speak several languages.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.580
&lrm;Humans... will... soon be...

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.460
&lrm;treated the same way as objects.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.780
&lrm;<i>Paris' only hope in this dire situation</i>
&lrm;<i>is Ladybug and Cat N--</i>

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.780
&lrm;<i>Hey! Aaah!</i>

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.740
&lrm;Oh, come on! She could've at least
&lrm;finished saying my name!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.980
&lrm;We'll never be able to defeat them all.
&lrm;We must fight the problem at its source.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.060
&lrm;Ha!

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.860
&lrm;Given his size, we shouldn't have
&lrm;any trouble finding him!

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.820
&lrm;Hey, look!

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.820
&lrm;I think we're on the right track!

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.460
&lrm;[Ladybug] No more footprints!

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.180
&lrm;He couldn't have just disappeared!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.500
&lrm;He must have leapt over the stadium!

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.220
&lrm;Oh! The tunnels!

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.100
&lrm;-He's trapped us in here!
&lrm;-We don't have time!

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.860
&lrm;We must find Robostus now!

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.820
&lrm;Aaah!

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.540
&lrm;I told you it would be trouble!

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.980
&lrm;-How about a Cataclysm right now?
&lrm;-I can't. I can barely breathe!

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.940
&lrm;<i>Now you are at my mercy!</i>

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.900
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Robostus,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.380
&lrm;before you get rid of them,
&lrm;you must take their Miraculous for me.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.700
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;haven't done you any wrong! Let them go!

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.860
&lrm;Being human also means being fair.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.580
&lrm;<i>I'll take over their Miraculous</i>
&lrm;<i>so we'll never be separated again.</i>

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.700
&lrm;<i>-Then I'll make my wish come true.</i>
&lrm;-What wish?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.220
&lrm;<i>I want to be a real human, like you, Max.</i>

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.020
&lrm;What's this about making a wish?

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.340
&lrm;Argh! Doesn't Hawk Moth
&lrm;usually demand the Miraculous?

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.580
&lrm;Uh! What... what's that?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.980
&lrm;What's going on, Ladybug? Milady?

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.220
&lrm;[Cat Noir] No, stop!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.660
&lrm;<i>Look, Max!</i>
&lrm;<i>I will be a real human in 53 seconds!</i>

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.780
&lrm;May I remind you that the Miraculous
&lrm;are for me, Robostus!

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.300
&lrm;<i>And how do you intend</i>
&lrm;<i>to stop me from using them?</i>

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.820
&lrm;Simple.
&lrm;I'll take your power away from you.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.700
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>You really thought you could control me?</i>

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.940
&lrm;[computer]&lrm;<i> Intrusion. Intrusion.</i>
&lrm;<i>Elimination mode activated.</i>

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.700
&lrm;[Robustus]
&lrm;<i>I'm more powerful than you, Hawk Moth!</i>

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.860
&lrm;-What's going on?
&lrm;<i>-My friends will look after you</i>

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.420
&lrm;<i>while I take care of these two!</i>

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.260
&lrm;Now's the time
&lrm;to come up with a bright idea!

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.940
&lrm;I'm sorry, Cat Noir!

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.420
&lrm;<i>Max?</i>

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.540
&lrm;[Max] Sorry, Robostus,
&lrm;but I can't let you execute your program!

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.140
&lrm;I have to stop you!

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.740
&lrm;<i>But why did you do that?</i>
&lrm;<i>I was going to become human, like you!</i>

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.060
&lrm;I don't want you to change!
&lrm;I want you to be like you were before!

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.060
&lrm;<i>Don't you love me any more?</i>
&lrm;<i>Aren't we friends?</i>

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.420
&lrm;If you want us to remain friends,
&lrm;you've got to stop this right now!

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.580
&lrm;I'm friends with Markov, not you.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.380
&lrm;<i>I am Robostus now!</i>

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500
&lrm;<i>And you've betrayed me!</i>
&lrm;<i>I don't want to be human any more.</i>

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.180
&lrm;<i>Humans don't have a heart!</i>

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.060
&lrm;<i>And that's exactly why I've decided</i>
&lrm;<i>to get rid of 'em! Ha, ha, ha!</i>

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.220
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.860
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;<i>-I told you, Ladybug!</i>

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.300
&lrm;<i>I have analysed and calculated everything.</i>
&lrm;<i>You can't win without your lucky charm.</i>

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.540
&lrm;<i>Grab her!</i>

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.980
&lrm;<i>Block her in! She'll be the first to go!</i>

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.140
&lrm;Do your thing, Cat Noir!

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.100
&lrm;It's down to us, Rust-o-bot!

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.260
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.020
&lrm;<i>-So predictable!</i>
&lrm;-Analyse this!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.420
&lrm;Protect Max!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.340
&lrm;Aaah!

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.060
&lrm;<i>You’re making this hard only for yourself,</i>
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.100
&lrm;<i>I will always be one step ahead of you!</i>

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.340
&lrm;Speaking too soon is a human weakness,
&lrm;Robostus! Cat Noir!

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.460
&lrm;<i>Really? Is that your last move?</i>

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.380
&lrm;<i>Whoa! Aaah!</i>

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.260
&lrm;<i>-What was that?</i>
&lrm;-That was wits and a little bit of luck.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.860
&lrm;<i>You are wrong, Ladybug.</i>
&lrm;<i>The game is still on.</i>

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.180
&lrm;<i>What? Where did you get that?</i>

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.340
&lrm;<i>No!</i>

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.820
&lrm;<i>Error... Error... Error...</i>

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.300
&lrm;I may have made a mistake today,
&lrm;but believe me, Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.340
&lrm;it won't happen again!

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.740
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.540
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.380
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.580
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.100
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.500
&lrm;Here's your friend.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.900
&lrm;Perhaps it's best if I don't.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.540
&lrm;Everyone can feel
&lrm;negative emotions sometimes.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.220
&lrm;It's important to accept that and forgive.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.460
&lrm;Follow your heart.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.540
&lrm;<i>Max! My friend! What...</i>

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.540
&lrm;<i>Where are we?</i>

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.900
&lrm;<i>What's going on?</i>

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.020
&lrm;-You were akumatized.
&lrm;<i>-Akumatized?</i>

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.740
&lrm;<i>Could you please define that word?</i>

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.100
&lrm;[laughter]

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.380
&lrm;<i>Did I say something funny?</i>

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.860
&lrm;[Ladybug and Cat Noir] Pound it!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.620
&lrm;[Marinette] Are there things
&lrm;you haven't told me about yet?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.980
&lrm;-What do you want to know?
&lrm;-What would happen if someone possessed

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.860
&lrm;Cat Noir's ring and Ladybug's earrings,
&lrm;Master?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.500
&lrm;Then the bearer could use them conjointly,
&lrm;and with a special invocation,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.620
&lrm;obtain the ultimate power,
&lrm;the one that shapes reality.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.060
&lrm;Ultimate power? Shape reality?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.580
&lrm;Wait. What does that mean?

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.980
&lrm;Well, basically,
&lrm;it can make any one wish come true.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.660
&lrm;Wow! That's amazing!
&lrm;But why don't we use it, then?

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.260
&lrm;We could ask for so many good things,
&lrm;like end all wars or eradicate poverty,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.540
&lrm;or beat Hawk Moth!

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.260
&lrm;Universe must always stay in balance.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.660
&lrm;For every action, there is a reaction.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.380
&lrm;For every wish, a price to pay in return.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.340
&lrm;Had your robotic friend
&lrm;asked to become a real boy,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.020
&lrm;someone would have lost
&lrm;his humanity in return.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.460
&lrm;I hadn't thought of that.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.140
&lrm;That's why Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;must never lose their magic jewels.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.220
&lrm;The universe's balance is at stake.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.380
&lrm;Neither Hawk Moth nor anyone else

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.820
&lrm;will ever get their hands
&lrm;on the Miraculous, Master.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.540
&lrm;I promise.
