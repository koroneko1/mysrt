1
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,187
It was clear that I was the first one to come.

2
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,587
But Linh got him, and now is Phuc.

3
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,370
Why not me?

4
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,977
Come in.

5
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:30,713
From now on, this is your house. 

6
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:31,884
Yes.

7
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,097
Thach!

8
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,309
You're coming over?

9
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,938
Uhm.

10
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,189
This is Nu. She is a year younger than you.

11
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:46,887
Yes, hello Mister.

12
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,109
I just bought this book.

13
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:52,789
Seems so thick! Can you finish it?

14
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,717
As you read it with me, it won't take long.

15
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:09,042
Nu? What's the matter?

16
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,791
No, I'm okay.

17
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,288
Your leg is dislocated, isn't it?

18
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:18,353
Get on!

19
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,551
No way, I can go by myself.

20
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,313
Or you want me to carry you in my arms?

21
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,701
Always wait for compulsion?

22
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,436
Well... No girls would get on with your first ask. 

23
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,628
Besides, I was a bit afraid.

24
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:40,745
Afraid of what?

25
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,888
You're very famous at school.

26
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,684
If any of your fangirls sees this, they'll beat me to death.

27
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,705
But I've got an apple in my eyes.

28
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,703
Huh? You have a crush on someone?

29
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,235
Who is she? Do I know her?

30
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,229
You surely do.

31
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,286
Who?

32
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,777
Never tell you!

33
00:03:58,213 --> 00:03:59,372
If you love Thach,

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,033
should you be glad for his happiness?

35
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:03,164
No.

36
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,925
Thach belongs to me in the very first place!

37
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:08,622
Nu...

38
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:12,988
How can one-month feeling equal years of emotion?

39
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:13,878
Nu..

40
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,473
Calm down and listen to me.

41
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,865
Love is not for competition.

42
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,335
How could you force someone to love you?

43
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:22,101
It's your weakness.

44
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,803
In love, as long as you want, you'll obviously get it.

45
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,293
You only need the desire.

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,564
I want to have a word with you.

47
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:00,001
Has Thach proposed to you?

48
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,913
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:04,720
Not yet, then.

50
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:09,336
Thach and I are nothing to each other.

51
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,970
I saw you kissing him.

52
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:18,000
But so far, we're still nothing.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,203
So just leave!

54
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,603
Quit your job.

55
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,063
Why?

56
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,245
Don't you see that Thach has enough of misery?

57
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:28,172
He's blind, infertile, and now getting in love with a man. 

58
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,569
What's wrong with loving a man?

59
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,873
It's stupid, my boy.

60
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,393
He wasn't like this before.

61
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:36,137
But since the day you came, he's become that stupid.

62
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,938
Do you love him?

63
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,445
Sure.

64
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,118
And I'll never stop chasing him.

65
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:43,242
You love him, but you can say those bad words?

66
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,970
Don't you think Thach will be upset if he hears?

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,537
Let's learn for your own a way to love!

68
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,451
Phuc!

69
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:13,963
Phuc!

70
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,091
This is how you can call me.

71
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,764
You touch here,

72
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,424
then you dial number one.

73
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,433
Is it Thach calling you?

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,272
Yes.

75
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:11,476
Hello?

76
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,861
Hello, where are you now?

77
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,559
Who is that?

78
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,955
It's Thach.

79
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,057
The house's owner?

80
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:27,847
Where are you?

81
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:29,237
Where am I?

82
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:31,362
I have no idea!

83
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,120
You and your belongings must come to my house, now.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,987
You're being nonsense! Coming to your house for what?

85
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:40,508
You have 30 minutes to take all your stuff and clothes here.

86
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:42,047
I have so many clothes.

87
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,558
You're that drunk?

88
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:47,467
Being able to recognize you means I'm not drunk.

89
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:56,380
I don't wanna say anymore. 

90
00:07:57,638 --> 00:07:59,226
Take your things to my house, right now.

91
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,599
Who the hell he thinks he is?

92
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,891
I think you should go there quickly. 

93
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,393
He asked me to take all my belongings there.

94
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:23,214
Being that romantic, he must want to be under the same roof with you.

95
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,486
I think this thing is a bit uncertain.

96
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,874
He still has his job, family,

97
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,038
and you two's father was a politician.

98
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,999
He is dead but his reputation is not.

99
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:45,999
I don't know where this can go to.

100
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:54,344
Alright. Let me take you home.

101
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:56,946
Thank you.

102
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,521
Ah. Maybe I should go there anyway.

103
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:02,261
He gave me only 30 minutes. He'll scold at me.

104
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:02,868
OK.

105
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,511
Go now?

106
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:12,537
Heyy! Our motorbike is over here.

107
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:13,116
 That's so?

108
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:13,616
Go!

109
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,697
You told me here, then where will I sleep?

110
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,614
Who came with you?

111
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:35,547
No one.

112
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,132
I heard someone else's steps.

113
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:40,810
Mine.

114
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:43,845
Come here.

115
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:44,415
Uh?

116
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:45,785
Just come here.

117
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,472
I also want to drink beer.

118
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,522
Order on Shopee, then.

119
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:01,590
I feel sleepy.

120
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,925
You should go back in and sleep.

121
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:06,686
Then just come in.

122
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,943
Fire! Fire! The house is on fire! Run, people!

123
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,793
Gosh, Thach! The house is on fire!

124
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:13,794
Leave here now!

125
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,021
Wait a minute! I can't smell anything!

126
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,091
How can you? People are rushing out there.

127
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,159
Run now! Hurry, please!

128
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,476
A minute!

129
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:21,672
I can't find Phuc.

130
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:24,184
He may be in the bedroom, let me call him. 

131
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,530
Phuc is out. He has left before.

132
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,838
Come on! Quick, man! Quick!

133
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:29,857
Be careful!

134
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,063
Come on, man!

135
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,803
The house is burning down!

136
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,969
The house is on fire!

137
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:39,418
Be quick please!

138
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,776
 Over! Thank you for participating this fire-drill of the village.

139
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:48,342
It's a fire-drill. Now let's back to our homes!

140
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,969
Thank you all.

141
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,948
Brother, what happened that everyone gets bewildered?

142
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,274
Our area was taking a fire-drill.

143
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:57,898
Wait!

144
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,437
Where is Phuc?

145
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:00,348
Come on...

146
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,469
Nu?

147
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:02,349
Yah?

148
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,328
 Do you see Phuc around here?

149
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,009
Phuc is not here.

150
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,317
When I left, did you see me turning off the gas cooker?

151
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,386
This one... I have no idea.

152
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:14,879
Take me inside!

153
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,781
But...

154
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:16,669
I say take me back in the house!

155
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,534
Let me take you in.

156
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:21,381
Thach!

157
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,023
Phuc! Where are you?

158
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:27,754
Phuc!

159
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,118
Phuc! Where are you?

160
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,489
Hi, you call me...

161
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:33,847
Why is it so smoky?

162
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,498
Just leave here. It's so smoky over here.

163
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,236
The room is filled with smoke. We should leave.

164
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:57,810
Why did you tell me Phuc had left?

165
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,857
I didn't know it clearly,

166
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:01,429
I just thought that he might be out.

167
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,409
How could you tell me without checking carefully?

168
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,799
What if bad thing happened to him?

169
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,963
Who is he that I need to care for?

170
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,266
I only thought of you at that moment.

171
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:15,507
You're so strange.

172
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:17,727
You're being selfish.

173
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:22,091
I have the rights to save who I want.

174
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,396
Why is it considered selfish?

175
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,386
Only not saving him can make me a selfish one?

176
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,018
Let's go out.

177
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:30,867
Leave me alone!

178
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:32,782
It's time to make everything clear.

179
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:33,767
Come on!

180
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,572
 Let go of me!

181
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,879
Can you just stop it?

182
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:52,399
Are you okay?

183
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,950
There was a fake alarm.

184
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,189
People were flocking out.

185
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,136
That explains why you forgot our dish.

186
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,076
I'm good. It's real.

187
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,558
It hurts.

188
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,513
Tell me.

189
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:23,720
Tell what?

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,025
You didn't call Phuc out on purpose, did you?

191
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,435
You don't need to ask what you've already known.

192
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,719
You're the most stubborn person I've ever seen.

193
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:33,963
So?

194
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:37,595
You said that you had no feelings with him.

195
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:41,013
If you like him now, take him away from Thach for me, please.

196
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,101
Are you insane?

197
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,852
How many times do I have to tell you? I'm straight.

198
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:46,421
The line between straight and gay is dim.

199
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,100
You piss me off!

200
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:52,794
If you're straight, you must know how Thach feels more.

201
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:55,246
 He was in very good condition, but then fell for a guy.

202
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,340
Don't you see it so nonsense?

203
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,045
How could you say that?

204
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,809
Don't take your gender as an excuse to say what you want!

205
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:04,632
There are only 2 kinds of people: good or evil.

206
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,175
Boy or girls is considered the same. We're equal!

207
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:09,066
I don't know and I don't even give a f*ck!

208
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,601
The only one occupying my mind is Thach.

209
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:15,065
Don't waste time giving me advice. It's useless.

210
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,134
I'm nothing to her.

211
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:43,601
Hello?

212
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,563
I'm listening.

213
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:45,554
Have you left the school?

214
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,547
If not, please buy me two ham sandwiches at the school gate.

215
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,586
Oh! I'm not. Let me buy for you.

216
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,770
But you can eat two of them by your own?

217
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,273
No way! See you later?

218
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:56,917
Sure.

219
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,134
Duy?

220
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:19,743
My god!

221
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:22,237
I forgot and asked Thach to buy for me.

222
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,554
You also bought the same?

223
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:29,523
Earlier, I asked him to buy for you and me.

224
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:36,142
Nu called me and luckily I was around there. So I rode there to buy.

225
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,093
You stay here and eat with us.

226
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,253
It's okay, you two can enjoy. 

227
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,761
I'm sorry!

228
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,667
Don't bother me.

229
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,561
Come on.

230
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,524
It will never happen again.

231
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:14,712
You should move to leave with your mom.

232
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,985
She has moved to the South for years. It's quite near my parents' house. 

233
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,246
I and mom can take care of you when you're there.

234
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:26,718
I really can't know how to live if that case really happens to you. 

235
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:29,327
You're still in contact with my mom?

236
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:33,825
Because... I adore her.

237
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:35,280
Then you mean...

238
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,113
That thing can happen to Phuc?

239
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:40,014
No. It’s not what I mean.

240
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:44,811
I mean if you move home, we can take care of you and make sure nothing will happen.

241
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,262
And... Phuc will be safe.

242
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,317
Actually, this is also because of me.
