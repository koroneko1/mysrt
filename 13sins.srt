when Dad would always...

134

going to have a man

Elliot Brindle, age 32.

174
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,148
Your mother was killed in a car
accident when you were nine.

175

Ever since, you've felt
responsible for your brother,

whose outpatient care
cost you $1,200 a month.

177

- no wonder you have trouble sleeping.

You always mean well, but follow-through
has often been a problem.
