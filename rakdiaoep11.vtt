00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Rak!!! I've told you for so many times to cl ose the bin lid. See? Dogs were messing with trash.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Good morning, Diao.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Not good morning.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What's going on?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was just following house rule to greet the house owner

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or should I be sweeter?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Good morning, darling Diao.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Keep on making fun of me so I can get back at you all at once.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Did you see this?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Are you hungry? Why didn't you tell me? You didn't have to go through the trash.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yeah, keep on making jokes. I'm gonna issue one more rule about garbage bin.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
From now on, if you forgot to close the lid, you'd be fined 100 baht each.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Well, if you're the one who forget to close it, then you need to be fined too.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's right!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Then I reduce the fee, to 10 baht each for the first time.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
One more rule, if the dogs get into the trash bin. You need to hold the bin by your mouth and run around.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Fine. But if the dogs start digging your trash,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
then you need to do it too. Are you sure that it's worth it?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now I have a second thought.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Discard this one. But I'm gonna issue one more rule.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If you forgot to close the lid, and dogs made the mess…

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And what….
If you forgot to close the lid and dogs made the mess, you need to...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Keep on going.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you forgot to close the lid and dogs made the mess, you need to...

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Hey, pick up the phone already, so I can finish it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm sorry. I turned it off now. Keep on going.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
If you forgot to close the lid and dogs made the mess, you need to hold the bin by your mouth and run around.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You can make this rule, please.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Because I'm the one forgetting to close it / What?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I was out here, discarding the trash, then my friend called to chat about Korean singers

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I was busy chatting so I forgot to close it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And then I went inside the house.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500
I'm so sorry.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
That's alright.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
What're you gonna do? You still want to set up new rule to run around with trash bin in mouth?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Of course I do.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.000
Please, don't do it. I can't run around and hold a trash bin in my mouth.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Don't you worry. I already come up with solution.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The rules will only apply to tenant. Pleng and I will be excluded.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You don't have to clean it up, I'll do it. You can get inside and start your lesson.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Thank you / You're welcome.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Hey, you blamed it on me earlier and you won't even gonna help me?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Or you'd feel more comfortable using your mouth instead of your hands.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I'm cool with that. Come on.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Why don't you go ahead and do it!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.500
Why're you smiling?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We share the same mind.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
That's nonsense.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You said it was nonsense. See? We do share the same mind.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Am I your playmate?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Can I go now, Mr. House Owner?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Go ahead. I'm not chaining you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Is this lamp broken?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Who's calling him? Why didn't he pick up the phone?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Suttirak received many calls yesterday and he didn't even pick them up.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Could it be from Daisy?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
He didn't pick up the phone because he can't communicate with wild animal.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
That's nonsense / I'm sorry.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Good. So I don't waste my time on ranting / You just did earlier.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Who called him? Why didn't he pick up the phone in front of me?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Hello.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Hello.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Are you gonna hold a meeting here ?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
In a meeting room.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Are you waiting for me to carry you to the room?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Here's my idea of wording for promotional campaign.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
"The first 500 people downloading the app will gain 20% off from every vendor."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I think it's too long and the words are not catchy enough.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Please revise it to be more fun.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Move on to colors…

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I like the color from background. We know it right away that it's our application.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But the color from 20% wording…

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Keep on going.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
But the color from 20% wording…

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But the color from 20% wording…

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I think it needs to be contrast with orange and in brighter shade.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This one is too dark.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Okay.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Narong is calling for you and he seems upset.

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:29.000
It's about the fact that Bank couldn't close the deal with famous vendors to partner with URFOOD.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Got it. I'm gonna explain all of this to Narong.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.700
Okay.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Everything's good?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Excuse me.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Diao, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.000
This is a good opportunity for us to look into his phone and see who called him.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Nope. I don't want to know about this.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Fine. Just go.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
You don't ? Why didn't you tell him that he forgot his phone?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'm not his secretary. If you want to know who called him, then pick up his phone.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You still don't pick it up?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Are you sure that you really don't want to look through his phone? You're in such a rush.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Kanom wants to know about this.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I'm gonna look it first.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
He sets password for his lockscreen.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Let's bring it to our room, in case he's coming back.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You planned it already?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I didn't.
99
00:12:01,000 --&gt; 00:11:03,000
Please don't let Suttirak know about this.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
What's his password?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Let's try his employee's code.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Wow. You didn't want to know about this but you seem to try the hardest.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Well, if you failed your attempt three times, the phone'd be automatically locked.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Then he'd know that we tried to look into in phone.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We? So you're curious too?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm not curious, I just shared my idea.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Diao? Kamomthai?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Yes,sir.
Do you see my phone?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I didn't.
Are you sure? I think I left it in the meeting room.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I'm sure. When we walked out, we didn't see anything.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Right / That's right. We didn't see anything.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Well, if anyone sees it, please bring it back to me.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.500
Got it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Enter his employee's code. Hurry up, so we can see who called him.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Okay, not curious at all.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Nope. That's not it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
His birthday?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
When is it?

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.000
How could I know that? I'm not his parents.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And you think I know? You live in the same house as him

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.000
so I think you could know about this too.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I'm gonna call Rit and ask when his birthday is.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Right. And you said you're not curious at all.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
If your curiosity could compare to a wound, you'd be in coma stage already.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Who called him anyway? Why didn't he pick it up?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Wait, don't bring it back to him just yet.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Give me one more hour. I can figure out his passcode for sure.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
One hour is not enough, we tried his employee's code and his birthday already.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.000
One more chance and you lost all the chances.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
He'd know right away that someone tried to hack his phone. Give it back to him already.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Maybe he wants to use it.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.000
It looks like you care about him. But why did you keep picking on him? You're joking about this?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'm serious about me picking on him. In case he wants to use his phone for work, you should give it back to him now.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Fine. I'll give it back to him.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You can't leave it like that

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
because he searched for it in the meeting room already.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
We need to pretend that the phone fell under the desk.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You think we nailed it?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I think / Nope. It didn't

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I think the phone needs to be on the desk.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Nope. That's not it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
How about this?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Under the desk. Pretend like the phone is dropped under the desk. This one could work.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Is this your phone? I saw it dropped under the desk.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It dropped? You said that it dropped and you asked if it looked real?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
You need to check your ears. I said that it was dropped here and the screen is working for real?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I don't think so.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
The screen ? / Your face.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I don't know what're you all up to but I need my phone to work.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Did you turn it on?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I didn't. Maybe my hands accidentally touch it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Toon? Who is Toon?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I don't want to know about him.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
If Kanom asked me, I needed to prepare the answer for her.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Who is Toon?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Is he naked? Can I see?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
What? No? I'm gonna check if the mirror is cracked.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.000
It looked a little bit broken from the kitchen.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
You're not good at lying. How could it be cracked?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Your face almost touched the mirror.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Are you gonna pick on him again?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
No, I'm not. Kanom was curious about him. Someone called him so many times

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and he didn't pick up his phone.

00:18:20.001 --> 00:18:21.000
Yeah? Who was calling then?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I don't know. They asked me to investigate on this.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
If you know about this, you need to let me know.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You need a spare key? You couldn't hear much from here.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.000
If you spy on him in his bathroom or in his bedroom,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.000
then you could hear anything.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
That's just too much.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Fine. I'm gonna shopping now. You need anything? What do you want for dinner?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
But you could be fulfilled from spying on someone.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Hey!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
He's gone to the bathroom for a really long time. Why hasn't he come out just yet?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Is he talking to Toon inside?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Damn it! How long has he been standing here?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
What should I do?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm gonna pretend to be faint so I don't have to answer questions.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.500
Hey!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.500
You!

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.000
You!

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.500
You!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Damn it! Why did he bring me here?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
It smells so bad, what is it?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Stop it. It smells so bad. I'm gonna faint again because of it.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Hold my breath.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.500
Hey!

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Do you have dirty clothes? What?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Not washing anything.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Are you insane? Diao's faint.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I tried to check earlier and he's not breathing anymore.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So I check his heartbeat.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Please go to tell Dao that he's faint.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.000
Okay.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Stop it already. I'm about to throw up.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
What happened? Why did you look like that?

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.000
Diao…

00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:06.000
Don't tell me that you see a ghost!

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You're writing too much fanfictions. / What?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
I'm here to get Dao, Diao is faint.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.000
I called her but she didn't pick up the phone.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Dao's at Uncle Jod's café.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Can you help Rak to take care of Diao? They're in the bedroom. I'm leaving.

00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:24.501
Okay.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
How's Diao?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
He's just faint. He should be better soon.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I'm not gonna be better because of this.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Have you seen Rit?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
He's searching for Dao at Uncle Jod's café.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
I see.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
I used to learn about healing people who are faint.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
It said that the patient needs to lie down and keep his head low, untighten his clothes and belt.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
So blood could flow to brain easily.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.000
Then using cold cloth to wash his legs and arms so he could be conscious faster.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Please get cold water from the fridge and put it in a large bowl for me.

00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.501
Okay.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Thank you.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Don't take off my pants.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Toon's calling again.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Are you pretending it? We'll see about that.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Will he see me?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I don't think so.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
He's staying still like this so he thinks I won't be able to see him?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Here's water.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Here / Thank you.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
You can't put it like that. You need to wash him gently.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Sorry, I forgot.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Is he gonna smack my face or helping me? Haven't he healed faint people?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Don't worry about him. I can take it from now.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Fine.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Thank you.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
You're not waking up, are you? Fine.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Pleng said that I need to wash his legs too.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I should just wash his face, not his body. It's not like he's faint for real.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
You don't want to wake up? Fine.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Why did you take off my pants?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
You're faint and I need to wash your legs too.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
No need for that. I'm healed now.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Healed? Or you didn't faint from the start?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I'm truly healed.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
You're not gonna pick it up?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
That's none of your business.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I saw her trying to call you for so many times and you didn't pick it up.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Who's Toon?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
That's none of your business.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I see. You're pretending to faint because you want to know about this.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Nope.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Nope? Then why're you still here, sitting on my bed? You're not going home?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Or you want me to wash your legs?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Why didn't he pick up the phone so I'd know who Toon is?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Please wait for me.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Slow down.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:13.000
Why didn't you watch where you're going? They're fixing the drain and you fell right into it.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
If I fell in love with you, it wouldn't be this much hurt.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
You should fall on your way back so I'll cover you with cement.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
What's going on? Come back here.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Rit said that you're faint?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I'm up now.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
You're up? I was searching for inhaler for you. It's a good one. One sniff and you're up.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I'm not waking up because of good inhaler.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
If someone is faint and they are waking up, it's gonna be because of its bad smell.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
This is what Suttirak gave me earlier. It smells so bad.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
But I think it smells good. Maybe it's for elderly.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
So you're not really faint? You're just pretending

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.000
so you can spy on Rak's caller?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
That's right.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So do you know who called him?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Not yet. But I know that the name is Toon.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
What? Toon called him?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
You know Toon? Who's Toon?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
A girl or boy?

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.000
It's a girl.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Toon is..

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.000
Rit!

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Stop it right now.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Rak, honey. Who's Toon?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Fine if you don't want to tell me.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.000
I was just asking for Diao. He wanted to know about this.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Excuse me. I'm gonna tutor Pleng.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Let me know if you know anything.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Let's go.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.500
Okay.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
You know what to say and what NOT to say, right?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Yes, sir. Can I study with Dao?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Excuse me, I'm gonna go back to my café with the inhaler.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.000
Okay.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.000
My other inhaler must be missing this one already.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
They're together all the time. This is the longest time they're apart.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I'm leaving / See you later.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Why do you want to know about me and Toon?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
I didn't. Kanom and Dao want to know about this.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Please let them know that I don't like people to know about my personal stuff.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Suttirak asked me why I needed to know about him and Toon.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
I think they used to have intimacy relationship for sure.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
That's right. Because Rit tried to tell us something,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.000
when Rak came, he stopped telling us already.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
I think Toon must be his ex that he told me about.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.000
Huh ? / You think?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
That's right. Toon is my ex.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
This red drink is quite tasty.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.700
Very red.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Anything else?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Wait! I need to see if I have enough money.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Diao.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.500
Yeah?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
You don't get our conversation earlier, do you?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Pae / Yeah?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
One brownie and hot Americano, please.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Sure.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Why don't you go ask him? Why he didn't pick up his ex's phone call?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Don't forget to ask him if they have a nasty breakup.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And if it was a nasty breakup, then why did she keep calling him?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I was just being told off earlier. Didn't you hear that? If I asked him again, he would have cursed my dad for sure.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.000
That's even better. Your dad is in Chiang Mai. He won't hear about any of this.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.000
That's right. His curse can't fly on the plane. Wait. We share the same dad.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Don't be mad at them. They want to know about this because they care about you.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
That's right. Can't you see? They care about you.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
That's right.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Why didn't you pick up the call from Toon?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Wait, I know that you care about him.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
But if he didn't want to talk about it, you don't have to push it.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I don't want to know about it. But I'm afraid that he could pick a fight with someone else

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.000
and sabotage my work.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
I told you that I can separate work and personal stuffs.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
I need to apologize for my brother.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
He likes to stick his nose into someone else's business.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Don’t forget to tell me if you know anything.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Come this way please.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
If Rak tells you anything, please let me know too.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.000
Thank you.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I've told you for so many times to stop messing with other people's business. It's bad habit.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
If there's something on your mind, you can tell me.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Toon broke up with me and dating someone else.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
I don't want to talk to her because of her new boyfriend.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
That's why you didn't pick up her call.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Let me tell you something.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
When I was young, I broke up with my ex, a nasty one.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And later she tried to call me.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
But I was dating Noi at that time.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Did she understand you?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
She got it. She said that people who broke up could stay friends.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
What if I broke up with 10 girls, does it mean that I have 10 enemies too?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Wouldn't it be better if we broke up with 10 people and gain 10 more friends.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
You're right.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Don't overthinking about it and stressing out.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Maybe Toon's boyfriend understands you like Noi did.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
She was a good person. That's the reason why you didn't find someone else

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
even though she's gone for two years already.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.000
I tried to ask Noi about it.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
And she said that I could try to replace her but she would come back to bring me back with her.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Hello, Toon. Sorry I missed your call.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
What's up?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
You want to have dinner together? Sure. When is it?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I gotta go now.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Is the lamp crooked again?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:15.000
That's right. Hey, don't tell me off yet.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I opened the door and I heard about it. I didn't eavesdrop or anything.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I didn't say anything. Why do you have to be defensive?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
How could I not? You're such a smart mouth like this.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Why ? You're one too.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Why did you decide to call her back?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
You said you didn't want to know about it.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I was just being polite. It's like greeting cats and dogs.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
How was the bone? You like it? Something like that.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Thank you.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
What for?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Thank you for caring about me, Mr. House Owner.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Who cares about you? Don't be so over yourself.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
So you're not gonna tell me? Why did you call Toon back?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Fine! I don't want to know about it anymore.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Are you looking for me?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
What're you talking about? I'm just checking on doorknob.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Not broken. It can be open from both sides.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Love Note. Chapter 8. When I was sick.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Ryu was sick for so many days but fever got nothing on him

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
because he has the best medicine with him.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
It is Ryo's love and care. He takes the best care of Ryu.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
What're you doing?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
I'm gonna cool you off.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
That's alright. I can take a shower by myself.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
You still couldn't get up. How could you take a shower?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
It's okay. Let me cool you off.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
You can just wash my arms.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I need to wash your chest too. So your fever will be gone.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Besides, I need to know if I'm still in your heart.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Excuse me.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.000
Suttirak? Come on in.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.000
You want to know about Diao? What is it?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I don't think he's gonna pass probation period.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.000
Narong made Suttirak to sign that Diao won't make it.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Poor Diao.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Did you see him?

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Diao was drunk and he hasn't made it home yet.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Don't worry. I'm not gonna sign on that.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
You think you're so smart, aren't you?
