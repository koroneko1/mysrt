00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,342
<i>You know,
when I was your age,</i>

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:07,761
I couldn't wait to stay here
every summer.

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:09,554
At least one of us
had a happy childhood.

5
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:12,929
Give it a chance. Sulphur
Springs may surprise you.

6
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,593
I would like to welcome
a new student.

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,869
Hi, my name is Griffin Campbell.

8
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,921
<i>And my family just moved here
from Chicago.</i>

9
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,883
Still don't know
your name though.

10
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,344
- Harper.
- Now I'm stuck here

11
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,738
while my parents fix up
The Tremont.

12
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,906
You live at The Tremont?!

13
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,826
- Who's Savannah?
- The ghost of a kid

14
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,046
who's supposedly
been haunting the hotel.

15
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:36,341
<i>She disappeared
from The Tremont 30 years ago.</i>

16
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:37,468
<i>Never to be seen again.</i>

17
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:38,523
<i>I just don't get it.</i>

18
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,430
<i>How does a kid vanish
without a trace?</i>

19
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:41,710
<i>I said drop it.</i>

20
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,532
<i>Whatever happened to
that girl happened years ago.</i>

21
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:45,531
 <i>I saw something
down here earlier.</i>

22
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,664
<i>The Tremont has a bunker?</i>

23
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,012
<i>It's Savannah!</i>

24
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,570
She's real.

25
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:53,512
If we hadn't moved here...

26
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:55,265
I never would've found this.

27
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,226
That's Dad?

28
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,531
Griffin?

29
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,031
Look.

30
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,257
Dad?

31
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:12,633
We can't leave now.
Savannah is in there.

32
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,296
Not her ghost. Her.

33
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:15,579
She's alive, Griffin.

34
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,164
This doesn't make any sense.

35
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,421
None of this does. We need
to get back to the bunker.

36
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:22,093
Remember that jolt I felt
coming out of the hatch?

37
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,523
It was like...
everything shifted.

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,230
What if it did because we went
through a portal or something?

39
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:28,815
A portal?

40
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,946
- You know how crazy that sounds?
- Think about it.

41
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,554
The hotel is open
for business.

42
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:33,680
Savannah hasn't gone missing.

43
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:35,360
Your dad is our age.

44
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,211
Time travel
is the only explanation.

45
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,923
Yeah, yeah, or this could
all be some crazy dream.

46
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:42,126
Yeah, that's it.
I just need to wake up.

47
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,086
- Ow!
- This is happening, Griffin.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,578
We're here,

49
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,155
in the past.

50
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:48,891
And I can prove it.

This is a waste of time.

I'm telling you,
I heard something.

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,683
Then you should check it out.

58
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,560
Uh, I'll wait here.

59
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,235
What if Savannah comes looking

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,446
for a body to snatch?

61
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,180
You'd be all alone.

62
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,938
She'd take you first.
Red hair.

63
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,932
You expect me to believe
ghosts only like red?

64
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:41,331
Savannah obviously does.

65
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,792
She had on a red shirt
in the picture we saw.

66
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,828
It could be her favorite color.

67
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,718
You're gonna have to do better
than that if you wanna scare me.

68
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,031
Boo.

69
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,437
Not cool.

70
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,101
Still think
there's nothing up here?

71
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,297
Just a second.
Ben?

72
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:55,640
Is that the pizza guy?

73
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,060
Yeah.
Can you tell the kids?

74
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,164
Uh, I'm looking
for my daughter.

75
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,695
She's not supposed
to be over here.

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,359
I‐‐ I tried calling her,
but her phone is off,

77
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,819
and it's never off, so...

78
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,518
Sorry.

79
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:16,219
No, sounds familiar.

80
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:18,344
I'm Sarah.
You must be Harper's mom.

81
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,597
Please come in.

82
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm with her.

83
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,929
Is‐‐ Is Harper all right?

84
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,609
Oh, she's fine. My son is
just showing her around.

85
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:32,494
Not that there is much
worth seeing at the moment.

86
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,414
We obviously have
a lot more to do

87
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,047
before the hotel
is ready for guests.

88
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,312
You plan on reopening
The Tremont?

89
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,937
- Mm‐hmm.
- Bad idea.

90
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,289
Put the lock back on the door
and lose the key.

91
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,926
Mom!

92
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,304
Whatever it is,
you two need to work it out,

93
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,598
at a much lower volume.

94
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:48,934
We have to get out of here.

95
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,420
Savannah's upstairs.

96
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,195
- You saw her?
- We heard her.

97
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,672
It is probably just your
brother playing another prank.

98
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:55,672
Griffin!

99
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,915
He's not up there.
Neither is Harper.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,687
It's like they both disappeared.

101
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:11,508
Okay, let's say
we did somehow find a portal

102
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,851
and that kid over there
really is my dad.

103
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,993
We can't just walk over and
tell him we're from the future.

104
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,914
Of course not.
We keep it simple.

105
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,801
Ask the year, the president.

106
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,971
Anything that'll prove
we traveled back in time.

107
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,818
Snake!
Someone get it!

108
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,594
No need to panic, ma'am.

109
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:32,405
It's just a toy.

110
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,437
This is outrageous!

111
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,125
You two,
don't move.

112
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,875
What are you waiting for?
Run!

113
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,351
- Stop!
- Over here.

114
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,663
Hey, Dad.

115
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:07,108
Let me guess.
Your handiwork?

116
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,577
What took you so long?

117
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,530
I doubled back,
like, three times

118
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,199
to make sure
we weren't followed.

119
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:24,030
We can't risk anyone
finding this place.

120
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,162
So what I'm hearing is
I was right.

121
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:29,905
You do think
we traveled back in time.

122
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,045
I thought
you were losing it.

123
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,667
Or maybe I was.
I...

124
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,828
I mean, what are the odds
we actually found a portal?

125
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,772
Go ahead.
Say it.

126
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,209
It's not hard.

127
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,823
Fine.

128
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,967
You were right.

129
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,876
I mean, this is
all just so crazy.

130
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:47,358
My dad pulling a prank.

131
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:48,647
No service.

132
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,193
He hates pranks.
Doesn't think they're funny.

133
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,804
I mean, at least
he doesn't now.

134
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,428
No service means
no cell towers.

135
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,092
Wait.
You don't think...

136
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,612
we're stuck in the past?

137
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:14,397
Anything?

138
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,631
The bunker must have been
blocking the signal.

139
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,608
So we made it back?

140
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:20,100
Everything's okay.

141
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,560
Not exactly.

142
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,577
I have to get home.
Now.

143
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:26,429
What are you doing down here?

144
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,264
I've been looking
all over for you.

145
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,881
Um, I was giving Harper
a tour.

146
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,079
In the basement?

147
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,584
Yeah. I, uh...

148
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:35,143
I painted this picture
in my head

149
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,896
of what the hotel was like
on the inside.

150
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,725
Just... wanted to see
how it matched up.

151
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,559
You should go upstairs before
the twins eat all the pizza.

152
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:55,963
You all right?

153
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,989
Um... Yeah, I'm fine.

154
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:20,903
Savannah was floating
down the hall,

155
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,340
nowhere near the window.

156
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:23,590
I blinked.

157
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:26,012
She was right up against the
glass, screaming in my face.

158
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,442
How'd you get away?

159
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,356
I booked it
off the porch.

160
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,168
But if Savannah
is really that fast...

161
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,296
It was a warning.

162
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,208
The Tremont's hers.

163
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,911
I'm surprised
she let you stay this long.

164
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,567
Mom, what are you doing here?

165
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,887
You weren't answering
your phone.

166
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,168
Uh, the signal isn't great
in the basement.

167
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,859
You were in the basement?

168
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,551
I... I know it looks like the
place might fall down around us,

169
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,918
but most of the work that
needs to be done is cosmetic.

170
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,573
Isn't that right, honey?

171
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,036
Some spackle and paint
will make a huge difference.

172
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,684
- Hi. Ben Campbell.
- I know who you are.

173
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,951
Let's go.

174
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,644
- Good luck surviving the night.
- Topher.

175
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,122
I sent a text.
Why are you so mad?

176
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,707
In the car.

177
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,207
Now.

178
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:20,221
You know, most
parents would be glad

179
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,348
to have a responsible kid
who checks in.

180
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,350
You call running around
a haunted hotel responsible?

181
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:26,504
You're lucky to be alive.

182
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,884
See, this is why you're not
allowed to watch horror movies.

183
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,573
You think
all that stuff is real.

184
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,496
Your hand was shaking too.

185
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:33,692
I felt it.

186
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:34,957
You were scared?

187
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,059
The only thing
that scares me

188
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,348
is something happening
to one of you.

189
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:38,802
You heard what
Griffin's parents said,

190
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,283
The Tremont is
completely safe.

191
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,985
The Tremont is cursed!

192
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,964
Look, bad things
happen here, baby.

193
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,472
People get hurt.
Innocent people.

194
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,066
And once they're gone,
they're gone.

195
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,913
You can't change that
no matter how hard you try.

196
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,175
I won't take that chance.

197
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,175
I won't lose you too.

198
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,854
Why are you on the floor?

199
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:34,324
I heard a weird noise
last night.

200
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,397
I heard it too.

201
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,583
It's an old hotel.

202
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:41,394
Probably
just the building settling.

203
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:44,083
What if we really did disturb
a spirit or something

204
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,364
when we moved in?

205
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:46,583
We've been over this.

206
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:48,214
The hotel isn't haunted.

207
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,339
Then how do you explain
the whooshing noise?

208
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:53,035
Water going through old pipes
would make that sound.

209
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,516
Nothing a plumber can't fix.

210
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,110
Maybe you should light
some sage instead?

211
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,707
Clear away
all the bad energy.

212
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,448
Okay, we are not doing this
right now.

213
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,148
Go and get dressed for school.

214
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,383
You too.

215
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,433
Still excited about
Griffin's new friend?

216
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,777
She has the kids so scared,
they can't sleep.

217
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,285
And what's your excuse?

218
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,698
Don't tell me
that you're letting

219
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,145
all this Savannah stuff
get to you too.

220
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:20,634
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,964
You were tossing and turning
all night.

222
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:24,971
Bad dream?

223
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:27,644
Uh... I never remember
my dreams.

224
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,691
Harper. Hey.

225
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,305
You have to see this.

226
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,394
Listen, after we left
the hotel last night,

227
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,269
- my mom completely freaked out.
- We have proof,

228
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:17,574
actual proof!

229
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:19,425
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,144
I grabbed this off a bag
when we were being chased.

231
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,020
Buried it in the woods yesterday
on the way back to the bunker.

232
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,504
That's my dad's name.
It really was him.

233
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,191
We already knew
that kid was your dad.

234
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:32,695
You were convinced
about the whole portal thing.

235
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,918
I needed evidence.
So, I did a test.

236
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,451
The tag was still there
this morning.

237
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:38,832
Do you know
what this means?

238
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,059
That time travel is real, and
we're the ones who proved it.

239
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,800
We can see what
happened to Savannah.

240
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,544
Maybe even save her.

241
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,871
Meet me at the hotel
after school.

242
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,902
We'll try going
through the portal again.

243
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:52,812
‐ About that... ‐ If it works,
I'm talking to my dad this time.

244
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,183
He was so different
as a kid.

245
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,478
You think all people
change that much?

246
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,339
Griffin, I can't go back.

247
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,238
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

248
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,347
My mom doesn't want me
hanging around The Tremont.

249
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:04,670
For how long?

250
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,847
This isn't something
that'll just blow over.

251
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,925
I've never seen her
so upset.

252
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,594
She said
we can't be friends.

253
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,613
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

254
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:14,238
Why?
What did I do?

255
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:16,785
Look, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

256
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,569
Harper, technically,
texting isn't talking.

257
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:30,152
Can anyone tell me what
Mr. Churchill may have meant by this?

258
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:40,021
He was saying that
we can all learn from the past.

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,755
Let me give you all
an example.

260
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,472
Learn from Griffin's mistake.

261
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,105
Otherwise,
history will repeat itself,

262
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,152
and I will have a drawer
full of fancy phones.

263
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:13,438
Be with you in a minute.

264
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:14,863
I'm in no hurry.

265
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,402
Thanks, Jess.
I'll see you tomorrow.

266
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:22,683
Thought it might be you.

267
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:25,582
Been a long time, Jess.
How are you?

268
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,144
What do you want?

269
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,533
Ah,
large dark roast.

270
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,333
Muffins look good too.

271
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:33,801
Bake 'em yourself?

272
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,621
Why come back here, Ben?

273
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,793
No one wants
to see The Tremont reopened.

274
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,044
You have to know
that.

275
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,911
Ever think about how
simple things were as a kid,

276
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,394
then you grow up?

277
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:47,472
Maybe I got tired of living
out someone else's dreams.

278
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,824
Always doing
what was expected.

279
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:00,426
Place is nice, Jess.

280
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,009
I'm glad things
worked out for you.

281
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,974
We all moved on.

282
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,450
Ask yourself why you haven't.

283
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:26,751
I applied for a few jobs today.

284
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,267
Thought our focus
was fixing up the hotel.

285
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:32,619
Well, there's a lot more to do around
here than spackle and paint, Ben.

286
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,290
We need professional help.
Contractors cost money.

287
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,861
Nah, we can do this
on our own.

288
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,673
Just have to take it
one project at a time.

289
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:40,064
Already got
a good start in here.

290
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,361
Changed out the chandelier,
rehung it this afternoon.

291
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,509
Sure that's hooked in?

292
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,228
It's not that difficult,
Zoey.

293
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,291
Hmm, that's what you said
about the Christmas lights.

294
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,329
And we all know
how that ended.

295
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,758
The fire department
had to come.

296
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:55,472
That part was pretty cool.

297
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:56,933
They didn't have to come.

298
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:59,687
I would've gotten down
without their help, eventually.

299
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,516
You're quiet tonight.

300
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:08,071
Um, yeah, I just have
a ton of homework to do.

301
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:09,812
May I be excused?

302
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,357
If you'd been
paying attention in class,

303
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,134
maybe you wouldn't have
so much to do tonight.

304
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:14,677
Uh, Ms. Douglas
called you?

305
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,117
What happened?

306
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:19,126
Griffin's teacher
caught him texting.

307
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,001
I had to go to the school
and pick this up.

308
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,969
- It's from Harper.
- Give it!

309
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,285
Can I have it back?

310
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,126
Not tonight.
Finish your dinner.

311
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,071
- Griffin's got a girlfriend.
- Shut it, Wyatt.

312
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,898
Eat, both of you.

313
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,635
And take the hat off
at the table.

314
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,046
He can't.

315
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,119
Savannah will steal his soul.

316
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:46,989
Okay, guys, come on.

317
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:48,972
One night without
Savannah.

318
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,579
Is that too much to ask?

319
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,563
Need some help?

320
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,165
Thought you had homework.

321
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,250
Manual labor would be
less painful than algebra.

322
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:19,910
Yeah, math was
never my thing either.

323
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,326
But school's important.

324
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,176
You can't be goofin' around
in class.

325
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,054
You never goofed around
as a kid?

326
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:28,015
Broke the rules
just for fun?

327
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,593
I'm not saying don't have fun.

328
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:35,164
Just... save the texting
for after school. Okay?

329
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,687
Hand me that screwdriver,
the black one.

330
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,960
Mom was showing me
an old photo she found.

331
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,246
You really won a talent show
at summer camp?

332
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,093
I was about your age.

333
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,139
Played the guitar.

334
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,994
Did you enter the year after?
Defend your title?

335
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:57,625
The hotel was closed
by then.

336
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,700
Harper said
Savannah went missing

337
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:03,127
the summer
before the hotel closed.

338
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,001
- Griffin.
- I'm just saying...

339
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,972
you must've been at camp
around the same time.

340
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,212
Well, if I was...

341
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:13,975
I never met her.

342
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,685
Nice try.

343
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:24,985
Good night, Griffin.

344
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:58,468
Are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

345
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,426
My parents took
my phone.

346
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,845
So I thought they might've seen
some text about the portal

347
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:04,101
and followed me down here.

348
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,991
The basement was empty
when I came in.

349
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,346
- Wait. What are you even doing here?
- I got your text.

350
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,562
There's no way I'm letting
you go back through alone.

351
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,079
We're in this
together.

352
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,624
But what if your mom finds out?

353
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,067
That can't happen. So let's
make sure we don't get caught.

354
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:18,530
Okay? Here.

355
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,218
Uh, thanks,
but it's not really my style.

356
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,221
Yeah, well, it would've
been 30 years ago.

357
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:27,314
The idea is to blend in
when we go back,

358
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:28,692
so people don't get
suspicious.

359
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,960
And you're sure
this is gonna work?

360
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,736
Trust me.
Just put it on.

361
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,702
Oh, and lose anything that
screams we're from the future.

362
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:38,140
You know, that would be
kinda hard to explain.

363
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:42,382
Phone, TV, email, internet
all in your pocket.

364
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,917
Wait, did they even have
internet back then?

365
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:47,632
Guess we'll find out.
Well?

366
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,956
You look good.

367
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,272
Not that you usually
look bad.

368
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:58,613
Are you sure about this?

369
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,491
I don't want you getting
in any serious trouble.

370
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,975
It'll be worth it if we can change
history and save Savannah.

371
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,657
We'll be heroes.

372
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:05,999
They'll write books
about us.

373
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:08,117
The Dunn‐Campbell theory
will be studied in schools

374
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,452
all over the world.

375
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,452
Campbell‐Dunn. I'm pretty sure
these things are always alphabetical.

376
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:16,577
Yeah, you're right. You
should, uh... You should be first.

377
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:18,287
Go ahead, I got it.

378
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,905
Stings, doesn't it?

379
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,691
Is that why
you let me go first?

380
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,317
Call it another test.

381
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,361
Had to find out
if it happens every time.

382
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:43,835
Now we know.

383
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,640
Your dad was at the
coffee shop after school,

384
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:49,963
talking to my mom.

385
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:51,619
About what?

386
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:55,149
She was probably telling him
she doesn't want us being friends.

387
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,251
Because I live at The Tremont?

388
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:59,851
She's just really paranoid
about keeping me safe.

389
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,050
Been that way
since my dad died.

390
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:06,351
Sorry about your dad.
I didn't know.

391
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,373
It's not something
I advertise.

392
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,710
It's her!

393
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,374
- What's she doing?
- Shh.

394
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:44,765
Sorry. I'm not used
to trailing people.

395
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:58,031
<i>Next time on</i>
Secrets of Sulphur Springs...

396
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,993
- What are you doing?
- There's a room behind this wall.

397
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,329
A secret room.

398
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,256
<i>What if the past doesn't
want to be changed?</i>

399
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,421
Maybe we're messing with things
that shouldn't be messed with.

400
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:07,715
We've mapped the whole place.

401
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,531
<i>It's every place
we've felt a cold spot.</i>

402
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,288
Did you feel that?
Ghosts.

403
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,999
Mom, did you used
to go to camp there?

404
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,577
Of course not.

405
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:16,233
<i>You know how
I feel about that place.</i>

406
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,648
You must be new.
I'm Jessica.

407
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,975
But everyone calls me Jess.
