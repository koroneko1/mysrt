The people, places, organizations, events,
groups and professionals

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:08.357
depicted in this program are fictional

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:11.000
and created for entertainment purposes only.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.095
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.334
I will get a choreographer to give you a dance lesson.

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:18.334
Our hotness will help restore university's reputation.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.000
This incident made us realize....

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.214
what people on the internet wanted to see.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:34.307
The six of you must help create Mek-Kim BL content.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:38.571
and encourage people to follow the university's channel.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.761
I require 100,000 subscribers!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.691
The content we are creating...

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:45.596
must be directly beneficial to the university.

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:48.309
I want everyone to learn more about our university

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.761
through content that doesn't force them too much.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.476
This way we can create both BL content and good image for the university.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:59.690
I hope we can gain as many subscribers
as the chancellor wanted.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.000
What do you guys think?

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.523
I think it's a good idea.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What do you think?

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.000
And what do you think?

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.428
It's up to the head's decision.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:13.810
I'm here to make BL content with you anyway.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.000
But I have one concern.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm concerned that you might not be able to resist my hotness.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.262
The air-conditioner here is so strong...

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:34.000
and so loud.

00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:38.240
So...

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:40.481
What's the first content we should do?

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.000
I've thought about it.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.669
For the first one...

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.311
I want people to see how beautiful our campus is.

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.000
We'll go out and take pictures around the campus,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.168
making them a check-in spot.

00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:53.239
Like those TV series locations people visit.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.238
With you and I exchanging a sweet eye contact in the photos, right?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.115
Like that water splash video we had.

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:00.619
Yeah.

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:03.573
You just tryna act cool.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.217
I know you want a sweet moment between us, too.

00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:10.000
Look at yourself first.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.523
Who would want a sweet moment with you!?

00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:13.572
Gross!

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.691
You're so fierce that I want you to guard my house!

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.810
Okay, okay.

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:26.000
Let's just get started with this content.

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:28.594
I'm ready.

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:32.760
Then, you can divide what to do in your group.

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:35.000
My group will work on the script.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.048
so it doesn't come out too ridiculous!

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:41.000
Bear, you'll be the photographer.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.881
For this project, I want the photos to look soft and gentle.

00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:44.571
Sure.

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.333
Park, you'll help edit the video.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.762
I want it to be so romantic!

00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:49.547
Get it?

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.810
Make sure you attract more people to our fandom, too.

00:02:53.642 --> 00:02:54.425
Alright.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.428
I'll work on the list of the locations then.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.119
You just take care of the people on set.

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:05.526
Deal.

00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.000
But I might need to get off early sometimes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.501
I have a lot of work to do lately.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.691
Okay, no problem.

00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:14.072
So...

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:15.952

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:10.382
Grrr!

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:12.453

Why are you doing this?

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.000
If one day these two end up together,

00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:02.311
that would be hilarious.

00:06:03.143 --> 00:06:05.143
Let's just hope that doesn't happen.

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:06.043
Please.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:14.190
What are you so happy about?

00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:17.000
You dig this kind of song now?

00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:19.358
Your auntie really is something.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah.

00:06:23.262 --> 00:06:27.000
When I heard about the drama,
I never thought she'd handle it this way.

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.786
The song's quite catchy.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.934
Wow!

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:40.713
Is that your mom's cooking?

00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:45.000
I told her you wanted to have a taste.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.713
So she made you a full meal.

00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:50.643
Please enjoy, sir.

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.287
I'll just go ahead and eat it then.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.095
P'Tim, can we take photo with you?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Tim is having a meal right now.

00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.000
Can we do it later?

00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:09.143
Please, I'm begging you.

00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:11.737
We study in another building.

00:07:11.737 --> 00:07:13.000
We don't come here often.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And this is the first time we've ever met you.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
- Can we please have a photo with you?
- Please.

00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:19.214
It's okay. It's just one photo.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:20.239
Let's do it.

00:07:26.453 --> 00:07:29.476
P'Tim, here's dessert I made myself.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.000
I brought it along. I want you to try it.

00:07:33.523 --> 00:07:34.572
Thank you so much.

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:36.810
I'll see you around.

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:44.620
Don't even think about it.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.000
You don't know what's inside.

00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:48.406
You might be allergic to it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.572
You take such good care of me.

00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:02.238
I wonder how much better you'd be to me if I were your boyfriend.

00:08:03.974 --> 00:08:04.973
Well...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.358
Can I sign up for being your boyfriend?

00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:10.166
I won't be your boyfriend.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.406
I bet you'll give me a lot of headache.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.620
You attract a lot of people.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.668
You're a picky eater.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.478
And you're very fussy.

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:23.762
Wow.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.554
You said it like you didn't remember

00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:27.905
that you once told me you liked me.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.000
I was just so young back then.

00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:35.000
There're a lot of people on this earth
that are better than you.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.120
Then...

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:42.188
That person you said is better than me...

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.786
Don't forget to bring him to me some time.

00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.000
If he wants to take my manager away,

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:48.929
he'll need my approval first.

00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:49.995
In your dream!

00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.375
I won't bring him to you.

00:08:51.613 --> 00:08:52.620
Now, just eat.

00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:03.524
It's delicious!

00:09:04.238 --> 00:09:05.406
As delicious as it has always been.

00:09:26.762 --> 00:09:30.000
It's just BL content. Why is it so tiring?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Yeah, right.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Our content has more actions but it's not nearly as tiring.

00:09:35.238 --> 00:09:36.762
You two are so extra.

00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:38.024
It's nothing.

00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:40.643
Of course you could say that!

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:43.000
I saw you did nothing but messing with the memory card.

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:46.025
You were just pretending to be busy, weren't you?

00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.503
When it fact you were just slacking off.

00:09:48.785 --> 00:09:50.000
Just shut up.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.523
Only you could think of something like this.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.596
Here're water for you.

00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:08.572
Thank you.

00:10:08.762 --> 00:10:09.383
Hey, wait.

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:15.358
So refreshing!

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:18.000
Damn it! It goes wrong every damn time.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.168
What's wrong with him?

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.049
What was that?

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:31.719
No idea.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.264
Let's check out photos.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.358
This is the last location, right?

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:43.096
Yes.

00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:46.000
Kim, should we just roll now?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.143
It's getting dark soon.

00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:51.785
They still look tired.

00:10:52.332 --> 00:10:53.833
Let them rest a bit.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.168

Traffic's so bad lately.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.382
I dozed off three times on the road
and still didn't reach the restaurant.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.251
Then, you can go now.

00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:14.556
Otherwise, you'll be late.

00:11:14.937 --> 00:11:16.952
There's nothing to worry here.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.621
Okay, see you later.

00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:22.803
- Later.
- Thanks.

00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:34.237
Just go please!

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.451
Go!

00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:36.176
See ya.

00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:40.429

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:41.216
Bye.

00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:42.270

00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:44.142
See you later, Bomb.

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:57.881
Guys.

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.333
Let's take 10

00:12:00.547 --> 00:12:02.214
and meet again at 3.30pm.

00:12:02.452 --> 00:12:05.000
Awesome! We can rest now!

00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:08.000
Bear, let's go to the toilet and get some snacks.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I want something crispy.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.073
Me too.

00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:13.524
Park, give me 50 baht.

00:12:14.452 --> 00:12:15.477
For the snacks.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Are you a friend or a thief?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You always take my money.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Don't. Be. Fussy.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.763
Here.

00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:29.738
Let's go.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.000
[Cheer up :)]

00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:41.166
Well, well.

00:12:41.713 --> 00:12:45.666
If you want to cheer me up, just say it to my face, Kim.

00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:47.285
You don't have to be sneaky about it.

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.455
What's wrong with you?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.287
[Cheer up :)]

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
You told me to cheer up. I noticed that.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Only Bomb would do such a thing.

00:13:09.523 --> 00:13:11.000
Your friend did that again.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.809
What?

00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:13.641
He's your friend too.

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:17.380
You're the one who brought him in during the freshman camp.

00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:06.501
Is he dancing or what?

00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:08.859
I guess so.

00:14:10.786 --> 00:14:12.808
I'll go buy some water.

00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:13.571
Okay.

00:14:41.773 --> 00:14:45.046
Since we've received great reponses

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:47.474
I decided to come up with a little business idea.

00:14:47.474 --> 00:14:48.524
Ta-da!

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:50.407
1,000 of them?!

00:15:18.377 --> 00:15:19.275
Is he dancing or what?

00:15:23.328 --> 00:15:24.377
I guess so.

00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:25.426
I'll go buy some drinks.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:26.076
Okay.

00:15:42.761 --> 00:15:43.926
You like dancing that much?

00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:49.609
No.

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:52.358
That was...

00:15:54.377 --> 00:15:55.255
That was just...

00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.793
I was startled because...

00:15:58.793 --> 00:15:59.927
some ants bit me.

00:16:02.377 --> 00:16:04.377
Thank you, anyway.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:05.941
Otherwise...

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:08.077
I'd have become food for the fish.

00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:11.377
Be careful then.

00:16:11.477 --> 00:16:13.093
There's a lot of ants around here.

00:16:15.377 --> 00:16:16.307
By the way...

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:19.460
You look familar.

00:16:20.693 --> 00:16:23.626
Are you in the guy in that Say No SOTUS video?

00:16:24.377 --> 00:16:25.289
Yes, that's him.

00:16:26.107 --> 00:16:27.828
Do you want his autograph?

00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:29.475
We're going to be famous soon.

00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:32.377
I'm sure we'll be on top of Twitter trends by tomorrow.

00:16:34.377 --> 00:16:35.843
Oh sure, I'll be supporting you.

00:16:38.278 --> 00:16:39.294
That's it?

00:16:39.693 --> 00:16:40.193
Tim.

00:16:41.746 --> 00:16:42.628
What happened?

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.794
Nothing. I just came here to help him.

00:16:46.612 --> 00:16:47.277
Let's go.

00:16:49.694 --> 00:16:50.726
Wait, P'Tim.

00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:54.377
Thank you again.

00:17:01.377 --> 00:17:02.809
Well, well, well.

00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:06.809
It's true that the eyes can't lie.

00:17:07.644 --> 00:17:08.559
You like him, do you?

00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:11.460
Just mind your own business!

00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:14.929
I was just asking nicely.

00:17:15.129 --> 00:17:16.377
I won't bother then.

00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:19.611
Bear! Let's finish this thing.

00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:21.377
I think I might lose my interest in shooting BL content soon.

00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:30.010
Won't you check me a little?

00:17:37.377 --> 00:17:39.127
We gotta go now.

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:41.526
Thank you so much for today.

00:17:43.377 --> 00:17:45.177
- See you later.
- See you later.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.110
Do you want to go home with me, Kim?

00:18:04.761 --> 00:18:06.377
We worked so hard all day.
Just get on my bike.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.493
Just think of me as your motorcycle taxi.

00:18:23.294 --> 00:18:24.576
I'm trying to be kind here.

00:18:25.377 --> 00:18:27.377
Not that I want to mess around with you or anything. Let's go.

00:19:10.744 --> 00:19:12.659
It's a Mek-Kim sweet check-in point!

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:13.495
Take a photo for me.

00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:30.377
[Nuchsuda Ittipat
Chancellor]

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.844
Hi, darlings.

00:19:32.844 --> 00:19:34.126
Please take a seat.

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:39.377
First of all,

00:19:39.377 --> 00:19:42.377
I'd like to give you props

00:19:42.377 --> 00:19:46.045
for making such good BL content.

00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:48.477
I'm so glad that I shipped you two.

00:19:51.143 --> 00:19:53.675
I mean, I'm glad that I put my trust in you.

00:19:56.511 --> 00:19:57.626
It's my pleasure.

00:19:58.377 --> 00:20:01.495
Since we've got good results,

00:20:01.495 --> 00:20:05.479
I decided to come up with a small business plan.

00:20:05.479 --> 00:20:07.761
And I want you two to help execute it.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.210
That business is...

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.896
Ta-da!

00:20:15.896 --> 00:20:19.060
The Mek-Kim official t-shirt!

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.377
The fabric is so flexible and of a high quality.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:25.377
Available for you at 690 baht only.

00:20:25.377 --> 00:20:27.926
All proceeds after expenses...

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:32.078
will be donated to the volunteer camps in all faculties.

00:20:32.577 --> 00:20:33.544
Wait a minute.

00:20:33.761 --> 00:20:35.097
What does this mean?

00:20:37.377 --> 00:20:38.960
Let me be clear.

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:42.978
Apart from being a BL couple,

00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:45.577
you need to sell t-shirts too.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.245
You know...

00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:52.395
This is the perfect time to raise some money.

00:20:53.227 --> 00:20:56.378
I've already ordered the first lot to be made.

00:20:56.378 --> 00:20:57.377
About 1,000 t-shirts.

00:20:57.377 --> 00:20:59.537
What!? 1,000!?

00:21:00.377 --> 00:21:01.328
Chancellor,

00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:03.447
I think a lousy t-shirt like this...

00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:05.657
No one would want to buy it.

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:07.744
I know people have different tastes.

00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:09.893
But design is also important.

00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:11.952
One more thing,

00:21:11.952 --> 00:21:15.137
I think this is getting out of hand.

00:21:17.392 --> 00:21:21.177
Sometimes we have to think like a business person.

00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:23.479
Whatever.

00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:28.245
Can you two just come up with a way to sell them?

00:21:29.677 --> 00:21:33.737
I have already made an investment in you.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.826
If you can't succeed,

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:42.377
we may have to reconsider about the consequences of your wrongdoings.

00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:48.509
That's all.

00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:04.511
This t-shirt is actually cute.

00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:08.463
So cute.

00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:17.907
Since the shirt doesn't look good

00:22:17.907 --> 00:22:20.651
we need to get something else to attract people.

00:22:38.127 --> 00:22:41.338
Your in-flight meal is ready.

00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:43.475
Please enjoy.

00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:44.798
I will.

00:22:45.816 --> 00:22:47.617
I suppose there's a lot going on with you these days.

00:22:48.223 --> 00:22:50.571
Classes, student club's work

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:53.434
Not to mention being a content creator.

00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:55.588
It's not that overwhelming.

00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:57.987
In fact, I find myself enjoying it.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.855
You don't have to worry about me.

00:22:59.855 --> 00:23:02.750
Actually, sitting in the same car with Bomb and Bear was even more overwhelming.

00:23:04.244 --> 00:23:05.268
Of course I do worry.

00:23:05.406 --> 00:23:06.610
Because...

00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:08.361
Sometimes when you say it's alright

00:23:09.022 --> 00:23:10.416
Eventually...

00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:11.756
It's not.

00:23:12.499 --> 00:23:16.244
I still remember that Valentine's Day
three years in our relationship.

00:23:16.464 --> 00:23:19.351
You told me you didn't want any gift.

00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:22.244
But when you realized I really didn't prepare anything for you

00:23:22.244 --> 00:23:23.741
you ended up getting mad at me.

00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:26.814
You better just forget it.

00:23:27.034 --> 00:23:28.981
How could I forget it?

00:23:30.385 --> 00:23:31.945
It's a memory about you.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:39.802
So...

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.380
Do you remember...

00:23:42.931 --> 00:23:44.931
how long we've been together?

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:52.357
You're taking too much time.

00:23:53.596 --> 00:23:54.696
I was just teasing you.

00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:56.971
This year...

00:23:56.971 --> 00:23:58.244
marks our 7th year together.

00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:00.299
How could I forget that?

00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:02.409
The kid who secretly took a photo of me.

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:03.666
Nonsense.

00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:04.973
You just happened to walk into my frame.

00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:06.513
My, my.

00:24:06.513 --> 00:24:07.298
Don't be shy.

00:24:07.683 --> 00:24:10.556
Wasn't it you who walked up and gave that picture to me?

00:24:10.859 --> 00:24:11.785
Just admit it

00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:12.794
that you...

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.620
have got a huge crush on me

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.620
since the first time you saw me.

00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:26.888
Well...

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.125
Don't you want to start taking photos again?

00:24:30.226 --> 00:24:31.597
Your camera is now left in the dust.

00:24:35.148 --> 00:24:36.064
Nah.

00:24:36.532 --> 00:24:38.044
I'm already over it.

00:24:39.943 --> 00:24:41.010
Besides...

00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:43.915
I'd rather have my photos taken.

00:24:44.603 --> 00:24:45.876
I'll be the photographer for you then.

00:24:46.382 --> 00:24:47.159
How about that?

00:24:53.048 --> 00:24:55.331
You don't eat that thing?
Here, take this.

00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:00.911
I'll go take care of the bill.

00:25:00.911 --> 00:25:02.548
Bill, please.

00:25:06.276 --> 00:25:07.210
Hey!

00:25:07.486 --> 00:25:08.165
Lee.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.449
Oh, hi, Fluke!

00:25:09.862 --> 00:25:10.951
How's it going?

00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:11.909
Long time no see.

00:25:12.129 --> 00:25:13.601
I'm good.

00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:14.715
Couldn't be better.

00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:15.504
How are you?

00:25:15.504 --> 00:25:16.779
Same old, same old.

00:25:17.164 --> 00:25:19.068
Still like to try this and that.

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:21.610
Come on, babe, let's go.

00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:24.578
Park,

00:25:24.743 --> 00:25:26.137
do you remember Fluke?

00:25:26.137 --> 00:25:27.131
My school mate.

00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:28.766
Right.

00:25:29.014 --> 00:25:29.962
Of course I do.

00:25:30.182 --> 00:25:32.021
Are you guys still together?

00:25:32.902 --> 00:25:33.823
Woah.

00:25:34.244 --> 00:25:35.693
Time flies so fast.

00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:38.638
Before we know it, our college life is over.

00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:40.823
Not for me.

00:25:41.098 --> 00:25:44.099
I started over at the Faculty of Liberal Arts last year.

00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:46.244
Why?

00:25:46.684 --> 00:25:48.836
I thought you'd study Comm Arts with Park.

00:25:48.974 --> 00:25:51.487
Don't tell me you compromised yourself for him again.

00:25:51.652 --> 00:25:52.826
I was just bored.

00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:55.259
You know I get bored easily.

00:25:55.644 --> 00:25:56.681
Alright, alright.

00:25:56.681 --> 00:25:57.745
I get it.

00:25:57.883 --> 00:25:59.030
I just think...

00:25:59.498 --> 00:26:00.975
Perhaps you're wasting your talent.

00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:02.657
Ever since you two got together

00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:05.182
seems like all your skills have been transferred to Park.

00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:08.008
Let's go home,

00:26:08.008 --> 00:26:08.981
shall we?

00:26:09.229 --> 00:26:11.012
I have some work to do.

00:26:12.553 --> 00:26:14.837
Well, I gotta go.

00:26:14.837 --> 00:26:15.736
See you around.

00:26:15.736 --> 00:26:16.965
Okay, see ya.

00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:17.686
Good luck.

00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:18.621
You too, Park.

00:26:25.994 --> 00:26:27.337
Why are you walking so fast?

00:26:34.472 --> 00:26:36.337
Let's grab some rice porridge at Tong's for dinner.

00:26:36.502 --> 00:26:37.345
Sure.

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:39.414
I'm actually feeling like some hot boiled rice.

00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:41.456
Excuse me.

00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:43.102
Can I take a photo with you?

00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.111
Of course, you can.

00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:45.196
I'm happy to.

00:26:45.968 --> 00:26:46.853
Are you a Hailstone?

00:26:46.991 --> 00:26:48.317
What howl?

00:26:48.702 --> 00:26:50.219
Are you a dog or something?

00:26:50.357 --> 00:26:51.775
I was not talking to you.

00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:53.264
I was talking to P'Mek.

00:26:53.952 --> 00:26:55.465
Sure. Be my guest.

00:26:55.465 --> 00:26:56.718
Okay then!

00:26:56.718 --> 00:26:57.443
Let's do this.

00:26:58.792 --> 00:27:00.037
Say cheese!

00:27:00.395 --> 00:27:01.741
Cheese!

00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:02.951
Cheese!

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.378
You guys seem to make the most of this opportunity.

00:27:05.956 --> 00:27:08.424
Actually, I know you from the fanbase.

00:27:08.424 --> 00:27:10.244
I adore you so much.

00:27:10.244 --> 00:27:11.975
You have mischievous eyes.

00:27:11.975 --> 00:27:13.380
And you seem like a free spirit

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.829
though a little bit grungy.

00:27:14.829 --> 00:27:17.021
But whenever you're around P'Kim,

00:27:17.021 --> 00:27:18.994
you become such a a heartwarming guy.

00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:23.251
You two are definitely an OTP,  one true pairing!

00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.874
Never knew I had my own fanbase.

00:27:24.874 --> 00:27:25.789
You do!

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:26.908
It's called...

00:27:26.908 --> 00:27:28.859
Mek-Kim: Sweet Neighbors, Romantic Lovers

00:27:29.084 --> 00:27:30.854
What a cringey name.

00:27:30.854 --> 00:27:32.000
How could someone like it?

00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:33.733
I like that name!

00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:34.604
It's cute.

00:27:35.292 --> 00:27:39.059
Do you know the head of the fanbase create your content all day and night?

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:41.224
She always finds ways to get new people to join the fandom.

00:27:41.224 --> 00:27:44.125
If you have some free time,
please come and have a little chat with us.

00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:46.092
I'll definitely join you guys.

00:27:46.092 --> 00:27:48.420
By the way, don't forget to stop by our t-shirt booth this Friday.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.691
Tell your friends to come, too.

00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:50.920
Okay, we will!

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.035
One more thing...

00:27:52.558 --> 00:27:54.089
Can you please pass this to P'Kim?

00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:55.263
This one, too.

00:27:55.263 --> 00:27:57.374
See you later.
Bye-bye!

00:27:57.374 --> 00:27:58.438
Thank you so much.

00:28:05.455 --> 00:28:07.004
Guys, I think I'm on the right track.

00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:09.252
From now on, I'm gonna play a spy.

00:28:09.252 --> 00:28:11.390
I'll go undercover to check on the feedback from fanbase.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.996
Seriously,

00:28:13.244 --> 00:28:15.001
do you really like that name?

00:28:15.386 --> 00:28:16.670
Yuck!

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:18.479
Don't be so harsh.

00:28:18.837 --> 00:28:21.553
After all, our channel name is called Thunderous Sky.

00:28:21.724 --> 00:28:23.293
You can't compare it to that!

00:28:23.403 --> 00:28:25.713
This name is the coolest name ever.

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:27.383
Right, Mek?

00:28:30.203 --> 00:28:31.324
Mek!

00:28:31.324 --> 00:28:32.857
Guys, check this out!

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.866
30,000 people like my fanbase page.

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.341
In less than a month!

00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:42.763
I'm sure I'll get hired by some eCommerce mobile app before the year ends.

00:28:43.148 --> 00:28:45.111
I see they hire BL couples all the time...

00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:47.084
Stop being so obsessed with this BL thing.

00:28:47.084 --> 00:28:48.944
Are you going to lunch or what?

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:50.782
Maybe later.

00:28:50.782 --> 00:28:52.507
I have to do some research on shippers' behavior.

00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:53.252
I'll see you guys later.

00:28:55.977 --> 00:28:56.736
Mek.

00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:11.884
I knew it!

00:29:12.324 --> 00:29:13.304
Kim!

00:29:13.304 --> 00:29:14.884
Why would you look at my laptop screen?

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.026
Stop it! Stop, stop, stop.

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:19.132
Don't you know I'm the head of Mek-Kim fanbase?

00:29:20.385 --> 00:29:21.913
- Give it to me now!
- You're gonna break it.

00:29:22.464 --> 00:29:23.604
Why are you so obsessed with this shipping thing?

00:29:23.604 --> 00:29:25.164
Even when it has to do with your own brother!

00:29:25.384 --> 00:29:26.421
Come here.

00:29:26.944 --> 00:29:28.100
Where are you going?

00:29:28.513 --> 00:29:29.151
Stop!

00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:30.169
Don't do this to your sister.

00:29:30.417 --> 00:29:32.417
I just want to help you out.

00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:33.475
How is that wrong?

00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:34.777
Are you sure?

00:29:35.603 --> 00:29:37.373
Do you want to help me or ship me instead?

00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:39.568
How could you edit my pictures like that?

00:29:39.568 --> 00:29:41.851
Because you two barely have any moments together.

00:29:41.851 --> 00:29:42.998
That's why I need to make it up.

00:29:43.273 --> 00:29:44.557
You know...

00:29:44.777 --> 00:29:46.810
The page has already gained 30,000 subscribers.

00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:51.594
Lots of them went on to subscribe to your channel.

00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:54.605
And you still don't think I'm helping you.

00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:09.170
When it comes to BL couple content,
the most important thing is the power of fanbase.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.117
Understood?

00:30:10.888 --> 00:30:13.279
We even have a fandom name.

00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:16.384
And about the t-shirts you're selling...

00:30:16.384 --> 00:30:17.727
I'll help you spread the word.

00:30:17.947 --> 00:30:19.855
You'll sell them out for sure.

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:20.877
Really?

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.396
And...

00:30:22.534 --> 00:30:23.791
What do they say about me?

00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:28.084
Ever since I got into this BL content thing,
I've never felt brave enough to read the comments.

00:30:28.084 --> 00:30:30.084
Jeez.

00:30:30.084 --> 00:30:33.343
You should read the comments and reply to your fans sometimes.

00:30:33.536 --> 00:30:34.690
Here.

00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:36.624
I'll read them out for you.

00:30:38.468 --> 00:30:41.004
"They have such a great chemistry."

00:30:41.004 --> 00:30:43.004
"Although they like to bicker,

00:30:43.004 --> 00:30:44.541
they look cute together."

00:30:49.274 --> 00:30:52.102
"I'd love to have P'Kim cook for me,"

00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:55.666
"but I'm afraid his food might be too sweet,
judging from the way he looks into P'Mek's eyes."

00:30:58.604 --> 00:31:01.310
"This couple gives me a lot of feelings."

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.371
"They're both heart-fluttering and funny."

00:31:05.298 --> 00:31:08.667
"What a perfect couple they are!"

00:31:12.879 --> 00:31:15.924
Do you think you will end up having real feelings for him?

00:31:15.924 --> 00:31:17.103
Are you insane?

00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:18.495
Stop that thought right away.

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:20.835
There's nothing interesting about P'Mek at all.

00:31:21.444 --> 00:31:23.324
The reason why I'm so convincing with my performance

00:31:23.324 --> 00:31:24.872
is because this is my responsibility.

00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:27.709
That's harsh.

00:31:27.709 --> 00:31:30.730
Don't you ever say that to the fans.
They'll be devastated.

00:31:30.978 --> 00:31:32.764
Kim, you know,

00:31:32.764 --> 00:31:35.444
when you filmed that cooking content with P'Mek

00:31:35.444 --> 00:31:37.444
you fried an extra sunny-side-up egg.

00:31:38.848 --> 00:31:39.722
And what about that?

00:31:39.844 --> 00:31:40.785
Don't be clueless.

00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:42.675
You know you only eat over-easy fried eggs.

00:31:42.923 --> 00:31:46.117
The reason why you prepared an extra sunny-side-up egg

00:31:46.117 --> 00:31:49.218
is because you were not sure about the kind of fried egg he prefers.

00:31:49.218 --> 00:31:50.045
Am I right?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.292
You say you don't care about him.

00:31:55.292 --> 00:31:57.540
But deep down you do.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.233
Maybe you're just overthinking.

00:32:03.692 --> 00:32:06.004
I was just trying to make the best fried egg I could.

00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:08.449
Let's keep on reading the comments.

00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:31.534
What is that?

00:32:31.864 --> 00:32:33.049
Can I spray myself with that, too?

00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.975
Sure you can.

00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:37.544
If you want to be a successful seller,
first you have to smell good.

00:32:37.544 --> 00:32:38.768
Smell refreshing!

00:32:38.768 --> 00:32:40.083
So we can sell it well.

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.091
Let's bring it on.

00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:49.399
It smells so good.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.084
You do have a good taste.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.584
Come and grab one!

00:32:53.584 --> 00:32:55.629
Mek-Kim lovely couple t-shirt!

00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:56.904
Do you fancy one?

00:32:57.152 --> 00:32:58.244
Over here.

00:32:58.244 --> 00:33:01.098
The Mek-Kim t-shirt you're asking for is now available.

00:33:01.098 --> 00:33:02.320
This way!

00:33:02.595 --> 00:33:04.781
For 690 baht only.

00:33:05.744 --> 00:33:06.793
Thank you.

00:33:06.793 --> 00:33:11.140
Is it true that we'll get to taste P'Kim's special dish if we buy the t-shirt?

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.265
Of course it is.

00:33:12.265 --> 00:33:14.182
The kitchen is right there.

00:33:14.788 --> 00:33:18.584
What's the special dish you're cooking for your fans today, Kim?

00:33:19.162 --> 00:33:21.555
Green curry spaghetti with fried chicken.

00:33:22.244 --> 00:33:25.104
That sounds like a great fusion dish I would love.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.804
Stop playing.

00:33:27.804 --> 00:33:28.605
Over there.

00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:29.752
The crowd is coming.

00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:32.228
Apparently, you and I are doing great as a couple.

00:33:32.228 --> 00:33:35.044
I think I'll order 1,000 t-shirts to be made.
They are going to be sold out anyway.

00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:36.851
Stop with that nonsense.

00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:37.973
Now, help me out.

00:33:38.248 --> 00:33:39.725
Relax.
Don't be mad.

00:33:39.973 --> 00:33:41.230
I'm here to give you something.

00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:49.107
Here, have this on.

00:33:49.107 --> 00:33:50.183
Our fans made it for you.

00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:51.416
Now now.

00:33:51.664 --> 00:33:52.604
I'm busy.

00:34:20.284 --> 00:34:21.198
See?

00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:22.510
It's very simple.

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:36.004
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:34:37.124 --> 00:34:39.181
Thank you.

00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:55.809
Here you go.

00:34:56.249 --> 00:34:57.267
Thank you.

00:34:59.882 --> 00:35:00.740
P'Mek!

00:35:01.483 --> 00:35:02.958
What do we do now?
We've run out of stock.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.644
We still have customers coming.

00:35:06.782 --> 00:35:08.478
Give me a list of the ingredients you need.

00:35:08.478 --> 00:35:09.244
I'll go get them for you.

00:35:09.244 --> 00:35:10.244
Okay, one moment.

00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:15.908
Here.

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:19.889
Okay.

00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:21.283
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.613
Can I have one spaghetti, please?

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.282
I'm sorry.

00:35:39.282 --> 00:35:40.773
It's out of stock.

00:35:41.076 --> 00:35:43.242
It will be available again shortly.

00:35:43.242 --> 00:35:43.964
That's a shame.

00:35:43.964 --> 00:35:45.771
I came all the way here to get your t-shirt.

00:35:47.764 --> 00:35:49.845
I didn't realize you were a Mek-Kim fan too.

00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:51.466
No.

00:35:52.374 --> 00:35:53.648
I'm just Kim's fan.

00:35:55.844 --> 00:35:57.216
Actually...

00:35:57.629 --> 00:35:59.244
I just want to try your cooking.

00:35:59.547 --> 00:36:00.694
What a shame it's not available.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.614
I wish I could try it.

00:36:03.004 --> 00:36:04.426
If it's not available,

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:06.041
maybe you just have to get over it.

00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:08.164
Don't put a pressure of him.

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:11.906
We only have a few left at the bottom of the pan.

00:36:12.374 --> 00:36:13.404
I'm so sorry.

00:36:13.597 --> 00:36:14.881
Actually, I don't mind that.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:17.241
I just want to taste it a little bit.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.810
Sure, P'Tim.

00:36:21.113 --> 00:36:22.122
If you say so.

00:36:31.442 --> 00:36:32.263
Here.

00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:40.650
That's pretty good.

00:36:41.668 --> 00:36:42.311
In fact,

00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:43.720
I have to say...

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.253
It's so delicious!

00:36:46.602 --> 00:36:49.312
It's as good as the ones I had at famous Italian restaurants.

00:36:50.881 --> 00:36:52.244
That's all I wanted.

00:36:52.987 --> 00:36:54.124
Thank you so much.

00:36:55.965 --> 00:36:56.953
Hey...

00:36:58.027 --> 00:37:00.974
Tim-Kim is not that bad!

00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:10.644
Kim, they ran out of coconut milk.

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:11.570
There was not any left.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.906
So I got you a creamer instead.

00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:13.541
Is that okay?

00:37:14.615 --> 00:37:15.567
Really?

00:37:16.916 --> 00:37:17.644
Why?

00:37:17.644 --> 00:37:18.516
We can't use the creamer?

00:37:19.204 --> 00:37:20.488
We can...

00:37:20.736 --> 00:37:22.004
but it's not the same thing.

00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:23.938
Because I follow the traditional Thai recipe.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.779
It'll taste good as long as you're the one cooking it.

00:37:28.404 --> 00:37:29.384
Come on.

00:37:29.564 --> 00:37:30.980
Don't you see customers are waiting?

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.764
Come on!

00:37:52.007 --> 00:37:53.568
It tastes so good, P'Kim.

00:38:09.612 --> 00:38:12.529
We've sold out the cringey t-shirts!

00:38:26.863 --> 00:38:28.244
Yay!

00:38:55.044 --> 00:38:56.301
Thanks so much for today.

00:38:57.898 --> 00:38:59.876
You did a better job than I'd thought.

00:39:00.537 --> 00:39:03.939
Because Head Chef Kim did a brilliant job.
I was just following your footsteps.

00:39:04.627 --> 00:39:05.618
I gotta go.

00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:07.209
Rest well, okay?

00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:08.577
We'll have to come up with new content ideas later.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.663
Wait.

00:39:17.823 --> 00:39:18.539
Here.

00:39:20.273 --> 00:39:22.097
I noticed you hadn't had anything today.

00:39:22.244 --> 00:39:23.313
So I kept this for you.

00:39:23.506 --> 00:39:25.027
Never knew you could be a nice guy too.

00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:26.172
Thanks a lot.

00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:29.364
They're just leftovers.

00:39:30.684 --> 00:39:31.440
See ya.

00:39:43.242 --> 00:39:44.625
Well done,

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.051
Mek, Kim.

00:39:46.323 --> 00:39:50.363
I am so proud of you two.

00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:53.135
We've got a good performance.

00:39:53.284 --> 00:39:56.033
So I'm thinking of ordering more t-shirts.

00:39:56.033 --> 00:39:56.959
Maybe about...

00:39:58.115 --> 00:39:59.124
2,000 of them.

00:39:59.124 --> 00:40:00.050
Please don't!

00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:01.764
Why not?

00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:03.962
You two have a lot of fans.

00:40:03.962 --> 00:40:04.878
Besides...

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:08.200
We've gained a lot more subscribers on our university channel.

00:40:08.695 --> 00:40:12.394
I think we should take it slow.

00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:15.644
Don't you agree?

00:40:15.644 --> 00:40:16.361
Yes.

00:40:17.572 --> 00:40:19.003
Anyway...

00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:20.959
The reason why I brought you in today

00:40:21.179 --> 00:40:22.332
is because...

00:40:22.965 --> 00:40:24.705
I want to try experimenting with something new.

00:40:25.204 --> 00:40:26.744
So...

00:40:26.744 --> 00:40:29.084
I decided to ask one of your friends

00:40:29.249 --> 00:40:31.584
to do a collab with you on our channel.

00:40:33.724 --> 00:40:35.784
Please give it down for...

00:40:35.784 --> 00:40:36.558
Oops!

00:40:36.778 --> 00:40:38.964
I mean, give it up for...

00:41:01.324 --> 00:41:03.320
Is this plant called "Kimhan" or something?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.421
You seem to take a very good care of it.

00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:05.673
Don't be silly!

00:41:05.673 --> 00:41:06.924
It's content.

00:41:06.924 --> 00:41:11.601
I'm going to help mix and match the uniforms
for our university's beloved BL couple.

00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:15.157
Everyone knows you have a crush on Tim.

00:41:15.157 --> 00:41:17.472
You're smiling from ear to ear.

00:41:17.472 --> 00:41:18.870
Stop bothering me.

00:41:19.888 --> 00:41:20.933
What is wrong with him?

00:41:20.933 --> 00:41:22.465
He was looking daggers at Tim all the time.

00:41:22.465 --> 00:41:24.394
Has he got so deep into the role

00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:25.620
and got jealous?

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.806
What is wrong with you today?

00:41:26.806 --> 00:41:27.761
You've been moody all day.

00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:29.404
Ah, I see!
