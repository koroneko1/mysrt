ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,786
LAST WORLD FAN FESTIVAL
VIP TESTER EVENT

3
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,746
APPLY

4
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,372
YOU HAVE APPLIED AS A VIP TESTER

5
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,000
Hyun-su, how long are you
going to behave like that?

6
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,878
-What?
-Honey.

7
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,506
Dad, why are you ruining the mood?

8
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,008
Then when else would I be
able to talk to him?

9
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:12,676
He never leaves his room.

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,970
Why are you ruining your own life?

11
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,348
Stop it. This is a family trip.

12
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,141
Hyun-su came out to join us.

13
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,142
So what?

14
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:21,769
Should I be impressed?

15
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,856
Fuck.

16
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,025
What?

17
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,360
You make me sick.

18
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:33,614
I'm so grateful you earn money for us
just to neglect your own son.

19
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,450
-You little brat.
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

20
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,661
Shut up, Su-a.
You're ashamed of me, aren't you?

21
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:42,248
Are you scared you'll end up like me?
I heard you talking shit with your friend.

22
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,959
-That's…
-Hyun-su, calm down.

23
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,628
You're no different, Mom.

24
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:52,007
You suggested it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

25
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,551
Hyun-su…

26
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:56,971
I thought you were strong enough
to overcome it.

27
00:01:57,054 --> 00:02:00,057
I'm not! How could I?

28
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,892
Cha Hyun-su! You brat!

29
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:03,435
You should all just die.

30
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,979
Dad!

31
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,129
He's awake! Hyun-su's awake!

32
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,926
I didn't think you'd wake up.

33
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,055
How long was I unconscious?

34
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,973
A pretty long time.

35
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,935
I had a dream…

36
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,314
A dream? What dream?

37
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:51,984
I can't remember it now.

38
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:55,154
I heard somebody was moving
into Room 1410. I guess that's you.

39
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:56,280
-Living alone?
-A loner?

40
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:58,699
You'll just cause trouble…
Find somewhere else to die.

41
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,285
A slow speaker.

42
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,080
-I'll protect you.
-Protect them?

43
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,665
Is that what you want?

44
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,792
That's what dreams are like.

45
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,835
Uncle…

46
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:12,963
I want to be alone for a while.

47
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:15,216
All right. Call me if you need any help.

48
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:17,426
You should live a decent life now.

49
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,513
At least for your dead family.

50
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:26,602
I'm sure there's a reason
you're the only one who survived.

51
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,321
Did I have an uncle?

52
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:03,389
Isn't it cool?

53
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,018
It's what you wanted. You wanted
everyone in the world to disappear.

54
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,104
-You should all just die.
-"You should all just die."

55
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:13,732
I can make everyone you hate disappear.

56
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,401
And I can do even more than that.

57
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,611
I am you.
All you have to do is accept that.

58
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:23,784
Sir, what's wrong?

59
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,670
Yeong-su, pull!

60
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,383
Wake up!

61
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:42,428
Come on!

62
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:58,777
Did you hear that?

63
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,529
Yes.

64
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,281
It's pretty loud.

65
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,327
Maybe it's the guy we saw.

66
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:08,829
What's God's will?

67
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:13,167
I'm sure it isn't to be selfish
and ignore others.

68
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,926
Run!

69
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,929
Hurry!

70
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,267
Are you okay?

71
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,397
Who are…

72
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:21,610
The kids.

73
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:23,320
What about the kids?

74
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,075
You're infected, aren't you?

75
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,827
Your nose was bleeding and you fainted!

76
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,579
-You're the one who wanted to save him.
-Are you sure he won't turn?

77
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,915
I'm sure crushing his head in right now

78
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,460
is not the will of God.

79
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:49,805
Help me.

80
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,394
Please help me.

81
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,020
I made a promise.

82
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,607
Help me.

83
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:03,277
Please.

84
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:52,075
Su-yeong, is he not coming back?

85
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,744
Is he dead?

86
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,750
We have to go on our own.

87
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,127
But…

88
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:12,471
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

89
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:15,974
Let's go.

90
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,399
I…

91
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:28,403
can't see.

92
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,830
Where are you?

93
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,550
I think I should tell you in advance.

94
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,345
They're not infected.

95
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,306
There aren't any monsters around here.

96
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,100
Let's go.

97
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,690
I can't see!

98
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,359
You might meet a monster that can't see.

99
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:08,652
His hearing is really good.

100
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,535
Don't make any noise.

101
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,914
And don't move.

102
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:23,125
I can't see…

103
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,557
I can't see…

104
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,961
I found you.

105
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,398
No!

106
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,412
Su-yeong, he told us

107
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:45,207
that it was Room 1408.

108
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,251
This is the 15th floor, though.

109
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:51,922
We can't go there now.

110
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:53,924
The monsters are fighting there.

111
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:55,967
Su-yeong…

112
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:59,554
There might be some grown-ups
who can help us.

113
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,942
Hello? Is there anyone in there?

114
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,402
Please help us!

115
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:21,535
Help us!

116
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:45,767
Close your eyes.

117
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,436
Su-yeong…

118
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:50,188
I said to close your eyes, Kim Yeong-su!

119
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,015
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

120
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,519
PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY STATEMENT

121
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,103
My fellow citizens,

122
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:17,442
we are declaring a state of emergency.

123
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,782
Do not leave your homes.

124
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,957
The monsters are extremely dangerous.

125
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:34,626
Don't touch the children.

126
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:39,798
You can do that, right?

127
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:46,513
The government will prioritize
the citizens' safety…

128
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,349
and…

129
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,729
What?

130
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,694
As if! Shit!

131
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,781
Everyone is going to die.
You're all fucked!

132
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,373
You're going to die.

133
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,750
Die!

134
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:24,551
What?

135
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:28,013
Is the president dead?

136
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:31,683
Gosh. I voted for him.

137
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:34,519
But still, they'll come and save us.

138
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:35,979
Are you deaf?

139
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,522
He just said we're all fucked!

140
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:49,451
-What's wrong with him?
-Seung-wan, what's wrong?

141
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:51,161
My poor daughter…

142
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,830
No…

143
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:12,891
Da-eun…

144
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:23,485
Da-eun…

145
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,791
Da-eun…

146
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,223
No…

147
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:58,770
No!

148
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:03,858
Da-eun…

149
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:09,155
Da-eun?

150
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,719
To be honest,

151
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,139
I already knew.

152
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:44,232
I knew…

153
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,988
that my baby was gone.

154
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:07,088
Kids, run.

155
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:09,799
Hurry!

156
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,136
Come on.

157
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,943
How do we kill that thing?

158
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,297
Take the kids and run!

159
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,469
Come to Room 1408!

160
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:06,022
Ji-su,

161
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,150
I'll take care of this.

162
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,282
Even those great muscles…

163
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,663
can't compete with this, I guess.

164
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,250
You're lousier than I thought.

165
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,376
He'll kill you.

166
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:27,627
Right? You piece of meat.

167
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:32,298
All right, that's it.

168
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:42,642
Ma'am, are you okay?

169
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,425
What about the kids?

170
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:33,336
There's no greater love than laying down
one's life for their friends.

171
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,755
If you do as God commands, you're…

172
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,716
His friend.

173
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,570
Amen.

174
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:24,846
They're safe.

175
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,908
I can go by myself from here.

176
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,456
Make sure to come, okay?

177
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:55,710
Okay.

178
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:57,837
I'll see you in Room 1408.

179
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,309
Who are you?

180
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,163
Ji-su.

181
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,707
I'm glad you're okay.

182
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,167
Do you want to die that badly?

183
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,713
I get that you like God,

184
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:26,008
but you can go meet him later.

185
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:30,346
God is omnipresent.

186
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,022
-Come on!
-Okay.

187
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,243
Ji-su, wait.

188
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,661
Someone must have been here.

189
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,880
You're pretty rude sometimes.

190
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,802
You're the first one to visit my room.

191
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:12,722
Oh, is your room usually…

192
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:16,017
It's not usually this bad.

193
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,144
Okay.

194
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,538
Ji-su.

195
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,665
Aren't you going to take that?

196
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:55,264
NOW IT'S YOURS

197
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:19,789
This is yours, right?

198
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,212
Hey, you got the job!

199
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:27,672
Congrats…

200
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:37,890
This is all useless, Mom.

201
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,519
I've studied so hard for five years,

202
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:44,605
but the world is over now.

203
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:47,733
The president's death
doesn't mean it's over.

204
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:51,028
We don't know that.
You're jumping to conclusions.

205
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,126
As if! Shit!

206
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:09,505
Everyone is going to die.
You're all fucked!

207
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,426
-Ma'am, turn that off, will you?
-You're going to die. Die!

208
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,469
It's getting on my nerves.

209
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:16,762
Stop calling me "ma'am."

210
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:19,932
You're such an asshole.

211
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,643
"Asshole"? Right…

212
00:26:31,068 --> 00:26:32,486
Have you seen my sister?

213
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,031
Eun-yu?
I haven't seen her for a while now.

214
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:36,490
Weren't you with her?

215
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,492
No.

216
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,829
I guess he was pretty flustered, too.

217
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:43,914
He doesn't even know where his sister is.

218
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:47,293
Bom, I promise I'll never leave your side.

219
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,142
Come and sit.

220
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:13,272
Okay.

221
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:22,823
Enjoy.

222
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:26,827
Let's eat.

223
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:42,718
Kids,

224
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,262
what are your names?

225
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:50,601
I'm Kim Yeong-su.

226
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:53,687
I'm Kim Su-yeong.

227
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,315
Kim Yeong-su and Kim Su-yeong.

228
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:00,611
Yeong-su and Su-yeong…

229
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:02,988
They're peculiar names…

230
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:12,206
I guess your parents
gave you similar names,

231
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:14,166
so you two would always stick together.

232
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,710
Yeong-su and Su-yeong. Right?

233
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:20,673
Dad named us…

234
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:23,884
Dad…

235
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:42,361
Thank you.

236
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,956
It's all right. I don't really drink.

237
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:06,093
You sure know how to drink.

238
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:09,889
-Here, you can have one, too.
-Oh, I'm…

239
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:12,600
Oh, right. You're a minor.

240
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,227
Right. There are kids here,

241
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:18,606
so let's not break the law. I'll buy you
a drink when you become an adult.

242
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,482
You should learn how to drink from adults.

243
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:23,819
Do you think…

244
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:26,530
that day will come?

245
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,648
ELECTRICAL ROOM

246
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:52,658
The electricity's back on,
but why hasn't she returned yet?

247
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,538
Isn't there a security camera
in the basement?

248
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,250
The camera's been turned like that.

249
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:09,883
I told her it was too dangerous.

250
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,635
Didn't I tell her, Bom?

251
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:15,014
Let's wait a bit longer.

252
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:41,457
Hey, it's your turn.

253
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,085
-What?
-It's your turn to stand watch.

254
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,183
I'm infected.

255
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,144
I know.

256
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:04,646
If I turn,

257
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,939
kill me.

258
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:11,820
Sorry.

259
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,074
What?

260
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:18,786
If I turn…

261
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:24,792
kill me and I'll do the same for you.

262
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,919
Okay?

263
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:30,881
Okay.

264
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:56,698
This is so selfish!

265
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:58,826
GREEN SUPERMARKET

266
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,079
Hang on.

267
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:03,497
Seok-hyeon, it's me, Byeong-il.

268
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,751
You shouldn't do this to me!

269
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,545
I'm not running a charity here.

270
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:11,880
Bring money if you want something!

271
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:13,549
This is insane.

272
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:16,635
What…

273
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,265
GREEN SUPERMARKET

274
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:25,310
Who is he?

275
00:35:26,812 --> 00:35:27,896
You're Room 802, right?

276
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:30,983
What happened to your face?
I couldn't recognize you.

277
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,568
Were you here the whole time?

278
00:35:33,694 --> 00:35:36,947
No, I came down earlier tonight.

279
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,323
Tonight?

280
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:41,785
Your face looks awful.
Did something happen on the way down?

281
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,287
Oh, this?

282
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,248
I got hurt a while ago.

283
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,541
A burglar broke into my house.

284
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,251
-A burglar?
-A burglar?

285
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,794
A burglar in this building?

286
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:54,631
What's he doing?

287
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:59,428
-My goodness.
-There's food!

288
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,139
We can share.

289
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:04,349
Thank you so much.

290
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:06,685
Take this.

291
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:15,694
-I'm sure you'll be blessed.
-We should all help each other, right?

292
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,030
-Thank you.
-I got this, too.

293
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,116
Thank you. We're saved now.

294
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,284
Here.

295
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:28,498
Take this.

296
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,586
It's all right.

297
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:40,302
Take as much as you want.

298
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:41,637
Thank you.

299
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:48,018
Help yourself.

300
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,281
What are you doing?

301
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:04,618
I've been watching since dawn.

302
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,370
I think it's safe outside.

303
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,746
All the monsters are gone.

304
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,375
You're thinking of going out?

305
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,961
Do you want to die in here, then?

306
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:17,714
-If I can get to the car…
-Then take me, too!

307
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:20,259
My mom lives in Wangsimni.
Please just take me there.

308
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:22,010
I'll have to take a detour if--

309
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:23,262
Please.

310
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:25,305
-It's too far.
-Please. Come on.

311
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:28,058
Is it nice to eat free food like a beggar?

312
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,394
You could've given me some food, too.

313
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:32,604
Buy some with your money!

314
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:35,691
How can you treat me like this?

315
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:39,528
What's this sound?

316
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:06,471
Tell them to turn it off!

317
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:09,766
They turn it on every morning.
You used to dance to it.

318
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,603
Hey, don't you remember that monster
with the tongue?

319
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:16,315
It's going to hear that
and come back here!

320
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,276
Gosh, you startled me.

321
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,737
How can it hear that and come here?
That's ridiculous.

322
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,239
Do you think it only has a tongue?
It has ears, too!

323
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,701
It must have ears! It's going to hear it!
Tell them to stop that!

324
00:38:57,272 --> 00:38:58,648
Survivors in the building,

325
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:03,111
take any food, medicine, and weapons
you have and come to the first floor.

326
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,572
The first floor is quite safe for now,

327
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:08,200
and it'll be safer to stay together.

328
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,373
We survivors…

329
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,959
must stick together.

330
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,134
Please come down.

331
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:31,973
Please.

332
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:37,604
I repeat--

333
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:55,705
-What's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

334
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:58,375
-My daughter!
-Hold her!

335
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,210
-Let me go!
-Why are you doing this?

336
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:01,962
-What's going on?
