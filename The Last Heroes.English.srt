00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,000
Come on, come on.

8
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,208
Hey. Puek. Chote.

9
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,541
-Hey!
-Yes.

10
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,000
Boontueng.

11
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:53,791
Hi, Fang.

12
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,583
Giving the elephants a bath this early?

13
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,416
Are you going to harvest the rice?

14
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,583
Yes. Before it all falls.

15
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,708
-Let's go, Soi.
-Yes, Auntie Fang.

16
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,375
Be safe.

17
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,041
Yeah! I'm going to the rice field,

18
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,500
not a minefield. Shit.

19
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,083
-Come on.
-The mahouts are so handsome!

20
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,875
Mom. Dad.

21
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,250
The village chief and the monk
are calling us.

22
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,958
See you at the gathering yard.

23
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,458
Fang!

24
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,333
Saeng!

25
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,916
Fang, are you here?

26
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, Duen.

27
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,416
Fang left a while ago.

28
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,041
-Where did she go?
-To the rice paddy.

29
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,916
Saeng, wake up!

30
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,375
They are heading to the gathering yard.
Why are you still sleeping?

31
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,000
Wake up!

32
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,000
Mom.

33
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,041
Whatever reason they are gathering for
has nothing to do with me.

34
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,250
How could you say that?

35
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,583
Get up and hurry. Come along.

36
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,458
Hurry up!

37
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,541
Hey, Saeng. Aren't you coming?

38
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,333
Yeah. But you go ahead.

39
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,833
Hurry. Let's go. Come on.

40
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,958
What's going on?

41
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,875
I have no idea.

42
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,791
I want to turn this way.

43
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,166
-Are you tired?
-Absolutely.

44
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,833
I didn't ask you, old lady.
I asked Kong over there.

45
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,916
Wow. Old lady?

46
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,791
-Fug.
-Fuck Fug. It's Fang.

47
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,000
There's a gathering in the village.
Hurry up.

48
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,041
Gotta be now? Things are heating up,
and I'm about to have fun.

49
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,458
Soi, let's go.

50
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,000
Soi. Fang. Follow me.

51
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,666
Come on, come on. Run, run.

52
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,166
Auntie Fang, hurry up.

53
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,583
-Hold on.
-Wait for us.

54
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,958
Please wait for us.

55
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,500
Wait for me.

56
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,541
Excuse us.

57
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,500
Excuse me.

58
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:05,000
Today, I've called for a gathering here

59
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,208
because I would like to ask for volunteers

60
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,000
to go spy on the Munramaeng
in Yasotharavadi City.

61
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,000
I would like to volunteer.

62
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,833
If you go, who will protect our village?

63
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,000
What? If it's not him,
who else would it be?

64
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
Those who are proper for this job

65
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,958
need to seem harmless,

66
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,000
so nobody suspects them.

67
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,500
This job is very dangerous.

68
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,083
We need those who are smart

69
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,916
and sharp, specifically.

70
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm not one of those people, am I?

71
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,750
I guess not.

72
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,208
Why do we need to spy on them?

73
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,458
I don't see that our village
has anything to do with them.

74
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,125
How does it not?

75
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,041
If they want to attack Asoraya City,

76
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,583
they have to come through
our Kung Raga village.

77
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,666
If now we think only of ourselves
or our comfort,

78
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:24,458
soon when the threat arrives,
our nation could fall.

79
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,541
We are merely simple farmers.
What can we do to spy on them?

80
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,750
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

81
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,500
If nobody volunteers today,

82
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,875
I would like you all to consider this.

83
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,125
Would you like to live for yourself
day after day,

84
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,833
or try to live for the nation
at least once,

85
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
now, while everybody is still here today?

86
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,500
Those who would like to volunteer,
please stay.

87
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,375
Those who would not, go back home.

88
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,333
Let's go.

89
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,166
Nobody volunteers.

90
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,458
Thank you very much, Horm,

91
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,000
for considering volunteering.

92
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,250
Geez.

93
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,708
Acting like he would like
to help our village...

94
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,458
It would be so nice if he died on the job.

95
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,958
Then there would be no homosexuals
in our village.

96
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,750
Lower your voice.

97
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,083
Gon.

98
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,000
What?

99
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,666
Are you going?

100
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,875
Where?

101
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,000
To Yasotharavadi.

102
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,833
This time,

103
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,000
if we don't go,
our village will be razed to the ground.

104
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,958
But if I go and happen to die,
how could I live with my life?

105
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
You're quiet because you're confused,
right?

106
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,625
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,333
As for me...

108
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,958
-Are you going?
-No, I'm not.

109
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,125
What did you say that for, then?

110
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,791
-Let's go inside and sleep.
-Yes, ma'am.

111
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,083
Talking to you is like talking to a dog.

112
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,166
Fang, Fang.

113
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,791
What's going on, Boontueng?

114
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,375
I would like to talk to you.

115
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,541
About what?

116
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,958
About going to Yasotharavadi.

117
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,416
Are you going?

118
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,750
-I'm thinking about it.
-Thinking?

119
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,666
Yes, thinking.

120
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,791
Go and think in your home. Go!

121
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,166
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,625
Let's go, Auntie.

123
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,791
-Wait for me.
-Fang.

124
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,708
What? I don't get to sleep now?
What do you want, Horm?

125
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,583
I want to talk to you.

126
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,916
About going to Yasotharavadi, right?

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,416
Wow, yes.

128
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,875
But I didn't do it voluntarily.

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So why are you standing there?

130
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:55,916
I fell sleep.

131
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,541
You go!

132
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,458
Where?

133
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,958
Go to sleep. It's late.

134
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,375
It's late, so you go to sleep, Gon.

135
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,458
-And when will you sleep?
-During the day.

136
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,375
I knew it.

137
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,875
Let's get back home.
Or you'll be in trouble.

138
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,500
-With Fang?
-With me!

139
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,791
Damn! I shouldn't have wasted time
with your matters.

140
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,875
Staying home and shaving myself
is better than this.

141
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,166
So, who can I talk to about this?

142
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,833
Ah, Duen.

143
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,041
Duen, I would like to talk to you.

144
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,666
I'm already in bed.

145
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,791
She's surely asleep since she's snoring.

146
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
Duen, Duen. That's twice.

147
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,541
I would like to talk to you.

148
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,541
-Mom. Dad.
-Yeah?

149
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,166
Let's get inside.

150
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,875
Just got out here and now you want us
to get inside.

151
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,458
Please be careful.

152
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,625
Going inside again?

153
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,333
So, who can I talk to now?

154
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,416
I would like to talk to you.

155
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,583
Your logic sounds good.

156
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,208
What? What did you say?

157
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,125
Moo moo?

158
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,875
Ah, moo.

159
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,958
Thank you very much. Gotta go.
Now I understand.

160
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,125
It's all gone.

161
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,541
Saeng.

162
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:10,250
You're a man. You can't be drunk
all the time like this.

163
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,000
Right now, the nation needs men like you
to protect it from enemies.

164
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,458
Mom.

165
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,333
How can someone like me
fight with anybody?

166
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,291
Of course, you can.

167
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,416
I would like to see you fight
like a brave soldier.

168
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,208
Look at Krai. Take him as an example.

169
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,291
You must fight at least once before I die.

170
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,666
Krai.

171
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,791
You came here to see me. What's going on?

172
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,791
I want to know if you will fight
with somebody else.

173
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,000
I haven't decided.

174
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,458
Because I have a concern.

175
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,875
My wife, Kumlai, is in this state,
as you can see.

176
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,666
How can I leave her here?

177
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,791
Yeah, I understand.

178
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,791
But if you decide to go,

179
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,416
please let me know.

180
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,041
I'll leave you now.

181
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,000
ASORAYA CITY

182
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,208
Commander, you pestered me to come
to this meeting. What's the matter?

183
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,708
I was going to have fun
with my beloved wife Jamjureethevee.

184
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,333
Right now is not the time to work.

185
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,333
Why did you have to make it a big deal,
Commander?

186
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,250
None of your business.

187
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,375
Our spies have notified me
that Yasotharavadi wants to attack us

188
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:50,166
and has sent some spy
inside the inner city, Your Majesty.

189
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,250
You mean, right now, some enemy has
infiltrated here

190
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,750
and might have learned
what is going on here, right?

191
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,583
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:06,833
I believe that such enemies
are just some lies,

193
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,041
Your Majesties.

194
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,500
Commander, are you sure that
Yasotharavadi is coming to attack us?

195
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,000
They promised they would end the war.

196
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,541
I don't think they are coming.

197
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,750
Why? Why?

198
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:28,041
Why would Governor Anorathaporamintin
betray us

199
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,583
when Yasotharavadi knows very well

200
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:37,041
how hard it is to attack our city?

201
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,791
The news I received is not a lie.

202
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:46,000
If we don't prepare an army to defend
ourselves, it will be too late.

203
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,958
Your Majesties.

204
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,666
If it happens,
there's no need to be afraid.

205
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,666
I would just dress to fight
and hold swords,

206
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,500
and all of our brave soldiers would be
ready to rise up to protect Our Majesty.

207
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,250
But I think

208
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,791
we shouldn't underestimate Yasotharavadi,
My Lord.

209
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,416
You know nothing about war.
No need to share your opinion. Understand?

210
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,708
I agree with my beloved wife
Jamjureethevee.

211
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
The nation is divided right now.

212
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,541
Whatever you want to do, do it now.

213
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,791
I hope you know what I mean.

214
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,666
I do.

215
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,250
Thank you so much. Thank you.

216
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,458
What did you get from spying
on the village that I sent you to?

217
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,750
We are going to win for sure.
People are not united.

218
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,458
They fight with each other
every single day.

219
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,916
They are divided into groups.
Some are always drunk.

220
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,583
We can easily defeat these people.

221
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,875
Wow. How easy it is!

222
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,291
I agree with you, Commander.

223
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,375
Fang.

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,125
Do we have volunteers
to go to Yasotharavadi yet?

225
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,791
Why? Are you volunteering?

226
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,416
Yes.

227
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,500
Once in a lifetime, I would like
to do something for my homeland.

228
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,875
That's right, Auntie Fang.

229
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,833
Yeah. I want to, also.

230
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,208
I have only one concern.

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,500
-What is it?
-What is it?

232
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,916
-Fang.
-Auntie Fang.

233
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,583
Kraeng. I have something to say.

234
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,708
About your love for me...

235
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,125
We are probably not meant for each other.

236
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,708
You should forget all about me.

237
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,583
You must live on without me.

238
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,000
Don't be too sad after I'm gone.

239
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,375
I'm going.

240
00:21:58,958 --> 00:21:59,958
I'm really going.

241
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,250
I'm truly really going.

242
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,125
Remember my face.

243
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,375
Krai, what was Fang talking about?

244
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,333
I have no idea. I think...

245
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,083
she has a crush on you.

246
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,875
No. No! No.

247
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,625
Krai, tell me it's not true.

248
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,125
No, no!

249
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,833
Hey, Fang. We think it's time for us

250
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,083
to volunteer to go spying
in Yasotharavadi. What do you think?

251
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,916
I'm so worried about Kraeng.

252
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,208
It's a critical time
and you're chucking down liquor.

253
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,791
You think that's right?

254
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,333
Gon is probably right.

255
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,000
On one hand, I'm worried about Kraeng.

256
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,750
On the other hand,
I'm worried about Kraeng.

257
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,291
Why would you drink the liquor?

258
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,375
Auntie Fang, if you don't go, I'll go.

259
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,458
If you go, will you remember my face?

260
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,208
-Of course.
-I wasn't talking about you.

261
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,375
I meant Kraeng.

262
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:31,041
But, Auntie Fang,
please don't punish yourself.

263
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,750
Fang, I'll drink it for you.

264
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,166
-Yeah. Help yourself.
-Of all the battles, none are as big

265
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,250
as the war coming to our village.

266
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,625
Nobody loves you more than me, Auntie.

267
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,833
If you had good judgment,
you wouldn't be drinking like this.

268
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,583
Why don't you love yourself?

269
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,916
When we were young,

270
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,250
I was your best friend, right?

271
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,833
-Auntie Duen!
-No more for me.

272
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:15,166
Where is our unity?

273
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:27,333
So you guys are volunteering to spy
on Yasotharavadi with Horm, correct?

274
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,375
We both will go as well.

275
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,791
Yeah.

276
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,083
Krai. Boontueng.

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,375
That's good. So...

278
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,375
Good.

279
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,875
So our nation will overcome
the enemies and opponents.

280
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,583
They are not enough.

281
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,375
I'll go with them.

282
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,833
-Auntie Fang!
-Fang!

283
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,791
I knew you would come.

284
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,250
I have thought it through.

285
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,375
Between the nation and men,
I'd choose men.

286
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,125
-Fang!
-Fang!

287
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,416
I'm kidding.

288
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,750
You guys.

289
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,125
I could never leave my homeland
in jeopardy.

290
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,750
I'm very good at prying
into someone's business. Believe me.

291
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,916
Are you okay?

292
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,875
You guzzled down all of my liquor.

293
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,541
I didn't have any.

294
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
It's so good

295
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,500
that you guys are making a sacrifice
for our nation.

296
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,250
I am relieved now.

297
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,000
Those who have skills don't volunteer?

298
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,000
If we let everyone go with you,

299
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,083
then there will be no one to fight here.

300
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,208
I have someone with skills
to teach you guys.

301
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:17,250
This is the alchemist who will teach you
the magic spells.

302
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,791
Learn them carefully

303
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,875
-so you can use them in an emergency.
-Okay.

304
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,625
I will teach you guys some spells
until you are good at it.

305
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,458
Today, I'll teach you the spells to call
for wind, water, rain and everything.

306
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,083
First, the water. Watch and learn.

307
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,416
I was totally startled.

308
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,791
-Fang.
-Yes?

309
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,875
-It's your turn.
-To call for water?

310
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:04,958
Yes.

311
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,791
There. The water called by Fang.

312
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,000
Fang, look!

313
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,041
Is that the water you called or bubbles
from fish gobbling something?

314
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,250
Yeah. Two bubbles are better than nothing.

315
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,583
It's good enough for now.

316
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,083
Keep practicing
and you'll get better, Fang.

317
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,833
Yes, sir.

318
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,458
Horm! Now it's your turn.

319
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,000
Water.

320
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,250
Water.

321
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,458
Are you calling for more water,
Auntie Horm?

322
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:10,250
Today, I'll teach you 15 poses
of Thai boxing.

323
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm lost from the beginning.

324
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,000
So much screaming.

325
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,125
What the heck?

326
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,041
Are you guys really volunteering
to go to Yasotharavadi?

327
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,541
Yuck! You guys overestimate yourselves,
don't you?

328
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:42,916
Yeah. I bet you will not make it
back here.

329
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,125
Is there a monkey show around here?

330
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,000
No more. Luckily, I knew
he was going to do that.

331
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,833
-Auntie Fang.
-What?

332
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,958
Kraeng is here!

333
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,291
Kraeng is here? See?

334
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,416
I knew it! He surely has a crush on me.

335
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,750
I think he's bringing elephants here
for a bath.

336
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,291
Soi, don't lie to me. He came to see me.

337
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,875
He really is, Auntie.

338
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,250
Shit. I'm so embarrassed.

339
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,000
No. It wasn't me.

340
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,166
-Fang is so talented.
-Yeah.

341
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,500
Men always compliment their wife.

342
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:25,166
Don't be shy.

343
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,458
Not you, Kraeng! It's you, Fang.

344
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,583
Freaking Duen!

345
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,041
Kraeng!

346
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,541
Kraeng.

347
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,875
I have blessed you guys
with warding spells.

348
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,833
From now on, you all are invincible.

349
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,291
You can't be physically harmed.

350
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,375
Gon, step forward.

351
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,916
Wait right here.

352
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,208
I'll bring you the first aid kit.

353
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,208
Where?

354
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,000
Do you think she'll survive?

355
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,000
She's all right. Don't you worry.

356
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,583
Hey, Duen.

357
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,750
-Yes, Dad?
-How are you doing?

358
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,750
Dad. Mom.

359
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,833
I have decided to go to Yasotharavadi.

360
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,500
Duen.

361
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,416
I didn't volunteer at first

362
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,250
because I was worried about you both.

363
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,708
Though I have a feminine mind...

364
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,125
physically, I'm still a man.

365
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,166
I have nothing to fear from the enemies.

366
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,375
I am so proud of you.

367
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,875
Though you're like this,

368
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:52,833
I am confident
that you will accomplish this job.

369
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,291
Yeah, Dad.

370
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,875
Take care of yourself.
No need to worry about us.

371
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:06,375
Your dad and I will pray to the gods

372
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,250
to protect you

373
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:14,083
until you come back.

374
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,333
I have to leave home

375
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,250
and you for a while.

376
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:37,375
You're the only one
that I'm worried about.

377
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:45,291
In this situation,

378
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:51,041
I can't be thinking of just myself or you.

379
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,541
Because if we can't accomplish this job,

380
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,000
not only our lives

381
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,916
but also everybody's lives here

382
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,541
will come to an end.

383
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,708
If I don't come back,

384
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,291
promise me

385
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,333
that you will take care of Kumlai for me.

386
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,458
Can you do that, Chote?

387
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:29,583
You have to promise me first
that you'll come back, my brother.

388
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,666
Kumlai.

389
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,500
Kumlai. Kumlai, I'm right here.

390
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,750
You don't need to be afraid, Kumlai.

391
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,583
Don't be afraid.

392
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,916
No need to be afraid, Kumlai.

393
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,208
I'm right here.

394
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,375
Don't worry about me.

395
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,416
If you really must go...

396
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,458
I won't forbid you.

397
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,875
Please show your grace to protect him.

398
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,041
I will hurry and come back to you.

399
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,791
Good luck, be safe, and be victorious.

400
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,250
Amen.

401
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Rise!

402
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:49,708
Find the monk Thammarong.

403
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,666
He'll help you guys.

404
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,541
Pick up the pace. Hurry.

405
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,416
No more dillydallying.
It will be much harder after dark.

406
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,541
Yeah. For big results, we need to be bold
and take risks.

407
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,833
Next time, whatever happens,

408
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,041
we have to follow it through.

409
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
You're right, Duen.

410
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,958
-Chote.
-Yeah?

411
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,291
Please take good care of my mom and dad.

412
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,083
Yes, I will.

413
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,416
For the next meal,

414
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,208
you've gotta find them some food.

415
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,000
Duen. Are you saying your last words?

416
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,125
Freaking Fang! I know,

417
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,250
your dad is dead, your mom is dead.

418
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,458
So you have no one to worry about.

419
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,208
Yes, you're right.

420
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,083
Your dad is dead, your mom is dead,
really?

421
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,750
It's time to go.

422
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,041
-Wait for me!
-Saeng.

423
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,500
I'm here.

424
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,708
Shouldn't you leave the liquor first,
Saeng?

425
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,333
Be careful, Saeng.

426
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,041
Wait for me.

427
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,625
They are camping up that way.

428
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,291
Walk for the time
it takes the rice to cook.

429
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,958
Boontueng. You said the time
it takes the rice to cook.

430
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,250
The rice would have been burnt by now.
When are we going to get there? Shit.

431
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:12,666
Real soon. Be patient, Fang.

432
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:16,083
Yeah, Fang. I agree with him.

433
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,833
Be patient.

434
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,000
Remember this. For big results,

435
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:24,125
we need to be bold and take risks.
You don't agree?

436
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,958
I am so hungry for it.

437
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,791
Hungry for the fight, Auntie Duen?

438
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,958
Food. I'm hungry for food, Soi.

439
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,666
-Are you not?
-I am.

440
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:38,125
I agree with Duen.
We have walked for a long time.

441
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,375
No shower, no food at all.

442
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,500
I am so hungry that I could die.

443
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,833
You're right, Gon. Since I have known you,

444
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,458
today is the only day
that you've said something right.

445
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,250
You don't need to agree with me, Horm.

446
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,250
So maybe we should stop and rest.

447
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:03,833
And I'll find out early in the morning
where their camp is.

448
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,500
Freaking Horm! Watch out!
You almost hit my face.

449
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,083
So, move.

450
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,416
Shit.

451
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:30,083
Freaking Horm! I said that you almost hit
my face. What are you doing?

452
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,958
Stop fighting.

453
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,041
We should be united.
If we are fighting each other like this,

454
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,333
how can we conquer any enemy?

455
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,291
I think she's right.

456
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,791
Whatever she says is right.

457
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah?

458
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,208
Could you stop doing that?

459
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,250
So, walk away.

460
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,083
Stop, stop!

461
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,916
You didn't listen to what Fang just said?

462
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,708
We need to be united.

463
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,125
That's right, Duen.

464
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:12,250
You guys went back to fighting
as soon as she'd said it.

465
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:19,125
So, I think we should drink to make a vow
that we will be in harmony.

466
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,750
I agree.

467
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,500
To live and to die together. Be united.

468
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,166
Okay. Let's drink to make a vow.

469
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,125
Where is Saeng?

470
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,708
Over there.

471
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,041
-You freaking Saeng!
-Let's go.

472
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,041
We can make a vow later
after he finishes peeing.

473
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,625
I have drunk it.

474
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,291
That's your problem. Let's go.

475
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:13,916
I think their camp is not very far
beyond the cave ahead.

476
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,458
This way. Hurry.

477
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,666
Auntie Fang.

478
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,125
What are you calling her for?

479
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,875
Walk up to her.

480
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,333
Krai. Where are they?

481
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,833
Right there. On the bank of the river.

482
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,333
Should we attack them now?

483
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,291
Well...

484
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,416
You didn't answer us, you just shot them.

485
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:53,208
Duen, what are you gonna do?

486
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,875
You guys, go!

487
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,375
I dare you!

488
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,291
You guys...

489
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,500
they're all dead. We won!

490
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,916
Hooray!

491
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:18,041
I feel very disgusted dressing like them.

492
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:22,125
You know that I despise them.

493
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,041
You think I like this?

494
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,583
Look. It hides all of my beauty.

495
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,583
But I like it. There are lots of men here.

496
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:36,000
Krai, for big results, we need to be bold
and take risks.

497
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,416
We have to do whatever it takes.

498
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,416
Walk straight. Don't show any red flags.

499
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,541
What red flag?

500
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,291
Fang. Gon.

501
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:52,916
Do you know where they keep the liquor?

502
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:59,666
Saeng! Can you not drink
at this moment? Jackass.

503
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:05,916
Wow, Fang. If you were not this pretty,
I would have slapped your face.

504
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:09,125
Don't believe him, Auntie Fang.
He's lying to you.

505
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,208
He's not lying. It's probably true.

506
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,541
Soi.

507
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,791
What are you doing here?

508
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,416
Right.

509
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,875
That was a close call.

510
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,458
Shit. Almost got ourselves discovered.

511
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:55,333
Hurry and bring the woman you caught
to serve me here.

512
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:56,833
Yes, sir.

513
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,333
Krai, Krai.

514
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,625
For big results, we need to be bold
and take risks.

515
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:06,166
We have to do whatever it takes.

516
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,916
You don't know any other words?

517
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,416
I'm just reminding him.

518
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,250
You'll surely see me fight.

519
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,166
Krai. You're stepping on my foot.

520
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,208
I'm sorry.

521
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,333
Fang. Slow reaction?

522
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,875
Yes, it is.

523
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,333
I think it's bruised.

524
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,500
Let go! Let go of me!

525
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,541
Let go! I said let go of me!

526
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,250
Sons of bitches!

527
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,833
Help!

528
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,458
No! No!

529
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,375
Help me!

530
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,291
Somebody help me!

531
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:57,666
Fang.

532
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,000
I feel so sorry for her.

533
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,500
Let go of me!

534
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,416
Don't! Don't!

535
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,583
No!

536
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,416
No!

537
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,333
-Krai!
-Krai. For big results,

538
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:21,041
-we need to be bold and take risks.
-We need to be bold and take risks.

539
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,208
-We have to do whatever it takes.
-We have to do whatever it takes.

540
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,416
-Fang.
-Yeah?

541
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,000
Are you mocking me?

542
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:30,041
-You said it every time you stopped Krai.
-You bastard.

543
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,000
Look. She's mean to me.

544
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,625
-Stop!
-Krai. I told you to stop.

545
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,125
Auntie Duen!

546
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:48,583
Don't do it, Krai! Krai.

547
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Stop!

548
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,333
Krai.

549
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,333
-Krai.
-Krai.

550
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,125
Horm. What did you do? He's fainted now.

551
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:05,166
I said, "Krai, stop!"

552
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,750
-Fang.
-Are you all right, Auntie Fang?

553
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,208
Take a look at her.

554
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,875
What's wrong with him?

555
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:15,791
-He's drunk, my dear.
-No!

556
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,791
He's drunk, sir.

557
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:21,583
-Good. Have a good time.
-Yes, sir!

558
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,750
So tomorrow you guys can go home.

559
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,291
Yes, sir!

560
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:30,041
Duen.

561
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,291
Did I say "Yes, sir" like a man?

562
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,375
Firm and very manly.

563
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:35,666
Who's manly?

564
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,666
Auntie Duen!

565
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,791
Auntie Fang, you shouldn't have done that.

566
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,208
She said I was very manly.

567
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:43,916
I couldn't take it.

568
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,916
You guys.

569
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,500
What hit me?

570
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Foot.

571
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,000
Whose foot?

572
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,625
Mine.

573
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,000
Let's call it even.

574
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,375
You guys, hurry up

575
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,208
and enjoy the party, so we won't attract
any attention like Saeng over there.

576
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:31,458
THREE MONTHS LATER

577
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:23,916
Krai, you miss Kumlai?

578
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,125
Fang, you know

579
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:32,375
that Krai has never been away
from his wife.

580
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,458
It's impossible for him not to worry
about her.

581
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,416
I wonder how she's doing.

582
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,708
You don't need to be so worried.
She's in the village.

583
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,583
She won't be harmed

584
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,375
because everybody
will take good care of her

585
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,416
to ease your worries.

586
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:10,375
You have to promise me

587
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,583
that you will love only me.

588
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:21,250
I promise you that I will love
and take care of you until the day I die.

589
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,708
Don't say that.

590
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,583
If you die...

591
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,041
I probably can't live my life.

592
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,500
We came here, and we don't know
if we will go back or not.

593
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,166
Don't you guys miss someone
at the village?

594
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:09,500
Daorueng, I love you.

595
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:25,500
Give me a hand.

596
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
Boontueng.

597
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:20,541
Auntie Fang, Auntie Fang!

598
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:24,083
What? What's all this noise?

599
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,208
-Someone is here.
-Who?

600
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,791
Kraeng.

601
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,750
Kraeng! Tell me,
he came here for me, right?

602
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,208
He didn't come here for you.

603
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,250
-Are you sure?
-He didn't come here for you.

604
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,458
-Do not tease me.
-I'm serious.

605
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,958
How are you doing, Tang.

606
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,291
See? He came here for me.

607
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,125
He's calling my name.

608
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,375
He called the elephant. Her name is Tang.

609
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:49,666
Yours is Fang.

610
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:51,458
Go. To the bath.

611
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,000
Gone, all gone.

612
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,333
What's all gone?

613
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:58,250
Your hearing.

614
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,833
Kraeng, Kraeng.

615
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:02,041
Auntie Fang.

616
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:03,750
-Kraeng.
-Auntie Fang, come here.

617
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,125
-Kraeng.
-Auntie Fang, come right here.

618
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,541
-What?
-Look.

619
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:11,958
Look at yourself in the reflection.

620
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,833
Wow, Soi.

621
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:15,833
You are such a lovely niece.

622
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:16,875
I know.

623
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,625
-Turn around.
-Turn around?

624
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,125
-Fang.
-Yeah?

625
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,416
-Fang.
-What?

626
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:42,333
Turn around and look at what's behind you.
The Munramaeng are naked.

627
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,375
White as pearl.

628
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:49,208
I'm not gonna look because I'll look only
at my lovely Kraeng.

629
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,541
Wow, so big.

630
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:00,666
Yeah. You're right, Duen.

631
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:05,916
So white, so big. Pleasing to the eyes.
Unlike somebody here.

632
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,458
Is that a face or a toad? I think my foot

633
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,833
probably looks better than his face.
You think so, Duen?

634
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:16,250
-Yeah. Fang.
-What?

635
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,541
Don't jokingly offend him.

636
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,666
-He might understand your words.
-Nah. He doesn't get it.

637
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,541
He could kill you.

638
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,791
No, no way. Right?
You don't understand, right?

639
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,541
I do. I'll kick your ass.

640
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,916
So white and such big butts.
I want to be a little bird

641
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,625
chirping right there.

642
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,583
I'm already there. For quite some time.

643
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,583
Here.

644
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:48,125
Damn! You're gonna get us exposed.

645
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,166
Horm. That guy is eyeing you.

646
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,875
Really? Don't lie to me.

647
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:22,416
-You really can't hold it in, huh?
-Jackass!

648
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,500
Krai did this, I'm sure.

649
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,833
Yeah, I think so, too.

650
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah.

651
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,291
Krai, what are you doing?
You're gonna spoil our big plan.

652
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:20,000
Watch out. We're on the same side.

653
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,416
Finally, you...

654
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,750
Sugorpan. Take him away.

655
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,958
Krai.

656
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,041
Let go.

657
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,583
Let go of me.

658
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,708
I said let go.

659
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:17,000
Krai shouldn't have been hasty.

660
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:22,250
I was enjoying naked men. Anyone see that?

661
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,750
Why are you spying on us?

662
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,125
Why?

663
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,500
I'm gonna kill you all.

664
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,041
Take him and chain him up.

665
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:52,250
Lock him up in a cell.
Don't let him die easily.

666
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,708
Go!

667
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,291
Let go of me! Let go!

668
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:05,000
Post more guards. I trust no one.

669
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,958
YASOTHARAVADI CITY

670
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,416
Let go of me!

671
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Duen.

672
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:53,833
Which way?

673
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,541
How would I know?
I'm not from around here.

674
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:03,875
Hurry up and choose one. Otherwise,
the Munramaeng will come get us.

675
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,333
Fang. Soldiers.

676
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,750
Let's go upstairs to hide from them.

677
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,125
-Which way? Let's go.
-There.

678
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,583
-Hurry up.
-Hurry. Let's go.

679
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,666
Get out of my way.

680
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:24,500
All right, I think we're safe now.

681
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,333
Duen, whose house is this?

682
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,625
How would I know?

683
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,500
I'm not from around here.

684
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:37,916
We are women. We should walk carefully.

685
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,625
Look at us.

686
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,958
Fang, someone's coming.

687
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:47,625
Okay, just go do your stuff.

688
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:51,375
We have just escaped from the guys,
now we have to face the girls.

689
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,291
-Soi, find some place to hide.
-Okay.

690
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,500
Look around.

691
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:55,750
See where we can hide.

692
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,375
Follow me.

693
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,000
Hurry. Let's get inside.

694
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,750
-Mig Khin.
-Yes, My Lady?

695
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,625
-Is the house in order?
-Yes, My Lady.

696
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:11,458
-Fang!
-What a dumbass.

697
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,458
-Mig Khin.
-Yes, My Lady?

698
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:24,500
-You said the house is in order.
-It is, My Lady.

699
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:30,125
So, who has just entered that room?
Mue Tor. Tor Pa Yee. Did you see anyone?

700
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,500
-I didn't.
-I did,

701
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,791
but I'm not sure who that was.

702
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:37,750
-So, you go and look.
-You go first.

703
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,916
Both of you go!

704
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,000
-Yes, My Lady.
-Yes, My Lady.

705
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,333
-Mig Khin.
-Yes, My Lady?

706
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,708
-Go help those two.
-Yes, My Lady.

707
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:56,125
Somebody's peeking at me.

708
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,791
Mue Tor. Tor Pa Yee. Did you see anyone?

709
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,000
Nobody.

710
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,625
Go inside and look.

711
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,625
-Yes, My Lady.
-Yes, My Lady.

712
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,750
There's nobody here.

713
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,250
Good grief!

714
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,208
Somebody must have been here.

715
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,583
You guys are useless.

716
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:10,375
Daorueng.

717
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:12,916
What's the matter?

718
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,208
I don't know.

719
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,916
I think you're pregnant.

720
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,666
-Pregnant?
-Pregnant?

721
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,000
What are you gonna do?
Boontueng is not here.

722
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:32,333
Daorueng, go get some rest.
I'll do this for you.

723
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:39,500
Come, Daorueng. Go sit down.

724
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:53,583
I wonder how Boontueng is doing.

725
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:58,583
He's fine, I'm sure. He'll come back soon.

726
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:04,416
Daorueng, you don't need to worry
about him. He can take care of himself.

727
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:17,333
Fang, look.

728
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,791
These fabrics are so beautiful.
If they were sold in our village,

729
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,458
they would cost a fortune.

730
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,958
This one is beautiful, too, Gon.

731
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,500
It would look very good on you.

732
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:28,875
I think it's too old-fashioned.

733
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,625
This one here!

734
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:34,166
So beautiful. How do I look?

735
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:36,833
The color is very bright. It suits you.

736
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,750
Wow, this one here looks good too.

737
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:43,500
Yeah. The patterns are delicate.

738
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,666
What's the matter with you?

739
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:52,583
I fold it and you unfold it.
When is it gonna be done?

740
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:57,625
You could have told me nicely, bitch.
All my lice must be dead from that slap.

741
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:01,041
I'll go to sleep now.
I don't want my lice to die.

742
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:06,291
But how are we going to find the monk
that our chief told us to find?

743
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,000
-Are you asking me?
-Yes.

744
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:10,666
-How would I know?
-I'm so worried about Horm.

745
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,125
We don't know if she's still alive.

746
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,708
Freaking Horm.

747
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,958
If she wasn't crazy to sleep on the wagon,

748
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:18,625
it wouldn't have been like this.

749
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:24,083
You guys don't need to worry. I think,

750
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,083
she can take care of herself.

751
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,375
I agree. Horm is street-smart.

752
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,666
We should worry about Krai.
He's hot-tempered.

753
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:39,083
Where's Saeng?

754
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:44,208
He must be drunk around here somewhere.

755
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,708
Hopefully, he will not reveal our secret.

756
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:21,000
Horm!

757
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,708
You can't resist men, can you?

758
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:34,833
How is the investigation going
that I requested?

759
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,375
There are conflicts among the noblemen.
They are divided into two groups.

760
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,125
So it's a good time to gather our army
to attack them.

761
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:52,708
If so, prepare an army and wait
for the right time.

762
01:09:53,750 --> 01:10:00,000
Priests, could you find an auspicious
time for the Prince?

763
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,833
I'll do it right away, Your Majesty.

764
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:07,666
This time I have prepared a large army

765
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,000
to seize the city as a present
for you, Father.

766
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:16,166
Mung Tra Bureng, don't underestimate them.

767
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:21,083
There are people ready to fight you
along the way, aren't there?

768
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:27,000
Pi Ya Sawe, you think
my son can't secure us the victory?

769
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,583
It's just a small village.
I don't think it'll be hard to crush it.

770
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:39,500
I can destroy all of them in a wink.

771
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:46,833
Easy-peasy, just like an elephant
stepping on some grass.

772
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,666
If you think so,

773
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:57,833
I hope you can deliver
what you just promised.

774
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,125
Don't let this small matter

775
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:07,541
be a problem for Yasotharavadi.

776
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,375
Yes, Your Majesty.

777
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,000
You guys are looking for me, correct?

778
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:18,708
No, we are not.

779
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:23,583
If not, why are you here?

780
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,333
We want to meet a monk
when we come to a temple, of course.

781
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,291
I am a monk.

782
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:34,125
Yes, we see you as a monk.

783
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,000
Or would you like us to see you
as something else.

784
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,916
What would you like me to be?

785
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:42,333
I'll be as such.

786
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:48,083
What is he talking about? I'm so confused.

787
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:51,166
Fang. Duen.

788
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:54,166
Or is he the monk that we are looking for?

789
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:57,000
I don't think so, Gon.

790
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,625
I don't think he's the one
that is going to help us.

791
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,291
Right, Fang?

792
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:08,666
I am Thammarong. I'm the one
who is going to help you.

793
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:11,166
See, Fang?

794
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:15,375
I told you. And you don't believe me. See?

795
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:18,125
Amen. We're so sorry.

796
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:20,250
We would like to salute you.

797
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:25,083
From now on, you have to call me
Ya Sin Visura.

798
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,166
-Ya Sin...
-Visura.

799
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,625
Who is that, Duen?

800
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,333
How would I know?

801
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,416
Me. That's my name in Yasotharavadi.

802
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,875
-I see.
-I see.

803
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,916
-Don't forget this name.
-Yes, sir.

804
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:44,708
Be gentle.

805
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,541
Do it gently.

806
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:53,916
La Ong Inlay.

807
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:57,708
The monk Ya Sin Visura is here.

808
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:14,125
Namaste.

809
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:25,416
You came to visit me here.
What can I do for you?

810
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:31,500
My relatives came from Mawtamaeng.
Staying with me is inappropriate.

811
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,333
So I'd like you to teach them
to do something

812
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,250
in exchange for a place to sleep.

813
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,125
Could you do that for me?

814
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:45,833
Yes, sir. Since you know them,
I'll teach them.

815
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:50,750
So that they can serve
the Royal family like us.

816
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:54,166
Isn't that right, La Ong Inlay?

817
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,958
I really appreciate it.

818
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:03,416
And, you guys, work as hard as you can.

819
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,000
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

820
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,791
So Sew, follow me. I'll try to find a way
to get you into the army again.

821
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,083
Yes, sir.

822
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,125
You asked me to come here.
What can I do for you?

823
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:23,458
I would like to ask you to enlist him
in the army

824
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:28,666
under the command of your father,
Po Ong Tin. Can you help me?

825
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Him?

826
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,708
Yes, sir. I'm Boon...

827
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,833
My name is So Sew, sir.

828
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,041
He's not from here, is he, sir?

829
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:52,083
This man is just a commoner

830
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:56,416
whose village was affected by the battle.
He came here,

831
01:14:57,208 --> 01:15:00,500
just hoping that his village will survive.

832
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:05,208
He has nothing else to gain
from this battle.

833
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:11,875
So I just hope that you could help him
to survive here

834
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,666
until his job is done.

835
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,250
Could you be of help to your mentor?

836
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:27,083
Father, I don't agree with this battle.

837
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:30,333
We have promised to end the war.

838
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:35,166
So, why are we breaking our own word?

839
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,125
We didn't want to end the war
from the beginning.

840
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,375
We can't let Asoraya
be a worrisome loose end

841
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:46,333
that could attack us at any time.

842
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,958
You are my son. Just do what I say.

843
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:56,000
I don't agree with everything in this war,

844
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,333
and I'm grateful for your kindness.

845
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:06,500
I'll take care of you and help
as seems appropriate.

846
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,458
Thank you.

847
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:11,375
Thank you very much.

848
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:21,333
Master, since I'm about to take the army
to attack a city far from here,

849
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:24,666
I would like to ask you for a talisman.

850
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,000
Could you give me one?

851
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,416
The thing you want

852
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:35,458
is actually unnecessary.

853
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,916
If you put your mind to it,

854
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:44,375
you will succeed and win this battle.

855
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:49,000
Please, Master. Give me a talisman

856
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,333
to make me feel secure.

857
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,625
If you really want it,

858
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:02,291
I'll give you one.
I have kept it for over 20 years.

859
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,750
-Ivory! You're so lucky.
-Ivory or a knife handle?

860
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:26,833
Because of this, I've had to lie
on my stomach for 20 years.

861
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:28,958
I'm giving it to you.

862
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,750
Well, Master...

863
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,000
Come on, help me here.

864
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:45,583
Master...

865
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,791
It hurts.

866
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:52,750
It must have been in the bone.

867
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,541
Master...

868
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,000
Master, I think...

869
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:03,375
that we should leave it like this.
Or you'll bleed to death.

870
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,541
Yeah. Leave it where it is.

871
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,250
Soi, be on the lookout for us.

872
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,500
"Lookout", not look in, right?

873
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:26,875
I'm going.

874
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:45,083
Use the spell, Gon. Call him over.

875
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,750
Come here.

876
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:08,041
Stop.

877
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,958
Where do you keep the battle plans?

878
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,791
With me.

879
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,375
Bring it to me right now.

880
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:33,250
Your spell is no longer working. Let's go.

881
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:35,000
Where?

882
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:39,583
To wash our feet, of course.
They're soaked with pee.

883
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,500
Damn it!

884
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,583
-Fang.
-Yeah?

885
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:01,583
We're standing here.
Aren't you afraid that they'll wake up?

886
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:07,083
How could they?
Remember the sleeping spell?

887
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:11,291
Just put them to sleep. And voila!

888
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,375
I've never seen you being so smart
like you are today.

889
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:16,708
Go ahead.

890
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:21,541
I want to know
when they are taking the army there.

891
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:25,166
Okay, you say the spell.

892
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,291
What are you doing here?

893
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,708
Buatong and Tongkayee asked me to see
if you are asleep.

894
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,458
Isn't that right?

895
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,041
Fang, Fang.

896
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,583
Oh, my God, you two.

897
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,083
Sleeping like a log. How am I gonna move?

898
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:09,625
How's it going, you two? No more bragging?

899
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:12,875
-You also failed last night, didn't you?
-What?

900
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:16,916
-What about you two?
-Yeah, you shouldn't say anything mean.

901
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,208
Stop fighting for a little bit.

902
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,958
Fang, what are we gonna do now?

903
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:26,416
We've been here for quite some time.
We still haven't got any information.

904
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,708
I've been busy with your quarrel,
so I haven't had time to think.

905
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:33,958
Think about what? Your plans always fail.

906
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:39,250
The witch doctor.

907
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:40,833
Which doctor?

908
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,583
The alchemist gave us some good stuff.

909
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,791
What good stuff, Fang?

910
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,416
What's the good stuff?

911
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,791
I totally forgot. Shit.

912
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,875
-Bitch. Took this long to remember.
-Here.

913
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,500
Here. Hold this.

914
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,875
It's a sedative.

915
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:56,791
-What?
-What?

916
01:21:56,875 --> 01:21:58,333
Pour it here, Duen.

917
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,083
Whoever inhales it,

918
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:04,375
in the blink of an eye...

919
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,125
Auntie Fang!

920
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:13,458
Fang, Fang. What's wrong with Fang?

921
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:17,083
Fang, Fang.

922
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:18,083
It's very potent.

923
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,291
It's almost time to go to the battle.

924
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:24,291
Is everything ready?

925
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,583
Yes, sir.

926
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:32,166
I think we will win this battle.

927
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:37,583
The weapons and artillery are ready to go.
You don't need to worry.

928
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:44,625
Don't let anyone in Asoraya know
about this plan.

929
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:51,000
If anyone gets in our way, kill them.

930
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,416
I won't lose this battle.

931
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,708
Take good care of yourself, Dad.

932
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:18,666
I'm leaving now.

933
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,500
Where are you going?

934
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:39,000
I'm going to the room for dancing girls.

935
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:53,500
-Are you a dancer?
-Yes, sir.

936
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,583
How was it, Horm? Did you succeed?

937
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:24,250
Horm!

938
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:31,083
Horm! Horm, Horm, Horm.

939
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,541
Just like me.

940
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,666
Mue Tor. Tor Pa Yee.

941
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,166
Go tell La Ong Inlay

942
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:00,333
that I thank her for training the girls
to dance so gracefully.

943
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:01,916
-I will.
-I will.

944
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:24,000
Who are these girls?

945
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:27,958
They are relatives of the monk
Ya Sin Visura.

946
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:33,625
He asked La Ong Inlay and us to teach them
how to serve the Royal family.

947
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:41,666
So we both think that they should serve
the Prince and My Ladies.

948
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:45,791
Great.

949
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:51,250
You two shall give them proper training.

950
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,625
Let me see your faces.

951
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:59,958
All of you, please look up
to let the Prince see your faces.

952
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:06,458
Have them beheaded!

953
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,541
My Lord, calm down.

954
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,083
Wait, My Lord.

955
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:12,958
Get them out of here.

956
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,958
Hurry up. Get out of here.

957
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:20,708
You two as well.

958
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,083
Wait.

959
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,291
Not you two.

960
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:31,500
Them.

961
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,208
Get out.

962
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:37,541
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

963
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:47,583
Such useless staff.

964
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,833
How is it going with the auspicious time
for the army?

965
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,833
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

966
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:57,458
For the most auspicious time

967
01:26:57,541 --> 01:27:04,041
to take the army into battle,
the Prince should leave Yasotharavadi

968
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,541
from dawn to dusk

969
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,958
on the 12th waxing moon day
in the first lunar month.

970
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,041
I don't agree.

971
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:18,291
The most auspicious time
is not the one the priest Mayatai said.

972
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:23,750
Rather, it is from dusk to dawn,

973
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,291
on the 12th waning moon day
in the second lunar month.

974
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:31,666
That is the most auspicious time
for the Prince

975
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:34,291
to take the army.

976
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,875
So which one is it?

977
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:40,500
Priest Pawatin,

978
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:44,250
I'm sure your time is best for my son.

979
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:48,833
I don't think so.
The priest Mayatai's time

980
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:51,833
should be best for the Prince.

981
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:57,541
I'm afraid that if you go
at the priest Pawatin's time,

982
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,458
you won't be victorious.

983
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,291
Enough!

984
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:07,208
You two'd better talk
and come to a conclusion.

985
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,583
Then let me know.

986
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,583
Don't fight in front of me like this.

987
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:18,291
I don't need to listen to your argument.

988
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,250
If there is no conclusion
by the next meeting,

989
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:27,041
I'll have you all beheaded.

990
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,833
You've got all the information, right?

991
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:04,666
I heard that they'll move the army
in the first and second lunar months.

992
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,250
At dawn and at dusk.
Did you hear the same?

993
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,666
How are they gonna do that?
Both in the first and second lunar months?

994
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,000
Neither of those times.
They all are going to get beheaded.

995
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:15,875
Me?

996
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:21,125
Damn. Not you. And not us.

997
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,875
But the two priests. If they can't find
the most auspicious time.

998
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:30,875
What are we gonna do now?
When can we go back home, then?

999
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:35,125
I think next time we should get closer
to hear it more clearly.

1000
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:39,958
Yeah, Fang. If you want to hear it
more clearly next time,

1001
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:43,333
you would have to piggyback on the Prince.

1002
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:45,541
Would he let her do that?

1003
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,041
Found the battle plan?
It must be here somewhere.

1004
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:53,333
You two hurry up before someone comes in.

1005
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:54,875
Fang, I've found nothing.

1006
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:04,875
Oh, God, someone is coming.
Fang, Fang, run!

1007
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,166
-Nothing in there.
-Wonder where they put it.

1008
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:26,750
Somebody's coming.

1009
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,041
Hurry up, Auntie.

1010
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:45,458
What about Gon and Horm?
Won't they be caught?

1011
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,250
-Soi.
-Duen, Duen.

1012
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,375
This way. Soi.

1013
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
They're right behind us.

1014
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,750
What should we do? They found us.

1015
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:00,083
What can we do but run?

1016
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,250
They're coming.

1017
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:00,875
Fang.

1018
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,416
What should we do now?

1019
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,041
Whatever it is, let's do it.

1020
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,541
I know what we should do.

1021
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:12,416
On the 11th of the waxing moon, at dawn,

1022
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:16,000
at 7:00 a.m. of the second lunar month,

1023
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:19,541
which is the auspicious time for victory,
so suitable for the Prince

1024
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,958
to move the army.

1025
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:26,333
Mung Tra Bureng,

1026
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:30,208
have you got your army ready?

1027
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:35,458
For the auspicious time that the priest
just said, I have the army ready

1028
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:37,750
for the battle, Father.

1029
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,000
Great.

1030
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:42,791
To celebrate this auspicious time,

1031
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:45,041
I have prepared dancers

1032
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:49,375
to dance in front of His Majesty
and my son

1033
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:52,333
as entertainment before the war.

1034
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:22,166
Which dancer do you like?

1035
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:25,166
I'll bring her to you.

1036
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,583
Commander Po Ong Tin...

1037
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,291
Your Highness...

1038
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,583
these dancers could be spies.

1039
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:05,000
Duen, we didn't practice this pose.

1040
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:18,416
Stop! Soldiers!

1041
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:21,500
Take these dancers to the prison.

1042
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,333
Auntie Fang!

1043
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:52,375
These dancers could be spies

1044
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:55,041
infiltrating us to get information
about the battle.

1045
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,791
Let go of me. Let go now!

1046
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:27,000
Duen.

1047
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:30,125
I can walk in there myself.

1048
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:43,625
You guys, what happened?

1049
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:47,000
Duen, you tell him.
It's because of you, isn't it?

1050
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,541
You always blame me.

1051
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:52,916
If you guys could dance delicately
like me,

1052
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,791
we wouldn't have been caught.

1053
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:58,583
Geez. You danced like a monkey.

1054
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,041
Yeah. Anybody could see through that.

1055
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,500
-Yeah.
-Enough.

1056
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:07,416
Stop fighting. We'd better figure out
how to get out of here.

1057
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,000
How are we gonna get out of here?

1058
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:11,125
What are we gonna do now?

1059
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:14,333
I don't know, either.

1060
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:29,875
Tomorrow is the most auspicious time

1061
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:34,541
for me to take the army into battle.
So I came here to say goodbye.

1062
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:42,583
-Tomorrow?
-But I still lack confidence,

1063
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:49,291
as I'm worried that this battle
is not like anything in the past.

1064
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,666
Actually,

1065
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:55,833
the auspicious time is not
what matters the most.

1066
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,625
Be confident, be brave.

1067
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:07,041
And you'll win
no matter what the auspicious time is.

1068
01:37:10,666 --> 01:37:14,250
Your advice is very helpful.

1069
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:19,000
I'll keep that in mind
and follow it through.

1070
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,875
Bless you.

1071
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:29,625
Be safe and sound. Return victorious.

1072
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:38,958
Your Highness...

1073
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:44,625
if you're still worried...

1074
01:37:57,958 --> 01:38:00,583
then take this.

1075
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:09,083
This is just the handle.
Where is the rest?

1076
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:14,791
Come to get the blade next time.

1077
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,875
Stop the bleeding.

1078
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,041
It's all right.

1079
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,250
Take care of him. I must go now.

1080
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:29,291
Be safe and sound.

1081
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:33,250
-Master!
-Master!

1082
01:38:33,666 --> 01:38:35,458
Master, master!

1083
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,625
Saeng, Boontueng, and Soi...
I wonder how they are doing.

1084
01:38:58,083 --> 01:39:02,541
They are moving the army tomorrow.
What are we gonna do?

1085
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,333
If we can't get out of here,

1086
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:13,458
everything we have done will be in vain.

1087
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:20,625
The villagers alone can't fight them off.

1088
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,208
I'm so worried.

1089
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,166
If the village is ruined because of me...

1090
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:30,541
I would rather die.

1091
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,625
Don't say that, Duen.

1092
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:36,125
If we must die...

1093
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:39,708
we all should die together.

1094
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:44,333
-Fang!
-I'm serious.

1095
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:53,250
Darling, look at the moon. It's so pretty.

1096
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:58,083
Please, all angels,

1097
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:03,791
please protect my son Duen from any harm.

1098
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:08,000
-Please.
-Please protect my son.

1099
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,750
Saeng, my son.

1100
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:30,416
I wonder how you are doing.

1101
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:56,791
I, as the King

1102
01:40:56,875 --> 01:41:03,708
and your father, would like to give you
blessings to win this battle.

1103
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:07,375
Thank you, Father.

1104
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:16,416
I will bring you the victory
without doubt.

1105
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:19,458
Bring me the victory.

1106
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:43,875
You two hurry up and go help the others
before it's too late.

1107
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:49,541
Saeng!

1108
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,916
How are you doing, Boontueng?

1109
01:41:52,916 --> 01:41:55,250
It's time to do it.

1110
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:58,583
We'll go help Krai and the rest.

1111
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:01,916
You should get everything ready.

1112
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:06,083
Don't worry. I'll do it.

1113
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:16,166
Thongdee. Chote.

1114
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,666
What's the matter, Puek?

1115
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,458
Boontueng has sent a message.

1116
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:31,500
-Hurry up, Soi.
-Auntie Fang.

1117
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:37,000
-Soi.
-I'm here to help.

1118
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:38,375
-Soi.
-Krai.

1119
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:39,833
Come on.

1120
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,916
-Go.
-Hurry before they all come.

1121
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:44,000
Hurry up.

1122
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,291
Hurry, come on.

1123
01:42:59,666 --> 01:43:02,958
Saeng, why are you sitting there?

1124
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:04,541
I'm waiting for you guys.

1125
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:10,583
Guys,

1126
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:11,666
where is Gon?

1127
01:43:12,583 --> 01:43:13,708
-Yeah. Gon.
-I'm here.

1128
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:15,583
Gon, hurry up.

1129
01:43:15,666 --> 01:43:17,416
Don't drag your feet.

1130
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:22,833
Hurry. I have all the weapons,
clothes, and horses ready over there.

1131
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,333
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

1132
01:43:25,208 --> 01:43:26,333
I have an idea.

1133
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:28,958
Doksok.

1134
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:35,000
You and I have been friends
for a long time.

1135
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:37,625
I think it's time...

1136
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:44,500
that we all cut ourselves
to make a vow to be friends forever.

1137
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:45,500
Good.

1138
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:48,333
Let heaven and earth be the witness.

1139
01:43:48,416 --> 01:43:50,958
Seventeen layers of heaven,
15 layers of earth,

1140
01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:53,500
forest, and mountain angels,
please be the witness.

1141
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:58,250
If I or any of you guys face a threat,
I will totally fight by your side.

1142
01:43:58,333 --> 01:44:00,666
But if I face a threat, you all will--

1143
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:02,625
-Duen!
-I'm not done.

1144
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:04,875
I'm bleeding to death!

1145
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:06,666
-Give me the knife.
-Here.

1146
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:14,666
Doksok,

1147
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,958
I have cut myself.

1148
01:44:28,625 --> 01:44:30,916
I'll send a message to my forever friends.

1149
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,541
So they come to help us.

1150
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:35,458
Shit. Where are you gonna find a pigeon
right now?

1151
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,750
I have one right here.

1152
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:48,333
Gon, we're leaving now.

1153
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:49,833
Wait for me!

1154
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:55,000
Thank you very much, Pi Day Gong.
With fate, we shall see each other again.

1155
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:02,000
So, Kraeng, Klar, Kriang,

1156
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:06,125
go tell everybody to get ready.

1157
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:07,208
Yes, sir.

1158
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:12,500
-All of you as well.
-Yes, sir.

1159
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,666
Saeng, don't let them go
through the village.

1160
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,500
You can count on me, Boontueng.

1161
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:29,791
They have to face someone like me.

1162
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:34,291
For my nation,
I will never let them go through.

1163
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:38,750
I'll let them know that the people
of Kung Raga

1164
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:42,500
are not afraid to fight to the death.
Let's go.

1165
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:46,541
Go.

1166
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:48,458
Go.

1167
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,375
Go.

1168
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,875
Hurry up, everyone, before it's too late.

1169
01:45:55,625 --> 01:46:00,416
Horm. Fang. Duen. Hold on! Wait for me!

1170
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,916
Let all the good deeds I have done
be the power

1171
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:19,125
to protect everyone of Kung Raga

1172
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:24,125
and help them to survive any threats
in this battle.

1173
01:46:31,666 --> 01:46:33,000
-Sher!
-What?

1174
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:34,500
Something terrible is happening!

1175
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:37,416
Oh, Fai. What's wrong?

1176
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,666
The chief is calling everyone
to fight a battle.

1177
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:40,625
A battle?

1178
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:42,416
Sher. Shor.

1179
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,791
What?

1180
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:47,208
Sher, no need to go.

1181
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:49,000
Why do we need to fight?

1182
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:52,500
We could just move
and escape from the enemy.

1183
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:56,291
Because of people like you two,

1184
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:58,375
our nation has been endlessly
losing our land.

1185
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:01,666
It's just land. You don't need to care.

1186
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,500
You are so old.
If you go, I'm sure you'll die.

1187
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:08,208
Bitches! No matter how old or young,
we have to fight

1188
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:10,333
for our Kung Raga village.

1189
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:16,208
I will fight with them.

1190
01:47:17,416 --> 01:47:21,250
I despise them.
You two, go get weapons ready.

1191
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:25,791
Meet at the front of the village
in a moment.

1192
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,291
Master!

1193
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:45,583
Master!

1194
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,625
Master!

1195
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:01,250
The enemy is coming toward us.
What should we do?

1196
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:06,541
If that is so, this battle is inevitable.

1197
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:10,791
Fight for our nation! Fear no one!

1198
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:19,791
If we do not fight today, we won't have
a nation for our descendants.

1199
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:23,250
Fight for our nation!

1200
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:25,958
Fight for our nation!

1201
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:28,958
Fight for our nation!

1202
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:31,625
Fight for our nation!

1203
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,000
Fight for our nation!

1204
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:36,208
Fight for our nation!

1205
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,541
Are you okay?

1206
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:24,708
The master's talisman is really powerful.

1207
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:45,833
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

1208
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,458
Doctor!

1209
01:52:39,416 --> 01:52:40,333
Witch doctor!

1210
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,958
Horm. I don't think I can make it.

1211
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:47,500
What? No! You'll be all right.

1212
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:50,500
No! You gotta be all right.

1213
01:52:56,291 --> 01:52:58,666
Not me. I didn't do it.

1214
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:00,500
I didn't do it.

1215
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:20,208
Kraeng. My dear Kraeng.

1216
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:28,208
Kraeng, are you all right?

1217
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,958
Leave him alone!
You have to go through me.

1218
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,666
-Yes!
-Gon.

1219
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:47,625
I have something to tell you. Gon!

1220
01:53:47,708 --> 01:53:50,958
Stop calling my name.
Hand me a cannon ball now!

1221
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:55,166
-Which one? This?
-Yeah.

1222
01:53:58,541 --> 01:53:59,375
Move aside.

1223
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,083
Daorueng!

1224
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:36,291
There are no more.

1225
01:54:36,541 --> 01:54:38,375
No more? So we leave!

1226
01:55:02,666 --> 01:55:03,500
Kumlai!

1227
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:14,708
Kumlai.

1228
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:21,541
How are you holding up?

1229
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:25,000
Kumlai.

1230
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:32,041
Kumlai.

1231
01:55:45,583 --> 01:55:46,708
Daorueng!

1232
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:49,916
No! Our baby!

1233
01:55:53,875 --> 01:55:54,833
You!

1234
01:57:02,458 --> 01:57:03,416
Mom!

1235
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:10,958
Mom.

1236
01:57:13,833 --> 01:57:16,000
-Saeng.
-Mom.

1237
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:17,750
Saeng, my baby.

1238
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,416
You don't need to say anything.

1239
01:57:23,916 --> 01:57:29,500
I'm so glad to see you hold a sword
and fight.

1240
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:40,708
Mom!

1241
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:48,083
Mom!

1242
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:51,041
Mom.

1243
01:57:52,208 --> 01:57:53,250
Duen.

1244
01:57:54,625 --> 01:57:57,458
No dad, no mom...

1245
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,583
Take care of yourself, okay?

1246
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,500
No, Mom.

1247
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:07,000
It can't be like this. Mom. Mom!

1248
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:11,750
I can rest in peace now, my baby.

1249
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:21,500
Don't cry. You are a man.
You have to defend our nation.

1250
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:25,500
Hold a sword to fight...

1251
01:58:27,791 --> 01:58:31,166
for our descendants.

1252
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:33,208
Mom!

1253
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:42,291
Mom!

1254
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:48,208
No!

1255
01:58:51,125 --> 01:58:53,208
Mom!

1256
01:59:38,125 --> 01:59:42,125
You mean, we couldn't defend our city
and men?

1257
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:43,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

1258
01:59:45,666 --> 01:59:49,833
If our city had great leaders,

1259
01:59:50,916 --> 01:59:53,916
not those noblemen,

1260
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,541
who are treacherous, ignorant cowards

1261
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:02,625
that let the enemy in to ruin our nation.

1262
02:00:03,833 --> 02:00:08,666
It doesn't matter if we had ten times
more people and soldiers than the enemy,

1263
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,708
we couldn't have won this battle.

1264
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:19,291
That's because we are divided, isn't it?

1265
02:00:33,333 --> 02:00:34,500
You die!

1266
02:01:36,333 --> 02:01:41,083
Duen! We are here for you.

1267
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,875
Doksok, Doksok. Oh, God, you came
to help me. I'll survive!

1268
02:02:18,833 --> 02:02:20,208
Duen!

1269
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:18,625
Not long after that, in 2112 B.C.E.,

1270
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:24,250
Yasotharavadi returned to attack Asoraya
once more

1271
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:30,833
because Asoraya was still divided and weak

1272
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:33,166
from the previous battle.

1273
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:39,166
So, Yasotharavadi
was able to easily seize Asoraya.

1274
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:42,833
The villagers at Kung Raga

1275
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:48,416
were the last group
that fought to the death.

1276
02:07:24,375 --> 02:07:26,375
