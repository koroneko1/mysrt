Father Choi seems pretty cool, right?
Very accepting?

3

say I was goin' to hell

and meet a nice boy.

in his hair today.

was a supportive gay ally.

29

should give him some space.

that you have a gay son?

He's actually the reason
we came to the church.

We wanted a place where
he would feel welcome.

Well, you've found it.

Our son, Nick, is gay, too,
