1
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,458
Yes, I did it.

2
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,583
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

3
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,000
You're always like this, Nok.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,708
I don't understand
how you can't feel anything.

5
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,916
I want to know how you feel.

6
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,458
We're getting married, Nok.

7
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,708
You can talk to me.

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,708
Okay. If that's what you want.

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,583
Thana! Watch out!

10
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,958
Hey, did you go jogging this morning?
I thought I saw you.

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Yes.

12
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,958
I like to go running.

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,625
To prepare myself for the big test.

14
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,916
The big test.

15
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,208
You're going to meet that guy today.

16
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,583
Be careful.

17
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,291
All right.

18
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,666
I heard he was talented
but not so friendly.

19
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,000
It's getting worse, Doctor.

20
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,833
This doesn't help.
Blood pressure is not increasing.

21
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,416
BP is dropping to 80/40.

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,916
Doctor, shall we prepare blood
for a transfusion?

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,833
-Prepare for cautery.
-Yes, Doctor.

24
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,000
Blood pressure is decreasing.
The dosage we gave is not sustaining.

25
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,541
I'm aware of that. I'm trying.
Apply suction here, please.

26
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,333
The patient can't take it.
BP is dropping very quickly.

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,708
I know. Can you hold that for me?

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,250
Please step aside.

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,708
Stand over there.

30
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,333
Doctor, allow me to raise the table up.

31
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,791
Great.

32
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,750
Apply suction here.

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,166
How's the bleeding?

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,333
Still heavy.

35
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,250
Apply swab and sponge.

36
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,916
Cut here.

37
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,125
How's the BP?

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,166
BP is much better.

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,791
I think the bleeding is under control.

40
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,000
Check the BP again.

41
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,250
BP is great, 120/70.

42
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,416
Cut please.

43
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,041
You can take it from here.

44
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,083
Can you manage?

45
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,041
Cautery may not always
be a better option than sutures.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,458
You have to check the bleeding.
Whether it's from the vein or the artery.

47
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,083
-Yes.
-These cases are rare but possible.

48
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,583
So you should be prepared.
Think and decide much faster.

49
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,541
Don't just stand around
and wait for a miracle to happen.

50
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,333
I wasn't waiting for a miracle.

51
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,250
I was trying to stop the bleeding,
I thought it was going to stop.

52
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,583
Don't stress yourself out.

53
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,416
You're still a resident.

54
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,625
I'm stressed

55
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,416
because you said
I was waiting for a miracle.

56
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,333
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,000
Why?

58
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,708
What's so bad about a miracle?

59
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,625
Nothing.

60
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,166
But people who wait for miracles,

61
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,791
they have already lost
by believing in them.

62
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,375
You're hardworking.

63
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,333
I'm looking into the last patient's file.

64
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,208
I have to study it carefully,

65
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
so I can succeed in the future.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,833
You've got an attitude.

67
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,541
That's why things
got tense with Dr. Thana.

68
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,916
How did you know about it so soon?

69
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,958
Well, Dr. Panthana

70
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,750
is on the most wanted list
of all the girls in this hospital.

71
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,666
How could I not know?

72
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,541
He's handsome, that's true.

73
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,750
But aren't the girls
afraid of his unfriendliness?

74
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,208
Bee, he's like that

75
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,375
because he's sad.

76
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,791
Sad?

77
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,083
You don't know?

78
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,750
Where have you been?

79
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,708
His case is very famous.

80
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,583
What happened?

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,500
Two years ago...

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,666
Dr. Thana's story is very famous
on the Internet.

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,125
HERE IT IS AGAIN,
A BOUQUET OF WHITE ROSES.

84
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,625
Everybody's been talking
about Dr. White Roses.

85
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,375
Mysterious white roses on the toll way.

86
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,541
I have seen them too for two months now.

87
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,916
They say...

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,541
The flowers are for the dead.

89
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,375
Really? That's scary.

90
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,750
What's the real story?
Can somebody tell us?

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,166
The tale of the roses
that went viral over the Internet.

92
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,416
There was an accident here,
a man and a woman, both are doctors.

93
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,083
They were going to get married

94
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,041
in just a week
before the accident happened.

95
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,875
They drove the car, then boom!
The woman died, but the guy survived.

96
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,958
He must have loved her very much.
He brings her flowers every Sunday night.

97
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,166
Can you give us an interview?

98
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,666
Hold on.

99
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,166
Just a second.

100
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,958
What's with him?

101
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,958
DR. KARN
DR. PANTHANA

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,333
You're interested in this story, right?

103
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,916
There's more to it.

104
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,458
Dr. Thana has remained single ever since.

105
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,125
If he's that handsome and that great,

106
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,083
how come nobody
has offered to heal his wound?

107
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:31,583
There were some,
but he wasn't really interested.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,083
And some of them encountered some mishaps.

109
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,083
Mishaps?

110
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,000
The ghost of Dr. Nok.

111
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,583
They say that

112
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,166
those young nurses

113
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,000
who hit on Dr. Thana
met with some unfortunate events.

114
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
Tenth floor, door opening.

115
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,958
He's cute.

116
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,625
Door closing.

117
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,000
I've been here a long time.
I don't even dare to give him my number.

118
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,625
That's crazy.

119
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,750
Thirteenth floor, door opening.

120
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,833
Why don't you come out?

121
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,666
-Is that true?
-I don't know if it's true or not.

122
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,958
I've never tried to hit on Dr. Thana.

123
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
Or do you want to give it a go?

124
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,750
I'm going.

125
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,166
I'm scared.

126
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,041
-Iced cappuccino, not too sweet.
-Here.

127
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,083
Latte for Dr. Thana.

128
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,583
Americano for Dr. Nok.

129
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,500
I want to say sorry
and thank you for yesterday.

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So do you want to apologize
or thank me first?

131
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,916
Sorry first,

132
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,791
for arguing with you.

133
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,875
And thank you for your help
with the surgery.

134
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,666
Please, sit down.

135
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,750
I guess someone must have told you things.

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,875
What's your opinion, then?

137
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,458
You like to have
two different kinds of coffee.

138
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,000
Nok and I...

139
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,833
Nok and I...

140
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,083
We liked different things.

141
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,166
We would always argue...

142
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
about whose coffee tasted better.

143
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,500
Try my Americano.

144
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,666
No, Nok. I think it's bitter.

145
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,166
Come on, try it.

146
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,166
Bitterness is good.

147
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,208
The latte is not bad.

148
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,041
The level of sweetness is just right.

149
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,083
And your Americano is weirdly bitter.

150
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,125
We drank half of each other's cups.

151
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,333
So I've been drinking
two types of coffee ever since.

152
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,500
It's a clever way to solve an argument.

153
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,166
If it's a clever way,

154
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,958
then you're clever
for answering correctly.

155
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,000
You're the first.

156
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,708
Other people think I order it for Nok.

157
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,250
Somebody needs me.

158
00:14:55,875 --> 00:15:00,541
The two kinds of coffee thing
is a secret I had never told anyone.

159
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,583
I've only told you.

160
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,833
Keep it to yourself.

161
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,375
Let people think whatever they want.

162
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,708
How are you doing?

163
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,250
-Hello.
-Hi.

164
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,916
I don't know, the pain comes and goes.

165
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,291
Let me look at your stomach.

166
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,000
Have you been passing wind?

167
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,375
Farting. She wants to know
if you've been farting.

168
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,375
Here and there. Why?

169
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,750
If you've been passing wind,
then your intestines work fine.

170
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,875
Nothing. Ple told me you were pretty.

171
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:07,083
I didn't believe her at first,
but now I see that it's true.

172
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,750
Thank you.

173
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,666
She's not just pretty,
she's a great surgeon, too.

174
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,416
Dr. Thana has been praising her.

175
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,875
The surgery was performed very well.

176
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,541
It definitely won't leave any scars.

177
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,958
Dr. Bee is pretty.

178
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,791
Dr. Thana is very good-looking.

179
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,208
Is this a hospital or a catwalk?

180
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,666
Hurry up and get well soon.
I'm getting jealous.

181
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,583
But Dr. Thana is not just handsome,
he's also romantic.

182
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
His girlfriend died two years ago.

183
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,625
He's still single.

184
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,958
I want to meet a nice guy like that.

185
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,250
Fine, when you die, I'll do that for you.

186
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,500
How come you know so much about this?

187
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,500
All the nurses
have been gossiping about it.

188
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,000
But his girlfriend must have been
so amazing.

189
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,708
Otherwise, he would be over her already.

190
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,041
Can you be as cool as her?

191
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,000
Asshole!

192
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,875
Dr. Bee.

193
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,708
Don't you want to have a boyfriend?

194
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,541
You're pretty
and Dr. Thana is good-looking.

195
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,750
You would be great together.

196
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,500
Get plenty of rest, okay?

197
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,750
Don't encourage that.
The ghost of Dr. Nok will come for you.

198
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,250
You bastard, don't joke like that!
I'm already scared.

199
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,958
Yes, June?

200
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,208
Don't forget about
the new residents party tonight.

201
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,625
I heard that person will be there too.

202
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,208
Who?

203
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:43,041
Well, the guy
you had coffee with last night.

204
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,791
Right.

205
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,083
Don't forget to come, all right?

206
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,291
-Uncomfortable in high heels?
-Yes.

207
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,583
But I think they look good on you.

208
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,458
Is that your ex?

209
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,000
What are you talking about?
That's your ex.

210
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,458
Not me, it's his ex.

211
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,291
Who is she?

212
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,416
That's Tree,
she's a pharmaceutical representative.

213
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,125
Her parents own a private hospital.

214
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,583
Her family is really rich.

215
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,583
It's good to be Dr. Thana.

216
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,500
The harder he is to get,
the more women want him.

217
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,833
What are you laughing at?

218
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,500
I want to thank that new doctor.

219
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,958
Thanks to her, you gave in to me.

220
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,750
This time, you even brought me back home.

221
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,666
What does she have to do with it?

222
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,541
Come on.

223
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,500
I saw you looking at her.

224
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,416
I was thinking about the time
when Nok and I were new residents.

225
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,791
I miss Nok.

226
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,666
It's so convenient to be a guy.

227
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,916
You miss you one woman,

228
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,708
but you bring another one home.

229
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,208
I'll be back.

230
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,000
So beautiful.

231
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,541
You can stay and watch if you like.

232
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,208
Thana!

233
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,583
Thana!

234
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,333
Thana!

235
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,666
Thana!

236
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,250
Thana!

237
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,958
Thana!

238
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,625
Thana!

239
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,625
Thana!

240
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,333
Did you have a rough night?

241
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,458
Not really.

242
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,166
In the end, it wasn't like
how people think it was.

243
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,791
Only the beginning was unbelievable.

244
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,291
Why is that?

245
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,375
The beginning was very normal.

246
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,500
Women...

247
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,125
They come and go as they please.

248
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,750
And men...

249
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:01,000
They ask you to come when they want you.
If not, they tell you to go away.

250
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,250
She was okay about it and so was I,
so it was fine.

251
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,375
Or did you think...

252
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,708
What did I think?

253
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,083
Dr. Bee.

254
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,291
Do you need to love someone
to have sex with them?

255
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,291
Hi, Bee.

256
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,833
About before...

257
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,500
I want to apologize and thank you.

258
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,708
Apologize for what?

259
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,375
Sorry for...

260
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,125
being rude to you.

261
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,666
I was annoyed with myself.

262
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,875
And what are you thanking me for?

263
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,583
For forgiving me.

264
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,000
I never thought you'd be the type
to say things like this.

265
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,333
Get in, I'll take you home.

266
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,708
That's all right.

267
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,208
Then that means you haven't forgiven me.

268
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:35,750
How about this, I'll take you home
to make up for what I said.

269
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,500
I have to go with you, right?

270
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,208
Get in, we're blocking the road.

271
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,791
Are you hungry?

272
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,875
Let's go eat first.

273
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,583
I'd rather not.

274
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,958
I need to go to this place.

275
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,458
Could you accompany me there?

276
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:13,833
Please?

277
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,916
Thank you.

278
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,166
I thought we were going to eat.

279
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,291
You're only having coffee.

280
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,250
I only meant to come to this place.

281
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,666
Come to this place?

282
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,333
What do you mean?

283
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,375
For the last two years,

284
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,750
I visit this place once a year.

285
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,333
Two years?

286
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,750
Once a year?

287
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,000
This restaurant is very important to me.

288
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,166
You haven't eaten?

289
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,625
I told you not to wait for me.

290
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,083
Today was such a chaotic day.

291
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,083
My cell phone is totally dead.

292
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,291
So what you did was--

293
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,416
I left you a message, of course.

294
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,708
I know how meticulous you are.

295
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,541
There were some problems with the case.

296
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,833
I almost didn't make it out.

297
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:57,208
One of the nurses said that
we're lucky there's a miracle.

298
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,416
So you said--

299
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,375
So I had to lecture her for a bit.

300
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,958
We have knowledge and technology.

301
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,750
We have everything.
Do we have to rely on miracles?

302
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,791
People believe in such things.

303
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,833
I'm sorry, I've been complaining.

304
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,833
Let it all out.

305
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,791
It will then be my turn.

306
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,541
Is something wrong?

307
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,125
Nok.

308
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,416
It's fine if you don't believe me.

309
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,291
But you're my miracle.

310
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,416
This binds us together.

311
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,125
From now on,

312
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,291
wherever you go,

313
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,333
I'll follow you.

314
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,416
When you feel down,

315
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,625
I'll be next to you.

316
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,958
When you're happy,

317
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,583
I'll be in front of you.

318
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,500
But when you feel sad,

319
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,291
I'll be right behind you.

320
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,541
I will do my best to take care of you.

321
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,833
I promise.

322
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,375
Well, it looks like it's not just binding.

323
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,208
We're going to be stuck together.

324
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,416
If you let me go, I'll be so mad at you.

325
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,666
I'll never let you go.

326
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,541
I sat here waiting for Nok,

327
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,208
for three hours...

328
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,541
but I was so happy.

329
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,041
After that day,

330
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,791
I sit here alone at this table.

331
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,291
And this...

332
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,625
has tortured me.

333
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,125
I think...

334
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,666
this is a nice place.

335
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,250
But you might get bored
if you come too often.

336
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,541
It's like the love between you and Nok.

337
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,083
I'm not trying to be intrusive,

338
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:31,833
but from what I've been hearing
from you and other people,

339
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,750
I think Nok wouldn't
want you to stay like this.

340
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,166
You think Nok would want me to forget her?

341
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:50,708
We hold on to the moments
that made us happy, right?

342
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:58,541
If we only try to hold on
to the happy moments,

343
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,958
isn't it harder to let go of the pain?

344
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,166
Thank you for your advice.

345
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:59,000
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please move your car?

346
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,916
It seems that your car wasn't in neutral.

347
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,541
NOK
UNKNOWN NUMBER

348
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,166
Thana, look at it this way,

349
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,833
the later I am,
the more I'll be missing you.

350
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,541
Hold on...

351
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,041
I'll come to you soon.

352
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,000
Thank you for dropping me off at home.

353
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,708
I'm the one who should thank you.

354
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,125
I was holding on to the happy memories.

355
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,291
And that makes it harder to let go.

356
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,833
What if I try to be happy again?

357
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,791
Do I have to prepare myself
for another heartache?

358
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,833
Hello, Mom.

359
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,708
Who was that?

360
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:15,250
And you pretend like
you're watching some Korean series.

361
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,166
Spying on you is much more fun
than any Korean series.

362
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:21,958
He's a colleague.

363
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,625
He's just a colleague for now.

364
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,666
It seems like it's going to stay that way.

365
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,958
Why? Does he already have a girlfriend?

366
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,333
He did.

367
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,041
Are you sure it's in the past?

368
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,000
Either way, it has nothing to do with me.

369
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,666
In any case, just be careful.

370
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,333
I don't want you to be involved
with someone else's boyfriend.

371
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,541
Or you'll be miserable like me.

372
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,958
Oh, Mom.

373
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,666
His girlfriend might
come looking for you at home.

374
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:24,541
Sorry, I know it's late,

375
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,333
but I need this for tomorrow.

376
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,833
No problem. Come by in the morning.

377
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:31,250
-Thank you, sorry for the trouble.
-It's okay.

378
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,000
Thank you for accompanying me.

379
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,458
Thank you for your words of advice.

380
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,291
Thank you, too,
for dropping me off at home.

381
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,791
Sweet dreams.

382
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,541
You too.

383
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,583
Hey!

384
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:47,333
You look exhausted,
did you get enough sleep?

385
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:50,625
Or...

386
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,666
the ghost of Dr. Nok visited you?

387
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,250
Why did you...

388
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:59,083
I'm just kidding.

389
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:03,250
Yesterday, I saw you get in the car
with Dr. Thana, right?

390
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,791
If I were Dr. Nok, I'd be jealous.

391
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,708
That is nonsense, June.

392
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,791
I just accompanied him.

393
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:16,333
It's fine if you two
are going to be more than colleagues.

394
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,583
I'm going.

395
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,541
How are you today?

396
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,125
Not bad.

397
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,541
Where's your boyfriend?

398
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:35,541
He's not here, he's watching
a football match with friends.

399
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,208
Happy birthday.

400
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,166
Thank you.

401
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,916
Let me see your wound.

402
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,583
Even on my birthday!

403
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,958
Men are always like this.

404
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,291
He said the flirting part was his duty.

405
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,583
Now that we're together, it's my duty.

406
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,875
How did Dr. Thana's girlfriend do it?

407
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:17,000
She isn't with him anymore,
but he still loves her.

408
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,666
You're being too serious.
You're still young.

409
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,708
Dr. Bee.

410
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,333
If you and Dr. Thana were together,

411
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,166
what would you do
to make him love only you?

412
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,250
If Dr. Thana liked me
and we were together,

413
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,708
that would mean
he's no longer in love with his ex.

414
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,583
I thought you said
you wanted to meet decent guys.

415
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,500
Well, then, that doesn't count,
she's dead.

416
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,541
Get some rest.

417
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:25,291
Are you sure it's a good idea
for a doctor to smoke?

418
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,500
-Does the smell bother you?
-No, it's fine.

419
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,500
I like the smell of cigarettes.

420
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,500
The smell reminds me of my dad.

421
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,583
Nok didn't like it.

422
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,291
So I had to sneak up here a lot.

423
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,500
But you still brought her along.

424
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,291
What are you listening to?

425
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:07,958
What?

426
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,166
What are you listening to?

427
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:22,250
It's my favorite song
that I always listen to.

428
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:25,750
When I'm tired or discouraged
and I listen to this song,

429
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,458
I feel like...

430
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,583
I have some support.

431
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,250
I like her.

432
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,583
What about you?

433
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,458
Were you dreaming?

434
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,000
Sorry.

435
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,375
Dr. Nok, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

436
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:20,500
What are you two doing?

437
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:27,958
What the hell are you doing?

438
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,250
You scared the shit outta me! So scary!

439
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,458
Happy birthday!

440
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,875
Love you, miss you.

441
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,416
What's wrong, Dr. Bee?

442
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,125
Nang.

443
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:15,250
Dr. Nok? Really?

444
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:17,291
That's very unlikely.

445
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,708
You think I'm seeing things?

446
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,041
No, I didn't mean it like that.

447
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,375
It's just that Dr. Nok
was a really nice person.

448
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,666
Even if she was a ghost,
she wouldn't be a mean one.

449
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,416
I've never seen her myself.

450
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,875
They said that...

451
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,791
she came to haunt those
who flirted with Dr. Thana.

452
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:54,041
I'm not saying that you flirted with him.

453
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,333
But he does flirt with you.

454
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,250
He flirts with me?

455
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:06,125
It's true.

456
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:11,708
Ever since you came to train here,

457
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,833
he seems to be in a better mood.

458
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:15,875
He smiles more often.

459
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,583
I doubt that.

460
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:21,041
A guy like Dr. Thana likes me?

461
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:25,250
But I hope he does.

462
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:31,166
If he really does like you,

463
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,000
will you like him back?

464
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:42,208
I'm not considering
anything more than that.

465
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,666
I just want to help him
get over his grief.

466
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,041
Really?

467
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,583
I saw you standing there awhile,
what have you been doing?

468
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,958
Dr. Nok? Really?

469
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,041
That's very unlikely.

470
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,291
You think I'm seeing things?

471
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,000
No, I didn't mean it like that.

472
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,958
It's just that Dr. Nok
was a really nice person.

473
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,041
Even if she was a ghost,
she wouldn't be a mean one.

474
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,708
They said that...

475
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:29,625
she came to haunt those
who flirted with Dr. Thana.

476
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,750
No. I'm not saying
that you flirt with him.

477
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,333
But he does flirt with you.

478
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,458
Earlier you said that...

479
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,875
Dr. Thana flirts with me.

480
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,541
It's true.

481
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,208
Ever since you came to train here,

482
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,416
he seems to be in a better mood.

483
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,458
He smiles more often.

484
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,500
But I hope he likes you.

485
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,958
If he really does like you,

486
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,666
will you like him back?

487
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,875
I've never thought about that.

488
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,458
Really?

489
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:32,166
Well, you should,
so he could get over his grief.

490
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:53,916
Dr. Thana.

491
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,416
The patient is a Thai woman aged 31.

492
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,916
She was in an accident,
her car crashed into a lamp post.

493
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,458
Her breathing is 30 per BP 70/30.

494
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,416
I think she has pneumothorax.

495
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,625
Give me number 32.

496
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,291
ICD number 32.

497
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,125
Scalpel number 10.

498
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,666
Thana!

499
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,208
Find Dr. Prapon.

500
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:51,750
I think we were lucky
that there wasn't any significant loss.

501
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:57,958
However, this mistake cannot be ignored.

502
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:01,000
So the committee and I,

503
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:06,208
we have agreed that you should refrain
from performing surgery temporarily.

504
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,875
About last night...

505
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,000
Seeing the patient last night

506
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,875
might have reminded him
of the night that Nok died.

507
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,291
The cases are very similar.

508
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,333
The patient was also a woman.

509
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,750
Is that all?

510
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,291
He probably felt guilty.

511
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,708
He felt guilty?

512
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,791
He probably felt guilty about Dr. Nok.

513
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,958
Can you wait for me on the 14th floor?

514
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,916
-I'll see you there.
-Yes, Doctor.

515
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:48,791
-Bee.
-Yes.

516
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:51,000
Did you hear that Thana resigned?

517
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,791
He resigned?

518
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:57,125
Yes. He submitted a resignation
letter, but Dr. Sanchai refused.

519
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,291
He told Thana to reconsider.

520
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:01,958
So where is he now?

521
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,125
I don't know.

522
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,750
If you can find him,

523
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,958
tell him to go talk to Dr. Sanchai
or Dr. Prapon.

524
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,416
-Okay.
-I have to go.

525
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,583
Sunday.

526
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:12,541
THANA

527
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,750
Why did you come here?

528
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,666
I just want you to change your mind
about your resignation.

529
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:59,000
You came to look for me...

530
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:03,166
but you might have been another person
to die because of me.

531
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:04,875
Another?

532
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,416
You think Nok died because of you?

533
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,875
Why?

534
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:21,666
Why do you blame yourself
when it was all an accident?

535
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,083
You know nothing.

536
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,166
You just don't know.

537
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,125
Calm down!

538
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,166
Help is here. Calm down.

539
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,791
Calm down.

540
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:53,500
Do you want to wait for Dr. Suthee?

541
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:54,791
No, I'm okay.

542
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,125
Still no pulse, defib 200 joules.

543
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:03,125
You're going to be okay, Nok.

544
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,625
Nok, I can help you.

545
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,791
Always together. You told me so, Nok.

546
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,458
-Out.
-Doctor.

547
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:25,958
That's enough.

548
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,916
The patient is no longer with us.

549
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,958
Hold the mask, hold it.

550
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,166
No, I can still help her.

551
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:55,875
No, Nok.

552
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,291
Nok, wake up.

553
01:10:58,583 --> 01:10:59,875
What will I do without you?

554
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,041
Doctor, she's gone.

555
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,708
Come back, Nok, come back!

556
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:07,458
Damn it!

557
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,291
You can do it, Nok.
Why aren't you holding the mask?

558
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,458
It's not true. Again.

559
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:16,750
-Doctor.
-It's not true, don't do this.

560
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,416
Always together, Nok.

561
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,500
Always together, Nok.

562
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,583
But in the end,

563
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:00,250
there was no miracle.

564
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,541
People die.

565
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,916
Even though you couldn't save her,

566
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,458
that doesn't mean
any other doctor could have.

567
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,458
You said it yourself.

568
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,000
People die.

569
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,500
Nok is gone.

570
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,416
I said she was dead,

571
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,125
but I didn't say she was gone.

572
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:42,875
She's still here.

573
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,166
Yes.

574
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,958
She's still here...

575
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,625
but only in your heart.

576
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,250
You don't understand.

577
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,541
She really is still here.

578
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,958
Nok donated her body.

579
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:45,000
If she'd lived,
she would be a lecturing doctor.

580
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,833
But even though she's not here,
her body is examined by students.

581
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:54,291
Thana.

582
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,125
I think...

583
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,041
I put that there.

584
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:32,125
I thought Nok wouldn't want me
to take it off.

585
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,583
At first...

586
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:46,958
I thought...

587
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,166
I could help you get over her.

588
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,041
So you can walk away from your past.

589
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,375
But this is more serious than I imagined.

590
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:07,166
Thank you

591
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,333
for trying to help.

592
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,791
You should stop trying, it's no use.

593
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,333
No one can help me.

594
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,791
Nobody can help you,
or you just don't want to be helped?

595
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,000
That's right.

596
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:32,833
Your forever love.

597
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:36,791
It's so great that you need no help.

598
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,000
As for me...

599
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:48,458
it doesn't matter.

600
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,458
I can't help myself either.

601
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,541
You know that I like you, right?

602
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,208
And you?

603
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,333
There is only you and me
in this room, Thana.

604
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,750
Help me, please.

605
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,500
Help me, please.

606
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,041
You were sleeping,
so I didn't want to wake you.

607
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:21,083
The new clothes are for you.
And please lock the house. 

608
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:31,750
Nok.

609
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:36,458
Nok, I know that you love me.

610
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,625
But please let me go.

611
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,250
I'm sorry, Nok.

612
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm sorry.

613
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,041
You seem to be in a good mood today.

614
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,958
You think so?

615
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:24,000
You're the second female surgeon
who hums while operating.

616
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:27,541
Who is the first one?

617
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:29,416
Dr. Nok.

618
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:36,458
But Dr. Nok, she could only hum one song.

619
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,666
Which song?

620
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,416
I'll look for it.

621
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,375
Because she always listened to it.

622
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:53,333
Dr. Thana used to sing the song for her
in front of other people, too.

623
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,416
You think Nok wants me to forget her?

624
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,875
If we only try to hold on
to the happy moments,

625
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,708
isn't it harder to let go of the pain?

626
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:54,125
But Nok didn't like it.

627
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,666
So I had to sneak up here a lot.

628
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,500
But you still brought her along.

629
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,833
You don't understand.

630
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,250
She's still here.

631
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,666
She's still here,

632
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,541
but only in your heart.

633
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:08,916
You should stop trying, it's no use.

634
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:10,458
No one can help me.

635
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:13,500
Nobody can help you,
or you just don't want to be helped?

636
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,541
I have feelings for her.

637
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:38,375
But it's not the same thing
that I feel for you.

638
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:40,875
What should I do?

639
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:48,750
What should I tell her?

640
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:06,916
You already know.

641
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:11,166
I will never leave you.

642
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:23,416
The number you are calling
is not available.

643

01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,458
Please try again later.

646
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:48,083
The number you have dialed
is not available at this time.

647
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,916
SEAMSTRESS FOR HIRE

648
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:54,416
The number you are calling
is not available.

649
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,791
Please try again later.

650
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:05,833
What is it, Mom?

651
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:07,458
A woman called.

652
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:12,000
She told me to warn you
to stop fooling around with her husband.

653
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,875
-Who--
-Why didn't you listen to me?

654
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:24,250
Did she tell you her name?

655
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,333
She said her name was Nok.

656
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,416
Thana.

657
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,416
Thana.

658
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:55,541
Thana.

659
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:00,791
Thana.

660
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,041
Thana.

661
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:16,250
Nok.

662
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,375
Is this you?

663
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,541
Yes, it's me.

664
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,166
That's all I wanted to know.

665
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:29,125
I didn't think she would do that.

666
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,708
It's not what she did.

667
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,083
Yes, I did it.

668
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,708
And do you want to know why I did it?

669
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:48,041
I don't want to talk about this.

670
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:49,791
You're always like this, Nok.

671
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,125
We have to talk about it.

672
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:54,250
We're about to get married.

673
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:01,583
You don't understand.

674
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,666
Yeah, I don't understand.

675
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,541
I don't understand
how you can't feel anything.

676
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,583
You think I'm tired of you.

677
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,708
Or I love you less?

678
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:29,916
All right, if you want to hear it.

679
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,541
Our love has never changed.

680
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,541
I believe that even
though you slept with her,

681
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:44,708
you still love me just the same.

682
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:48,916
But what's changing is...

683
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,291
Thana, watch out!

684
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:05,416
How are you?

685
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,375
How did I get here?

686
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,083
You passed out in the car.

687
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:23,208
Last night...

688
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:26,958
Dr. Nok, right?

689
01:33:31,291 --> 01:33:32,875
I saw that photo.

690
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:34,541
What photo?

691
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,625
Yes.

692
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,875
I was wrong. I cheated on her.

693
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,791
She was still mad at me, so she did this.

694
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:01,625
Why do you think so?

695
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:10,250
At first, I thought
Nok would have accepted you.

696
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:14,000
Because you and her are alike somehow...

697
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,833
but she refused to give in.

698
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,166
She didn't want me to start over
with someone else.

699
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:31,208
That's all you cared about?

700
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,333
You slept with me...

701
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,875
because I'm similar to Nok, right?

702
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:46,625
You should go home.

703
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:57,416
Well, here we go again.

704
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,083
Please, come in.

705
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,333
You go first.

706
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,166
What is it?

707
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:24,208
You're so evil.

708
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:31,166
Did you know this picture
made them argue and led to the accident?

709
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:35,375
Let me tell you something.

710
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,041
Do you know why men cheat?

711
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:42,625
Because sometimes,
they get bored of good girls,

712
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:45,458
well-mannered like princesses.

713
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:50,208
So if there is a hero and a princess,
there must be a villain.

714
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:52,958
You should thank me, instead,

715
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:57,166
for helping to prove
the true love between Thana and Nok.

716
01:36:58,458 --> 01:36:59,500
Just like you.

717
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:03,875
How?

718
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,625
You've already slept with him, right?

719
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:16,875
Normally, when people fight
over something,

720
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:20,583
they always bring out their good sides
to bluff other people.

721
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,791
Some are good at understanding.

722
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,333
Some are good at caring.

723
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:29,583
And some are good in bed.

724
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:36,458
If fighting over something is so bad,
then we three are bad people.

725
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:40,250
As for Nok,

726
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:44,333
when she knew that Thana cheated on her,
she took the easy way out and died.

727
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:47,250
So Thana's heart will forever be with her.

728
01:37:48,416 --> 01:37:49,500
That was so bad.

729
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:52,458
Nok was not like that.

730
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:55,458
Oh, God!

731
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,291
You're so naive.

732
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:02,083
Or you're just pretending to be...

733
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:08,666
I know you're listening to us.

734
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:12,875
You're probably laughing at us
for fighting over something we can't have.

735
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:16,541
What?

736
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,875
You think I'm crazy?

737
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:22,500
Don't tell me you haven't seen
the ghost of Nok?

738
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,791
There. I told you.

739
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,291
She is so possessive.

740
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,625
One more thing...

741
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,791
ghosts can't make phone calls.

742
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,458
The person who called your mom

743
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:57,291
was me.

744
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:03,000
Consider it as my welcome present.

745
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:07,750
My mom has nothing to do with this.

746
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:28,708
THANA

747
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:39,083
The number you are calling
is not available.

748
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:54,791
You still remember where my place is.

749
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,750
I thought you had forgotten about it.

750
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:04,708
You're in such a rush.

751
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:08,000
Finally,

752
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,708
you've come back to your done deal.

753
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:13,875
A done deal is great.

754
01:40:14,666 --> 01:40:16,250
There's no fuss.

755
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:18,375
There's no running away.

756
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:22,833
Nok!

757
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:29,958
You!

758
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:33,291
I didn't do it!

759
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,916
It was an accident.

760
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,250
Don't make me feel guilty!

761
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:42,041
It wasn't my fault!

762
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:45,000
Don't come any closer!

763
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:46,875
I didn't know! I didn't do it!

764
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,666
It was an accident!

765
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:51,250
It's not my fault!

766
01:41:34,958 --> 01:41:36,250
I've always thought

767
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:39,708
that the love between you and Thana

768
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:43,833
is such a beautiful thing.

769
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:46,250
But in reality,

770
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:49,125
love is terrible, isn't it?

771
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,416
No matter how good we are...

772
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,958
in the end,

773
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,583
we have to be evil when someone tries
to take something that we love.

774
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,875
Then, go ahead...

775
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,958
I'm right here right now.

776
01:42:20,916 --> 01:42:22,541
Do what you have to do.

777
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:26,708
If you think I'm taking Thana
away from you...

778
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:30,750
do it, Dr. Nok.

779
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:38,333
LABORATORY - ANATOMY

780
01:45:56,458 --> 01:45:58,625
-Her BP is dropping.
-Give her adrenaline.

781
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:07,458
Her BP is dropping.

782
01:46:19,208 --> 01:46:20,458
This binds us together.

783
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:25,541
Wherever you go,

784
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,583
I will follow you.

785
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,875
Her BP's not going up, load the IV.

786
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,291
Load the IV.

787
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,000
We need to give her a defib,
get the defib ready.

788
01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:54,333
Where's Dr. Varaporn?

789
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,625
Calm down.

790
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:13,166
Everything is going to be okay.

791
01:47:14,625 --> 01:47:17,458
Many things are not what they seem to be,

792
01:47:17,541 --> 01:47:18,791
Doctor.

793
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,541
You're thinking about Nok, aren't you?

794
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:16,291
I'm thinking about you, too.

795
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:20,250
Nok.

796
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:24,791
I miss you.

797
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,166
I'm on my way to be with you.

798
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:38,916
Like I said...

799
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,250
Wherever you go,

800
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:47,541
I'll follow you.

801
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,708
I know.

802
01:48:53,208 --> 01:48:55,541
-We're bound together.
-We're bound together.

803
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,791
Wherever you go,

804
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:59,375
-I'll follow you.
-I'll follow you.

805
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:02,291
When you're happy,

806
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:05,708
I'll be in front of you.

807
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:08,625
When you're down,

808
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:11,208
I'll be next to you.

809
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:14,875
When you're sad,

810
01:49:16,791 --> 01:49:18,166
I'll be right behind you.

811
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:19,875
Yes.

812
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:25,458
But you can't come with me.

813
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:30,166
I have to go.

814
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:34,833
But you have to live on.

815
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:43,541
I want you to live on with this woman.

816
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,083
Or anyone.

817
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,333
As long as you are happy.

818
01:49:55,208 --> 01:49:56,750
But why...

819
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:00,958
Why are you still around me?

820
01:50:03,916 --> 01:50:06,083
You're still close to me

821
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:07,625
all the time.

822
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,791
Think carefully about it, Thana.

823
01:50:19,833 --> 01:50:21,208
Why...

824
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:23,750
Why I'm still around you.

825
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:28,083
Why I'm still lingering,

826
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:29,333
never leaving.

827
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:41,583
Nok, no.

828
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:46,333
Nok, don't go.

829
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,125
Come back, Nok.

830
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:51,375
Come back, Nok.
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

831
01:51:04,416 --> 01:51:06,666
We drank half of each other's cup.

832
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:10,916
So I've been drinking
two types of coffee ever since.

833
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:17,500
For the last two years,

834
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:20,541
I visit this place once a year.

835
01:51:25,333 --> 01:51:26,541
Now this binds us together.

836
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:30,125
Wherever you go,

837
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:31,500
I'll follow.

838
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:37,291
It looks like it's not just binding.
We're going to be stuck together.

839
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:47,583
Because of me?

840
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:51,416
Because of you.

841
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,833
You miss me.

842
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:00,958
You won't let go.

843
01:52:22,708 --> 01:52:24,333
I've been trying to tell you,

844
01:52:25,375 --> 01:52:27,083
but you just can't see it.

845
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:30,875
You can't feel it.

846
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:47,625
I'm sorry.

847
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:54,833
I'm sorry.

848
01:52:56,041 --> 01:52:57,750
You don't have to be sorry,

849
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,500
you did your best.

850
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:04,000
You took the greatest care of me.

851
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:07,791
I never thought

852
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:11,125
that the love I have for you...

853
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,708
had caused you pain.

854
01:53:15,708 --> 01:53:17,208
Love makes us happy.

855
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,083
But we suffer because we miss each other.

856
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:24,208
We love each other just the same.

857
01:53:24,416 --> 01:53:26,083
But we won't miss each other just as much.

858
01:53:26,791 --> 01:53:29,041
We'll care for each other less.

859
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:40,666
I love you.

860
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,958
We did everything we could.

861
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,291
It's up to him now
when he will regain consciousness.

862
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,708
Don't give up hope.

863
01:55:38,916 --> 01:55:40,125
Thana.

864
01:55:46,541 --> 01:55:47,625
I think...

865
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:50,166
You have to choose.

866
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:53,708
Which one of us do you want to make happy?

867
01:55:57,583 --> 01:55:58,583
Nok?

868
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:05,416
Or me?

869
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:11,583
If you don't wake up...

870
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:17,000
then Nok will be very happy.

871
01:56:21,666 --> 01:56:22,583
But...

872
01:56:28,541 --> 01:56:30,000
I will miss you.

873
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:41,291
I can never let you go.

874
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:48,916
It's true that...

875
01:56:51,791 --> 01:56:55,750
I once told you
that I would step aside...

876
01:57:02,875 --> 01:57:04,333
if you were alive.

877
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:09,916
But right now,

878
01:57:10,958 --> 01:57:12,458
I'll never give up.

879
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:21,166
Wake up, Thana.

880
01:57:24,041 --> 01:57:25,333
Wake up and be with me.

881
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:29,458
You have to wake up.

882
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,291
Because I...

883
01:57:35,625 --> 01:57:37,375
can never lose you to someone else.

884
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:35,791
I can no longer take it.

885
01:58:36,458 --> 01:58:41,083
I'm not letting you go.
You have to stay with me for a long time.

886
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:53,541
-How is he, Doctor?
-The patient is not likely to make it.

887
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:56,416
So, please, be prepared for the worst.

888
01:58:58,416 --> 01:59:00,041
You have to help our father!

889
01:59:00,125 --> 01:59:01,625
Don't let him die.

890
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:03,583
You have to help him, Doctor.

891
01:59:03,666 --> 01:59:05,708
We did our best.

892
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:08,958
Please, help.

893
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:22,125
You're going to be all right.

894
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:23,458
Please, stay with me.

895
01:59:24,333 --> 01:59:25,958
I'll be with you always.

896
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:09,875
