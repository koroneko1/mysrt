00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.420
Where are you from that you come here for the violence suddenly?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.900
You owe the money without giving back and you can still shout it out&gt;

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.940
I will pay all the left part after acting

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.180
You are too brave not like your appearance

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.860
They are the people who make the event first

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.020
But what's exciting of hitting together?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.020
We need to do that, therefore they won't slight our troupe

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.700
Hello boy...

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.220
What a truly cold cinema?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.250
The chairs are small, too.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.020
If I had known about this, I would have bought a couple chair.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.900
Hey, if you want, buy it yourself

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.500
Having money for watch but not for eating?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.060

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.740
But... This is your dating?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.460
Dating with the loneliness!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.020
Leave me alone.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.260
I date with the air, ok?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020
Honey, wanna eat?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.980
No? So I will eat

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.700

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.580
Come in, Dung... Be yourself like you are at home.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.420
Your home... is too neat!

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.220
I have got the careful illness. Come in.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.420

Please help me type the test marks

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.980
I'm busy these days, I haven't done it yet.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.060
But remember not to mistake this class in another class...

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.500
I will be dead then | Yes yes

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.060
Like... there are something on my face?

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.420
Ah, uh... Not at all

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.100
I got it

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.020
Quickly and then back to home

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.420
Fighting

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.180

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.180
A middle size of "lack coffee", please

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.050
Do you wanna get traditional coffee or "get high" one?

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.300
Uh... the second type's also ok!

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.140
Welcome to Amix Coffee!

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.140
Oops... You are the one who stayed in the cinema with us?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.380
You seem so familiar!

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.780
Seem like you are in music club, right?

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.260
Sorry, I'm late!

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.100
Dang!

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.180
Dang, what happened?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.940
Or you don't like this shop? We can go to another!

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.780
I feel not really fine, I'm back first!

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.260
Dang!

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.140
It's also a chance for me to look at his body

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.420
Except some bad traits, he's still truly handsome

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.180
The body is too nice

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.980
You are willing to find it and leave me away?

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.420
Last time, I said that was to hold you here

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.540
I want you to be my Osin forever!

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.940
It's not finding out the ring

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.860
What do you mean?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.140
I found out the ring when I realized I had falled in love with you

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.460
Intially, this ring was not yours,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.660
But the destiny makes it be yours!

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.580
Do you wanna wear it again?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.940
I thought you were a stra... | Whatever I am, it's not important!

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.540
The importance is...

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.100
I wanna be with you!

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.340
My god, my god!

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.060
I see you're very addicted by this!

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.780
You have read the BL novels, and now move to watch the movies!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.500
Madam... do you know?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.180
This "The lost ring" film is too nice!

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.060
How is nice you mean?

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.420
You always like that when you see a handsome boy?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.540
You see, this main boy couple...

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.480
they are so cute, and truly handsome like our oppa Dang!

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.220
Hey!

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.140
You love BL is you bussiness!

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.500
Don't be bullshit like that, Dang has got a girlfriend already!

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.500
Rubbish!

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.220
Everyone think that they're straight until they find out a gentleman of their life!

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.860
You're always good at being bullshit!

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.700
Let's clean the kitchen hurry up and come back home!

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.500
Or you wanna be here til night?

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.300
Please let me ask you this

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.620
If Dang brother likes a boy, what will you think?

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.900
I ask for fun only, please don't mind at this!

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.340
Dang... If he likes a boy...

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.260
Or a girl

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.780
I will always accept all...

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.940
Because finally

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.620
Being parents, we all want our child to be happy!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.340
As long as he feels happy

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.100
If only everyone could think like you, the life will very happy

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.940
It's too far from now, think about it later

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.420
And now go to clean the kitchen, then back to your home quickly

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.140
I have cooked sweet soup, take it to your home!

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.060
Thank you...
