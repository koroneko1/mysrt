1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,183
[Michael] Hey, FloJo,
can you slow down a second?

2
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:23,314
You know, this could be why I'm one of
Manhattan Magazine's 50 most eligible men,

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,066
and you're not.

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,111
It's amazing how many times that comes up
in a mile and a half.

5
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,323
Are you coming to the event tonight?
I'm not the only homo on the list.

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,993
You could snag
an eligible single of your own.

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,619
Is Stanley gonna be there?

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,163
No.

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,832
[sighs] It's Friday.

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,002
He's got his table for one somewhere.
Remember?

11
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,339
PS, if I ever start taking myself out
to hot new restaurants on Friday nights

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,134
and posting pics of my lonely Negroni,

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,219
please reintroduce me to my dick.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,179
Hah. Deal.

15
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,431
-And, just asking…
-[sighs]

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,642
…when is this teen girl nonsense
between you two going to end?

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,271
What? It's not nonsense.
He fucking betrayed me.

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,274
W-- Would you have gone
to a dinner party at Colin's

19
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,193
the week after he kicked me to the curb?

20
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,110
-No!
-Well--

21
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,738
But only partly out of loyalty to you.

22
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,032
Your boy was a little dull.

23
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,576
-Bam!
-Seriously? You always thought that?

24
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,786
Oh no. We are not doing that.

25
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,370
-Just make sure you come tonight.
-Wha--

26
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,165
I'll try. I've got a busy workday
and lunch with my mom.

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
I'm gonna finally tell her
that Colin left.

28
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,752
-Oh, damn.
-[sighs]

29
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,378
Doesn't she love Colin?

30
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,673
Yeah, for his looks and his money.
She's deep that way.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,885
Hundred bucks says
she was at that dinner party.

32
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,345
[sighs heavily]

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,639
[whimpers] Wait, wait, wait…

34
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,476
[theme music playing]

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,944
[music ends]

36
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,738
Whew! That salad was overrated, right?

37
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,781
Eh…

38
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:59,786
It's crazy. The Times gushes,
like the chef reinvented the Nicoise,

39
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,289
everybody trips over themselves
to go try it, and then it's like,

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,461
"It was fine! It's a tuna salad.
People, take a chill pill."

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,840
"Chill pill?" Mom, don't say chill pill.
That's not okay.

42
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:17,554
[sighs] Chillax, honey. I didn't mean
to offend your super hip ears.

43
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,181
What is going on with you?

44
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,310
All day, you've either been monosyllabic
or kind of a bitch.

45
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,646
Did I do something?

46
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,565
No, I'm sorry. It's not you. I just…

47
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,985
I have something big to tell you,
and it's harder than I thought.

48
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,947
Colin left.

49
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,407
Left where?

50
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,449
Left me.

51
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,784
He walked out,

52
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,620
took all his shit,
and dumped me in a text.

53
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,123
No. No, this can't be.

54
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,001
No, you seemed so in love
at the birthday party.

55
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,294
What did you do?

56
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,879
Did you cheat?

57
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,338
Uh-- Of course not!

58
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,632
This makes no sense! Think back.

59
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,635
Did you do something to push him away?

60
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,805
No. Jesus, believe me, I keep
asking myself the same question,

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,349
but it'd be nice if it wasn't
the first thing my mother went to.

62
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,350
-[screams]
-My--

63
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,978
-[crashing]
-Okay, Mom, you don't have to get hyster--

64
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,981
-Michael! Down here!
-Mom?

65
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh my God. Are you okay?

66
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,484
I'm alive!

67
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,322
But I'm very disappointed in you!

68
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,115
I…

69
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,825
[sighs]

70
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:28,041
-The hospital just sent her home?
-Yeah. She's banged up, but she's okay.

71
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,335
Dad's there.
I'll check in on her a bit later.

72
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:35,173
The kitchen has a breakfast nook
and a walk-in pantry, so…

73
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,551
-Oh!
-[elevator bell dings]

74
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,636
[laughs] Oh my God.

75
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,054
She's back early.

76
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,974
Careful. You scuff a wall,
you're telling Claire.

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,477
I'd like to keep my balls,
thank you very much.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,312
Stanley! Wow!

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,899
-Nice surprise.
-Yes, for all of us, huh?

80
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,068
Hello, Michael.

81
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,486
Hi.

82
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,949
[sighs] Claire bought a piece
at the Sayre Gomez show,

83
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,368
and I wanted
to supervise the installation.

84
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,204
Whatever you need to do.

85
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,497
[sighs]

86
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,833
He's just hurting, you know.

87
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,628
I do, but come on, we're almost 50.

88
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,673
Girl, didn't I go to your 50th,
like, two years ago?

89
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
Shut up, Suzanne. Everybody shaves.

90
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,804
I'd like to get a peek
at your driver's license sometime.

91
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,097
Ooh!

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,431
-[Stanley chuckles]
-Ooh!

93
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,562
[scoffs]

94
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,734
[sighs]

95
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,406
Okay, we've been friends for 20 years.

96
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,283
I know you're going through a lot,

97
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
but are we seriously
not even going to talk?

98
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,452
Yes.

99
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,622
When you betray people,
they often don't wanna talk to you.

100
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,040
Okay, come on.

101
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,251
"Betray" is a pretty dramatic word.

102
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,837
-Can you even let me ex--
-Ah-- I'm in the middle of a showing.

103
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,428
[sniffing]

104
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,055
It's super perfume-y in here.

105
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm so sorry.

106
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,353
No, no. it's great. I'll call you back.

107
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,063
[gasps] We just got an offer.

108
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,148
-Really?
-Yes!

109
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,816
-From who? Whom? Wait.
-[laughs]

110
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,569
It doesn't matter!
Someone from last week's open house.

111
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,739
It's a smidge under asking,
but I bet we can get Claire on board.

112
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,741
-You think? Oh my God.
-Yes!

113
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,701
-I need this. I'm so excited!
-[laughing]

114
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
-Me too! I'm all tingly down there.
-Oh-ho!

115
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,169
You see that text?
She says she's coming up the block.

116
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,379
-Oh God, I hope she takes this offer.
-Yeah.

117
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,591
Second notice on the liquor bill
for Colin's party.

118
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,635
Based on this, everyone there
should've died of alcohol poisoning.

119
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,637
He should really
help you out with that.

120
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
Tell him you need some cash.

121
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,224
Oh, believe me, I'd love to,

122
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,644
but how could I ask him for money
without sounding like a pathetic loser?

123
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,647
Like this. "Bitch, you wanna leave?
The price is half your shit."

124
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,316
[both laugh]

125
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,276
-Hey.
-God!

126
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,613
Why are you jumping up at me like that
the second I walk in the door?

127
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,532
It gives me flashbacks
to when I had to raise my children.

128
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:13,081
[laughs] Sorry. We're just all worked up
because we got a great offer.

129
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,457
-Oh!
-[laughs]

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,292
-It's a bit under asking, but--
-No.

131
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,794
No?

132
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,296
I am not taking less than asking

133
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,009
just so my cradle-robbing ex-husband
can jump-start his bloated new life.

134
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,553
Yes, he's fatter now.

135
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,681
Who knew that he could shack up
with his Pilates instructor

136
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,683
and somehow end up
with an even bigger ass?

137
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,976
-But--
-Me. I knew.

138
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,770
Listen. [chuckles]

139
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:41,234
I hear you, but we've had dozens
of showings, and this is the only bite.

140
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,946
And our asking price
might actually be a little high

141
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,198
for the comps in this neighborhood.

142
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,367
That is all gobbledygook to me.

143
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,827
[sighs]

144
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,873
There have been a lot of showings, Claire,
and this is the only offer we've gotten.

145
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,876
A comp in the building
did sell at this price.

146
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,130
Okay. I get what you're saying.

147
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,841
But I don't want
to upend my whole life here

148
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,718
when the right buyer may come along later.

149
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,179
I mean, I have time.

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,014
Where am I even going?

151
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,226
Actually, um… you have a good point.

152
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,812
Is it possible
you might be holding on to your old life

153
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,022
because it's hard to picture a new one?

154
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,276
What if we showed you some apartments

155
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:29,073
and gave you an idea of how great
your life would be once this is all over?

156
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,784
It could help you let go emotionally.

157
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,079
Do we have this kind of relationship?

158
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,205
[Michael] I get it, though.

159
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,791
Like, with Colin,
when I think ahead to Christmas,

160
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,252
I dread doing it without him.

161
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,381
But then I remember Colin only
let us have white lights on our tree.

162
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,218
So this year,
I am doing colors, which I like.

163
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,098
Point being, when I let myself
imagine a fun life without him,

164
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,559
I do feel better.

165
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,645
Yeah, that makes sense.

166
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,358
Okay, so I say
we give you a fresh new start.

167
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,862
Somewhere totally different
with no bad memories.

168
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,781
What about downtown?

169
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,202
Downtown is for restaurants.
Not for living.

170
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,622
Come on, Claire, change it up.

171
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:24,629
I could totally see you in a sexy loft,
downtown, living your best life.

172
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,714
And wouldn't it be nice
to walk to the corner

173
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:31,177
and not be reminded of places you went
with your morbidly obese ex-husband?

174
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,929
[laughs]

175
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,181
You do make it sound fun.

176
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,684
You know, there's a place
I think you will love.

177
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,063
And I bet we could get in this afternoon.

178
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,064
Oh.

179
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,150
Yes. I think I can make that work.
I'm free at 5:00.

180
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,652
Great. [laughs]

181
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,320
-Let's order.
-Yes.

182
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,031
Oh, I'm not eating here.
The food is terrible.

183
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,493
[upbeat jazzy music playing]

184
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,791
Hey, it's me!

185
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,209
[Mom] In my room, honey!

186
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,919
[Dad] What, Mike?

187
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,130
-Uh, stop in the kitchen first!
-Uh, I wanna check in on Mom.

188
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,633
Uh, no, wait. Mike. Mikey!

189
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,681
I, uh, think your dad
was trying to warn you that I'm here.

190
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,725
-Makes sense. Hi.
-Hi.

191
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,852
Uh… Sorry, Colin.

192
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,439
It's just that we only learned today
what's going on with you two.

193
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,695
So, Mom, did you tell Colin that you fell
so that he would come over?

194
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,281
No, he came over on his own, thank you.

195
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,783
I'm still on the family text thread.
I read it there.

196
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,203
And saw a pretty appetizing picture
of your lunch salads.

197
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,871
Oh, they were fine.

198
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,249
I just wanted to make sure
that your mom was okay.

199
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,003
Which I really appreciate.
Such a lovely gesture, coming over here.

200
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,588
[Mom sighs]

201
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,508
FYI, you know,
Ben and I took some time off once

202
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,302
when he was sleeping with his secretary.

203
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,304
-I was not--
-Mom.

204
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,932
Please stop saying that.
I just wanted space.

205
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,143
Yes, space between another woman's legs.

206
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,062
It's fine. We're fine now!

207
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,441
I mean, these things happen,
and you never think about them again.

208
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,109
What--

209
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,694
All right. Well, I should go.

210
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,653
Um…

211
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,405
I'm glad you're feeling okay, Lisa.

212
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,620
-Nice to see you, Michael.
-Yeah, you too. Maybe.

213
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,579
I'm not sure yet.

214
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,456
-Don't be a stranger.
-See you soon!

215
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,083
"You too, maybe?" What is wrong with you?

216
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,961
-I don't--
-Clearly, he still cares about you.

217
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,548
-Go after him, fix this!
-He never even told me why he left.

218
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,343
You're not gonna find out in here,
knucklehead. Go!

219
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,180
Colin? Hey. Hey!

220
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,598
I just, um… Hi.

221
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,143
I just wanted to, uh, say sorry
for the dumb goodbye.

222
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,102
-It's, uh--
-[exhales]

223
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,813
-I still don't know how to act yet.
-I get it. Me either.

224
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,316
Oh. That's weirdly comforting. [chuckles]

225
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,402
Thanks for checking in on Mom.
That was sweet of you.

226
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,447
Oh, of course.
I spent 17 years with your family.

227
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,033
I care about them. That won't change.

228
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,911
I won't forget one of the five women
who've seen me naked.

229
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,496
-Oh my God.
-[laughs]

230
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,333
In that creepy house
that my sister rented on the Jersey Shore.

231
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,168
I get shivers thinking about your mother

232
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,212
accidentally walking in on me
in the shower.

233
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,131
Accidentally, my ass!
She knew you were in there.

234
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,675
[both laugh]

235
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,470
So how's work? I hear
the market's pretty strong these days.

236
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,429
Yeah, sure.

237
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:21,972
Kinda.

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
Kinda?

239
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,267
You need anything?

240
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,020
Um…

241
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,607
No, I'm good.

242
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,068
I think I have a big sale comin' up, so…

243
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,987
Oh, that's great. I'm not worried.
You're the best.

244
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:37,988
[chuckles]

245
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,409
All right, I really gotta go.

246
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,912
Dog's been locked away for hours now.

247
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,288
Do-- dog?

248
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,999
You're joking. You got a dog?

249
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,002
Can we please end
on the nice moment we just had?

250
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,716
Uh, if you want a nice moment,
don't tell me that you just got a dog

251
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,554
when I always wanted us to have a dog,
and you said you never ever wanted a dog.

252
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,975
Did you get an Eames lounge chair now too,
or is that still a tired gay cliché?

253
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,934
What about cilantro?

254
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,644
-Suddenly delicious?
-No matter what I say,

255
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,187
you always have the biggest feelings.

256
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,858
Was that it? My feelings were too big?
I still don't know what happened with us.

257
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,526
-I'm not doing this now.
-You're not--

00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,278
-And I'm not gonna be yelled at.
-Wh--

[loudly] I'm not yelling! I'm confused!

This is my very confused voice!

261
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,455
[yells] And the Eames chair is a classic!

262
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,756
-Hey, sorry to be so late.
-[sighs] It's cool. Claire's upstairs.

for some time alone in the loft.

or she's poopin'. [chuckles]

What's wrong?
You love a snooty lady pooping joke.

He got a dog.

-What? After you--
-Yeah.

268

-And he kept sayin'--
-Uh-huh.

269
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,690
Oh, I'm officially out of the fan club.

270
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,402
I don't hate it.
Can't argue with the views.

271
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,989
It has a sexy feel that I would have loved
when I was young and gorgeous.

-Stop. You're gorgeous.
-You're gorgeous.

310
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,418
Meaning?

311
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,003
[laughs]

312
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:44,550
Kai's dad is one of three men
that I had no idea how to find in 1997.

313
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,428
My God!

314
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,890
Your life is that horrendous ABBA movie.

315
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,142
Except my life has Black people in it.

316
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,769
-Oh!
-[laughs]

317
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,229
-[chuckles]
-You got it.

318
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,106
That's much better. Thank you!

319

[Billy laughing]

320
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,526
-Hey!
-Oh, hey!

321
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,236
-Hey!
-[chuckles]

322
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
Yo, my people, this is Michael.

323
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,823
-Hey.
-Hi, hi.

324
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,533
My best friend of many years.

325
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,954
He's newly eligible himself,
and any of you would be lucky to have him.

326
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,331
Trust me. I've had him.

327
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,750
Years ago, when we were children.

328
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,501
Like everyone Billy dates now.

329
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,254
-Ah!
-You didn't tell me he was cute and funny.

330
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,634
Oh! Dive right in, okay.
Michael, this is Alex.

331
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,677
He's on the eligible men's list too.

332
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,971
Oh, cool. Congratulations.

333
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:35,267
Alex has a big podcast
about climate change from an LGBTQ angle.

334
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,853
It's called Emissions Control. [chuckles]

335
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,688
How funny is that?

336
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,649
Ah, yeah, that is funny.

337
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,234
So why are you newly eligible?

338
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,820
My partner dumped me on his 50th birthday

339
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,406
at a surprise party I'm still paying off.

340
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,908
Damn. Are you serious?

341
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,952
Sorry for eavesdropping.
That sounds rough.

342
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,372
It was. But we don't wanna
talk about that right now, do we?

343
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,165
I ran into him today, by the way,

344
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,919
and, um, found out
that he bought himself a dog.

345
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,337
-Oh.
-Can you fucking believe that?

346
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,547
I always wanted a dog, but he refused.

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,801
Now that he's single, he is all about
rushing home to walk a stupid dog.

348
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,469
-Jesus.
-That's so cold.

349
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,596
[sighs] We're really doing this?

350
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,264
You know,

351
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,979
Pierce Brosnan once hit on me
in the first-class lounge at Heathrow.

352
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,815
But I've been faithful
for some goddamn reason.

353
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,900
Oh, you shoulda hit that.

354
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,860
Trust me, I pictured it more than once

355
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,322
while Jabba the Husband
was squirming around on top of me.

356
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,699
[laughing] Oh my God!

357
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,075

359
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,664
-This is fun.
-Mm! This is fun.

360
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,082
You're fun.

361
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,293
I have to say,
I thought you didn't like me.

362
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,257
No. I'm just chilly
with people who work for me.

363
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,093
-Ah.
-And also with family and friends.

364
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,683
And Stanley kept the whole dinner party
a secret, which is such a huge betrayal!

365
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,394
-Huge!
-Sorry, that's awful.

366
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,188
Thank you. It means a lot
that you guys get it.

367
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah, of course.

368
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,234
But don't worry, you're cute.
You have a good job. You'll do fine.

369
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,610
You know what you need?

370
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,946
To get out of your head
and into your body,

371
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,450
possibly with a not crazy,
STD-free couple on PrEP.

372
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,327
Did you say couple?

373
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,872
I thought you were an eligible man.

374
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,666
No, no, Luis and I
have been together for years.

375
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,918
But single's better for the brand.

376
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,379
He doesn't care,
and we get to be single together.

377
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,422
So what do you say?

378

Maybe Alex and I
licking your wounds for a night

379

could turn that frown upside down?

-Well, we feel bad for you.
-So, yes, Okay, um… pass.

["Golden Times" (Jim Henderson Remix)

466
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,797
Could you give it
to the guy at the end of the bar?

467
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,090
-[bartender] Sure.
-Thanks.

468
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,220
From that guy down there.

469
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,994
So did you know about the dog?

470
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,000
-I didn't want to be the one to tell you.
-I bet.

472
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,878
For what it's worth,
the whole dog thing is bananas.

473
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,047
Suddenly he wants a dog?

474
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,300
I don't get what's goin' on with that man,
and I've tried.

475
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,011
It's like someone flipped a switch.

476
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,929
Yes.

477
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,975
But I still went over there for dinner,
thinking, naively, that I could

478
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,186
somehow figure it all out.

479
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,606
Uncover some clue
that might explain what he did.

480
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,401
And why.

481
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,653
For me?

482
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,822
Of course for you.

483
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,953
I'm sorry, Stanley.
You're not the guy I'm mad at.

484
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,870
I know.

485
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,458
And I may never get my answer.
I've got to be okay with that.

486
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,880
Besides, I think
a lot of what happened was my fault.

487
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:49,052
I push people away
with my big, giant feelings.

488
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,432
-Sucking the air out of rooms and--
-No, no, no. No. Don't do that.

489
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,976
Don't blame yourself for what happened.

490
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,562
I won't let you go down that path.
There's nothing good there.

491
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,022
You got it?

492
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,734
So I don't have giant feelings?

493
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,905
I mean, could they use a little tweak
now and then? Sure.

494
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,660
But you are absolutely
a person worth loving.

495
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,620
Period.

496
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,668
Thank you, my friend.

497
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,629
-Uh, drink that.
-[chuckles]

498
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,340
-I've already had three.
-Gladly.

499
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,509
Oh!

500
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,516
-[laughs] Gotta take a picture.
