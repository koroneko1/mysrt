1
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,708
All right, class. Today we're going
to talk about your dreams.

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,083
I want each of you

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,041
to tell me what you want to be
when you grow up.

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,125
Okay?

5
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,500
Let's start with Doc.

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,291
I want to be a doctor.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,041
Very good.

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,666
Now, Boy, how about you?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,291
I want to be like Toon Bodyslam.

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,583
Huh?

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,250
Anyone else with a serious answer?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,375
I want to be pregnant.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,625
I want to have kids.

14
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,458
That's awesome!

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,208
That's absolutely fine, dear.

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,708
But after you grow up, get married,
then think about it. Okay?

17
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,458
Understand?

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,416
PRINCIPAL

19
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,333
Well done, Kanlaya.

20
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,875
You're the top student of our province.

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,750
Your family must be proud.

22
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,125
HONORABLE CERTIFICATE
KANLAYA HEWSAKUL

23
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,958
Ho.

24
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,750
Dad.

25
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:53,833
Ho.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,958
Where's Mom and big sister?
I have something to tell you guys.

27
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,166
I have something to tell you, too.

28
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,333
Well, Dad, you go first.

29
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,416
Your mom and your sister
were in a car crash.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,541
Ho.

31
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,916
Congratulations!

32
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,083
What gives?

33
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:29,000
CRAZY CRYING LADY

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,375
What's up?

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Doc, I cried in my sleep again.

36
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,708
And are you okay?

37
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,666
Yeah, I guess.

38
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,916
If you're okay, then go back to bed.
Nothing to worry about.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,833
But I was crying hard.

40
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,291
Then you're not okay.

41
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,916
-You want to tell me about it?
-Yeah.

42
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,958
Doc, why do I cry so often?

43
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,708
Every little thing can set me off.

44
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,791
I cry even when I'm asleep.

45
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,416
Can you help me?

46
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,000
You're a doctor!

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,375
What's that have to do with it?

48
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,375
Your problem isn't from some disease.

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,958
It comes from your feelings.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,791
Your feelings are the problem.

51
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,666
Any problems in your life?

52
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,041
Of course.

53
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,375
You'll have a problem with me.

54
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,708
I can't take this.

55
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,875
Get out of my house!

56
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,500
You're getting too queer.

57
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,000
-In what way?
-In every way.

58
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,375
It's just the way things are, Dad.

59
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,666
Anything can happen these days.

60
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,625
Gays are the leaders of fashion.

61
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,000
The gay stuff is not normal.

62
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,625
Why is that?

63
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,208
What's wrong with being gay?

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,458
Nana is not wrong.

65
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,500
What did you just call yourself?

66
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,500
Nana.

67
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:46,250
I named you Nava,
and you changed it to Nana on your own!

68
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,333
Bastard!

69
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,958
What's going on, Dad?

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,541
Look at your brother.

71
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,583
Who raised him to be this way?

72
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,833
This is unacceptable.

73
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,541
Nava, please.

74
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,875
Please what? I don't care.

75
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,208
Why?

76
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,041
I am gay and so what?
I'm not hurting anybody.

77
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,000
It's me you're hurting.

78
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,791
Dad, calm down.

79
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,000
Just say what you want him to do.

80
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,541
-Here.
-What?

81
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,500
Three things.

82
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,500
One.

83
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,625
Don't bring that ugly
gay friend of yours here again.

84
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
I can't stand him.

85
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,791
I haven't introduced myself to you, Papa.

86
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,416
My name is Sabina.

87
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,416
Would slapping a child gay
be against a military rule?

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,708
Enough, Dad.

89
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,791
No! Two.

90
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,125
Don't dress like this again.

91
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't like this?

92
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,750
Happy now?

93
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,750
Did you get a boob job?

94
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,416
Do I have to take it off?

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
No!

96
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,333
I'm almost barfing 'cause of this.

97
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,250
You criticize how I dress.

98
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,750
And look at you.

99
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,208
What about me?

100
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,708
You've been retired for a long time,

101
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,333
but you're still wearing
your full uniform.

102
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,958
Walking around
with your sweaty armpits all day.

103
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,416
It's pretty close to madness.

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Really close.

105
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,916
Captain, don't forget the third one.

106
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,541
Three.

107
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,541
Don't do this again.

108
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,833
That's my phone!

109
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,791
What is it?

110
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,000
It is...

111
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,541
Still here.

112
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,500
Look at it yourself.

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,500
Hello.

114
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,583
Today I'm going to teach you
how to do a sweet makeup look.

115
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,500
EXPERT NANA
125 VIEWS

116
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,000
First of all, lip color.

117
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,083
Red is the color of attraction.

118
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,916
Next, we'll add some sweetness
with eyeshadow.

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,625
Pink is the only color to choose.

120
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,833
Apply.

121
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,291
Apply.

122
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
And apply.

123
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,791
But if you have to be
up close to your guy,

124
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,750
try this, syrup or a sugar solution.

125
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,583
The same method.

126
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,625
Dip your finger in it,
then apply on the eyelids.

127
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,750
Apply.

128
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,041
In case your guy wants to taste it,

129
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,333
the sweetness on your eyelids
will linger on the tip of his tongue.

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:34,375
Next Monday,
I'll teach you how to play a ukulele.

131
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,625
On Wednesday,
I'll teach you how to dance the robot.

132
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,000
And on Friday,

133
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,791
I'll teach you how to open cockles
without hurting your hands.

134
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,833
And for now...

135
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,250
good-bye.

136
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:53,708
A high-ranking officer like me
has a son who teaches how to open cockles.

137
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,000
Why, Dad?

138
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,375
What's wrong with a gay on YouTube?

139
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,875
It's wrong in every way.

140
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,416
You don't have any art in your heart.

141
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,375
I neither have art nor heart.

142
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,708
My heart has been dead for a long time.

143
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,000
Shit.

144
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,416
Melodrama time.

145
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,625
Those tears are coming?

146
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,833
Not yet.

147
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,791
If your mom were still here,

148
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,458
it wouldn't have been like this.

149
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,833
There you go with those words.

150
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,541
I think we should split up for now.

151
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,708
Why do you want to be gay, Nava?

152
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,375
Nana!

153
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,916
Okay. Nana.

154
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,291
I'm begging you.

155
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,333
Try to change yourself.

156
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,708
Try to be a man.

157
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,416
Try to have manly friends.

158
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,750
It might turn out well.

159
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,166
You'll never know if you don't try.

160
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,541
No, I don't want to.

161
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,708
I'm not into it.

162
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,541
You don't understand me.

163
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,541
If our sister Lookpong were still here...

164
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,708
she wouldn't have said this to me.

165
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,125
There it is.

166
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,583
It looks like fun, Nana.

167
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,833
To do what we haven't done before.

168
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,625
It might be a good thing.

169
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,041
We'll never know if we don't try.

170
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,916
Try?

171
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,250
You think so?

172
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,041
Okay.

173
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,083
I'll try.

174
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,750
Yeah. We'll never know if we don't try.

175
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,958
I just said the exact same thing.

176
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,166
Come on. Let's plan this.

177
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,416
So exciting!

178
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
Wait.

179
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,958
There's one more person to deal with.

180
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,833
Dad.

181
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,333
Dad?

182
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,583
Dad!

183
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Dad.

184
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,083
Dad. Come out and talk.

185
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,208
What's there to talk about?

186
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,083
I'd like to ask you to compromise.

187
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,958
Being strict is not always a good thing.

188
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,000
We need to learn
how and when to compromise.

189
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,000
You're a teacher.

190
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,625
Just teach at school, not at home.

191
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,916
I'm a soldier.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,625
I follow rules strictly.

193
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,000
But this is our home, not a battlefield.

194
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,958
Could you please stop thinking about
the past and start thinking about future?

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,583
I have.

196
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,958
So, can you tell me
what you think about the future?

197
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,125
How about next year?

198
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,708
I want to get enlisted.

199
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,125
Oh, shit.

200
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,791
Being enlisted at the age of 60...

201
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,333
If you die on the battlefield,
they don't even count you as a casualty.

202
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,708
Damn, Doc.

203
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,250
You're a doctor, not a soldier.
You don't know shit.

204
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,250
When one sacrifices himself
on the battlefield

205
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,875
so someone else can survive,

206
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,458
the survivor...

207
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,708
must live on suffering dearly.

208
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,041
This is Major Choochai.

209
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,416
Why are you posing, Major?

210
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,375
Sit down now.

211
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,833
You all understand, right?

212
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:51,250
The one who picks the short stick
must carry the bomb and run in there.

213
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,250
Pick one now!

214
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,125
Long.

215
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,875
One down.

216
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,208
Pick one.

217
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,875
-Long.
-Long.

218
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,333
Wow.

219
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,916
We're the last two, Major.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,291
Don't be scared.

221
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,458
Why do you look so pale?

222
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,666
Remember, we are Thai,
we are born to fight.

223
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,416
No need to pick.

224
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
You have a family waiting for you.

225
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,125
I'll volunteer.

226
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,041
What's wrong with your voice?

227
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,000
It's trembling with fear?

228
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,958
I don't like it at all.

229
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
-Let me do it.
-Pick one.

230
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,166
-Short.
-Long.

231
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,791
Why did you let him do it?

232
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,250
I didn't.

233
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,333
I passed out.

234
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
The war has ended.

235
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,041
But you don't want to stop.

236
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,208
No, I don't.

237
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,916
You want to go risk your life?

238
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
Yes, I do.

239
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,208
Sacrifice myself for Thailand.

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
Or for someone.

241
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,833
Wow.

242
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,041
Dad.

243
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,833
To sacrifice,
we don't need to die for someone,

244
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,791
we can live for someone instead.

245
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,791
Wow.

246
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Who do you want me to live for?

247
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,375
Dad.

248
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,250
Can't you think of anyone
that you should live for?

249
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,083
Why don't you understand anything?

250
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,458
You don't either.

251
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
In your life...

252
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:08,833
those who matter to you
have all died, haven't they?

253
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,625
Shut up!

254
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,083
Stop!

255
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,833
Stop!

256
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,541
Go.

257
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
I don't want to hear you right now.

258
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,541
It's so hot.

259
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,083
Go.

260
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,041
Leave me alone with nature.

261
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,041
What are you doing?

262
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,416
Your face is all warm from anger.

263
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,416
Do this.

264
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
What is that?

265
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,666
It's to disperse some of the heat.

266
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,083
-Do it.
-No.

267
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,208
Come on, please.

268
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,583
Please, please. Once.

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,875
Why am I doing what you told me to?

270
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm serious right now.

271
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,583
What for?

272
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,000
There are many elements in our lives.

273
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,125
When you're sad, find a friend.

274
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,083
Add something good.

275
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,750
Like what?

276
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,583
See?

277
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,125
The element of love.

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,041
Why are you smiling?

279
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,541
Nothing.

280
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,875
I'm not smiling. This is my normal face.

281
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,083
Hello?

282
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,833
Hi, rocker.

283
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,916
Yeah. What's up?

284
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,833
I want to take you to the beach
for a couple of nights.

285
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,833
I want to take you to see the horizon.

286
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,958
Yeah? Is it a good idea?

287
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,916
What's good and what's bad?

288
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,541
I don't like beaches.

289
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,125
All right.

290
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,375
It's up to you.

291
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,041
How about hanging out in my room tonight?

292
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,083
I'll play guitar for you.

293
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,208
I don't want to get home late these days.

294
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,708
You can't get home late?

295
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,333
What the heck?

296
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,416
It's okay. That's it. Bye.

297
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,083
I am under pressure.

298
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,750
Boy asked me to go to the beach with him.

299
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,750
So?

300
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,208
You boyfriend asked you out.
What's wrong with that?

301
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,875
But I'm a girl.

302
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,500
We're not married yet.

303
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,083
And he hasn't met my family.

304
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,875
How sincere do you think he is?

305
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,708
Just the two of us? Staying overnight?
What do you think is on his mind?

306
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,333
Why are you mad at me?

307
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I am mad.

308
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,666
In this day and age,

309
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,041
spending time alone with your guy
is absolutely normal.

310
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,416
So, I'm weird?

311
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,791
Sleeping with someone casually
is not weird?

312
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,708
Why? Virginity means nothing at all?

313
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,250
I didn't say that.

314
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,666
But people wouldn't expect
someone with your looks to think this way.

315
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
What does it have to do with looks?

316
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,375
People judge each other by their looks.

317
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,250
That's why they can't see
the real people inside.

318
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,541
You're pissing me off.

319
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,416
Blow it, don't spray it.

320
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,750
Does it look good, Buncha?

321
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,916
It's gonna get ugly
if you call me that again.

322
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,833
Sorry. Does it look good, Sabina?

323
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,083
Wow. It looks nice.

324
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,791
Do you think it would work?

325
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,166
Why not?

326
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,791
But I feel itchy on my breasts.

327
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,375
Look, it's very easy to pluck it.

328
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,125
Damn, Sabina.

329
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,208
I'm so sorry.

330
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,208
Stop it. I'll try this time.

331
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,583
To be a real man, we have to change a lot.

332
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,833
We might have to make some manly faces.

333
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,916
Is it okay now?

334
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,500
A bit more.

335
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,416
How about now?

336
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,666
To be honest,

337
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:02,458
your face looks like a male owl.

338
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,708
Damn you!

339
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,625
I'll slap you hard.

340
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,125
Or we should try to hang out with guys?

341
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,708
It might work out better.

342
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,791
You think so?

343
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,166
What?

344
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,458
He wants to show you the horizon?

345
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,041
It sounds a bit weird, doesn't it?

346
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,666
Not at all.

347
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,583
Guys like him sound like fun.

348
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
It was fun at first.

349
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,458
But as time passed... I don't know.

350
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,458
Don't take it too seriously.

351
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,000
Think of guys as toys.

352
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,166
Yeah. You slut.

353
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,708
-No need to give me a compliment.
-I'm not.

354
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,416
Ho, you don't need to worry about it
because you have some good news right now.

355
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
You got a two-year scholarship
to study in America, didn't you?

356
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,791
Hello?

357
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,333
I'm inside already.

358
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,791
Yeah. Come right in.

359
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,458
Nam Tarn. What the heck?

360
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,333
She's sad right now.
Why did you bring him here?

361
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,625
I asked him to come here
because I have something to tell you.

362
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,083
I'm getting married.

363
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,291
Please, come.

364
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,583
Isn't it too soon?

365
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,000
Not at all.

366
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,458
I'd like to cherish all my moments.

367
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:59,458
The biggest dream for a guy like me
is to marry the woman I love.

368
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:07,208
Let me take care of your heart, okay?

369
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,750
Oh, God.

370
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,333
Mang Gorn,
nobody says things like that these days.

371
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,000
Nam Tarn, I envy you so much.

372
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,666
I wish someone would
say something like that to me.

373
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,583
What are the sunglasses for?

374
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,750
I don't want you guys
to notice that I'm crying.

375
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:41,666
Wait. With the sunglasses,
we notice it even more.

376
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:43,875
-Really?
-Yeah.

377
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,708
She's a real crybaby just like you said.

378
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:58,958
Ho.

379
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,750
What?

380
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,750
No, I won't do it.

381
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,000
Come on.

382
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,875
Come on. One, two, three.

383
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,750
What are you guys laughing at?

384
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,000
You!

385
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:26,375
THE FACULTY CONGRATULATES MISS KANLAYA
HEWSAKUL FOR RECEIVING A GRANT

386
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,291
-Hi, Principal.
-Hello!

387
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,708
-Hi, Principal.
-Hi.

388
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:38,666
So, have you brought all the papers
and the letter from the medical exam?

389
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,833
I haven't had a medical exam.

390
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,750
Then, go get it done today.

391
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,208
Get your blood, heart, lungs,
and kidneys checked.

392
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,000
Inside and outside. Get them all checked.

393
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,625
Okay.

394
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,500
Is that all?

395
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,375
No. One more thing.

396
00:25:56,458 --> 00:26:02,000
Before you can go,
you have to register and pay 30,000 baht.

397
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,458
Expensive, isn't it?

398
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,541
Did you also bring
your financial statements?

399
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,791
-Here.
-Yeah.

400
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,458
Let me see how much.

401
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,708
Thirty grand!

402
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,708
You'll have nothing left after you pay.

403
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,458
Yes.

404
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,041
You're so broke.

405
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,250
It's up to you.

406
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,833
If you want to pass it up,
you can tell me.

407
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,125
Let me think about it.

408
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,416
Go ahead, think about it.

409
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,833
I'll go now.

410
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,833
You're thinking about the money?

411
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,125
No.

412
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,458
Normally, I don't need much money.

413
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,958
I'm thinking about something else.

414
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,250
You're afraid that when you're gone,
your family won't survive, right?

415
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,875
I think they will.

416
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,625
They probably will

417
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,833
because I'm not an important person.
It won't affect them at all.

418
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,500
You should know an important person
is different from a necessary person.

419
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,000
What are you saying?

420
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,750
Sometimes we don't value someone
even though we need them.

421
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,291
And which one is better?

422
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,708
Actually, it should be the same person.

423
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,750
And if I'm a necessary person...

424
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:47,000
how come I'm not an important person?

425
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,708
Here we go.

426
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,375
-Why?
-Stop.

427
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,541
-Why?
-Stop.

428
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,791
Why?

429
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,291
The field is ready. Bring the equipment
to the customers.

430
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,583
I'll tell them to get started.

431
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,625
-This uniform?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,791
Here's your gun.

433
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,458
Safety mask.

434
00:28:56,958 --> 00:29:00,166
Look at me.
I don't need any safety equipment.

435
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:04,083
-Are you sure?
-You, give it back to him.

436
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

437
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,208
boys and girls,

438
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:20,666
if the teams and players are ready,
please make your way to the firing zone.

439
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,250
Come on now, give it your all!
Push on through!

440
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,916
You can do it! Come on! Remember,

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,083
the most important thing
is not about winning or losing.

442
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,583
'Cause tomorrow will be a better day.
A brighter day.

443
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:38,916
Are you ready? I am ready!

444
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,625
Are you ready to rumble?

445
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:48,250
-What did he say?
-Dumbass!

446
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:52,333
You can't understand English,
you don't want safety equipment,

447
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,250
and then you laughed.
What's so damn funny?

448
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,000
SPORTS ARENA
SUPPORTED BY THAI INSURANCE

449
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,625
Can we play with you?

450
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,708
Hell no.

451
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,291
You should go jump rope.

452
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,750
Let them play.

453
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,125
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,666
Change serve.

455
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,416
Hit you again. I'm sorry.

456
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,500
Carry on.

457
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,000
I think you meant to do that.

458
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,083
You!

459
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,250
Given the situation,
I think they've got us.

460
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,541
Here's the plan.
I'll go out and distract them.

461
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,708
You guys retreat when you can.

462
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,208
Captain.

463
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,333
Do you realize
you're sacrificing yourself?

464
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,125
I have been living...

465
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,875
-for this.
-Captain.

466
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,500
All my brave soldiers,

467
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:04,333
today I'm very honored
to be fighting with all of you.

468
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,541
It will be written down in history.

469
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,875
Captain!

470
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,791
You fired away like New Year's fireworks.
I haven't even drawn my gun yet.

471
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,833
Damn it.

472
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,291
He's using a real gun!

473
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,958
-Help!
-Don't shoot!

474
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,500
GYNECOLOGY

475
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,333
-It's all done. Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

476
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,416
I'll bring you the results in two days.

477
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,916
Okay.

478
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,083
You can change your clothes now.

479
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,125
Here are your phones.

480
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,666
Are you using two phones?

481
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,750
Yeah. If you're smart,
you can save some money.

482
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,583
This one
has the Midnight Slider promotion,

483
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,791
free calls from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.
And this one,

484
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:39,333
Free Day Hello-lo,
free calls from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

485
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:43,750
Hello?

486
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,291
It's the police.

487
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:52,666
Yeah.

488
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,458
What?

489
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,791
My dad shot someone?

490
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,750
Boy is calling.

491
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,833
Hello?

492
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,375
What? You were shot?

493
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,250
What the heck?

494
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,125
The same incident, for sure.

495
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,500
I'll be there right away.

496
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,333
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

497
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:27,666
Are you really arresting me?
I'm a soldier, I defend this country.

498
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,416
And I'm a police officer.
I have to protect people.

499
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,375
If there are no soldiers,
how will people live?

500
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,041
In a condo, maybe?

501
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,375
-You're messing with me?
-You don't listen.

502
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,916
You don't want to mess with me.

503
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,291
Dad.

504
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,000
Boy.

505
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,041
Boy?

506
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,083
What? Boy?

507
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,250
Sounds familiar.

508
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,833
I see, Boy.

509
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,583
You looked Chinese when you were young.

510
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,500
Now, you look like a westerner.

511
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:18,875
Let's talk about you. Did your daughter
adopt you from somewhere?

512
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,458
People change over time.

513
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,208
-How so?
-When I was a young man,

514
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,583
I looked like Tom Cruise.

515
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:29,458
Is he your dad?

516
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,625
I can't recognize him.

517
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:38,208
See? We know each other.

518
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,333
Okay, I won't press charges against him.

519
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,500
No, no, no.

520
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,416
You shot him, even if it was just a graze.

521
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,000
He's the one who can decide.
Not the other way around.

522
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

523
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,291
Get inside, go.

524
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,166
-Sir, I'd like to file a report.
-What happened?

525
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,833
These two assaulted my son.

526
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,500
Nana!

527
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,208
What happened?

528
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:10,791
These two assaulted my son. See the blood?

529
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:22,083
Good. A soldier's seed
must stand up and fight.

530
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:26,750
Shit. You're a soldier,
but your son is a gay.

531
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,458
Shit. Right on my weak spot.

532
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,000
See?

533
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,041
I'm so embarrassed.

534
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,583
You can go home now.
I'll take care of this.

535
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:41,958
No. I came here to file a report.

536
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,750
My son was assaulted.

537
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,208
Yeah?

538
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,333
What now?

539
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,375
Sir, when can I go home?

540
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,000
You've lost your damn mind.

541
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,583
Sir, what do we have to do?

542
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,583
I'll let it go.

543
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,250
There. One problem solved.

544
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,958
No. It's a criminal charge.

545
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,916
The fine and the bail are
about 30,000 baht all together.

546
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,125
If you don't have the money,
then he'll be in jail. That's it.

547
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,416
Want me to help?

548
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:24,791
I can pay for it.

549
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:33,375
Are you mad?

550
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,958
POLICE TO SERVE PEOPLE

551
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,208
I wish I were. But I can't be.

552
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,333
Don't get angry at a crazy person, right?

553
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:47,625
Boy.

554
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:51,541
That crazy person is my dad.

555
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,250
I didn't say anything.

556
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,833
You don't need to say it.

557
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,875
If I had known he was your dad,
I wouldn't have come here.

558
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,000
You couldn't have known.

559
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:07,083
You never asked about my family.

560
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,958
-You're off topic.
-No.

561
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:15,208
It's about us.

562
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,083
It's about my gay brother.

563
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:22,333
It's about my crazy dad
who shot my boyfriend.

564
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,666
It's all about us.

565
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,041
Ho, I didn't mean to make you cry.

566
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,291
I'm sorry.

567
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:48,208
Tears can't win over everything, trust me.

568
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,291
I didn't want to cry.

569
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,458
The tears just come on their own.
Understand?

570
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,583
And I'm not trying to win over anything.

571
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:03,958
You know what?

572
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:09,250
On a dark starless night,
you're my shining light.

573
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:11,541
What?

574
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:15,666
It's wonderful.

575
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,333
I started off being shot by your dad
and ended up apologizing to you.

576
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:30,708
Never mind.

577
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,583
Let's go home.

578
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,291
I'm exhausted.

579
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,291
Let's go.

580
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,625
Cheer up.

581
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:18,541
Find some time and ask him out for dinner.

582
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,541
Talk to him and it'll get better.

583
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:26,708
For some women,
boyfriend problems are a very big deal.

584
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,333
You'll never understand.

585
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,666
Okay. Big deal.

586
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,916
How about this?

587
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,708
Take care of your smallest problem first.

588
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:43,833
Think about it.
What is your smallest problem?

589
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:46,083
Your brother, Nana.

590
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,583
You want him to be straight, right?
I agree with you.

591
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:52,666
If you can do it,
you'll solve two problems at once.

592
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,791
One, your brother becomes straight.

593
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:58,375
Two, you dad won't fight with him.
All good.

594
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,208
What should I do?

595
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,166
He'll fight with the guys
he hangs out with.

596
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,333
That's normal. Some guys who fight
become friends in the end.

597
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:18,166
Take him to see them.
They'll become close friends. Trust me.

598
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,041
Are you sure?

599
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,541
Better than doing nothing.

600
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,250
Yes.

601
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,500
And...

602
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,791
take your dad with them, too.

603
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:31,125
Your dad wants your brother
to be a macho man, right?

604
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,583
Maybe if you use one problem
to solve another, it might work.

605
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:44,458
Would my dad agree with me?

606
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,416
Go up and ask him now.

607
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,416
Go!

608
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,875
That hurt!

609
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,500
I should be the one to say that.

610
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,958
You stepped on my damn foot.

611
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,333
But I agree with you.

612
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,541
Told you he's the problem.

613
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,916
Parrot girl, you haven't stopped
running your mouth since you got here.

614
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,625
-I didn't know you were here.
-Still talking back!

615
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,208
-What did you say?
-Nothing. It was just a bird chirping.

616
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,375
Shut it!

617
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:31,875
Here comes this family again.

618
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,458
I'm sorry about the other day.

619
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,250
-I was wrong.
-Yes, you were.

620
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,000
Young man,

621
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:49,041
when a real man admits that he's wrong,
you should give him a second chance.

622
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:51,833
Yeah.

623
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,875
Friends are better than foes.

624
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,916
Today my son is going
to play sepak takraw.

625
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,708
-Anyone have a problem?
-Yes.

626
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:03,791
Today we're not playing sepak takraw.
We're practicing Thai boxing.

627
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,875
Anyone interested?

628
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,291
No way.

629
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:14,083
Today you'll meet the Beast from the East.

630
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,750
-Who is that?
-I'll tell you later.

631
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,875
Dad, won't he get hurt?

632
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,208
Yes.

633
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:37,500
Good. The more he gets hurt,
the tougher he'll be.

634
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,000
Don't give up.

635
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,083
Keep smiling.

636
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,500
Stop! Enough!

637
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,458
He's already down. This is outrageous.

638
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:21,375
This is nothing. I haven't gotten even
for what you did to me.

639
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:24,166
-Fight with me!
-No.

640
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,541
You have to fight
so you'll stop being mad at him.

641
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,791
Captain, aren't you going to stop them?

642
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:39,083
Mr. Son, a soldier's child,
even it's a girl,

643
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,625
will fight when the time comes.

644
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,000
Come on.

645
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,833
I'm ready.

646
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,041
Fight!

647
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,958
No! I don't fight with girls.
People would call me a bastard.

648
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,791
Don't worry. I challenged you.

649
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,750
Fight with me.

650
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:07,125
-Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!
-Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

651
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,333
I knew it.

652
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:16,083
It's all your fault.
Because of you, I got hurt.

653
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,833
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say you're sorry.

654
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,916
From now on, I'll stay being gay.

655
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,708
-I'll be gay. Got it?
-I don't.

656
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,000
Accept me the way I am or not,
I don't care.

657
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,791
I can't accept it.

658
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,125
Nana.

659
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,833
Dad.

660
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Mom.

661
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,458
I wish you were here.

662
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,583
You would know what to do.

663
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,833
I have no idea what else to do.

664
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,791
Sis.

665
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,750
Will you switch places with me?

666
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,791
Come live my life.

667
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:31,625
Can I be the one who rests in peace?

668
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,833
I'm so tired.

669
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,500
Hello?

670
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,791
Okay.

671
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,333
SORRY!

672
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,250
Sorry?

673
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,375
Yes, sorry.

674
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:10,375
Why did you have to put it in a box?

675
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:15,833
I felt that on some occasions
"sorry" might be the best present.

676
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,375
Are you sure you want to do this?

677
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:28,291
I know it's risky, but I'll give it a try.

678
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:29,500
Like in Toon's song.

679
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,500
-I thought it was Big Ass' song.
-Yeah.

680
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:35,916
It's a joke.

681
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:45,708
I think what happened
wasn't your fault at all.

682
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,916
It was me that didn't come off well
with your dad.

683
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,833
-He's really at fault.
-But he's your dad, after all.

684
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,291
But I have a solution.

685
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:02,041
-What?
-We divide this world in two.

686
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,791
One has only two of us.

687
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,500
And I'll make it the happiest world.

688
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,708
I'll call this world...

689
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,416
Together

690
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:20,916
And the other one
I'll call the "Family" world.

691
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,875
There's only your family in it.
I won't get involved.

692
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:29,083
Do you think we can do it?

693
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,375
Can we?

694
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,416
Yes, we can.

695
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,333
Maybe.

696
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,083
I guess so.

697
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,708
Ladies and gentlemen...

698
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:44,708
Yeah.

699
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,000
This is my girlfriend, Ho.

700
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:50,666
Ho...

701
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,458
Look into my eyes. Look.

702
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,083
Look into my eyes!

703
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,250
Look into my eyes.

704
00:50:58,708 --> 00:50:59,666
Do you know?

705
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,916
You are the one.

706
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,791
No more long-haired girls.

707
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:07,041
I would like to tell everyone.

708
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:11,500
I never feel like I'm wasting my time
when I'm with her.

709
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:16,750
I want to make her happy
with all my heart and soul.

710
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,666
I'll take her on a bike,

711
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,458
ride to see the horizon,

712
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,791
and hug her under the moonlight.
Please give us a big hand.

713
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,750
Clap your hands!

714
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:28,083
Yeah.

715
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,875
Clap your hands, everybody.

716
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,625
Come on, now.

717
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:03,791
Why are you crying?

718
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:07,708
I don't know.

719
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,875
I'm drunk, maybe. I cry when I'm drunk.

720
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,333
Why?

721
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,750
I don't know.

722
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,041
If you don't, then who knows.

723
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,375
I don't know.

724
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:25,000
You realize people are staring?

725
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,708
I do.

726
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,000
What do you want to do?

727
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,625
I don't know.

728
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:40,875
There should be a reason or something.
Explain to me why.

729
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,083
I don't know. Stop asking.

730
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,875
Why can't I ask you?

731
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,958
'Cause then I have to explain.
The more I say, the more I cry.

732
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:55,333
Even a short answer makes me cry,
a longer one would make it worse.

733
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,625
Ho, stop, please. I feel embarrassed.

734
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,291
Please.

735
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,041
Me, too.

736
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:16,500
How would we make our "together" world
happy if you always cry?

737
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:30,333
Remember, I told you I would do my best
to make it the happiest place.

738
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,791
But if one day I'm gone,

739
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,333
-please understand me.
-Yeah,

740
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,166
I do.

741
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,041
Now?

742
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:44,500
-I gotta pee.
-Right, okay.

743
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:56,416
Men always talk about themselves.
They care only about their happiness.

744
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,208
They only talk about what they want,
but never ask what I want.

745
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:03,833
It's not right! I'm pissed off.

746
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,166
There, there.

747
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,041
Did you console me or just hit my head?

748
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:16,916
Come on.

749
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,625
Did you cause any trouble?

750
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:30,500
I cry all the time.

751
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,583
I'm such a stupid, whiny person.

752
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:36,666
Who would tolerate me?

753
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,833
Would you?

754
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,333
So, why do you like to cry?

755
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,083
I don't like to.

756
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,083
But it comes from my feelings.

757
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Then, fuck it.

758
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,833
You are who you are.

759
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,791
I can't fuck it.

760
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,625
You know that I want to have kids.

761
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,583
And if men can't tolerate me,
how can I have kids?

762
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,500
How could you say that?

763
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,083
Here. Here.

764
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,166
I shouldn't have said that.

765
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,666
Then, you shouldn't want to have kids.

766
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,083
-What?
-Come on.

767
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,375
I'm so different from you.

768
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,833
I don't want to have kids.

769
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,500
Why not?

770
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:41,291
That's my business.
But why do you really want to have kids?

771
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,958
I don't know.

772
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,916
I really can't answer that.

773
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,250
Yeah.

774
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,916
Why? Why do I want to have kids?

775
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,750
You know why? You answer it.

776
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:57,291
Answer me.

777
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,208
How would I know?

778
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:04,750
I think that's enough talking
about kids right now.

779
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,500
Let's talk about your boyfriend.
What is it he loves about you?

780
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:11,958
Or you've got nothing.

781
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,041
-Yes, I do.
-What?

782
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,166
I'm a cheap, pretty virgin.

783
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,041
Laughing at your own joke.

784
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,875
-Hello.
-Are you really getting married?

785
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,583
This is my dream.

786
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:03,208
During this wedding,
the bride and the bridesmaids

787
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:05,041
will surprise the groom.

788
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,708
Could the groom make his way to the stage?

789
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:19,666
You guys,

790
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:23,416
the reason I'm rushing into marriage
is that I'm pregnant.

791
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:40,875
Are you okay?

792
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,375
Yeah. I think it's great.

793
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,333
How?

794
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,625
I don't know how long he'll love me,

795
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,500
but now he has given me someone
who'll love me forever.

796
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,750
You're absolutely right!

797
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:01,666
Right?

798
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,583
Ho, are you all right?

799
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,791
Yes, I am. I'm touched.

800
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,000
What's next?

801
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:22,708
I believe my child will love me
the way my mom loves me.

802
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:26,875
This...

803
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,666
is the reason why I want to have kids.

804
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:34,833
Ho!

805
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,333
Your turn, go!

806
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,583
Thank you.

807
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:19,416
-Are you okay? Right?
-Okay.

808
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,208
Hungry.

809
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,541
WAI WAI

810
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,958
Let's eat together.

811
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,166
How about another cup?

812
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:20,958
Doctor.

813
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,875
Your friend's results are in.

814
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,500
280 DAYS FOR QUALITY PREGNANCY

815
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:42,041
Hey.

816
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,125
Is your baby kicking?

817
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:45,791
You crazy?

818
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:50,875
Only one month. No kicking yet.
It's probably just a clot of blood.

819
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:52,916
How do you prepare for it?

820
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,666
-You don't.
-No!

821
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,333
You have to.

822
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:01,541
If I were you, I would join a mom's club,

823
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:05,541
get some physical therapy for the baby.
When I have a big bump,

824
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:09,333
I would have a photo shoot in bikinis
and keep them for my kid to see.

825
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,583
Are you a movie star or something?

826
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,625
I really envy you.

827
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,791
You're the first one to get pregnant.

828
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,375
You make me more certain

829
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,875
that the only thing I want in life
is to have kids.

830
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:27,875
Because they would love me forever.

831
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,083
Yeah.

832
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,833
Hey, Doc.

833
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,333
Hello.

834
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:39,458
Talking about something serious?

835
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,875
No. Just talking about kids.

836
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,416
Listen carefully.

837
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,541
You might not be able to have kids.

838
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:57,875
You have an old uterus.

839
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,333
-What?
-What?

840
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,416
What? What the hell is that?

841
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,125
This is the first time I've seen it
in my life.

842
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,541
Everyone at the hospital is stunned.

843
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,375
Your lab results show
that you have a congenitally old uterus.

844
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,875
How come it's old?

845
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,541
It's like second-hand stuff.

846
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,833
It's aged.

847
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,000
It's like it was old since you were born.

848
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:40,291
The terms you're using, old or aged,
sound quite weird.

849
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,708
Is there such a thing?

850
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,208
It's a new disease.

851
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,166
How would it affect me?

852
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:55,833
It's like it's about to expire.

853
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,208
What?

854
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,833
A uterus has an expiration date?

855
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,250
And then?

856
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,791
Right now we're checking it out in detail.

857
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:08,291
It should last for a year or two.

858
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:12,708
But if we can't find a way to treat it,

859
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,541
we might have to dissect it.

860
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,333
Or it could become malignant.

861
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,083
That means you won't be able to have kids.

862
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,041
Wait...

863
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,791
There's a solution.

864
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,791
What is it?

865
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,500
Just use it before it expires.

866
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,666
You can get pregnant
and have a kid right away.

867
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:53,000
When the time comes,

868
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,291
it should be okay to dissect it.
And you get your kid.

869
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,083
How do I do it?

870
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,000
Do what makes people get pregnant.

871
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:10,250
Who would I do it with?

872
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,750
Boy, your boyfriend.

873
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,625
I think you'll have to propose to the guy.

874
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:36,166
No marriage. You have to hurry.

875
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,083
Just "do it" and talk later.

876
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,750
-"Do it"?
-Yes. Just do it.

877
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:48,458
But she said she wouldn't sleep
with anyone before getting married.

878
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:56,333
Ho, don't tell me you're still a virgin.

879
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:00,666
Shit.

880
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:18,458
I think it's time to take care
of the unimportant person.

881
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,041
Is there a way to treat her?

882
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:24,791
I don't know yet.

883
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:14,250
Shit. Dad.

884
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,916
Don't you want to do something?

885
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:24,375
Do what?

886
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:26,625
I don't know.

887
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,333
I've never been a father.
I don't know what to do.

888
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:31,958
You think I'm a good father?

889
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:34,958
But you're a soldier.

890
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,166
What does that have to do with it?

891
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,541
I don't know.

892
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,916
Help me think. Think like a soldier.

893
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:47,000
What?

894
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,083
Nana? What are you doing here?

895
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:55,166
-What? Dad?
-Hit my nose and mouth.

896
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:57,958
What are you guys doing here?

897
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,875
We...

898
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,416
Here.

899
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,666
I came to record a clip for Nana.

900
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,583
Action!

901
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:12,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

902
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:17,125
Meet me, Nana, again today.

903
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,416
I'll teach you how to...

904
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,083
-do free kicks.
-Smile.

905
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,333
Smile.

906
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,208
Thank you.

907
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,208
Dad.

908
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,250
Do you not hate gays anymore?

909
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,750
Ho.

910
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,000
Are you free tomorrow?

911
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:25,375
CHUMNAN CLINIC

912
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,291
Dad. How are they gonna treat me?

913
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,625
-With Botox.
-What?

914
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:54,041
Botox injection.

915
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,791
Botox is great.

916
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:59,666
Dad. Botox is used to tighten the face.

917
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,166
If it can tighten a face,

918
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,250
then it can tighten a uterus.

919
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,041
-I'm leaving.
-Don't piss me off.

920
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:11,541
Dad.

921
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,000
Stay, please, my dear child.

922
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,208
What? What did you call me?

923
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:22,708
My dear child.

924
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,208
My dear child.

925
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,208
That's so wrong.

926
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,583
I love you so much.

927
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:39,458
Dad. Tell me the truth. Is it hard to say?

928
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:41,791
A little.

929
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:47,958
You can talk to me the way you did before.

930
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:50,333
Your dear child is there.

931
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,541
Why don't you try? I'd love to try it.

932
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,833
-What, Dad?
-What do you need Botox for?

933
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:02,583
If it's dangerous, I'll take it...

934
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,833
for my beloved sister.

935
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,750
Beloved?

936
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:14,375
Yes.

937
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,583
If it's dangerous,

938
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,333
I'll sacrifice myself for you.

939
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,125
Sacrifice?

940
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:30,750
Then I'll take it, too.

941
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,916
I'll let you guess where I got Botox.

942
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,708
It's so obvious.

943
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:48,625
Does it hurt?

944
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,166
No.

945
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,625
But I'm sleepy.

946
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:56,458
Like I have strained my eyes.

947
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,500
I want to get some sleep.

948
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:03,041
You can sleep right here.
Dad hasn't come out yet.

949
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,041
Nana.

950
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:40,250
-Dad's here.
-Shit. What the fuck is that?

951
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,041
Are you guys mesmerized?

952
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,416
Do I disgust you or something?

953
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:59,166
I've had my mouth open for so long.
I'm so thirsty.

954
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,458
Hey.

955
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,791
What about the other one?
Where do you want it?

956
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:14,083
Dad. That's enough. It's not helping.

957
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,458
I said it is.

958
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,750
It's an innovation.

959
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,583
Trust me, it's good.

960
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:28,583
How could it be?
Your mouth can't hold water now.

961
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,500
Inject it into her uterus to tighten it.

962
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,000
Uterus?

963
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:36,041
That's impossible.

964
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,333
Botox is only for external use.

965
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,208
That is internal.

966
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,250
Doctor,

967
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:48,208
you said it can be done anywhere.
Now, what?

968
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,083
You're going back on your word?

969
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,416
-Dad, let's go.
-No.

970
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,500
What would you say?

971
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:03,625
One sec.

972
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,166
I am ready.

973
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,750
Are you ready?

974
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:17,500
Let's get ready to rumble!

975
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,666
I'll try.

976
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,833
EXAMINATION ROOM 1

977
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:31,750
Most people have a Chi problem.

978
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,375
-Right.
-If it doesn't flow,

979
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,291
then it causes us problems.

980
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:40,291
-I invented some herbal medicine.
-What is it?

981
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:44,625
It can really help with Chi.

982
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,875
It's very potent.

983
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,083
But I have never tried with a person.

984
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,041
It could be too strong.

985
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,583
I'll try it.

986
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,583
Nothing happened.

987
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,166
Dad.

988
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:11,875
Blood.

989
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,375
Okay now?

990
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,458
No.

991
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:30,041
It's just blood.

992
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:38,166
What about the flow, Doctor?

993
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,666
What the fuck just happened to me?

994
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,875
I don't think it's good.

995
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,458
You don't think so?

996
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:58,250
Do you have the antidote?

997
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:40,250
What are you looking at?

998
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,500
You don't look sad, why?

999
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,375
I am sad.

1000
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,125
But what do you expect?

1001
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:54,666
Crying?

1002
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,708
I'm tired of crying.

1003
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:01,083
Or it's because your dad and your brother
have come together.

1004
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,666
Maybe.

1005
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,625
But you still can't have a kid.

1006
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:15,375
Or things between you and your beau
are better?

1007
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:17,791
No.

1008
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:19,750
He just says nothing.

1009
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:26,708
So what will you do?

1010
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,416
Are you gonna reconcile with him?

1011
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:30,916
Maybe.

1012
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:34,000
If he doesn't just take off.

1013
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,000
I don't think he would.

1014
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:00,125
I want to ask you out...

1015
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,333
for fireflies.

1016
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:11,458
I'm leaving now.

1017
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:25,000
Actually, I didn't know if you would come,

1018
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:27,750
but I've reserved a room.

1019
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:34,416
Maybe during this trip
someone is going to propose, right?

1020
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:37,000
Don't worry about it, Ho.

1021
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,291
If you don't want to, it's all right.

1022
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:35,875
Let's be frank.

1023
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,250
At first, I thought...

1024
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:44,041
the fact that I'm a crybaby
would have driven you away.

1025
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,791
Why did you come back?

1026
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,666
I miss you.

1027
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,666
So, let's be frank.

1028
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,041
Sure, I'd love that.

1029
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:05,250
Since we are in a relationship,

1030
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:09,708
do you think sex is important?

1031
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:12,500
Of course.

1032
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,000
That's why I want to save it for later.

1033
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,083
That's not it.

1034
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:20,583
I mean...

1035
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,125
should we try it?

1036
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:35,416
It depends on if we're married.

1037
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,291
When we return, let's find the auspicious
time for a wedding, then.

1038
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:48,208
You said we came to see fireflies...

1039
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,250
I don't see any.

1040
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:52,541
For those,

1041
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:54,958
we have to go see in our room.

1042
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:01,083
Am I going to have sex with him?

1043
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:06,083
But he's going to find the auspicious time
for a wedding.

1044
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,291
Are you sure?

1045
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:12,250
It's just finding the time,
not the actual wedding.

1046
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,375
Come on. So it won't be a waste of time.

1047
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:21,625
Shouldn't I be worried
about wasting my virginity?

1048
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,333
Try it, you might like it.

1049
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:33,375
Have sex with him now
or after the wedding, it's all the same.

1050
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,750
I'm talking to myself!

1051
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,375
It's the end of the bed.

1052
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,500
Boy.

1053
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,833
It's ticklish there. Ticklish.

1054
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:26,583
Oh, no. Don't.

1055
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:31,333
Don't take it off.
Do you have to take my pants off?

1056
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,583
They have to come off to have sex.

1057
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,958
You can put them back on later.

1058
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,458
I understand.
But you think it's a good idea?

1059
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:47,916
When we do something for the one we love,
trust me, it'll turn out well.

1060
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,083
Not toward the left, no.

1061
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:58,250
Not to the left.

1062
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,333
If not to the left,
it won't get to the middle.

1063
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:04,125
Really?

1064
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,791
I'm sorry.

1065
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,000
You're not ready for this, are you?

1066
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,333
Maybe not.

1067
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,333
So why did you come with me?

1068
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,500
At first I thought I'd try.

1069
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,625
-And?
-And...

1070
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,166
Wait a sec.

1071
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,041
We can't try something like this.

1072
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,375
I understand.

1073
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Boy,

1074
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,541
I'm sorry.

1075
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:14,708
I know that you took me here
because you wanted to help me.

1076
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,958
But I screwed it all up.

1077
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,166
Did I also screw up your life?

1078
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,750
Don't worry about it.

1079
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,208
It's not all your fault.

1080
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,166
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

1081
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,000
Are you all right, though?

1082
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:39,500
I have to live with it.

1083
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,125
Boy.

1084
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:44,041
I'm so sorry.

1085
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,791
You can scold me any way you want.

1086
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,625
No, I can't.

1087
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:51,958
Never.

1088
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,333
What if you could, what would it be?

1089
01:25:57,958 --> 01:25:58,916
Cockteaser!

1090
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,958
Why are you fucking dating me?

1091
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,666
I don't care that people think I'm a fool,

1092
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,250
I still want a girl whose body and heart
want the same thing.

1093
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,541
You're giving me
neither your heart nor your body,

1094
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,833
you helmet-top!

1095
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,166
Are you just faking it or something?
Shit, want to save it for later.

1096
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:21,000
If I had a new girlfriend,
she would be up for it,

1097
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:24,125
a real looker who likes to have
fun and stay up all night.

1098
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,791
Let me ask you this.
Why are you fucking wasting my time?

1099
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:35,291
Go stay with the one that you love,
you mushroom-head!

1100
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,500
If I could say something,
it would be that,

1101
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,250
but I wasn't scolding you.

1102
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,583
I mean, if I could.

1103
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,291
EMERGENCY

1104
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,041
What's wrong? You look so sad.

1105
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:15,208
What are you doing here?

1106
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,125
Same problem.

1107
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:20,916
We want to talk about how to help Ho.

1108
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,625
Someone helped her already, right?

1109
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:29,666
She just called and told us
that it didn't work out.

1110
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,333
She ruined the plan.

1111
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:34,666
Really?

1112
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:47,833
If he's not the one,
why bother seeing him?

1113
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,083
Jump right in it.

1114
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:52,166
Has it ever happened to you?
You're with someone

1115
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:56,375
and you know that he's not the one,
but you still try your best.

1116
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,833
-Can't let go.
-Sounds complicated.

1117
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:02,875
Never mind. If it's so complicated,
then let it go.

1118
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:05,125
-Emotional.
-Let what go?

1119
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:07,291
Your boyfriend...

1120
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:11,083
-or your desire to have kids?
-Right on.

1121
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:14,666
If they're both problems,
then let both of them go.

1122
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,250
Seriously.

1123
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:21,375
Actually,
what he said about you is spot-on.

1124
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,458
If you love someone, then go tell him.

1125
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:27,500
-An instigator.
-Helmet-top...

1126
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:28,666
That hurts.

1127
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:33,208
Why are you smiling?

1128
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,625
Or do you like Ho?

1129
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:40,916
No.

1130
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,333
Would he like me?

1131
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:58,708
I don't know. You've got to find out.

1132
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,458
Would he like a whiny woman like me?

1133
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,708
Probably not, just give up.

1134
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,375
"No" means you like her, right?

1135
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:13,666
-No.
-Right?

1136
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,875
-No.
-Right?

1137
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,000
No!

1138
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:19,750
Dad.

1139
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:24,833
What do we do to say that we love someone.

1140
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:27,583
What did you say to Mom?

1141
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:36,958
That day, I decided to stare at your mom,

1142
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,250
and I said...

1143
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:47,208
"Hey, my love is on your face."

1144
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,833
It sounds difficult. Right, Dad?

1145
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:58,916
-Somebody likes it. Yeah.
-What did Mom say?

1146
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:01,583
Your mom jumped right up.

1147
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:09,083
But if I say that,
I would sound like an unreasonable person.

1148
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:15,708
If you don't have a reason, then don't.

1149
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:18,208
It's what you do.

1150
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:23,875
Doctor,

1151
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:28,625
the research center sent out
your friend's results again.

1152
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:30,375
They said they found out something new.

1153
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,583
What did they find?

1154
01:30:31,666 --> 01:30:35,166
The abnormality
is increasing exponentially.

1155
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,833
The uterus might expire
faster than we expected.

1156
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:41,041
She would have an acute stomachache.

1157
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:05,416
Ho!

1158
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:26,166
I have something to tell you.

1159
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:27,750
Wait.

1160
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:29,833
Me first.

1161
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,500
I think...

1162
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,291
I like you.

1163
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,375
When I see your face,

1164
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,958
my heart starts whining.

1165
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,375
It probably wants you to console me.

1166
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,958
It probably wants your attention.

1167
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:58,416
I think...

1168
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:02,000
I see my love on your face.

1169
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,708
I think I have been in love with you,

1170
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,291
but I had a boyfriend.

1171
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:15,208
But I broke up with him already.

1172
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:19,083
And if you need more reasons...

1173
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:01,833
What's happening?

1174
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,666
What are you feeling?

1175
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:07,166
Positive or negative?

1176
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,000
Positive.

1177
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,833
So, why are you crying?

1178
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:17,416
I don't know. It's coming from inside.

1179
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,958
I've just learned that kisses are yummy.

1180
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:33,916
They are sweet.

1181
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:36,458
Did you add some syrup?

1182
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,708
-Stomachache?
-Yeah.

1183
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:47,791
Just now?

1184
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,500
Yes.

1185
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,708
Looks like we're too late.

1186
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:30,041
Given your symptoms,

1187
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,000
I'll have to dissect the uterus.

1188
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:38,708
That means...

1189
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:41,791
you won't be able to have kids.

1190
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,041
Tell me.

1191
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:49,833
What?

1192
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:54,750
Tell me why you don't want kids.

1193
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,166
Are you sure?

1194
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,875
It's pretty cheesy.

1195
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,041
I want to hear it. Say it.

1196
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,583
You might not like it.

1197
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,791
It's okay. Tell me.

1198
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,750
I believe...

1199
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,291
I can love only one person.

1200
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:46,666
See? That's it.

1201
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,708
Tell me more.

1202
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:53,541
Come on.

1203
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:57,750
If I find the one I love,
I can love just one at a time.

1204
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:04,750
If I have a kid one day,

1205
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,791
if I have to love two people
at the same time,

1206
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,541
I don't think I know how.

1207
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,291
Are you crazy?

1208
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:15,916
It's cheesy, huh?

1209
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:20,833
I like it.

1210
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:29,208
You're so sweet.

1211
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:33,291
If men really think
like what you've just said,

1212
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:35,750
some women might not want to have kids.

1213
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:43,875
And some women are around here?

1214
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,333
I don't know.

1215
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:51,708
You can love only one person, right?

1216
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,375
Yes.

1217
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,041
Do as you said!

1218
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,666
How is she?

1219
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:30,833
Don't tell me...

1220
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:33,666
Tell me now.

1221
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Sis!

1222
01:37:57,333 --> 01:38:00,041
She's dead!

1223
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:02,541
Damn it, Doc!

1224
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:06,041
You killed my daughter.

1225
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,416
You know what,

1226
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,250
my daughter...

1227
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,875
is very important to our family.

1228
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:21,958
Without her, how would my family survive?

1229
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:27,500
Sis.

1230
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:30,666
You have to come back.

1231
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:37,500
Come back, sis!

1232
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:46,083
I know that you really want to have kids.

1233
01:38:47,583 --> 01:38:49,166
If you want a kid...

1234
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:53,041
I'll be your kid.

1235
01:38:58,291 --> 01:39:00,125
If you want a son...

1236
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:04,208
I'll be your son.

1237
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,083
If you want a daughter,

1238
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:11,833
I'm good at that!

1239
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:16,958
Ho.

1240
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,625
Come back, dear.

1241
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,458
I'm sorry.

1242
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,708
I love you, kiddo.

1243
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:39,625
I really love you.

1244
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:41,958
Enough, probably.

1245
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:43,583
What the hell?

1246
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:46,333
She's not dead?

1247
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,291
I'm not dead.

1248
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:54,750
Doc said if I wanted to know
how much you love me,

1249
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:56,125
I should do this.

1250
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:02,333
I told you I loved you
at the Botox clinic.

1251
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,708
That felt so prepared,

1252
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,250
but this looks very real.

1253
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:12,541
I love you, Dad.

1254
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:17,708
Me, too.

1255
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:20,958
I love you, too.

1256
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:24,750
Too much hugging.

1257
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,083
Wait. Don't cry yet.

1258
01:40:30,916 --> 01:40:32,250
Let's do your operation.

1259
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:36,208
-Good luck, sis.
-You can do it.

1260
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:47,500
ONE YEAR LATER

1261
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:55,250
Ho, if one day you're not pretty
or a virgin,

1262
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:56,750
would I want to be with you?

1263
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:00,083
Don't worry about that.

1264
01:41:00,541 --> 01:41:02,458
Even if I'm not pretty and not a virgin,

1265
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:05,041
I know what to do.

1266
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:13,750
And what if I'm still whining
and crying all the time?

1267
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,583
I have a very easy way to console you?

1268
01:41:19,416 --> 01:41:21,333
-How?
-Give you hugs and kisses.

1269
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:24,250
What? Are you crazy?

1270
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:26,083
That's no way to console someone.

1271
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:29,500
Do you want to try to cry?

1272
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,416
I'm saying goodbye.

1273
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,791
Dad, are you really going to war?

1274
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,125
I volunteered to be a soldier.

1275
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:52,000
Dad--

1276
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,666
Don't stop me.

1277
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,708
Let me redeem myself.

1278
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:03,583
Why? Why do you want to do this?

1279
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,541
Everyone wants to be somebody.

1280
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:14,666
If so, you can't say goodbye to just me.

1281
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:36,041
Ho!

1282
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:41,000
You had your dress enlarged
for your brother?

1283
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:46,458
Nana!

1284
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:51,041
What did you just call me?

1285
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:52,625
Nana.

1286
01:42:56,250 --> 01:43:00,000
Whether you're Nana or Nava,
I still love you.

1287
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:03,750
-Dad--
-Stop!

1288
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,041
Remember this.

1289
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:09,041
I'll give you a lesson.

1290
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:15,083
If you're a girl,
you have to save it for later.

1291
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:20,500
It might be too late.

1292
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:25,958
Dad. Don't give up.

1293
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:39,416
Sis...

1294
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:41,708
you know...

1295
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:44,083
you're my idol.

1296
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:57,541
Are you okay?

1297
01:43:58,875 --> 01:43:59,791
Okay.

1298
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:03,791
My life is drifting.

1299
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,541
Yeah, I've been wanting to ask you.

1300
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,958
Why did you call Ho "mushroom-head."

1301
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:16,291
I don't know.

1302
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:20,416
What if you needed to call me names,
what would they be?

1303
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:26,000
-No.
-Come on. I won't be mad.

1304
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,583
You're a fake! Acting like
you're sweet and innocent.

1305
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:33,750
Got knocked up before marriage,

1306
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:36,083
you whore!

1307
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:40,708
If I were to call you names,
that would be it.

1308
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:47,833
You're a very cool guy.

1309
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:50,291
Where did you get all that from?

1310
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:53,458
Probably from my feelings.

1311
01:44:55,291 --> 01:44:56,166
I love it.

1312
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,916
You love something like this? Really?

1313
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:00,750
So...

1314
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:03,583
Would you mind
if your friend's ex-boyfriend wanted to...

1315
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:05,583
ask you out?

1316
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:07,125
You mind?

1317
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:11,333
I feel very honored.

1318
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:16,916
Today I'm here to teach you
how to do the robot dance.

1319
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,083
If you're ready,

1320
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,250
let's get started.

1321
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:25,750
The robot dance is all about
using each part of your body individually.

1322
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:27,708
Look at this. Roll your neck.

1323
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:34,000
See? Now, reverse. It made a noise.

1324
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:36,208
And your hands. Look at this.

1325
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:43,208
It's longer. Clap your hands.

1326
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:44,958
How is the robot dance?

1327
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:47,875
Some people might say it is fucking hard.

1328
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,541
To be honest, it is hard, but not fucking.

1329
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:55,291
We are in the hornet's nest right now.

1330
01:45:55,375 --> 01:45:57,625
If we attack, we're sure to lose.

1331
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:01,500
Let's do this.

1332
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:03,333
I, Burapha,

1333
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,875
will carry the bomb into their camp.

1334
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:09,875
Please give this bag of letters
to my daughter.

1335
01:46:11,083 --> 01:46:12,166
This is the remote.

1336
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:17,375
When I say "I love Thailand,"
then you press it.

1337
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:19,458
Captain.

1338
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:24,000
Can you let us praise you?

1339
01:46:55,083 --> 01:46:57,375
Off you go. My tongue hurts now.

1340
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:23,500
I love Thailand!

1341
01:47:34,083 --> 01:47:35,000
Fuck!

1342
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,916
I gave them the wrong one.

1343
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:38,541
THANK YOU
HO
