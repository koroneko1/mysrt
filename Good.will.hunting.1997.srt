1
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,052
Mod f-x-square, d-x.

2
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,474
So please finish Percival
for next time.

3
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,216
I know many of you had
this as undergraduates,

4
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,897
but it won't hurt to brush up.

5
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:54,528
Thank you, Steven.

6
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,450
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

7
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,328
I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

8
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:05,374
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

9
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,544
but also go on
to fame and fortune...

10
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,714
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

11
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,841
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

12
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:18,430
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

13
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:23,226
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

14
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,689
Well, that's all.
If you have any questions...

15
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:30,234
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

16
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:07,651
Hi, Will.

17
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,736
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

18
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,989
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

19
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,282
- No?
- No.

20
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,826
- Why not?
- I don't know.

21
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,162
- Cathy!
- What?

22
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:20,706
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

23
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,125
- you usually throw at me?
- Oh, fuck you...

24
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,587
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.

25
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:29,591
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

26
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:33,053
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

27
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:35,139
T- Toots!

28
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,476
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

29
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,521
She's got skin problems.
I don't-

30
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:44,649
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

31
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:47,332
There's only so many times you can
bang your friend's future wife.

32
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,989
It's wrong. Where you goin'?

33
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,271
I'm gonna take off.

34
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,535
Fuck you, you're takin' off.
It's, like, what, 10:00?

35
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:56,830
No, I'm tired.

36
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,084
Irish curse?

37
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:04,045
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

38
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:14,331
Out! Stop pressuring me back.

39
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:18,586
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

40
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,299
You're gonna get charged,
you know that?

41
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:26,887
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

42
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:31,517
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

43
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,769
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

44
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:37,857
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

45
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,445
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

46
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,784
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

47
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,703
Come on. Come on. That's it.

48
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:01,216
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

49
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,678
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

50
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,933
Come here. It's Saturday.

51
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,715
Unless you wanna have a
drink with me tonight.

52
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,437
Maybe.

53
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,564
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

54
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:18,319
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

55
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:44,152
This is correct. Who did this?

56
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,530
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

57
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:49,325
- Nemesh?
- N-No way.

58
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,166
- Come on, Joey, now!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

59
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,668
Come on, kid!

60
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,921
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Son of a bitch!

61
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,549
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to
do it! Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

62
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:12,099
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the
striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

63
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:15,187
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
Who's the guy she's with?

64
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:18,523
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

65
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:21,235
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

66
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:22,766
That guy used to beat the
shit out of me in kindergarten.

67
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,238
That guy?

68
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,532
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

69
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,202
Fuck this. Let's get some food.

70
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,317
Oh, what, Morgan, you're
not gonna go talk to her?

71
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,414
Fuck her.

72
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,918
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

73
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,046
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just
'cause you like the take-out girl.

74
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,265
It's 15 minutes
out of our way.

75
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,425
What the fuck are we gonna do?
We can't spare 15 minutes?

76
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,836
Double burger.

77
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:47,806
Double burger.

78
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,393
Double burger.

79
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,437
Chuck, I had a double burger.

80
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:57,650
Would you shut the fuck up!
I know what you ordered. I was there.

81
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,223
So give me my
fuckin' sandwich.

82
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:00,736
What do you mean, your sandwich?
I bought it.

83
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,613
Morgan, how much money
you got on you?

84
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:05,450
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

85
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:08,996
I said that when we pulled up. Give me
my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

86
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,165
All right, well, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

87
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,629
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

88
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,340
We'll put you on a program. Every day
you come in here with your six cents.

89
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:20,997
At the end of the week,
you get your sandwich.

90
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,594
Are you gonna be an asshole?

91
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:24,793
What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?
I think

92
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:26,932
you should establish a
good line of credit.

93
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:29,768
Like how you bought
your couch-payment plans.

94
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,105
Remember how your mother brought in
ten dollars every day for a year.

95
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:35,108
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

96
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,445
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

97
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,657
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

98
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,119
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

99
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,121
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

100
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,707
Yeah, you, you skank face!

101
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,295
Shut the fuck up. - Get outta
here. - What are you worried about?

102
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,298
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

103
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,851
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.
We should've

104
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:01,386
fight him then. We're
eatin' our snacks now.

105
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,513
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'. - So don't go.

106
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,393
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

107
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,938
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds,

108
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:11,856
when I'm done with them,
you're next.

109
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,028
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
we went to kindergarten together.

110
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,838
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

111
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,843
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

112
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,186
Motherfucker, die!

113
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,565
- Carter!
- Come on!

114
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:04,539
Will! Will, come on!

115
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:08,085
Will, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

116
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,380
Easy, brother, easy.

117
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:14,883
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

118
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,428
Whoa! Whoa!

119
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,727
Ah. Fuck.

120
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:35,324
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

121
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:38,452
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

122
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,121
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

123
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:46,002
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

124
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:51,049
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

125
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:05,732
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

126
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:08,568
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

127
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:12,781
However, uh, my colleagues and I
have conferred,

128
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,451
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

129
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,788
that took us
more than two years to prove.

130
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,541
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down,

131
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,630
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

132
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,312
Hey, when's the arraignment?

133
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,356
Next week.

134
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:10,970
Sorry.

135
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,055
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

136
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:17,060
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

137
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:19,855
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

138
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:23,025
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

139
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,385
Oh, my God.

140
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
Looks right.

141
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,790
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

142
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,585
I mean, how hard is it
to push a motherfuckin' broom around?

143
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,712
Mitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

144
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:22,131
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

145
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,926
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

146
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,263
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

147
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:30,683
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

148
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:36,398
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Management was restructuring.

149
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:37,721
My uncle could probably
get you on a demo team.

150
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:38,984
Can he do that?

151
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,611
You kiddin' me! I asked you
yesterday if I could get a job.

152
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:43,655
And I told you "no" yesterday.

153
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:46,325
What's up, Casey? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

154
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:52,331
Let's sit over here.

155
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,333
All right. Let's go.

156
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:02,509
Oh, this is-this is
a Harvard bar, huh?

157
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,928
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

158
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,643
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

159
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,641
Timeout. I'm gonna have
to bust a little move

160
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,780
on them Harvard hotties
down there at the bar.

161
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:25,785
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

162
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,846
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

163
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,058
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

164
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:48,101
- So, do you ladies, uh-
- Come here often?

165
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:50,062
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

166
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:53,231
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

167
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,735
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

168
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,393
Yeah, that's it. I think
I had a class with you.

169
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:01,032
Oh, yeah. What class?

170
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:03,076
- History.
- Maybe.

171
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,120
Yes, I think
that's what it was.

172
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:08,791
You don't necessarily-may not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

173
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,906
It doesn't mean 'cause I
go here, I'm a genius.

174
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,962
I am very smart. - Hey.

175
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,880
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

176
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:17,550
What class
did you say that was?

177
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:19,552
- History.
- Yeah.

178
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:23,139
Just history? It must have been
a survey course then.

179
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,142
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

180
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,561
You should check it out. It's a good
course. It'd be a good class.

181
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:32,233
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly,

182
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,619
I found that class, you
know, rather elementary.

183
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:34,987
Elementary.

184
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,989
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

185
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:40,075
I, uh, I remember that class.

186
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:43,662
It was, um-
It was just between recess and lunch.

187
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:46,249
Clark, why don't you go away?

188
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,918
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

189
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,504
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

190
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,257
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem here.

191
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,761
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

192
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,015
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

193
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:06,563
My contention is that prior to the
Revolutionary War, the economic modalities-

194
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:09,399
especially
in the southern colonies-

195
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:12,110
could most aptly
be characterized as...

196
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,112
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

197
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,490
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

198
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:20,661
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian-Pete Garrison, probably-

199
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,913
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

200
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,043
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

201
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,254
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

202
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,716
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

203
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,845
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

204
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,932
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

205
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:41,309
Well,
as a matter of fact, I won't,

206
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,646
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of-

207
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:48,150
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

208
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:51,487
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

209
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:55,784
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

210
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,467
I read that too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

211
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,123
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

212
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,336
Or is that your thing? You come into
a bar. You read some obscure passage.

213
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,255
Then pretend-
pawn it off as your own.

214
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:11,968
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

215
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,681
See, the sad thing about a guy like
you is, in 50 years,

216
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,764
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

217
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,477
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

218
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,271
One: Don't do that.

219
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:25,358
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

220
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:28,444
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

221
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,241
Yeah, but I will have a degree,

222
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:38,580
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

223
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:41,667
Maybe, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

224
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,381
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

225
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:50,677
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

226
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,679
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:55,683
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

228
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:58,185
How do you like me now?

229
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:03,482
My boy's wicked smart.

230
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:07,446
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place and run into a barney, huh?

231
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:11,366
There it is.

232
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:13,410
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

233
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:18,333
I was gonna close the deal, but then
Chuck-Billy insulted one of 'em-

234
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,177
The heavyset girl
said I had a receding

235
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,961
hairline, and I was a
few pounds overweight.

236
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,963
And I was, like,
"Go fuck yourself."

237
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,967
I swallowed a bug.

238
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,137
Hi.

239
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,140
- You're an idiot.
- What?

240
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,268
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

241
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:37,270
waiting for you
to come and talk to me.

242
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:39,940
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

243
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,609
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

244
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,611
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

245
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,614
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way,

246
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,992
that guy over there-
Michael Bolton clone-

247
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:52,036
He wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

248
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,457
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

249
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,459
Well, I've got to go.

250
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:01,797
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

251
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,049
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

252
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:07,762
There's my number. Maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

253
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:11,474
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get
together and eat a bunch of caramels.

254
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:13,476
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it,

255
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,440
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

256
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:21,527
Uh, right, then.

257
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,156
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

258
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,577
Yo!

259
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,538
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

260
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:35,293
There goes them fuckin' barneys right
now with his skiin' trip. - Hold on.

261
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:37,837
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

262
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,014
Do you like apples?

263
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,267
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

264
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,481
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

265
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:49,874
Come.

266
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:57,466
Excuse me? Is this
the Buildings and Grounds office?

267
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,927
Yeah. What can I do for you?

268
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:02,054
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

269
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:04,556
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

270
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:06,768
I have this guy
who works in my building.

271
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:09,270
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

272
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,273
- Two.
- Two. Building two.

273
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,249
Look, if anything was stolen,
I should know about it.

274
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:20,449
No, it's nothing like that.

275
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,702
I just need his name.

276
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,713
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

277
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:26,665
This is Professor Lambeau.

278
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,750
And this is Professor Hayes.

279
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,794
Tom, please.

280
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:37,010
This is important. Please.

281
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:39,304
Will didn't show
for work today.

282
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:43,016
Got this job through
his P.O. You can call him.

283
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,104
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

284
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,110
Thank you.

285
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:56,281
Asshole.

286
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:03,705
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789,

287
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,949
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

288
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:10,338
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

289
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:12,548
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

290
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:16,386
in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote... 1887?

291
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,305
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

292
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:20,462
He's gonna make a mockery.

293
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,601
I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defense, sir,

294
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:25,396
by the Constitution
of the United States.

295
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,315
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

296
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,859
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

297
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:32,487
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

298
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:34,822
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

299
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,077
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

300
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,831
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

301
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:46,920
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

302
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,089
September '93, assault.

303
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:52,759
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

304
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:57,056
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

305
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:01,324
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

306
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,995
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

307
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,999
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

308
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,045
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

309
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:17,050
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

310
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:21,554
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

311
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:25,059
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

312
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:26,727
Thank you.

313
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,354
Rise.

314
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:33,067
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

315
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,279
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

316
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:37,030
- Who?
- It's Will.

317
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:40,275
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

318
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:43,912
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

319
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:47,458
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

320
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,460
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

321
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:53,673
Oh, Will! I remember.

322
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:57,052
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

323
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:59,054
- Yeah, look, I was wondering-
- Yo, what's up, baby?

324
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:03,225
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

325
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:05,091
Herve, I remember you from juvi.
How you doing?

326
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,896
What you doing?

327
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,316
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

328
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:12,152
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

329
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:14,184
Sit out at a cafe. Maybe
have some caramels.

330
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,157
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

331
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,035
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

332
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:22,079
Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,

333
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:26,418
but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

334
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,549
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

335
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,553
Nice talking to ya.

336
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,266
What the fuck do you want?

337
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,144
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

338
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,148
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

339
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:50,402
Well, what the fuck
do you want?

340
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:54,531
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

341
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:57,035
- Really?
- Yeah.

342
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,961
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

343
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:07,672
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

344
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:11,092
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,

345
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:15,931
get into some more advanced...

346
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:21,019
combinatorial
mathematics, finite math.

347
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:25,108
Sounds like a real hoot.

348
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:29,779
And the second condition
is that-

349
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,156
that you see a therapist.

350
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:39,331
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

351
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:44,420
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

352
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:48,925
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

353
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:52,929
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

354
00:28:56,541 --> 00:29:00,796
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...

355
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,090
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

356
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,177
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will.

357
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,221
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

358
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:11,224
Will, the pressures-
and I'm not judging them.

359
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:14,102
I'm not labeling them,

360
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,106
but they are destroying
your potential.

361
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:22,236
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

362
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,200
You're right. God, I know.

363
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:31,079
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

364
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:36,210
Well, I mean, I do do things, you
know? - What-What kind of things?

365
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,879
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

366
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:44,343
You hide, do you? - No, no. I
mean, I like-I go places. I interact.

367
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:46,471
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

368
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:48,640
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

369
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:51,101
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

370
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:54,730
Fantasy. That's nice.
A bit more.

371
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:58,401
It's something like when you get
in there, the music, like, owns you.

372
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:00,987
It's like that house music. It's like-

373
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:06,410
- You know, you start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

374
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,581
It's just- Yes.

375
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,755
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

376
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:19,674
What are you talking about? What?

377
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:22,510
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

378
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:26,098
A jump? Are you-

379
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:28,142
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

380
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:30,978
Hey, I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

381
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,983
What are you-P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

382
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:40,280
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

383
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:42,908
It's very erotic.

384
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,328
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

385
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,748
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

386
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:51,542
- Ah, Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

387
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:54,045
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

388
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:56,632
- It's just not-It's not worth it.
- What happened?

389
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:58,676
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

390
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:00,457
I mean, I haven't got
time to tell you, much

391
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,221
less talk to that
raving looney in there.

392
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:05,225
An absolute lunatic, he is.

393
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,852
Henry.

394
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,605
Okay,
you are in your bed, Will.

395
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:14,317
Now, how old are you?

396
00:31:15,444 --> 00:31:17,363
Seven.

397
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:19,365
What do you see?

398
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,869
Something's in my room.

399
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:26,540
What is it?

400
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:31,628
It's like a-It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

401
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:35,258
You are in a safe place, Will.

402
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:38,845
It's t-It's touchin' me.

403
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:41,848
Where is it touching you?

404
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,392
It's touching me down there,

405
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,022
and I'm nervous.

406
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:51,859
You don't have to be
nervous, Will.

407
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:55,780
We start dancin' and dancin'.

408
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:59,784
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

409
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:05,291
a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

410
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,393
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

411
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,023
Come on! One dance!

412
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:29,942
You really hypnotized me,
you know?

413
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,891
For God's sake, Will.

414
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:33,821
What? Oh, come on. He left.
You can't pin that on me.

415
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:35,520
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

416
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:39,620
Look... - into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

417
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,247
I don't need therapy.

418
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:46,127
That's enough. Get out!

419
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:50,382
I called Mel Weintraub this
morning to see... Oh, what's the use?

420
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,384
What do you want to do?

421
00:32:54,427 --> 00:32:59,016
- Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?

422
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,522
He used to be my, uh-
my roommate in college.

423
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:11,989
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

424
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,074
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

425
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,995
Why is trust
the most important thing...

426
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:21,457
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

427
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:26,046
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

428
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:32,761
- Vinnie. - Um- Because, uh-

429
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,807
Trust is, uh-Trust is life.

430
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,561
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

431
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,355
Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

432
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,818
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust
you, then they won't be honest with you.

433
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,029
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

434
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:50,144
I mean, hey, if they
don't trust you, you're

435
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:52,199
never gonna get them
to sleep with you.

436
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:53,773
That should be the goal
of any good therapist.

437
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,287
Nail 'em while
they're vulnerable.

438
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,039
That's my motto.

439
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,666
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

440
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:04,838
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

441
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:12,055
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

442
00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:16,143
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

443
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:19,021
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

444
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,857
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

445
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,988
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.

446
00:34:27,072 --> 00:34:30,158
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

447
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:33,662
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

448
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:37,041
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

449
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:41,587
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

450
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:43,589
Good to see you.

451
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:45,455
Sean, I think I got
something interesting for ya.

452
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:47,260
Yeah?

453
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,846
What, you have to have
blood and urine? What's up?

454
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,224
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

455
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:55,770
You know, I'm-I've been busy.

456
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,772
- You were missed.
- Really?

457
00:34:57,855 --> 00:35:00,012
So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

458
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:02,193
Before Nancy died.

459
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,195
Yeah, I'm sorry.

460
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,949
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

461
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:08,701
I got your card. It was nice.

462
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,084
- Come here.
- Now that's a takedown.

463
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:20,005
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

464
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:24,801
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

465
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:28,597
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

466
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,852
Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

467
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:34,937
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

468
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:38,025
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

469
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:41,486
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?

470
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:45,616
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

471
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,455
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.

472
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,374
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

473
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,377
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

474
00:35:55,461 --> 00:35:57,880
He had no formal education.

475
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:00,466
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

476
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,801
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

477
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:05,263
But he came across
this old math book,

478
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,974
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

479
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,976
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

480
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:13,146
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh-

481
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:17,318
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

482
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,654
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm.

483
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:24,325
And brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

484
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,912
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

485
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:29,331
This-This Ramanujan-

486
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:33,377
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

487
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,881
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.

488
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:40,510
- But he's-he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

489
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,553
I need someone
who can get through to him.

490
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:46,183
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

491
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:47,777
Why?

492
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,353
Well, because you have the
same kind of background.

493
00:36:49,395 --> 00:36:52,690
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighborhood.

494
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:56,069
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

495
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:58,988
Boy genius from Southie.

496
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:03,201
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

497
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:07,707
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:10,876
Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week. - Mm-hmm.

499
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,878
Please?

500
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:19,136
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

501
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:22,305
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

502
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,766
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

503
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,269
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

504
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,271
This is Sean Maguire.
Will Hunting.

505
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:30,273
How are ya?

506
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:36,697
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

507
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,824
I'm pumped.
Let's let the healing begin.

508
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:42,411
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

509
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,081
You, too, Gerry.

510
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,083
Yeah, of course.

511
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,424
How are you?

512
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,804
Where you from in Southie?

513
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:01,766
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

514
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,101
Do you buy all these books
retail,

515
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:06,217
or do you send away for,
like, a "shrink kit"

516
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,273
that comes with all
these volumes included?

517
00:38:08,357 --> 00:38:11,902
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

518
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,112
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

519
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:16,949
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

520
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,703
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?

521
00:38:20,787 --> 00:38:22,756
Yeah, I read those.

522
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,749
Good for you. What do
you think about 'em?

523
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,669
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

524
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:29,588
I did. I had to.

525
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,092
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

526
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:44,688
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

527
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:58,620
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,

528
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,664
read Howard Zinn's
A People's History in the United States.

529
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:02,666
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

530
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,751
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

531
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:09,632
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

532
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:11,998
You spend all your money on
these fuckin' fancy books.

533
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,345
You surround
yourselves with 'em.

534
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:16,807
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

535
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,228
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

536
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:23,897
Hey, you know you'd be better
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

537
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:26,109
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

538
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:29,612
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

539
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:32,615
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

540
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:35,202
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

541
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:36,662
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

542
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:37,997
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

543
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,835
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

544
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:45,088
You paint that?

545
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:47,090
- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.

546
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:50,635
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

547
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,055
Do you like art?

548
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:57,435
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

549
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,437
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

550
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,152
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

551
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:09,448
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

552
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:11,450
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

553
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:12,752
That's not really what
concerns me though.

554
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:13,994
What concerns you?

555
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,498
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

556
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,666
It's paint-by-number.

557
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,211
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

558
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,754
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

559
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,509
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

560
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,177
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

561
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:31,889
Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?

562
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,629
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

563
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:35,310
Yeah.

564
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:38,355
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

565
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,116
Maybe you're in the middle of
a storm, a big fuckin' storm.

566
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:41,858
Yeah, maybe.

567
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,113
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

568
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:47,281
The oars are about to snap.

569
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,325
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.

570
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:51,661
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

571
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,080
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

572
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:57,668
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

573
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:05,468
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

574
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:08,471
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

575
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:12,267
Ah.

576
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,649
That's it, isn't it?

577
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:22,236
You married the wrong woman.

578
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:26,950
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

579
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:30,037
Was she, you know-
banging some other guy?

580
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,833
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

581
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,003
I will fuckin' end you.

582
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:40,520
Got that, chief?

583
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:42,522
Time's up.

584
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:44,942
Yeah.

585
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,125
At ease, gentlemen.

586
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,176
You okay?

587
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:17,603
Look, I'll understand if you don't
wanna meet with him again.

588
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:21,398
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

589
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:25,612
Yeah.

590
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:27,614
Thanks.

591
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,938
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

592
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,940
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

593
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:38,972
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

594
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:40,944
Wonderful.

595
00:43:43,572 --> 00:43:46,993
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

596
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:52,373
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

597
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:56,879
Then Harvard.
Hopefully med school.

598
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:58,922
You know, I figured out,
by the end,

599
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:03,260
my brain's gonna be worth
$250,000.

600
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:06,890
That sounded horrible,
didn't it?

601
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:09,601
Bring me another mai tai!

602
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:13,897
Yeah, that's cool. I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

603
00:44:13,938 --> 00:44:17,860
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

604
00:44:17,943 --> 00:44:21,364
Wow. Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

605
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:24,450
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

606
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:29,581
All right, so you just wanted to use
this sailor and then run away, huh?

607
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:32,876
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

608
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,254
In that case, that's fine.

609
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,682
Hey, you wanna see my
magic tricks, Skylar?

610
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:38,091
Of course.

611
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:43,721
All right. Promise
to- All right.

612
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:47,476
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

613
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,396
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

614
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,398
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

615
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,276
You ready? Ready.

616
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,946
One, two, three.

617
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,990
They're all gone.

618
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,618
That was my-It works better
when I have my rabbit.

619
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,664
Well-

620
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,375
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

621
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:14,380
How very unfortunate...
I think for me.

622
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:17,759
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

623
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,761
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

624
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,147
No, I really haven't.

625
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,514
Yes, you have. You were hoping
to get a good night kiss.

626
00:45:22,597 --> 00:45:25,685
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night laid.

627
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,690
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

628
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:33,568
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

629
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:37,114
- Mm.
- No, I was-I was hopin' for a kiss.

630
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,661
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

631
00:45:42,745 --> 00:45:45,165
- Right now?
- Yeah.

632
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:47,167
Come on.

633
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:58,471
I think I got
some of your pickle.

634
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:11,485
You again, huh?

635
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:15,656
Come with me.

636
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:26,960
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

637
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:31,632
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?

638
00:46:31,715 --> 00:46:34,075
Is it something, like, maybe
we need to devote some time to?

639
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,586
Thought about what you
said to me the other day.

640
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,267
About my painting. - Oh.

641
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:44,270
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

642
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:47,650
Something occurred to me.

643
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:52,279
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

644
00:46:52,363 --> 00:46:55,325
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

645
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:59,913
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

646
00:46:59,996 --> 00:47:03,083
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

647
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,586
You've never been
out of Boston.

648
00:47:07,755 --> 00:47:09,716
Nope.

649
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:11,926
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

650
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:14,595
on every art book ever written.

651
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:18,434
Michelangelo?
You know a lot about him.

652
00:47:18,517 --> 00:47:22,187
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

653
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:27,068
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

654
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,573
I bet you can't tell me what it
smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

655
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:37,747
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

656
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,918
Seeing that.

657
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:44,921
If I ask you about women,

658
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:48,675
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.

659
00:47:48,759 --> 00:47:51,678
You may have even been laid
a few times.

660
00:47:56,768 --> 00:48:00,021
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

661
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:02,523
and feel truly happy.

662
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:07,571
You're a tough kid.

663
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:13,243
I ask you about war, you'd probably
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

664
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:16,748
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends."

665
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:21,086
But you've never been near one.

666
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:23,922
You've never held your best friend's
head in your lap...

667
00:48:24,005 --> 00:48:28,427
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

668
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:35,519
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet,

669
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:39,773
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

670
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:44,152
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

671
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:48,658
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,

672
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:51,702
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

673
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:54,998
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel,

674
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,127
to have that love for her
be there forever.

675
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,673
Through anything.
Through cancer.

676
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:05,009
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

677
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:07,178
for two months,
holding her hand,

678
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:09,180
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

679
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:13,852
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

680
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:16,105
You don't know about real loss,

681
00:49:16,188 --> 00:49:21,193
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

682
00:49:21,277 --> 00:49:25,198
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

683
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:32,539
I look at you. I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

684
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,296
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

685
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:43,384
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

686
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:47,014
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

687
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,218
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

688
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:53,187
You ripped
my fuckin' life apart.

689
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:59,110
You're an orphan, right?

690
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:06,994
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been-

691
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:09,663
how you feel, who you are-

692
00:50:09,747 --> 00:50:13,125
because I read Oliver Twist?

693
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,462
Does that encapsulate you?

694
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,801
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because-

695
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:23,011
You know what? I can't
learn anything from you...

696
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:25,515
I can't read
in some fuckin' book.

697
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,435
Unless you wanna talk
about you,

698
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,437
who you are.

699
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:36,819
And I'm fascinated. I'm in.

700
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:41,907
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

701
00:50:44,243 --> 00:50:47,163
You're terrified
of what you might say.

702
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,129
Your move, chief.

703
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:04,081
Hello? Hello?

704
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:07,043
Hello?

705
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:10,004
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

706
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:14,842
Freak.

707
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,308
- Oh, God.
- Christ, who did you call?

708
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,894
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

709
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,523
You went all the way out there in the
rain, and you didn't bring the number.

710
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:30,527
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

711
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:33,154
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

712
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:35,366
That's pretty funny, Morgan.

713
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:37,910
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch.

714
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:40,287
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

715
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,251
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

716
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:44,417
Keep fuckin' with me.

717
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:52,300
No smoking.

718
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:26,922
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

719
00:53:26,964 --> 00:53:30,259
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

720
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:33,012
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

721
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:37,100
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

722
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:41,146
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

723
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:44,984
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

724
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:50,031
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

725
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:53,117
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

726
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:55,704
But I can do the sum.

727
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:58,248
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

728
00:53:58,332 --> 00:54:00,250
If we do the whole thing
this way, then-

729
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:03,087
Hey, look, look.

730
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,591
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

731
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:20,064
Sometimes people get lucky.

732
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:22,108
You're a brilliant man.

733
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,985
You know,
I was on this plane once,

734
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:04,904
and I'm sittin' there, and...

735
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:06,909
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know,

736
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:09,632
"we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"
but then he puts the mike down.

737
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,329
- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.

738
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:14,331
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like,

739
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:19,129
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."

740
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:21,757
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'
up from the back of the plane...

741
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,508
to tell him
the microphone's still on.

742
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:26,929
This guy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."

743
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:30,475
You ever been on a plane?

744
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:33,561
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

745
00:55:33,603 --> 00:55:35,564
Yeah, it does.

746
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:40,611
I have been laid, you know?

747
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:42,946
Really? Good for you.

748
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,949
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

749
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:48,161
I went on a date last week.

750
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,247
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

751
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:53,291
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

752
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,002
- Why?
- Haven't called her.

753
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:58,422
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

754
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:02,760
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

755
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:05,305
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

756
00:56:05,347 --> 00:56:09,768
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

757
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,717
So call her up, Romeo.

758
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,647
Why, so I can realize
she's not that smart.

759
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,067
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't-

760
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,612
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna ruin that.

761
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:23,616
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

762
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:27,621
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

763
00:56:27,663 --> 00:56:30,592
That way, you can go
through your entire life

764
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:33,544
without ever having to
really know anybody.

765
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,799
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

766
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,885
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

767
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,555
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

768
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:46,517
Just thought I'd share that
with you.

769
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,145
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

770
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,900
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"

771
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:58,155
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have
the heart to tell her. Oh, God.

772
00:56:58,238 --> 00:57:00,490
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

773
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:10,835
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

774
00:57:10,877 --> 00:57:14,046
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

775
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,093
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

776
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:21,096
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

777
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,766
That's what made her my wife.

778
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:27,228
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

779
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:31,733
People call these things
"imperfections," but they're not.

780
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:34,569
That's the good stuff.

781
00:57:34,611 --> 00:57:39,283
And then we get to choose who
we let into our weird little worlds.

782
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,285
You're not perfect, sport.

783
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:44,038
And let me save you
the suspense.

784
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:47,417
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

785
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:51,296
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

786
00:57:51,379 --> 00:57:55,718
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

787
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,720
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport,

788
00:57:57,762 --> 00:58:00,890
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

789
00:58:00,932 --> 00:58:03,643
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

790
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:07,397
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

791
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:09,441
Yeah, why not?

792
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:13,237
You told me every other
fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

793
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,116
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

794
00:58:16,157 --> 00:58:20,217
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

795
00:58:20,258 --> 00:58:22,219
Yeah.

796
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:27,975
You ever think
about gettin' remarried?

797
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:30,603
My wife's dead.

798
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:33,815
- Hence the word "remarried."
- She's dead.

799
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:39,696
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

800
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,949
I mean, that way, you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

801
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:44,660
without ever really knowing
anybody.

802
00:58:47,122 --> 00:58:49,290
Time's up.

803
00:59:03,764 --> 00:59:05,976
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

804
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,354
Thanks.

805
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,379
Subeit By: SharePirate.Com

806
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:39,596
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

807
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,849
- Hello.
- Hey.

808
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:47,229
Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I've
been, like-I've been really busy, and-

809
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:49,899
- But, um-
- Mmm. Me too.

810
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:55,155
Yeah. I-I thought you'd call.

811
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:57,365
Yeah, um-

812
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:00,786
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

813
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:03,038
I mean, I just-I-

814
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,249
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.

815
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,460
No. No, I mean,
you know, it's all right.

816
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:10,713
Yeah, um, so, I was
wonderin' if, uh,

817
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:12,715
if, you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

818
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,385
You know, let me
take you out again.

819
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:18,138
- I can't.
- All right.

820
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,600
Oh, no, I didn't-I didn't mean
I can't, like, ever.

821
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:23,602
I just can't right now.

822
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:26,689
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for "ebogamine."

823
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:30,777
All that sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

824
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,738
- All right, um-
- Maybe some other time.

825
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:37,827
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

826
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,371
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
01:00:40,413 --> 01:00:42,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

828
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:57,014
What are you doing here?

829
01:00:57,098 --> 01:00:59,350
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

830
01:00:59,434 --> 01:01:02,395
Where the fuck
did you get this?

831
01:01:02,478 --> 01:01:04,564
I had to sleep
with someone in your class.

832
01:01:04,647 --> 01:01:07,451
Oh, I hope it was someone
with the open-toed

833
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:10,279
sandals and the
really bad breath.

834
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:14,324
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

835
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:17,036
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

836
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,080
- No.
- Let's go.

837
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:26,672
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!

838
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:29,049
Come on, Misty!

839
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:31,844
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

840
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:33,846
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

841
01:01:36,183 --> 01:01:40,395
- We won.
- He totally won.

842
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:44,566
So did you grow up
around here then?

843
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:46,861
Not far. South Boston.

844
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:51,407
Still glowing from my win.

845
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:55,078
Look at you. You're so happy.

846
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:57,206
And what was that like then?

847
01:01:57,289 --> 01:02:00,918
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

848
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:04,213
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

849
01:02:04,296 --> 01:02:07,509
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

850
01:02:07,592 --> 01:02:13,139
- Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

851
01:02:13,223 --> 01:02:18,187
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

852
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,774
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

853
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:25,112
Seven? Eight? How many?

854
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:27,405
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

855
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:30,283
No, I swear to God. I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

856
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,327
Do you know all their names?

857
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:34,956
Do I-Yeah, they're my brothers.

858
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,125
What are they called?

859
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,365
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

860
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:41,546
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

861
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:44,090
Say it again.

862
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,206
Marky, Ricky, Danny,
Terry, Mikey, Davey,

863
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:48,262
Timmy, Tommy, Joey,
Robby, Johnny and Brian.

864
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,931
And Willy.

865
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,307
- Willy?
- Yeah.

866
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:53,892
- Will.
- Wow.

867
01:02:53,976 --> 01:02:57,772
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

868
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:00,442
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

869
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:01,985
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

870
01:03:02,068 --> 01:03:04,446
Yeah, we'll do that.

871
01:03:04,654 --> 01:03:07,032
Oh, you know,
I read your book last night.

872
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,660
Oh, so you're the one.

873
01:03:09,743 --> 01:03:11,704
Do you still, uh-
Do you still counsel veterans?

874
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:13,080
No, I don't.

875
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:17,836
- Why not?
- Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

876
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,640
You ever wonder what
your life would be like

877
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:23,425
if you, uh, if you
never met your wife?

878
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,428
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

879
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:26,563
No, no, no, I'm not
saying, like, better off.

880
01:03:26,576 --> 01:03:27,638
No.

881
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,691
I didn't mean it like that.

882
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:31,684
It's all right. It's
an important question.

883
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:34,020
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

884
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:36,356
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

885
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,026
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

886
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:41,820
Why? 'Cause the pain
I feel now?

887
01:03:41,904 --> 01:03:47,243
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

888
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,459
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

889
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:57,254
October 21, 1975.

890
01:03:57,338 --> 01:03:59,423
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin' day?

891
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:01,998
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was
game six of the World

892
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,512
Series, biggest game
in Red Sox history.

893
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:07,128
Yeah, sure.

894
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:09,684
My friends and I had slept
out all night to get tickets.

895
01:04:09,768 --> 01:04:11,487
You got tickets?

896
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,230
Yep. Day of the game I
was sittin' in a bar,

897
01:04:13,313 --> 01:04:16,818
waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.

898
01:04:16,901 --> 01:04:20,238
It was an amazing game though. You know,
bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

899
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:22,448
It was 6-6. It went to 12.

900
01:04:22,532 --> 01:04:26,370
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

901
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:28,497
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he's got that weird stance.

902
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:32,167
Yeah, yeah. - And then-
Boom! He clocks it, you know.

903
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,921
High fly ball
down the left field line!

904
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,549
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin' at the ball.

905
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:40,135
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

906
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:42,137
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!

907
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,638
- Right.
- Get over!"

908
01:04:43,721 --> 01:04:48,144
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans-

909
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,271
They charge the field,
you know.

910
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,690
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

911
01:04:52,773 --> 01:04:54,901
"Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

912
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:58,113
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

913
01:04:58,196 --> 01:04:59,765
Did you rush the field?

914
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:01,357
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

915
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:02,856
What?

916
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:04,369
No, I was in a bar, havin'
a drink with my future wife.

917
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:09,041
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a
fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

918
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,294
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.

919
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:13,921
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

920
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,474
I don't care if Helen of
Troy walks into the room.

921
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:16,967
Oh, Helen of Troy!

922
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,178
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

923
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:21,555
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

924
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:25,226
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

925
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:28,396
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."

926
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,648
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?
- Yes!

927
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:32,692
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

928
01:05:32,776 --> 01:05:34,904
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.

929
01:05:34,987 --> 01:05:38,783
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

930
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:41,494
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

931
01:05:41,577 --> 01:05:44,038
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

932
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,250
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

933
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:50,378
I don't regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,

934
01:05:50,462 --> 01:05:54,174
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

935
01:05:54,257 --> 01:05:56,886
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

936
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:59,680
That's regret.

937
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:02,016
Wow!

938
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,691
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

939
01:06:09,775 --> 01:06:12,319
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

940
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:18,493
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

941
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:21,663
I'm extremely tall.

942
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:24,582
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

943
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:30,714
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

944
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:34,343
"It is decidedly so." Hmph.

945
01:06:36,763 --> 01:06:39,432
Why do we always stay here?

946
01:06:39,516 --> 01:06:42,144
'Cause it's nicer
than my place.

947
01:06:42,227 --> 01:06:44,688
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

948
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:47,024
I know.

949
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:49,569
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

950
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:53,072
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

951
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:55,284
I think I can make it
to South Boston.

952
01:06:55,367 --> 01:07:00,038
It's kind of a hike.

953
01:07:00,164 --> 01:07:03,083
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

954
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,712
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

955
01:07:05,753 --> 01:07:08,214
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

956
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:13,720
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

957
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:23,063
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

958
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,401
Oh, my God. Men are shameless.

959
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:30,780
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

960
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:34,409
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

961
01:07:34,493 --> 01:07:39,207
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good."

962
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,668
What? - Fuck the-Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

963
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:45,964
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that
told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

964
01:07:46,048 --> 01:07:50,093
Exactly, so look out. You'd better
start buying some season tickets.

965
01:07:50,177 --> 01:07:54,974
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

966
01:07:55,058 --> 01:07:57,268
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

967
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:00,146
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

968
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,274
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

969
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:05,611
I'm all about home runs.

970
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:09,907
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

971
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:25,007
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

972
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:28,803
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

973
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,732
Well, I can't believe
you brought Skylar here

974
01:08:32,745 --> 01:08:34,600
when we're fuckin' all
bombed and drinkin'.

975
01:08:34,684 --> 01:08:37,980
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

976
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:40,899
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go
on a bender for six, eight months.

977
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,389
Did I ever tell ya what
happened to him when

978
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:43,819
he was drivin' up there
and got pulled over?

979
01:08:43,861 --> 01:08:46,156
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

980
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,826
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.

981
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:53,288
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

982
01:08:53,371 --> 01:08:57,334
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

983
01:08:57,418 --> 01:09:02,548
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

984
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,302
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

985
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:10,140
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

986
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:14,352
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

987
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:16,647
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.

988
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:18,638
He gets out of the car,
pukes, and the statie's

989
01:09:18,651 --> 01:09:20,568
pretty sure he's over
the legal limit.

990
01:09:20,651 --> 01:09:24,447
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

991
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:28,577
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

992
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,164
Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around... He got shot?

993
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:35,210
No. So-So-You
heard this story before.

994
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:37,212
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

995
01:09:37,253 --> 01:09:40,590
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

996
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:42,592
Anyway-

997
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:44,803
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!

998
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:47,848
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

999
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:49,892
He told you the story
once before.

1000
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:52,645
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move."

1001
01:09:52,728 --> 01:09:56,650
Statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

1002
01:09:56,733 --> 01:10:00,654
After a few minutes of just
lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

1003
01:10:00,737 --> 01:10:02,739
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

1004
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,326
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

1005
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:08,412
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

1006
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,748
He hears this knockin' at the door.

1007
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,751
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"

1008
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,796
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

1009
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:17,798
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, 'What?'

1010
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,385
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."

1011
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:24,012
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.

1012
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:26,808
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are."

1013
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:30,186
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage."

1014
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,605
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage."

1015
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:35,317
He was like, "All right. Fine. " Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.

1016
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:40,614
And there's-The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

1017
01:10:40,656 --> 01:10:43,159
He was so fuckin'-

1018
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:45,704
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

1019
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:49,541
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

1020
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:52,043
was so embarrassed
he didn't do anything.

1021
01:10:52,127 --> 01:10:55,464
He'd been drivin' around all night in my
uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

1022
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:59,552
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

1023
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,846
He got away. That's the point.

1024
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,100
- Well, question-
- Come on. Stop.

1025
01:11:05,184 --> 01:11:07,978
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing him.

1026
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,522
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense,

1027
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:12,566
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

1028
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:15,987
Well, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

1029
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:20,783
All right, there's an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.

1030
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:26,415
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

1031
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:29,627
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

1032
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,754
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

1033
01:11:31,837 --> 01:11:34,089
You're such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.

1034
01:11:34,173 --> 01:11:36,551
I want to give ya
a little present.

1035
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:39,554
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1036
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:41,556
What would ya like?

1037
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,312
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

1038
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:51,317
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing
that's been missing,

1039
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,155
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

1040
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:58,909
I would like for it."
Mary's like, "All right."

1041
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:03,413
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.

1042
01:12:03,497 --> 01:12:07,418
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

1043
01:12:07,502 --> 01:12:11,422
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

1044
01:12:11,464 --> 01:12:13,800
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

1045
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:16,804
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

1046
01:12:16,887 --> 01:12:21,517
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."

1047
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,894
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1048
01:12:23,936 --> 01:12:27,357
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

1049
01:12:31,778 --> 01:12:35,741
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

1050
01:12:35,825 --> 01:12:39,078
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1051
01:12:39,162 --> 01:12:41,622
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin' by.

1052
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:43,666
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

1053
01:12:43,749 --> 01:12:47,212
You don't want to rush to judgment on
that one, 'cause they're not all like me.

1054
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:50,007
Oh. I'm sure.
It was nice to meet ya.

1055
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:52,759
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1056
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,931
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1057
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,642
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

1058
01:12:59,726 --> 01:13:01,424
Come on, Chuck.

1059
01:13:01,437 --> 01:13:03,146
You're walkin', bitch.
Will's takin' the car.

1060
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:06,442
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1061
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:09,445
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

1062
01:13:09,487 --> 01:13:13,407
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

1063
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:16,369
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1064
01:13:16,453 --> 01:13:18,371
don't start
thinkin' you're bad.

1065
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:20,736
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1066
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,919
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1067
01:13:24,002 --> 01:13:27,590
He knows once you see that shit-hole
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1068
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:29,675
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1069
01:13:29,759 --> 01:13:32,178
We're gonna do that
another time.

1070
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:34,180
All right.

1071
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:38,393
Need them keys.

1072
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:42,481
The stewardess hears this
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1073
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:45,902
I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee."

1074
01:13:45,985 --> 01:13:47,987
No shit! You didn't say that.

1075
01:13:48,071 --> 01:13:50,490
For Christ's sake, Marty,
it's a joke.

1076
01:13:50,532 --> 01:13:51,604
I know someone that
actually happened to, Marty.

1077
01:13:51,617 --> 01:13:52,700
A joke.

1078
01:13:52,784 --> 01:13:54,369
- Gerry.
- Hi.

1079
01:13:54,452 --> 01:13:56,413
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

1080
01:13:56,497 --> 01:14:00,376
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1081
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:02,586
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

1082
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,588
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

1083
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:07,133
Um, no, just a Perrier.

1084
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:09,135
That's French for club soda.

1085
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,805
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

1086
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:13,807
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1087
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,143
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

1088
01:14:16,227 --> 01:14:18,396
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1089
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:20,147
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

1090
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:24,987
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

1091
01:14:28,282 --> 01:14:32,119
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1092
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:37,792
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.

1093
01:14:37,876 --> 01:14:41,754
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1094
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:45,968
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1095
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:49,763
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1096
01:14:49,805 --> 01:14:53,350
Maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1097
01:14:53,434 --> 01:14:57,314
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1098
01:14:57,397 --> 01:15:00,706
The kind of place where a mind
like Will's is given free rein.

1099
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:06,421
That's great that there are offers, but
I don't really think he's ready for that.

1100
01:15:10,175 --> 01:15:12,385
I'm not sure
you understand, Sean.

1101
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:15,222
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1102
01:15:15,306 --> 01:15:18,476
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1103
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:20,895
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

1104
01:15:20,978 --> 01:15:23,439
Tim, can you help us?

1105
01:15:23,481 --> 01:15:25,942
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1106
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,402
Uh-oh.

1107
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:30,906
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1108
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:33,658
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1109
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:39,123
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1110
01:15:39,207 --> 01:15:42,960
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1111
01:15:43,002 --> 01:15:44,963
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

1112
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:51,428
This isn't about me, Sean.

1113
01:15:51,512 --> 01:15:54,348
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

1114
01:15:57,852 --> 01:15:59,813
You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau?

1115
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:04,526
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors
renown for their study of the universe.

1116
01:16:04,609 --> 01:16:09,156
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

1117
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,826
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1118
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:13,869
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1119
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:16,456
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.

1120
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,167
We all would have
lost something.

1121
01:16:19,209 --> 01:16:21,211
Tim would never
have heard of him.

1122
01:16:21,294 --> 01:16:24,381
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1123
01:16:24,464 --> 01:16:27,051
This boy has that gift.

1124
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:29,637
He just doesn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1125
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:35,018
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young
man graduated from University of Michigan.

1126
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,355
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.

1127
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:40,858
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1128
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,431
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1129
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:43,986
Showed amazing potential.

1130
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:46,990
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1131
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:49,993
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1132
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:51,911
Haven't heard of him.

1133
01:16:51,995 --> 01:16:53,913
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1134
01:16:53,997 --> 01:16:56,750
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1135
01:16:58,669 --> 01:17:01,755
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1136
01:17:01,839 --> 01:17:03,757
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah-

1137
01:17:03,841 --> 01:17:06,219
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1138
01:17:06,261 --> 01:17:08,346
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1139
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:11,266
- Sean-
- We have to let him find-

1140
01:17:11,349 --> 01:17:14,060
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1141
01:17:14,144 --> 01:17:16,105
to ruin this boy's life!

1142
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:18,608
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,

1143
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:21,110
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1144
01:17:21,194 --> 01:17:23,613
Maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1145
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:26,450
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1146
01:17:26,533 --> 01:17:30,454
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1147
01:17:30,537 --> 01:17:32,956
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about the boy.

1148
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,752
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1149
01:17:35,835 --> 01:17:39,088
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1150
01:17:39,172 --> 01:17:41,799
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1151
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:46,639
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

1152
01:17:46,722 --> 01:17:48,891
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1153
01:17:48,974 --> 01:17:51,101
Nice to be in the loop.

1154
01:17:51,143 --> 01:17:54,772
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1155
01:17:54,814 --> 01:17:59,277
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

1156
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:01,696
We've already
offered you a position.

1157
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,782
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1158
01:18:03,865 --> 01:18:07,119
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin'.

1159
01:18:07,203 --> 01:18:10,456
But I think we all know that person is
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1160
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,668
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

1161
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:18,465
Retainer! Retainer.

1162
01:18:18,549 --> 01:18:21,301
You want us to give you
cash right now?

1163
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:25,473
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-
Now, I didn't say that.

1164
01:18:25,515 --> 01:18:30,770
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,

1165
01:18:30,854 --> 01:18:34,691
would be concurrently
improved if I had...

1166
01:18:34,732 --> 01:18:37,403
$200 in my back pocket
right now.

1167
01:18:37,486 --> 01:18:42,491
I don't think I can-Larry?

1168
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:46,788
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

1169
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:51,626
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1170
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:57,049
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town,

1171
01:18:57,091 --> 01:18:59,844
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,

1172
01:18:59,886 --> 01:19:02,513
you can bet
I'll be lookin' into you.

1173
01:19:02,555 --> 01:19:07,519
Now, any business
we have heretofore,

1174
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:11,398
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1175
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,609
Good day, gentlemen.

1176
01:19:13,692 --> 01:19:17,405
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1177
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:33,672
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1178
01:19:33,756 --> 01:19:35,800
Yeah.

1179
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:37,802
Good.

1180
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:41,515
- Want some help?
- No!

1181
01:19:41,598 --> 01:19:44,768
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we'll go to the batting cages.

1182
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:47,063
No.

1183
01:19:47,104 --> 01:19:50,775
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1184
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:54,612
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

1185
01:19:54,695 --> 01:19:59,618
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1186
01:20:01,995 --> 01:20:05,667
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1187
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,505
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

1188
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:14,175
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1189
01:20:14,259 --> 01:20:16,220
Do you have
a photographic memory?

1190
01:20:18,389 --> 01:20:20,337
I don't know. I just
kind of remember. I

1191
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:22,309
mean, how do you remember
your phone number?

1192
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,311
You just do.

1193
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:27,274
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1194
01:20:27,315 --> 01:20:30,235
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1195
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:32,863
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1196
01:20:32,946 --> 01:20:35,575
Are you mad?

1197
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:38,160
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1198
01:20:38,244 --> 01:20:42,832
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a
necessity, especially for someone like you.

1199
01:20:42,915 --> 01:20:45,377
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1200
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:49,715
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1201
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:54,303
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.

1202
01:20:54,386 --> 01:20:57,182
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1203
01:20:57,265 --> 01:21:01,227
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1204
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:06,984
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don't understand.

1205
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,153
I don't understand
how your mind works.

1206
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,447
- Did you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1207
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,657
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1208
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:16,024
Yeah, a bit.

1209
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,330
So when you look at a
piano, you see Mozart.

1210
01:21:18,371 --> 01:21:22,000
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?

1211
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:25,838
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1212
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:27,111
So what are you saying?
You play the piano?

1213
01:21:27,124 --> 01:21:28,283
Not a lick.

1214
01:21:28,299 --> 01:21:32,178
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1215
01:21:32,261 --> 01:21:37,059
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.

1216
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:41,104
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1217
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:46,611
And I can't play the piano. - But you
can do my O-chem paper in under an hour.

1218
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:52,200
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to
stuff like that, I could always just play.

1219
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,538
That's the best
I can explain it.

1220
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:59,625
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1221
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:02,461
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1222
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:04,463
Well-

1223
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:23,651
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1224
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:26,822
I've been here for four years,

1225
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:30,325
and I've only just found you.

1226
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,744
Well, you found me.

1227
01:22:44,549 --> 01:22:48,387
- Are you awake?
- No.

1228
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,849
Yes, you are.

1229
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:01,359
What?

1230
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:06,490
I want you to come
to California with me.

1231
01:23:11,245 --> 01:23:16,001
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

1232
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:19,171
Yeah, but how do you know?

1233
01:23:19,254 --> 01:23:23,383
I don't know. I just know.

1234
01:23:23,467 --> 01:23:26,221
Yeah, but how do you know?

1235
01:23:26,304 --> 01:23:29,390
I know because I feel it.

1236
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:31,860
Because that's a really
serious thing you're saying.

1237
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,312
I know.

1238
01:23:34,395 --> 01:23:36,857
You could be in California
next week...

1239
01:23:36,941 --> 01:23:40,110
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

1240
01:23:40,194 --> 01:23:42,238
Maybe you wish
you hadn't said that,

1241
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:44,761
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

1242
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:47,943
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me,

1243
01:23:47,953 --> 01:23:52,499
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

1244
01:23:52,582 --> 01:23:58,464
I don't want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.

1245
01:23:58,548 --> 01:24:02,260
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so-

1246
01:24:03,344 --> 01:24:05,305
Why not?

1247
01:24:05,347 --> 01:24:09,476
Well, one, because
I got a job here.

1248
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,813
And, two, because I live here.

1249
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:17,402
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

1250
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:19,404
I'm not sayin'
I don't love you.

1251
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:24,659
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1252
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:27,663
What am I so scared of?

1253
01:24:27,705 --> 01:24:30,457
Well, what aren't
you scared of?

1254
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:33,502
You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you-

1255
01:24:33,586 --> 01:24:37,507
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1256
01:24:37,549 --> 01:24:40,135
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

1257
01:24:40,176 --> 01:24:43,013
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1258
01:24:43,096 --> 01:24:45,016
who your parents
will approve of...

1259
01:24:45,099 --> 01:24:47,101
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1260
01:24:47,184 --> 01:24:50,021
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1261
01:24:50,062 --> 01:24:54,483
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

1262
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:59,031
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1263
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:04,536
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1264
01:25:04,578 --> 01:25:08,249
That I would give it back in a second if it
meant I could have one more day with him.

1265
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:11,711
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

1266
01:25:11,794 --> 01:25:15,674
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1267
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:17,676
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1268
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:20,262
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1269
01:25:20,346 --> 01:25:22,514
You know what? I'm afraid too.

1270
01:25:22,598 --> 01:25:25,727
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

1271
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:29,648
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

1272
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:32,025
All right.

1273
01:25:32,108 --> 01:25:34,236
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1274
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:36,372
What do you want to know? That
I don't have 12 brothers?

1275
01:25:36,385 --> 01:25:38,449
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1276
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,576
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

1277
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,871
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1278
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:46,375
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1279
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:49,378
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't
want to hear that shit, Skylar!

1280
01:25:49,419 --> 01:25:51,713
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want that shit!

1281
01:25:51,797 --> 01:25:54,968
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

1282
01:25:55,051 --> 01:25:57,804
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1283
01:25:57,887 --> 01:25:59,806
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1284
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:01,891
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!

1285
01:26:01,975 --> 01:26:03,966
I love you.

1286
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:05,980
Don't bullshit me! Don't
you fuckin' bullshit me!

1287
01:26:06,063 --> 01:26:08,983
I love you.

1288
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:14,071
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1289
01:26:14,154 --> 01:26:18,243
Because if you say that...

1290
01:26:18,326 --> 01:26:21,746
then I won't call you...

1291
01:26:21,788 --> 01:26:25,918
and I won't be in your life.

1292
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:32,466
I don't love you.

1293
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:17,642
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1294
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:20,478
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1295
01:27:20,519 --> 01:27:24,148
They get convinced
they're stupid.

1296
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:27,194
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

1297
01:27:27,277 --> 01:27:30,614
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

1298
01:27:30,697 --> 01:27:33,659
not against you.

1299
01:27:36,871 --> 01:27:39,499
Hello, Will.

1300
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:41,834
Tom, can you get us
some coffee?

1301
01:27:41,918 --> 01:27:43,878
Sure.

1302
01:27:47,383 --> 01:27:50,511
Now, let's see.

1303
01:27:55,475 --> 01:27:58,687
Good. This is correct.

1304
01:28:00,188 --> 01:28:02,566
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1305
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:05,695
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but-

1306
01:28:05,778 --> 01:28:10,032
This can't be right.

1307
01:28:11,117 --> 01:28:14,036
This would be
very embarrassing.

1308
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,085
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1309
01:28:20,168 --> 01:28:22,337
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1310
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:26,551
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

1311
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:30,221
Yeah, sure. Did you think of
the possibility... That's right.

1312
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:35,519
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1313
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,649
What happened
at the McNeil meeting?

1314
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,735
I couldn't go. I had a date.

1315
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:45,906
So I sent my chief negotiator.

1316
01:28:49,743 --> 01:28:53,455
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1317
01:28:53,538 --> 01:28:56,167
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates,

1318
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,920
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1319
01:28:58,961 --> 01:29:01,172
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

1320
01:29:01,255 --> 01:29:03,674
I'll cancel 'em.

1321
01:29:03,758 --> 01:29:07,304
I'll give you a job myself. I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1322
01:29:07,471 --> 01:29:10,712
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of
my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1323
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:20,068
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1324
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:24,572
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

1325
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:27,952
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1326
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:30,120
I'm sorry you can't do this-
I really am-

1327
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:35,669
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1328
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:42,759
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1329
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:47,431
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1330
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,657
You're right, Will.

1331
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:10,498
I can't do this proof,
but you can.

1332
01:30:10,582 --> 01:30:14,627
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

1333
01:30:14,711 --> 01:30:16,839
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1334
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,174
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

1335
01:30:19,216 --> 01:30:21,302
Yeah, so am I.

1336
01:30:21,385 --> 01:30:26,516
Most days I wish
I never met you,

1337
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,227
because then I could
sleep at night.

1338
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:32,240
I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge

1339
01:30:32,253 --> 01:30:35,192
that there was someone
like you out there.

1340
01:30:41,574 --> 01:30:45,996
I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1341
01:30:52,169 --> 01:30:57,550
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

1342
01:30:57,592 --> 01:30:59,552
Morgan!

1343
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:02,315
If you're watchin'
pornos in my mom's room

1344
01:31:02,328 --> 01:31:05,059
again, I'm gonna give
you a fuckin' beatin'!

1345
01:31:20,992 --> 01:31:24,037
What's up, fellas?

1346
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:28,709
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your
own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1347
01:31:28,793 --> 01:31:32,922
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.

1348
01:31:33,005 --> 01:31:35,676
Come on. Not in my glove.

1349
01:31:35,759 --> 01:31:38,136
I didn't use the glove.

1350
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,737
That's my Little League glove.

1351
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:45,242
What do you want me to do?

1352
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,452
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1353
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,704
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1354
01:31:49,788 --> 01:31:52,916
I- I just used it for cleanup.

1355
01:31:52,999 --> 01:31:56,712
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1356
01:31:56,796 --> 01:31:59,924
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1357
01:32:01,676 --> 01:32:06,557
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1358
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,726
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1359
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:13,188
You'd be exposed to the kind of
technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,

1360
01:32:13,272 --> 01:32:15,858
because we've classified it.

1361
01:32:15,942 --> 01:32:19,612
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1362
01:32:19,654 --> 01:32:22,615
Code breaking.

1363
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:25,452
That's one aspect
of what we do.

1364
01:32:25,536 --> 01:32:28,163
Oh, come on.
That is what you do.

1365
01:32:28,247 --> 01:32:30,666
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1366
01:32:30,749 --> 01:32:33,252
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

1367
01:32:33,335 --> 01:32:39,134
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

1368
01:32:39,217 --> 01:32:43,096
So the way I see it,
the question isn't:

1369
01:32:43,179 --> 01:32:45,808
"Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?"

1370
01:32:45,892 --> 01:32:48,352
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1371
01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:52,315
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?

1372
01:32:52,398 --> 01:32:56,320
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1373
01:32:56,403 --> 01:32:59,156
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.

1374
01:32:59,197 --> 01:33:01,158
Something no one else
can break.

1375
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,160
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.

1376
01:33:03,201 --> 01:33:05,747
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1377
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,591
But maybe that code was
the location of some

1378
01:33:07,604 --> 01:33:09,375
rebel army in North
Africa or Middle East.

1379
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:12,503
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1380
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:16,842
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1381
01:33:16,884 --> 01:33:19,887
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in
the Marines to secure the area,"

1382
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:21,847
'cause they don't give a shit.

1383
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:23,849
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

1384
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:25,402
just like it wasn't them
when their number got

1385
01:33:25,415 --> 01:33:26,895
called 'cause they were
in the National Guard.

1386
01:33:26,978 --> 01:33:29,856
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1387
01:33:29,898 --> 01:33:31,978
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

1388
01:33:31,983 --> 01:33:34,444
got exported to the country
he got back from,

1389
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:36,864
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1390
01:33:36,906 --> 01:33:39,784
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

1391
01:33:39,867 --> 01:33:42,453
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1392
01:33:42,536 --> 01:33:45,666
was so we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1393
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:47,718
Of course, the oil
companies used a skirmish

1394
01:33:47,731 --> 01:33:49,753
over there to scare up
domestic oil prices.

1395
01:33:49,836 --> 01:33:51,868
A cute little ancillary
benefit for them, but

1396
01:33:51,881 --> 01:33:53,924
it ain't helpin' my
buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1397
01:33:54,007 --> 01:33:56,367
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1398
01:33:56,427 --> 01:33:58,555
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

1399
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:01,808
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'
play slalom with the icebergs.

1400
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:04,143
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1401
01:34:04,227 --> 01:34:06,689
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1402
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:09,066
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

1403
01:34:09,108 --> 01:34:11,068
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1404
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:13,904
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1405
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:16,491
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat,

1406
01:34:16,575 --> 01:34:18,493
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1407
01:34:18,577 --> 01:34:21,496
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

1408
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:26,586
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1409
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:30,506
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy,

1410
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:32,508
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,

1411
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:35,095
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,

1412
01:34:35,178 --> 01:34:37,848
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1413
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:40,475
I can be elected president.

1414
01:34:40,559 --> 01:34:43,812
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

1415
01:34:43,896 --> 01:34:47,525
Do you have a soul mate?

1416
01:34:47,609 --> 01:34:50,111
Do I have a-Define that.

1417
01:34:50,194 --> 01:34:52,113
Somebody who challenges you.

1418
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:55,125
Uh, Chuckie.

1419
01:34:55,138 --> 01:34:58,078
No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie
down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1420
01:34:58,162 --> 01:35:03,792
I'm talking about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1421
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:07,047
- I got-I got-
- Who?

1422
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:10,175
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1423
01:35:10,258 --> 01:35:13,261
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke-

1424
01:35:13,345 --> 01:35:15,556
That's great. They're all dead.

1425
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,192
Not to me they're not.

1426
01:35:17,205 --> 01:35:18,768
You don't have a lot
of dialogue with them.

1427
01:35:18,809 --> 01:35:22,230
You can't give back
to them, Will.

1428
01:35:22,313 --> 01:35:24,471
Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.

1429
01:35:24,484 --> 01:35:26,652
That's what I'm saying.

1430
01:35:26,735 --> 01:35:30,280
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1431
01:35:30,364 --> 01:35:32,824
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

1432
01:35:32,866 --> 01:35:36,663
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1433
01:35:36,746 --> 01:35:37,756
You gonna take the
professor's side on this?

1434
01:35:37,769 --> 01:35:38,790
Don't give me a line of shit.

1435
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:40,792
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

1436
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:42,835
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1437
01:35:42,877 --> 01:35:46,006
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1438
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:51,136
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1439
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,556
There are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1440
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:55,892
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1441
01:35:55,976 --> 01:35:58,478
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1442
01:35:58,562 --> 01:36:01,022
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this."

1443
01:36:01,064 --> 01:36:04,860
What do you mean, cop out? What's
wrong with layin' brick? - Nothing.

1444
01:36:04,944 --> 01:36:07,264
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1445
01:36:07,321 --> 01:36:10,199
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?

1446
01:36:10,241 --> 01:36:12,201
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1447
01:36:12,243 --> 01:36:14,453
Exactly. That's
an honorable profession.

1448
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:16,456
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

1449
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,458
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

1450
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:20,460
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1451
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:22,879
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1452
01:36:22,921 --> 01:36:25,425
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

1453
01:36:25,508 --> 01:36:26,998
And their wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1454
01:36:27,011 --> 01:36:28,511
That's right.

1455
01:36:28,595 --> 01:36:31,598
And that's honorable. I'm sure
that's why you took that job.

1456
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:33,683
I mean, for the honor of it.

1457
01:36:33,766 --> 01:36:38,397
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1458
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,324
Why did you work at
the most prestigious

1459
01:36:40,337 --> 01:36:42,192
technical college in the
whole fuckin' world?

1460
01:36:42,276 --> 01:36:45,572
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1461
01:36:45,614 --> 01:36:51,536
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

1462
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:54,581
'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1463
01:36:57,793 --> 01:37:00,421
So what do you really wanna do?

1464
01:37:03,799 --> 01:37:05,802
I wanna be a shepherd.

1465
01:37:05,928 --> 01:37:07,721
Really?

1466
01:37:07,804 --> 01:37:09,774
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little

1467
01:37:09,787 --> 01:37:11,767
spread, get some sheep
and tend to them.

1468
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,770
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1469
01:37:14,854 --> 01:37:16,323
You know, if you're gonna
jerk off, why don't

1470
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:17,815
you just do it at home
with a moist towel?

1471
01:37:17,857 --> 01:37:19,859
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1472
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:21,861
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1473
01:37:21,945 --> 01:37:23,268
I'm not leavin'. No.

1474
01:37:23,281 --> 01:37:24,614
You're not gonna answer,
you're wastin' my time.

1475
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:26,659
I thought we were friends.

1476
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,329
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

1477
01:37:30,412 --> 01:37:33,749
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1478
01:37:33,832 --> 01:37:36,044
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1479
01:37:36,127 --> 01:37:39,214
Where's your soul mate? You wanna
talk about soul mates? Where is she?

1480
01:37:39,297 --> 01:37:41,424
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1481
01:37:41,508 --> 01:37:44,219
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away?

1482
01:37:44,302 --> 01:37:46,397
At least I played a hand.

1483
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,516
You played a hand and you lost.
You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1484
01:37:48,557 --> 01:37:51,978
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1485
01:37:52,061 --> 01:37:55,148
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1486
01:38:02,072 --> 01:38:06,327
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1487
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:10,123
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can't give me a straight answer,

1488
01:38:10,206 --> 01:38:14,168
because you don't know.

1489
01:38:15,838 --> 01:38:18,048
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

1490
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:23,137
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1491
01:38:27,892 --> 01:38:30,103
Shepherd.

1492
01:38:30,186 --> 01:38:32,272
White little prick.

1493
01:38:33,523 --> 01:38:35,484
I just wanted to, you know, um,

1494
01:38:35,568 --> 01:38:39,071
call you up,
uh, before you left, um-

1495
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,741
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

1496
01:38:41,824 --> 01:38:43,784
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1497
01:38:43,826 --> 01:38:46,538
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

1498
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah.

1499
01:38:52,586 --> 01:38:54,504
I love you.

1500
01:38:58,843 --> 01:39:01,346
Will?

1501
01:39:01,429 --> 01:39:04,265
You take care.

1502
01:40:15,136 --> 01:40:17,847
Will, come on. Will!

1503
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:22,018
Will, that's it! We're done!

1504
01:40:22,059 --> 01:40:26,815
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1505
01:40:26,898 --> 01:40:28,900
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

1506
01:40:28,984 --> 01:40:31,028
An hour and ten minutes late.

1507
01:40:34,489 --> 01:40:37,994
Well, if he doesn't show up and I file
a report saying he wasn't here...

1508
01:40:38,077 --> 01:40:41,956
and he goes back to jail,
he won't be on my conscience.

1509
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,963
Okay. Fine.

1510
01:40:49,506 --> 01:40:52,301
What's up?

1511
01:40:53,385 --> 01:40:55,305
Thanks.

1512
01:40:57,933 --> 01:41:01,853
Ah! God, that's good.

1513
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:08,152
So how's your lady?

1514
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:11,072
Ah, she's gone.

1515
01:41:11,113 --> 01:41:13,449
Gone? Gone where?

1516
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:17,204
Med school.
Medical school in California.

1517
01:41:17,287 --> 01:41:19,206
- Really?
- Yeah.

1518
01:41:19,289 --> 01:41:22,251
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1519
01:41:26,631 --> 01:41:28,549
That sucks.

1520
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:35,099
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings?

1521
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,184
I think the week after I'm 21.

1522
01:41:37,268 --> 01:41:39,979
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

1523
01:41:40,062 --> 01:41:44,275
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1524
01:41:44,358 --> 01:41:47,779
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

1525
01:41:47,821 --> 01:41:49,823
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1526
01:41:49,864 --> 01:41:53,243
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1527
01:41:53,326 --> 01:41:55,538
What do I want a way
outta here for?

1528
01:41:55,621 --> 01:41:57,873
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

1529
01:41:57,957 --> 01:42:00,042
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1530
01:42:00,126 --> 01:42:04,714
Fuckin' take 'em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1531
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:09,678
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

1532
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:12,681
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

1533
01:42:12,723 --> 01:42:15,977
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

1534
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,354
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1535
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:20,982
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1536
01:42:21,065 --> 01:42:23,234
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

1537
01:42:23,318 --> 01:42:26,488
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

1538
01:42:26,572 --> 01:42:30,451
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1539
01:42:30,534 --> 01:42:32,587
What if I don't want to?

1540
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,663
No, no, no. Fuck you. You
don't owe it to yourself.

1541
01:42:34,747 --> 01:42:37,000
You owe it to me,

1542
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:39,628
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

1543
01:42:39,711 --> 01:42:42,172
and I'll still
be doin' this shit.

1544
01:42:42,255 --> 01:42:44,799
That's all right. That's fine.

1545
01:42:44,884 --> 01:42:47,470
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1546
01:42:47,553 --> 01:42:51,223
You're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1547
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:56,188
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1548
01:42:56,229 --> 01:42:59,107
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

1549
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:01,860
Be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1550
01:43:01,902 --> 01:43:04,488
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1551
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:06,699
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1552
01:43:06,741 --> 01:43:08,481
No. You don't know that.

1553
01:43:08,494 --> 01:43:10,244
Oh, I don't know that. Let
me tell you what I do know.

1554
01:43:10,328 --> 01:43:14,207
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1555
01:43:14,248 --> 01:43:18,253
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it's great.

1556
01:43:18,337 --> 01:43:21,048
You know what the
best part of my day is?

1557
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:23,289
It's for about ten
seconds: From when I pull

1558
01:43:23,302 --> 01:43:25,512
up to the curb and when
I get to your door.

1559
01:43:25,595 --> 01:43:27,919
'Cause I think maybe
I'll get up there and

1560
01:43:27,932 --> 01:43:30,267
I'll knock on the door
and you won't be there.

1561
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:33,812
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.

1562
01:43:33,895 --> 01:43:38,192
I don't know much,
but I know that.

1563
01:43:50,539 --> 01:43:53,041
This is a disaster, Sean.

1564
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:55,503
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy,

1565
01:43:55,545 --> 01:43:57,547
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1566
01:43:57,630 --> 01:43:59,590
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

1567
01:43:59,674 --> 01:44:02,302
I don't care if you have a few laughs,
even at my expense.

1568
01:44:02,385 --> 01:44:03,773
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1569
01:44:03,786 --> 01:44:05,185
Undermine?

1570
01:44:05,222 --> 01:44:07,266
This boy is at
a fragile point right now.

1571
01:44:07,349 --> 01:44:10,352
I do understand. He is at
a fragile point. He's got problems.

1572
01:44:10,394 --> 01:44:13,981
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

1573
01:44:14,064 --> 01:44:17,152
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1574
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:21,197
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1575
01:44:21,281 --> 01:44:24,826
He can handle the problems. He can
handle the work. He obviously handled you.

1576
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:27,455
Listen to me. Why is he hiding?

1577
01:44:27,538 --> 01:44:29,457
Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1578
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,459
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

1579
01:44:31,542 --> 01:44:33,461
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to love him the most.

1580
01:44:33,544 --> 01:44:35,547
Don't give me
that Freudian crap.

1581
01:44:35,631 --> 01:44:37,966
Why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1582
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:41,637
Because any one of them, if he asked
them to, would take a bat to your head.

1583
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,640
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1584
01:44:44,723 --> 01:44:47,894
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

1585
01:44:47,935 --> 01:44:50,480
It's a defense mechanism,
all right?

1586
01:44:50,563 --> 01:44:53,274
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

1587
01:44:53,358 --> 01:44:56,028
If you push him right now, it's gonna
be the same thing all over again.

1588
01:44:56,111 --> 01:44:58,030
I'm not gonna
let that happen to him.

1589
01:44:58,113 --> 01:45:00,032
- Don't you do that.
- What?

1590
01:45:00,115 --> 01:45:02,001
Don't infect him with
the idea that it's okay

1591
01:45:02,014 --> 01:45:03,911
to quit, that it's
okay to be a failure.

1592
01:45:03,953 --> 01:45:05,914
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1593
01:45:05,956 --> 01:45:07,842
And if you're angry at
me for being successful,

1594
01:45:07,855 --> 01:45:09,751
for being what you
could have been-

1595
01:45:09,834 --> 01:45:12,671
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1596
01:45:12,754 --> 01:45:16,884
You resent me, but I'm not gonna
apologize for any success I've had.

1597
01:45:16,968 --> 01:45:19,720
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

1598
01:45:19,804 --> 01:45:21,931
But ask yourself, Sean-
Ask yourself...

1599
01:45:21,973 --> 01:45:25,394
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1600
01:45:25,477 --> 01:45:27,479
You arrogant shit!

1601
01:45:27,562 --> 01:45:29,803
That's why I don't come
to the goddamn reunions,

1602
01:45:29,816 --> 01:45:32,067
'cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1603
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:35,154
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1604
01:45:35,238 --> 01:45:37,240
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1605
01:45:37,323 --> 01:45:41,786
I'm proud of what I do. It was
a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!

1606
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:44,622
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1607
01:45:44,664 --> 01:45:48,294
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
you around going, "The Field's medal!"

1608
01:45:48,377 --> 01:45:51,714
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

1609
01:45:51,797 --> 01:45:53,829
It's about my medal, isn't it?
Oh, God, I could

1610
01:45:53,842 --> 01:45:55,885
go home and get it for you.
You can have it.

1611
01:45:55,969 --> 01:45:58,930
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

1612
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:01,016
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal,

1613
01:46:01,099 --> 01:46:03,059
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

1614
01:46:03,143 --> 01:46:04,946
when you were pimple-faced
and homesick and

1615
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:06,772
didn't know what side
of the bed to piss on.

1616
01:46:06,856 --> 01:46:08,816
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1617
01:46:08,899 --> 01:46:10,860
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

1618
01:46:10,901 --> 01:46:13,321
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

1619
01:46:13,362 --> 01:46:16,158
You mathematical dick!
It's about the boy!

1620
01:46:16,199 --> 01:46:18,690
He's a good kid! And I
won't see you fuck him

1621
01:46:18,703 --> 01:46:21,204
up like you're tryin' to
fuck up me right now.

1622
01:46:21,288 --> 01:46:23,790
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

1623
01:46:23,874 --> 01:46:27,337
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

1624
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:33,092
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

1625
01:46:33,176 --> 01:46:35,220
He's not you! You get that!

1626
01:46:37,348 --> 01:46:39,183
I can come back.

1627
01:46:39,266 --> 01:46:43,354
No, come in.
Uh, I was just leaving.

1628
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:57,495
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

1629
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,622
You know. Not about you.

1630
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:06,380
What is that?

1631
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:10,759
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

1632
01:47:10,842 --> 01:47:15,974
Oh. Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

1633
01:47:19,644 --> 01:47:21,854
What's it say?

1634
01:47:23,231 --> 01:47:25,901
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1635
01:47:27,611 --> 01:47:30,823
Have you had any, uh,
experience with that?

1636
01:47:30,906 --> 01:47:34,493
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1637
01:47:34,576 --> 01:47:38,915
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

1638
01:47:42,919 --> 01:47:46,424
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1639
01:47:46,507 --> 01:47:48,467
Yeah, I have.

1640
01:47:48,509 --> 01:47:50,553
It sure ain't good.

1641
01:47:53,973 --> 01:47:56,101
My father was an alcoholic.

1642
01:47:56,143 --> 01:47:58,979
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1643
01:48:00,605 --> 01:48:03,608
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1644
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:08,197
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go
after my mother and little brother.

1645
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:12,452
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

1646
01:48:13,494 --> 01:48:16,957
He used to just put a wrench,

1647
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:19,793
a stick and a belt
on the table.

1648
01:48:19,870 --> 01:48:23,894
- Just say, "Choose."
- Well, I gotta go with the belt there.

1649
01:48:23,978 --> 01:48:25,939
I used to go with the wrench.

1650
01:48:25,981 --> 01:48:27,983
Why the wrench?

1651
01:48:28,066 --> 01:48:30,444
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1652
01:48:30,485 --> 01:48:34,114
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1653
01:48:34,156 --> 01:48:38,077
So, uh, what is it, like,
Will has an attachment disorder?

1654
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:40,455
Is it all that stuff?

1655
01:48:40,538 --> 01:48:43,458
Fear of abandonment?

1656
01:48:43,499 --> 01:48:46,545
Is that why I broke up
with Skylar?

1657
01:48:46,629 --> 01:48:49,965
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1658
01:48:50,007 --> 01:48:53,969
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1659
01:48:56,181 --> 01:49:02,020
Hey, Will, I don't know a lot.

1660
01:49:02,103 --> 01:49:05,524
You see this? All this shit?

1661
01:49:10,529 --> 01:49:12,615
It's not your fault.

1662
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:17,079
Yeah, I know that.

1663
01:49:17,162 --> 01:49:20,123
Look at me, son.

1664
01:49:20,207 --> 01:49:23,710
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

1665
01:49:23,794 --> 01:49:28,424
No. It's not your fault.

1666
01:49:28,508 --> 01:49:30,426
I know.

1667
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:35,015
No, no, you don't.
It's not your fault.

1668
01:49:35,099 --> 01:49:37,059
- Hmm?
- I know.

1669
01:49:37,142 --> 01:49:39,853
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

1670
01:49:39,937 --> 01:49:42,398
It's not your fault.

1671
01:49:44,275 --> 01:49:49,531
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

1672
01:49:49,614 --> 01:49:51,992
It's not your fault.

1673
01:49:52,075 --> 01:49:55,621
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1674
01:49:55,705 --> 01:49:58,249
It's not your fault.

1675
01:50:03,462 --> 01:50:07,551
It's not your fault.

1676
01:50:13,765 --> 01:50:21,566
My God- My God! I'm so sorry!
My God!

1677
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:37,917
Fuck them, okay?

1678
01:52:04,012 --> 01:52:06,044
Can I help you?

1679
01:52:06,057 --> 01:52:08,100
Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.
I'm here about a position.

1680
01:52:08,183 --> 01:52:10,602
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

1681
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:17,569
Yes, there's
a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1682
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:39,676
Which one did you take?

1683
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,681
I was over at McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1684
01:52:44,765 --> 01:52:49,145
I haven't told him yet, but I went
down there and talked to my boss-

1685
01:52:49,187 --> 01:52:52,649
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1686
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:58,113
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

1687
01:52:58,197 --> 01:53:01,200
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1688
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:03,202
Thanks.

1689
01:53:06,289 --> 01:53:08,208
Time's up.

1690
01:53:11,169 --> 01:53:14,422
So that's-So that's it?
So we're done?

1691
01:53:14,506 --> 01:53:17,301
Yeah, that's it.

1692
01:53:17,385 --> 01:53:20,221
You're done. You're a free man.

1693
01:53:21,514 --> 01:53:26,228
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that-

1694
01:53:26,311 --> 01:53:28,313
You're welcome, Will.

1695
01:53:33,443 --> 01:53:36,489
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1696
01:53:36,572 --> 01:53:39,033
Yeah, me too.

1697
01:53:39,117 --> 01:53:41,744
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but, uh-

1698
01:53:41,828 --> 01:53:45,541
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1699
01:53:45,582 --> 01:53:49,420
So, here's the number.

1700
01:53:49,503 --> 01:53:53,382
You call that.
I'll get back to you right away.

1701
01:53:53,424 --> 01:53:56,553
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1702
01:53:56,594 --> 01:54:01,182
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1703
01:54:02,434 --> 01:54:05,438
You do what's in your heart,
son. You'll be fine.

1704
01:54:09,942 --> 01:54:14,238
- Thank you, Sean.
- Uh- Thank you, Will.

1705
01:54:15,949 --> 01:54:19,244
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

1706
01:54:19,328 --> 01:54:21,496
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

1707
01:54:25,293 --> 01:54:27,462
- Take care.
- You too.

1708
01:54:27,545 --> 01:54:29,464
Yeah.

1709
01:54:31,299 --> 01:54:33,301
Hey.

1710
01:54:33,384 --> 01:54:35,763
Good luck, son.

1711
01:54:46,858 --> 01:54:49,653
Two beers.

1712
01:54:52,364 --> 01:54:54,407
What's up? Did you guys go?

1713
01:54:54,491 --> 01:54:56,827
No. I had to talk him down.

1714
01:54:56,911 --> 01:54:58,755
Why didn't you yoke him?

1715
01:54:58,768 --> 01:55:00,623
Little Morgan's got a
lot of scrap to him.

1716
01:55:00,665 --> 01:55:02,625
People try to whip
his ass every week.

1717
01:55:02,667 --> 01:55:05,170
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you sayin' about me?

1718
01:55:05,212 --> 01:55:08,715
Was I talkin' to you?
None of your fuckin' business.

1719
01:55:08,799 --> 01:55:12,052
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

1720
01:55:12,135 --> 01:55:14,137
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1721
01:55:14,179 --> 01:55:18,017
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1722
01:55:18,101 --> 01:55:20,687
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1723
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:22,689
All right. Who's first?

1724
01:55:22,772 --> 01:55:25,192
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

1725
01:55:27,277 --> 01:55:30,823
Here's your present.

1726
01:55:30,864 --> 01:55:32,866
- Come on, bro.
- What?

1727
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:37,205
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1728
01:55:37,288 --> 01:55:41,167
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so-

1729
01:55:41,209 --> 01:55:45,297
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That's not what I was sayin'!

1730
01:55:45,381 --> 01:55:47,842
But, uh, you're 21 now.

1731
01:55:47,925 --> 01:55:51,512
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1732
01:55:51,554 --> 01:55:54,056
- How do you like it?
- This is like-

1733
01:55:56,518 --> 01:56:00,439
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

1734
01:56:00,522 --> 01:56:02,524
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1735
01:56:02,607 --> 01:56:07,572
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts,

1736
01:56:07,613 --> 01:56:09,699
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

1737
01:56:09,741 --> 01:56:11,701
I had the router to do
all the bodywork.

1738
01:56:11,743 --> 01:56:13,703
Yeah, I have a fuckin' job,
too, brother.

1739
01:56:13,745 --> 01:56:16,206
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1740
01:56:16,248 --> 01:56:18,334
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1741
01:56:18,417 --> 01:56:20,627
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

1742
01:56:20,711 --> 01:56:24,381
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1743
01:56:24,423 --> 01:56:26,384
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1744
01:56:26,426 --> 01:56:29,512
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1745
01:56:29,596 --> 01:56:32,974
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1746
01:56:40,066 --> 01:56:41,984
Hi.

1747
01:56:43,444 --> 01:56:45,489
Come on in.

1748
01:56:47,616 --> 01:56:52,663
Sean, I, um- Me too, Gerry.

1749
01:56:52,746 --> 01:56:55,083
Yeah. Good.

1750
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:58,294
I heard you're
takin' some time.

1751
01:56:58,378 --> 01:57:02,965
Yeah. Travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1752
01:57:03,049 --> 01:57:05,010
So where are you going?

1753
01:57:05,094 --> 01:57:09,098
India and China and Baltimore.

1754
01:57:10,349 --> 01:57:12,434
Oh.

1755
01:57:12,476 --> 01:57:14,478
You know when you'll be back?

1756
01:57:14,561 --> 01:57:17,983
Oh. I got this flyer
the other day.

1757
01:57:18,024 --> 01:57:20,860
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1758
01:57:20,944 --> 01:57:22,862
Yeah, I got one of those too.

1759
01:57:22,946 --> 01:57:24,865
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

1760
01:57:24,949 --> 01:57:27,827
The drinks at
those things are free.

1761
01:57:27,868 --> 01:57:31,372
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1762
01:57:35,752 --> 01:57:39,548
- Oh.
- How about a drink right now?

1763
01:57:39,631 --> 01:57:42,801
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1764
01:57:42,843 --> 01:57:45,221
Come on. This one's on me.

1765
01:57:48,016 --> 01:57:50,351
- I got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh!

1766
01:57:50,435 --> 01:57:53,771
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1767
01:57:53,855 --> 01:57:56,150
This is my ticket to paradise.

1768
01:57:56,233 --> 01:57:58,319
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

1769
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,405
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1770
01:58:01,488 --> 01:58:03,615
I still have a shot, you know?

1771
01:58:03,699 --> 01:58:06,607
Yes, just about as big
chance as you being hit

1772
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,539
by lightning here on the
staircase right now.

1773
01:58:09,622 --> 01:58:12,876
It's a possibility too. I mean,
32 million. If you look at the size-

1774
01:59:42,349 --> 01:59:44,768
Will!

1775
02:00:03,789 --> 02:00:05,709
Will?

1776
02:01:12,949 --> 02:01:14,910
He's not there.

1777
02:01:35,975 --> 02:01:39,270
Sean, if
the professor calls about that job,

1778
02:01:39,311 --> 02:01:43,899
just tell him sorry,
I had to go see about a girl.

1779
02:01:43,983 --> 02:01:45,902
Will.

1780
02:01:47,487 --> 02:01:50,824
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1781
02:02:20,487 --> 02:02:27,487
Thanks for using the subs
 regards, shock
