00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,893
Michael! [laughs] How funny you are here.

157
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,229
I never see you
at these sexy gay weekends.

158
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,522
Hello, Horst.

159
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,731
I heard you were dumped.

160
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm sorry. But now you're in the same boat
as the rest of us, ja?

161
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,904
Care to join me
and my ski pals for dinner?

162
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,116
-No, thanks. I'm here with my own friends.
-[both drawl] Hi.

163
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,827
Hi, what a good idea. Boys' trip!

164
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,373
It's the perfect thing to do when your
hot ex is on a romantic getaway in Miami.

165
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,960
What are you talking about?
Colin's in Miami?

166
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,172
Ja. My favorite instructor
at Barry's Boot Camp's ex-husband Robbie

167
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,173
is dating him.

168
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,425
I saw a picture of them in Miami
on his Instagram.

169
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,554
Why didn't you tell me you split up?
He really was so hot.

170
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,849
We'll be at the fondue pot at 8:00.

171
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,143
I'll save you a fork
if you change your mind.

172
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,147
-Oh my God.
-Michael, don't get crazy.

173
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,524
Yeah, maybe Eva Braun
over there is mistaken.

174
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,442
You heard him.

175
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,736
He saw them on his favorite
Barry's Boot Camp instructor's

176
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,362
ex-husband Robbie's Instagram.

177
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,908
Well, whatever. This is the last thing
you should be thinking about.

178
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,786
Do you think it's just a fling, or this
Robbie's a real person with a real job?

179
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,499
And if they're on some romantic getaway
in Miami, do you think this is serious?

180
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,583
Wh-- what are you doing?

181
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,336
I'm searching Horst's Instagram
for Robbie's profile.

182
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,423
Wait, you don't think Colin would bring
him to the Jonathans' wedding, do you?

183
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,466
Oh my God.

184
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,845
I'm going to have to sit there and watch
Colin start his new future. Shit!

185
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,683
Horst knows, like, eight Robbies,
and half of them have private accounts.

186
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,185
Michael, snap out of it!

187
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,561
You have Corey.

188
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,940
Or you will when you remember
you're at gay ski weekend to have fun,

189
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,233
not obsess over your ex.

190
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,610
Exactly. Let it go.

191
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,738
You're right. You're right.

192
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,659
I have Corey. I don't need to care
about where Colin is. I will.

193
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,369
I will let it go, for real.

194
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,330
But I will take
one more of those fireball shots!

195
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,290
♪ Baby, I'm about to blow… ♪

196
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,672
-Sorry, you're not on the list.
-♪ Baby, I'm about to blow… ♪

197
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,631
Fuck that list.

198
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,551
Do you see two fine-ass ladies
tryin' to get in the club?

199
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,513
Can you look again under Suzanne Prentiss,
double S, as in super special?

200
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,432
Didn't you two yell at me
when I worked at Soho House?

201
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,560
-Nope. Never been.
-That's racist.

202
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,604
Okay. Just check with Trey.

203
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,440
Fine. Step aside, please.

204
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,818
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

205
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,529
And remind him
that it's Kai's mother plus two.

206
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,699
What a minute, plus two?
Who else is comin'?

207
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,410
Oh, client. She's about to get a divorce.

208
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,621
She wants to rub it in her ex-husband's
face that she's partyin' at Ten West.

209
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,791
Okay, I get that.
But how is she? Is she chill?

210
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,294
Sorry I'm late.

211
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,047
I laid out 15 outfits on the bed
and then just went with all black.

212
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,258
I look like I flew here on a broom.

213
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,175
You look great.

214
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,052
-So great I wanna make out with ya.
-Oh!

215
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,262
-Ha-ha!
-[both chuckle]

216
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,221
[host] Trey vouched.

217
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,098
-You can go up.
-Thank you.

218
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,308
Attitude!

219
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,895
You must be Mia. I'm Claire Lewis.
Thank you for letting me crash your party.

220
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,689
-[all chuckle]
-Let's check my fur.

221
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,943
You won't like her at first,
but you'll warm up as the night goes on.

222
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,361
Appreciate the heads-up.

223
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,614
-Let's go, ladies!
-[Mia] Whoo!

224
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,616
-♪ Baby, I'm about to blow… ♪
-Hey!

225
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,994
Oh, this is cute!
We got cute ones in here tonight!

226
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
Aah! [laughs]

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,414
Oh my God, look!

228
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,498
Suzanne!

229
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,791
Oh, hey, Trey.

230
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,961
I'm so sorry. Kai asked me
to put you on the list, and I spaced.

231
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,340
I feel awful, trust me. I don't like
to disappoint a beautiful woman.

232
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,092
[laughs] First drink is on me.

233
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,012
You guys wanna order,
or should I surprise you?

234
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,099
You can surprise me with a double
Belvedere up with two olives, very cold.

235
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,643
-Make it three.
-All right.

236
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,897
Suzanne, I think that young man
has a little thing for you.

237
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,358
I have told her that!

238
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,569
He flirts with her so hard
every time we use him to get into places.

239
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,487
Stop.

240
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,699
Even if that were true, which it's not,
that is my son's best friend. Pass!

241
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,079
Come on. Wouldn't it be nice to spend
a romantic evening with a young man

242
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,666
who wants to get into your vagina,
rather than one who came out of it?

243
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,209
-[laughs]
-She's funny!

244
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,086
-Warming.
-Mm-hmm!

245
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,756
Okay, someone take a picture of me here so
I can make my ex-husband feel like shit!

246
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,301
No, no, no, no, no! They don't allow
pics here. They will throw us out.

247
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,471
-We have to be stealth about this.
-And you can't post on Instagram.

248
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,264
My friend Marcus tagged a pic here.

249
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,059
They came after him
like the Scientologists went after Leah.

250
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,353
I'm not on any of those things.

251
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,855
I'm going to text a photo
to my oldest child,

252
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,357
the one who's still a daughter,

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,027
because she's mad at her father for dating
someone barely older than she is.

254
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,698
I use my kids
to fuck with my ex-husband too!

255
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,243
I mean, the shit I've gotten away with.
I should be the KGB.

256
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,663
This is the fun you missed out on,
not knowing who Kai's father is.

257
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,332
I also missed out
on gettin' left like you two.

258
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,126
[both laughing]

259
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,545
-Oh…
-Okay. Still fresh.

260
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,504
-I get it.
-I'm sorry.

261
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,464
Here we go. Have a seat.

262
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,093
Ooh! Thank you, Trey. This is cute skrt.

263
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,016
I've also got a little molly
if you're looking.

264
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,562
-Oh no. Who do you think I am? I can't!
-Not so fast!

265
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,941
I've never done it. My kids are grown.
What am I waiting for?

266
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,194
And it looked so fun
when J. Lo did it in Hustlers.

267
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,362
[Mia chuckles]

268
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,490
-That's two yeses to your one no.
-[Suzanne sighs]

269
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,577
Okay, fine. Ju-- Maybe just a smidge.

270
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh!

271
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,209
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Claire giggles]

272
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,377
Oh, I'm so excited!

273
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:38,048
Either he's already done some of that,
or he is dying to get wit' you.

274
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,302
Is that okay to say that? "Get wit' you?"

275
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,554
-I'mma need to sit wit' it.
-I'm on board.

276
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,638
Okay!

277
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
[light jazz playing in background]

278
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:53,105
I am so lucky
that you are both my best friends.

279
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,900
And I'm forever grateful
that you get to be with me

280
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,652
-while my life is literally falling apart.
-Oh!

281
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,863
Take it easy with the booze there, gushy.

282
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,532
You don't wanna cross over
into wasted sorority girl territory.

283
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm not wasted. I promise.

284
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,912
Or sad. Or thinking about Colin.

285
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,791
-I need to find Horst.
-No, you don't.

286
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,795
I do, as a matter of fact,
because I sent him many texts,

287
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,631
and none of them have gone through
'cause the service here sucks.

288
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,300
-Okay, let's get an espresso in you, huh?
-Good idea.

289
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,636
-You stay right there.
-Stay. Don't move.

290
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,224
-I think he's had four of those fireballs.
-Yeah.

291
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,392
Which, as we know, equals eight.

292
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,938
-What's up?
-Oh, cute.

293
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,110
Michael.

294
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:45,157
-I thought I lost you on the slopes.
-Corey. You're he-- here.

295
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
And in a robe.

296
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,119
I was worried about you.

297
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,955
Nah.

298
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,914
[chuckles]

299
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh, by the way, I don't have a boyfriend.

300
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,795
Yeah, I heard. So did the entire mountain.
You know, the echo.

301
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,129
Right.

302
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,131
[chuckles] Cool, cool.

303
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,133
Um…

304
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,345
Glad there wasn't an avalanche.

305
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,556
Well,

306
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,768
there is still time
to make this mountain shake.

307
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,272
-Come find me in the hot tub.
-Absolutely.

308
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,238
Guys! Guys!

309
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,950
I found Corey.
He wants me to meet him in the hot tub!

310
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,201
-All right!
-Aw!

311
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,661
-Well, knock this back.
-Yeah.

312
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,956
-Knock it back.
-Put on a robe and get your ass in there.

313
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,291
-[Stamley] Mm--
-Pyeoww!

314
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,667
-Oh!
-Hey, that's hot!

315
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,502
Okay.

316
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,422
[club music playing]

317
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,799
So you gonna let me--
Okay. Don't tell a soul.

318
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,643
Horst, wait up!

319
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,438
[club music playing loudly]

320
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,115
Michael!

321
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,075
We missed you at fondue!

322
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,661
Now we're dancing off
the bread and the cheese.

323
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,540
Horst, you follow four Robbies
and 12 Roberts,

324
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,709
and almost all of them
have private accounts.

325
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,878
I need to see that guy's Instagram page.

326
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,382
I apologize for telling you about Robbie.
That was a bad thing for a friend to do.

327
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,550
Are we friend…

328
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
Never mind. Um…

329
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
I need to see Robbie's account, please.

330
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,391
Are you sure that's a good idea?
You are a crier. I've seen it.

331
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,436
-Just let me see the damn picture!
-Oh God.

332
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,273
Ugh! Here.

333
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
Fuck!

334
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,072
Colin looks so happy.

335
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,951
It's not his fake smile
like in family pictures.

336
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,536
That's his real smile,
like when he looks at money.

337
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,997
Please tell me Robbie's a cater waiter.

338
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,791
He's a successful architect.

339
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,002
Like super driven
to make up for his small penis?

340
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,379
Nein.

341
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,838
Is that German for no?

342
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,802
Oh, I guess not. Oh God.

343
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,262
That poor Speedo. It's working so hard.

344
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,932
May I have my phone back now?

345
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,979
I can unlock some hot private photos
on his Grindr if you want.

346
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,738
[Billy] …that big a deal
for purple lingerie to be lying around…

347
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,865
-[Stanley] I have no idea!
-[Billy] Now it's a thing?

348
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,825
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

349
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,993
Uh, what are you doing here?

350
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,120
-I thought you were in the tub with Corey.
-Hey! Whoa!

351
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,038
Whoa, hey, that's six! Oh!

352
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,749
Uh, which is really 12.
He should be in rehab.

353
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,210
Colin's moved on with a hot architect

354
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,714
who is younger, better-looking,
and way more successful than me.

355
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,509
Oh, come on, that just means
it's time for you to move on too.

356
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,637
I can definitely think
of one good way to do that.

357
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,305
Huh? [burbling]

358
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,306
Whoosh!

359
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,433
Brrr!

360
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,270
-Bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub!
-Is that supposed to be a hot tub?

361
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,188
-Yes!
-Who swims in a hot tub?

362
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,651
It wasn't swimming.
I mean, it was saying water. Hot water.

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,113
[hip-hop music playing]

364
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,199
-Newsflash. I love molly.
-[chuckles]

365
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,869
I like the way the lights glow. [gasps]

366
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,497
I love the feel
of the glass in my hand.

367
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,083
[laughs] It's all just extra.

368
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,044
Did I use that right? Extra?

369
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,420
-You actually did.
-Yeah.

370
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,007
Oh! And I feel beautiful.

371
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,884
Which is so welcome.

372
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,720
Would you take a picture of me
now, when I'm feeling so beautiful?

373
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:39,391
Yes. But let's be real cool about it.
Hand me the phone. Nice and easy.

374
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,560
[Mia] Hurry up. Do it quick.
Do it right now.

375
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,021
Ooh!

376
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,608
Your phone will be waiting at the door
when you leave, or I can walk you out now.

377
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,942
It's not mine. It's hers.

378
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,279
How about I give you $200,

379
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:56,450
and you give me my phone back,
and we pretend like this never happened?

380
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,580
Ugh! Youth and their ethics.
Exhausting! [chuckles]

381
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,086
Don't get me in trouble, woman.
Or you're gonna owe me.

382
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,754
Big.

383
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,131
[Mia] My God!

384
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,719
Suzanne, wake up, girl!
That boy wants to get all up on you.

385
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,055
[Claire] It is as plain as day.

386
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,682
What do you think "owe me big" means?

387
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,142
Okay, okay, I gotta admit,

388
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,686
it seems like he's working me,
but I can't believe it.

389
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,730
I'm his friend's mother.

390
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,776
Oh!

391
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,402
It's on! [laughs]

392
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,488
Can I say that? "It's on."

393
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,824
It's all fine, girl. Stop askin' us.

394
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,659
[all laughing]

395
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,369
No fucking way.

396
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,412
Claire!

397
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,499
Oh… my.

398
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,793
Ooh, what a surprise. [chuckles]

399
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:54,258
Uh… Suzanne, Mia,
this is Henry, my ex-husband.

400
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,592
And… Oh.

401
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,387
Sorry, I've forgotten your name.

402
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,513
Layla.

403
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,056
-Hello.
-Hey.

404
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,433
It's so odd seeing you here.

405
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,146
It's like spotting Jane Austen at CBGB's.

406
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,730
[laughs] Oh! I get it.

407
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,775
Because I'm so out of place
at a hip, downtown club.

408
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,279
Well, what's funny
is that I'm shocked to see you here.

409
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,656
It's nice they didn't reject you
a fifth time.

410
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,117
-Well, I'm a member. I got us in.
-Oh.

411
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,828
I thought you had to be at least 21
to belong here.

412
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,081
Be nice, Claire.
I'm actually happy for you.

413
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,041
You're getting out, trying new things.

414
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,794
And who am I to say
you won't meet someone here?

415
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,379
Some old pots find new lids.

416
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,382
Oh, Henry, you are such a fool.

417
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,260
You think you're winning,

418
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,263
but you look like you're being
escorted around by your nurse.

419
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,682
And I am not on the prowl

420
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,019
for a-- a young piece of ass,
if that's what you're implying.

421
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,021
I already have a lid for my pot.

422
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,481
[Suzanne] Mm!

423
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,694
[Claire] Mm!

424
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,155
That's right. I'm fluid!

425
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:03,994
Now please go away before I ask Trey,
that's the bartender, whose name I know,

426
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,287
to make you go away.

427
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,957
Good luck, ladies.

428
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,584
Bye!

429
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,296
Wow!

430
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,634
That felt really good. [chuckles]

431
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
That fat fuck didn't know what hit him.

432
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,351
You think he's fat? I hope we never
run into each other after the holidays.

433
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,686
I won that round, didn't I?

434
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,938
Ooh, you did!

435
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,107
We're gonna have to have a little
talk about consent later, but you did win.

436
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,945
[soft conversation and laughter]

437
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,490
-Oh!
-You made it!

438
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,368
May I…

439
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,871
-Corey, may I… May I join you?
-Hi.

440
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,623
I'd be bummed if you didn't.

441
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,672
Watch it.

442
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,966
Ah… Ooh! Ooh!

443
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,176
-[gasps]
-Feels good?

444
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,261
-Ooh!
-[laughs]

445
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,178
Finally,

446
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,888
I am all…

447
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,558
I promise I'm all yours.

448
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,280
Is it hot in here? Are you hot?

449
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,614
-You tell me.
-[chuckles]

450
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,996
I mean, I know you're hot,
but are you also aggressively warm?

451
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,499
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, no, I'm-- Yeah, I'm good.

452
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,792
You don't look so good.

453
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:39,214
It's just I think I had too many
of those fireballs and fajitas.

454
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,340
-[belches]
-Oh!

455
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,675
-[gags]
-[man 1] No!

456
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,801
[man 2] No! No, no!2

457
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,136
-No! No, no!
-[Michael groans]

458
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,595
-[vomiting]
-[man 2] God! Yuck!

459
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,972
[Michael groaning]

460
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,349
That was bad.

461
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,767
