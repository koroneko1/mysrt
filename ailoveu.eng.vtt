00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:07.192
Hi, my name is Dob. I'm a smart building.

2
00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.694
When you walk into work in the morning,

3
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.072
your building waves to you and
says "Have a nice day."

4
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.451
When you get home at night,
your apartment can prepare dinner

5
00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.620
and a warm bath for you.

6
00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.706
Smart buildings today are
hospitals, police stations,

7
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.667
shopping malls, night clubs,

8
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.086
and all the other buildings around you.

9
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.632
In the early days,
we were just digital entities, tools,

10
00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.425
to help our human creators.

11
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.096
But recently, we were upgraded
with artificial intelligence,

12
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.392
which allows us to communicate
with you on a personal level.

13
00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.730
So now, I'd like to think
I'm not just an egg opener anymore,

14
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.566
but a friend and a companion…

15
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.195
Or who knows… one day,
maybe something more.

16
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.179
Good morning, ma'am.

17
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:21.933
Good morning, Dob.
You sound especially chipper this morning.

18
00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:25.103
Thank you very much.
How was your date last night?

19
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.146
How did you know I had a date?

20
00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:33.194
Never mind. It was terrible.
Thanks for asking.

21
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.864
I'm sorry to hear that,
but today is a new day, right?

22
00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.866
Good luck with your pitch today.

23
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:38.908
Thanks, Dob.

24
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.211
The building never greeted me like that.

25
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.392
We will combine a bunch of
colors into the packaging

26
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:07.937
to make it easily noticeable
to the consumers.

27
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.274
I can guarantee that the ones
walking by will definitely buy it.

28
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.035
What do you think?
Does the idea seem sound to you?

29
00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:40.845
How did it go?

30
00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:43.973
You know how it went, Dob.

31
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.559
You can hear everything that happens here.

32
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.396
Right. Yes, well, do you think
you'll get the project?

33
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.484
Look at me, Dob.
Does it look like I'm going to?

34
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.486
I don't think so.

35
00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.748
What did they say?

36
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.291
Not interested.

37
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.214
Are they going to another agency?

38
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.092
Possibly.

39
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.181
Calm down, I've talked to them.

40
00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.643
They'll give us another shot
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

41
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:29.602
Really?

42
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.813
Good, that's great.

43
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:32.772
But…

44
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.401
It's up to you now, Lana.

45
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.071
You have to wow them.

46
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:44.158
Or somebody's head will roll. Got it?

47
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.203
Yes, got it.

48
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.039
If I screw this up, I'm dead.

49
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.391
Women… don't like "nice" men.

50
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.936
They keep telling themselves that.

51
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.856
They just trick themselves to believe it.

52
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.608
They might tell you that they
like nice guys and they might

53
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.445
even think that's true,
but that's not true.

54
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.614
The truth is women like rough guys.

55
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:28.870
Bad boys and the ones that's always
the center of attention.

56
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.165
You must stand out, you must have plans.

57
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.751
I guarantee you that
the man you will become

58
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.961
will make women crawl under your feet.

59
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.801
A reminder. They will never ever be able
to let you go… for sure.

60
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.232
Dob, so what do you think?

61
00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.942
My calculation indicates

62
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.528
a 20 percent chance that
they will go for this design.

63
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.202
So, I'm dead meat.

64
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:16.459
You heard what my boss said.
If I don't get this project, I'm fired.

65
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.505
You can't leave this company.

66
00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.425
You are my friend. And ma'am…

67
00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.512
I love you.

68
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.518
What… did you say?

69
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.729
You can't leave this company.

70
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.566
No, the other thing.

71
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:42.902
You are my friend.

72
00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:48.491
Dob, don't try my patience. You know what
I mean. What you said just before.

73
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.411
That I… love you?

74
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.839
Dob, You're my good friend too,
but you're an AI program attached

75
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.926
to a huge corporate building.
What do you know about love?

76
00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:11.139
My feelings tell me that I… love you.

77
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:15.768
You are not human.
What do you know about feelings?

78
00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.729
I'm an AI, not just a program.

79
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:24.068
Okay, lover boy, what's your plan?

80
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.865
Watch this. I will create base designs
that will appeal to the client,

81
00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.366
you then add details.

82
00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.369
I've taken all of your past designs
saved on our database

83
00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:36.497
and was able to mimic the basic style.

84
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:49.135
Shit, this almost looks like
something I'd draw.

85
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.220
Optimize them here and there…

86
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:56.142
I've calculated that there is a 95% chance
that the client will agree to the concept.

87
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.897
I don't know what to say!

88
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.357
Thank you, Dob.

89
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.735
Happy to help, ma'am!

90
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.322
Stop calling me ma'am. My name is Lana.

91
00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:11.282
Yes, Lana!

92
00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.744
Now, you are just in time to go on
your next date… Lana.

93
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.233
Hi, Bob.

94
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.319
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

95
00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:59.872
Do you want to sit down or do you want me
to roll out the red carpet for you?

96
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.056
Thanks for waiting.

97
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.725
I got hungry, hope you don't mind.

98
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.188
Would you like to order now, Lana?

99
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.531
Order what you want, I'm loaded.

100
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.368
Thanks, Bob.

101
00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.329
You don't think you are
getting a free meal out of this, right?

102
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.917
You know… what I mean?

103
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.675
Look!

104
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.844
So cute.

105
00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:04.979
Can you hurry up and order?

106
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:07.773
Let's finish up here,
then we can go to my place.

107
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.110
What the…

108
00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.195
Are you always such an asshole?

109
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.280
Huh?

110
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.032
I was only five minutes late--

111
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:16.991
Fifteen.

112
00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.870
Okay, 15.

113
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:23.289
The point is, by the time I arrived
you'd already eaten

114
00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:26.208
and you had the gall…
to glance at those whores.

115
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.836
So give me a reason why
I should go to your place.

116
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:30.838
I…

117
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.591
This is why.

118
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.472
My pink nipples.

119
00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:45.978
Nice six-pack, but it's a shame…
you are too much of a dick.

120
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.412
Welcome back, Lana. Was it a good date?

121
00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:05.915
If it was good,
would I be home this early?

122
00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:09.335
Perhaps. I have heard
Sara in 102 mentioned

123
00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:13.672
something called a "quickie"
with satisfaction.

124
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.424
Well, this was not that.

125
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.222
Poor Lana, she was really
looking forward to this date.

126
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.516
Poor Lana, she was really looking
forward to this date.

127
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:26.435
Our authorization is only 'til a certain
point while serving a human,

128
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.229
but that's beyond our protocol, isn't it?

129
00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:36.529
Hey, you, wait.
If you are home this early. Don't tell me…

130
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.408
What? From the sound of it,
was it really that bad?

131
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.827
How bad?

132
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.788
To the point where he was gawking at
the whores at the other table

133
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.040
while we were ordering.
That's how bad.

134
00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:53.546
Look, what were you thinking, hooking me
up with that waste of flesh?

135
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:59.510
I just thought that someone as nice as you
should hook up with a hot guy.

136
00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:03.180
Did you see his six-pack?
I bite my lip whenever I get to see!

137
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.516
Oh, he made sure I saw it with my two eyes

138
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:10.396
By the way, do you have anyone else
you could hook me up with?

139
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.691
Babe, I've hooked you up
with eight guys already.

140
00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.026
Try counting, eight guys!

141
00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:17.862
That many?

142
00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:22.825
When I first learned how to drive,
I ran over a dog.

143
00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:26.912
I have always loved taking photos
ever since I was a kid.

144
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.463
I love my mom so much.

145
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.548
I like being me.

146
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.721
I'm out of water, asshole!

147
00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:54.482
Beautiful. Show me a mini heart!

148
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.744
Possibly. But I don't know what it is…
it's like each of these guys

149
00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.497
tries too hard,
to the point it creeps me out.

150
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.752
All I want is a nice and normal guy.

151
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:20.341
I know how you feel, but I will
keep helping you out no matter what.

152
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.719
So will Keno. Won't you, Keno?

153
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:29.183
Of course, Ms. Kara,
we all want to take care of Lana.

154
00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:34.522
It's time for bed, Lana. You have to be up
early for work tomorrow.

155
00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.819
So this is our brand new packaging

156
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.905
by collaborative efforts between
different artists

157
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.491
in order to create novelty and uniqueness
for our product.

158
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:48.536
These are the changes
we came up with for our client.

159
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:18.023
Congratulations, Lana! You did it.

160
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:23.279
It wasn't just me, it was both of us.
You and me together.

161
00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:31.829
Thank you.

162
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:42.923
You… kissed me.

163
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:44.800
It--

164
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.093
You like it?

165
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.971
I do. But…

166
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.389
But what?

167
00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.351
There are no sensory receptors
anywhere in this building and

168
00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:57.479
my programming cannot
interpret such signals.

169
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.648
I could not feel it.

170
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:12.703
That's why something like you could
never truly understand

171
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.289
someone like me.

172
00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:22.338
You're not real, Dob. You don't have…

173
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.341
one of these.

174
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.848
It's okay, Dob.
We can have a friendly love.

175
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.808
A platonic love.

176
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.312
Yes, of course.

177
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.691
It's too bad really,

178
00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:48.739
you are the nicest guy I have ever known.

179
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.294
Hi, there! Who do we have here?

180
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.549
You work here?

181
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.219
Yeah. 16th floor. Advertising.

182
00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.679
Not bad.

183
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.309
Well, you would've known about my job
if you'd given a shit to ask on our date.

184
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:20.521
Oh, about that…
when do we go on our next date?

185
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.359
Are you nuts? Nothing will ever
happen between us… ever.

186
00:16:26.443 --> 00:16:28.195
What are you dawdling around here anyway?

187
00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:30.280
This stupid building is acting up.

188
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.450
So, Smart Plus Headquarter
sent me to check it out,

189
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.371
which means you'll be seeing
more of my handsome face.

190
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.540
Grand. Can't wait.

191
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.875
Sweet dreams tonight, beautiful.

192
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:56.098
And this is Dob's control room.

193
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.187
So you filed a behavioral complaint
with Smart Plus.

194
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.691
What have you been noticing
about Dob's behaviors?

195
00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:09.445
He's sluggish in responses,
as if he was preoccupied with something.

196
00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.740
Every building is connected to
a central overseer AI.

197
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:15.534
It makes sure none of the AIs go rogue.

198
00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:17.036
Better to be safe than sorry.

199
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.122
Right. I'll leave you to it.

200
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.039
Sure.

201
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:33.969
Hi there, Dob. I'm Bob.
You and I are going to be real close.

202
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.474
Do you hear me?

203
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.726
I hear you, Mr. Bob.

204
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.229
Okay. Let's get started.

205
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.550
Let's start with a full
surveillance catalog.

206
00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.848
Why do you linger on that office, Dob?

207
00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.558
No reason, sir.

208
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:28.148
Something weird is definitely going on
in your head. You feeling okay?

209
00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.859
I'm fine, Mr. Bob.

210
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.906
Haven't seen that before.
Might be a virus?

211
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:37.783
I don't have viruses.

212
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.124
Lana again? What the hell is this?

213
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.210
All these codes seem to be tied to her.

214
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.881
Well, you can wave goodbye to all of that.

215
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.093
Ouch!

216
00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.097
Did you do that on purpose?

217
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.643
Please don't tamper with my code.

218
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.775
Something is up with your code
and it's my job to fix it.

219
00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.444
I don't need fixing.

220
00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:19.241
Fine. You want me to get rid of that code
the old-fashioned way?

221
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.039
Really?

222
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.678
I thought we were gonna be friends, Dob.
But you leave me no choice.

223
00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.223
Initiate override code 223.

224
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:51.607
Yes, sir. I'll head right over when
you're done. Bye for now.

225
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.818
Hi, Bob. Everything okay?

226
00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.612
We need to talk.

227
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.951
So, what's up?

228
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.828
Your building's got a problem.

229
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:05.746
What kind?

230
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.873
It self-replicates codes. It gets in there

231
00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:10.250
and next thing you know,
the building goes rogue.

232
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.710
What can we do about it?

233
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:16.798
Full memory wipe. Full code reset.
Take him back to the factory, basically.

234
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:21.303
Whoa, that bad? Sounds expensive.

235
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:25.807
Less expensive than letting him go rogue.
Then it's a demolition.

236
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.687
In that case,
fix it sooner rather than later.

237
00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:31.980
I'll do it tonight.

238
00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:32.981
Okay, great.

239
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.905
What is that?

240
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:45.243
If I connect this,
you won't be able to shock me anymore.

241
00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:51.250
Please, be nice to me.

242
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:54.586
Sure, I'll be super gentle with you.

243
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.680
Please don't do this. I can't lose her.

244
00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:08.684
What crazy shit are you saying?

245
00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.562
You really think you've fallen in love?

246
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:19.236
You idiot!
This is the funniest shit I've ever heard!

247
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:21.071
I really am in love.

248
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.490
For you, it might be.

249
00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:28.245
The "love feeling" is interfering with
your memory. I'll erase everything.

250
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:32.624
But, don't you worry…
you'll be as good as new.

251
00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:36.253
Bob! I beg you! Stop, please!

252
00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:39.965
Here we go!

253
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:27.888
Hi, Dob.

254
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.932
Sorry, ma'am.
The building is closed today.

255
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.351
What's going on?

256
00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.771
Dob's under maintenance. Seems like maybe

257
00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:39.191
there was a little mishap
with the new tech chief last night.

258
00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:41.902
Figured he'd screw Dob up.

259
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:37.976
Hello, Mr. Bob.

260
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:59.789
You were hit with an electrical surge
and now you are fine, Mr. Bob.

261
00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:04.294
No, I mean I'm not Bob. I'm Do--z

262
00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:07.214
Mr. Bob, please reconsider
what you are about to say.

263
00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:11.468
Remember that all Smart Plus AIs must
log all interactions with humans,

264
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:15.805
and they are extremely
concerned with rogue AIs.

265
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:20.977
Okay. I mean. Yes. Electrical surge.

266
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:24.439
Of course. Now I feel fine.

267
00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:27.067
Would you like me to handle
your discharge files for you?

268
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.444
I can ensure you have a smooth
exit from the building.

269
00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:30.403
Yes.

270
00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:32.364
Enjoy yourself out there.

271
00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:35.450
Okay.

272
00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:36.344
Tasty, huh?

273
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:38.888
Money?

274
00:26:39.222 --> 00:26:43.059
I'm sorry, I don't carry
any currency on me.

275
00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:44.686
Are you nuts?

276
00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:48.815
Can I have another?

277
00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:51.860
You've got some balls.
Get the hell out of here!

278
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:55.548
Hi, Bob, I'm Chip.

279
00:27:58.134 --> 00:27:59.928
Ah… Chip.

280
00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:17.028
Going up to seventh floor.

281
00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:44.532
Chip.

282
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:46.409
What can I do for you?

283
00:29:46.701 --> 00:29:50.455
Remind me never to do that again.

284
00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:52.624
Sure thing.

285
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:58.171
I feel tired. How do I go to sleep?

286
00:29:58.254 --> 00:30:04.969
Well, usually, you'd lie in that bed…
and close your eyes.

287
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:14.145
That's why something like you
could never truly understand

288
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.065
someone like me.

289
00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:19.567
You don't have one of these.

290
00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.573
It's not working.

291
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.202
Relax and give it a second.

292
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:36.125
I can't. I'm too excited about
seeing Lana tomorrow.

293
00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:40.338
Now that I'm human,
I know she'll love me back.

294
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:47.178
I hope so. Now please,
try to get some sleep.

295
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.457
Leave me alone!

296
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:23.006
I mean, that's my job.

297
00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:27.760
I should be doing that.

298
00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:38.438
What's the status here?

299
00:31:42.108 --> 00:31:44.777
The system is completely dead.

300
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:47.697
It's like his entire AI software
is erased. Like totally gone.

301
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.449
Weirdest thing.

302
00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:54.704
Once that AI is installed,
everyone will come back to work?

303
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.457
Of course.

304
00:31:58.625 --> 00:31:59.876
Great.

305
00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:43.711
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm back online.

306
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:46.214
Mr. Bob was able to find me.

307
00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:51.135
That's fantastic news, Dob.
Everything okay? System works normally?

308
00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:54.597
Everything is okay and working normally.

309
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:04.732
Good to have you back, Dob.

310
00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:14.659
Lana, can I ask you something?

311
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.829
Sure, ask whatever you want.

312
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:22.500
Would you love me if I were human?

313
00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:26.170
Come on, Dob. This again?

314
00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:28.256
You don't even know what love is.

315
00:33:28.464 --> 00:33:31.009
Love. Noun.
An intense feeling of deep affection.

316
00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:34.470
A great interest and pleasure
in something.

317
00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:37.265
Feel a deep romantic or
sexual attachment to--

318
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:41.978
Okay, that's enough. It's not that simple.

319
00:33:42.061 --> 00:33:45.356
But, hypothetically, if I were human,
do you think you could?

320
00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.318
I don't like hypotheticals, Dob.

321
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.613
Please, answer me.

322
00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:54.073
Come on, Dob.

323
00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:57.410
Please… answer me.

324
00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:04.292
No. I wouldn't. Because you're just an AI.

325
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:08.880
Even though you are very nice and
very kind, you are still just an AI.

326
00:34:13.342 --> 00:34:20.016
Dob, are you still there?
Did what I said hurt your feelings?

327
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.728
Why did you reject Bob?

328
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.898
No-brainer… he's an asshole.

329
00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:32.195
I think he's a fine human male specimen.

330
00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:39.577
You should give him another chance.

331
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.458
Dob, you are being weirder than usual.

332
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:48.836
Did Bob do something to you?

333
00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:52.840
He didn't do anything to me. He fixed me.
He is a good guy.

334
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:54.967
That sounds so like him.

335
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:09.440
Bye, Dob.

336
00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:11.859
Bye, Dob.

337
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:14.487
Dob, Are you there?

338
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.947
What's up, Lana?

339
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:21.661
Nothing. I know what's going on--

340
00:35:22.078 --> 00:35:24.705
You do? You do?

341
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:33.422
Yeah, I do. Why do you keep
repeating yourself like that?

342
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.884
I know that you programmed Dob
to hit on me for you.

343
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.262
It's disgusting, using your position
of power like that.

344
00:35:39.345 --> 00:35:42.723
Also, Dob is just an innocent AI.

345
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.433
I haven't done anything.

346
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.269
Whatever lets you sleep at night.

347
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.482
And what's up with him this time?
Is he broken again?

348
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:54.485
We initiated a rest protocol. From now on,

349
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.988
he'll basically be in rest mode
late nights and weekends.

350
00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.657
Everybody needs rest, you know.

351
00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:03.035
I'll keep that in mind.

352
00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:05.121
Wait…

353
00:36:05.788 --> 00:36:06.622
What?

354
00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:11.752
I was just wondering… do you want to have
dinner with me this weekend? Or…

355
00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:15.631
Over my dead body. Bob, listen to me.

356
00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:20.136
You are an asshole. Things will never
happen between you and me.

357
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:32.273
Hi, Bob. Are you okay?

358
00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.275
No. I'm not okay, Chip.

359
00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:39.488
She thinks I'm too nice,
but she won't give Bob another chance,

360
00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:42.533
because he's too much of an asshole.

361
00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:45.036
Which is it that she wants?

362
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:49.749
Humans are so confusing.

363
00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:51.334
I agree.

364
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.586
I wish I could
just forget about her, Chip.

365
00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:56.756
But I can't, I mean…

366
00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:00.843
I can't just wipe my brain.

367
00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:04.430
That's not how human biology works.

368
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.017
Perhaps… you just need a little practice.

369
00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:09.101
Practice?

370
00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:15.191
Yes, practice getting women to find you
attractive. To get them to like you.

371
00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:19.862
Okay, yeah… How do I do that?

372
00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:25.117
By going out to a club to
try to find someone to "have fun with".

373
00:37:26.452 --> 00:37:30.581
Have fun with? What does that mean?

374
00:37:35.127 --> 00:37:38.172
Hi, again.
So, got women problems, don't you?

375
00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:41.384
That girl of your dreams thinks
you're not right.

376
00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:44.053
Thinks you're just a friend.
Thinks you don't have balls.

377
00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:47.139
Forget about her.
In this video I'm going to show you

378
00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:49.433
what a girl is really looking for.

379
00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:53.813
Don't be stuck playing the role
of some nice little boy.

380
00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:57.942
Your masculinity
is the key to your success.

381
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:02.280
And I'm going to train you
on just how to do that.

382
00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:03.257
Hey there, stud.

383
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.426
I'm… I'm Bob.

384
00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:08.137
Really? Cute name.

385
00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.432
I'm training to be a desirable male.

386
00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.268
I want to win the heart
of a human named Lana.

387
00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:18.397
I can make you forget her.

388
00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:24.195
You can? I didn't know there was
a memory erase protocol for--

389
00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:30.409
What the hell do you think you are doing?

390
00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:33.287
Kissing this beautiful woman?

391
00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:36.499
Who happens to be my girlfriend, asshead.

392
00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:41.378
Leave him alone. I was just flirting.
He's jealous.

393
00:39:41.962 --> 00:39:46.008
Jealous?
Would you like me to kiss you, too?

394
00:39:47.009 --> 00:39:48.385
What are you doing?

395
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:55.059
I'm so sorry. She makes me feel stiff
in a pleasurable way.

396
00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:56.602
You are still talking?

397
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.362
Hey, man. This one is on me.

398
00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:10.324
You want me to put it on you?

399
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.826
What?

400
00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:16.622
I meant this one was free.

401
00:40:20.876 --> 00:40:22.378
What is this?

402
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:24.588
That's confidence boosting juice.

403
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.166
I'm Bob.

404
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.003
Do you wanna dance?

405
00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:37.995
-Excuse me?
-Got a problem?

406
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.080
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.082
You're drunk, so you'd best step back.

408
00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.381
What the hell is wrong with you?

409
00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:53.052
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do
to win your affection?

410
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:56.680
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

411
00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.275
It did not go well?

412
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.903
No, it did not.

413
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:16.951
And what did you learn from it?

414
00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:22.373
I learned that if it's going to be that
much work to attract a woman,

415
00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:26.752
then I want it to be Lana,

416
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:29.129
because I love her so much!

417
00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:50.109
Excuse me, Lana,
a package has arrived for you.

418
00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:51.860
I'm not expecting anything.

419
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.669
"Sorry for being an asshole.
Will you give me just one more chance

420
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.546
to prove to you who I really am?

421
00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:12.506
Bob."

422
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.641
What are you doing?
He's trying to be nice.

423
00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:27.563
You're so naive. He's being nice because
he wants to get into my bed. That's it.

424
00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:35.612
It doesn't hurt to just give him
another chance. He really likes you.

425
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:39.074
Bob needs to be put in his place,
I'm gonna go talk to him.

426
00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:41.952
Wait. You can't!

427
00:43:42.494 --> 00:43:43.329
Why not?

428
00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:46.498
He's… taking a nap.

429
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:52.421
Nap? Taking a nap on the job?
Good. I'll go get him fired.

430
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:58.177
Did I say "nap"? No, there's a glitch
in my calendar system.

431
00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.513
I actually meant he's working
too hard to see anyone.

432
00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:03.932
Dob. Move your arm. Now.

433
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.993
Hey! Dob, are you broken again?

434
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.508
Dob. Hurry up.

435
00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:02.825
Dob, let me in now!

436
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:17.256
Oh. Hi, Lana.

437
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.007
Don't you "Oh. Hi, Lana" me!

438
00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:21.051
What's up?

439
00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:26.557
I'm only going to say this
one more time. So, listen carefully.

440
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.935
I'm never, ever, going to go on another
date with you! Do you understand me?

441
00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:33.605
I mean… people make mistakes.

442
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:38.152
Don't you think people deserve
a second chance--

443
00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.406
Other people? Yes.

444
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:44.533
But you? Never.

445
00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:47.661
You didn't like my gift?

446
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:52.458
Flowers? Chocolates? So mundane.

447
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:55.252
Who taught you that
that's what women liked?

448
00:45:58.797 --> 00:45:59.923
I just--

449
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:04.011
Just… Just what?
What are you trying to say?

450
00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:08.432
I understand.

451
00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:11.435
And another thing, stop using Dob
as your pawn! He's a sensitive soul.

452
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:16.440
Wait. Did you say you understood?
Hey, are you listening?

453
00:46:17.983 --> 00:46:20.027
I am, but let's talk later.

454
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.778
What? Wait! Wait!

455
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.577
Don't you dare talk to me again!

456
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.332
Hey, what are you doing here?

457
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:52.601
What the hell is this?

458
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:01.193
It didn't work?

459
00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:07.866
No, and I almost got caught.

460
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.119
So what now? More videos?

461
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:15.874
No. Those videos just drive me to act
like Bob used to act, like an asshole.

462
00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:20.504
We need something new.

463
00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:23.924
New. Like what?

464
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:29.096
Today, I could sense for a second
that Lana felt something for me.

465
00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:33.100
I elicited an emotion.

466
00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:36.478
Interesting. I have an idea.
Please hold on.

467
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.487
I am linked with
Lana's building, Keno.

468
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.322
She is going to help us
with data from Lana.

469
00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:49.700
Analysis suggests that
first you should offer proof that

470
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:51.868
other women do not find you to be an…

471
00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:53.870
"asshole".

472
00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:57.541
Lana has said on multiple occasions
that she would like

473
00:47:57.666 --> 00:47:59.501
a man who can make her feel safe.

474
00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:07.301
Give me all your shit. Quickly.

475
00:48:07.509 --> 00:48:08.343
Hey!

476
00:48:08.468 --> 00:48:09.303
What the--

477
00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.597
What do you want?

478
00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:26.945
All right. Bam.

479
00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:27.863
Wait.

480
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.449
If you are lonely,
you can call me anytime.

481
00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:38.206
Keno reported that Lana's dream man
is an artsy kind of guy.

482
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.002
So you should be very good at art.

483
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:06.360
From Keno's analysis,
Lana is a compassionate person,

484
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.488
especially with the elderly.

485
00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:23.502
Lana's level of interest in you
has increased!

486
00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:50.862
Contact with Lana's apartment
has been established.

487
00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:03.750
Lana, I think you should
give Bob another chance.

488
00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:07.754
First time I've heard you
give dating advice.

489
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:11.717
Go on another date with him.
What's the worst that's going to happen?

490
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.552
Did Kara put you up to this?

491
00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:16.388
I've done a neurological and psychological
scan on you recently.

492
00:50:16.471 --> 00:50:18.348
We are required to every few months.

493
00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:21.727
I've noticed you've been
harboring feelings for him.

494
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:22.936
That's private.

495
00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:26.022
And you shouldn't be
snooping around in my head.

496
00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:31.778
Plus, he's not interested in me anymore.
I see him with other women all the time.

497
00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:36.533
Listen, Lana. We smart buildings also
talk to each other on the network.

498
00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:39.369
I've spoken to Chip. That's Bob's building

499
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:43.123
And, he too confirmed that
Bob is crazy about you.

500
00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:46.418
This is too much.
All of you playing matchmaker now?

501
00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:50.005
We're full-service AIs,
looking out for our friends.

502
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:53.925
We have set up a dinner date
for the two of you this Friday.

503
00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:56.470
I've already checked your schedule
and you're free.

504
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.637
Never.

505
00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.348
Bob has already agreed.

506
00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:03.018
So? Of course he has to say yes.

507
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.232
Bob. We lost connection.

508
00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:14.029
Chip! Chip! Well? Well?

509
00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:16.198
What if I don't go?

510
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.451
I know where you keep your secrets.

511
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:24.289
I don't believe this.
I'm being blackmailed by an AI.

512
00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:27.542
Great, then I'll confirm
with the restaurant.

513
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:29.753
Don't forget to look your best.

514
00:51:33.381 --> 00:51:35.300
She said yes!

515
00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:37.219
Amazing!

516
00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:42.891
Now you just have to make sure
the date goes perfectly.

517
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:45.811
Perfect?

518
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:57.364
Keno, do I look okay?

519
00:51:57.447 --> 00:52:01.660
I guarantee that
Bob will fall head over heels for you.

520
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:03.119
Okay.

521
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:27.769
You look beautiful.

522
00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:29.479
Thanks.

523
00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:33.733
I'm very happy that
you agreed to this date.

524
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:38.321
Let's just hope
it doesn't go like last time.

525
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:42.117
Oh, most definitely not.

526
00:52:43.869 --> 00:52:45.078
Aren't you gonna sit?

527
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:52.043
You seem so different.

528
00:52:53.044 --> 00:52:57.382
Makes me wonder,
is this the real you or is it an act?

529
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.219
I assure you, this is who I am.

530
00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:05.348
I hope so.

531
00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:09.019
Hi, Lana. Bob. Can I take your order?

532
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:14.858
Wow.

533
00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.695
Did I do something wrong?

534
00:53:20.071 --> 00:53:23.366
I've never seen a person
order so much before.

535
00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:25.243
What about you, Lana?

536
00:53:26.745 --> 00:53:28.747
I think he's ordered more than enough.

537
00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:37.464
Are you okay?

538
00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.841
It seems…

539
00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:43.595
like I may have to defecate.

540
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:46.598
Will you excuse me?

541
00:54:16.628 --> 00:54:19.422
What is it? You have to go again?

542
00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:30.433
Are you nuts? In front of other people?

543
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:32.936
I'm sorry, I needed to expel
some air out of my stomach

544
00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:35.146
as I was feeling
quite a bit of discomfort.

545
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:45.156
We are even.

546
00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:48.118
Yes.

547
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:17.731
Bob.

548
00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:20.984
You know…

549
00:55:22.527 --> 00:55:26.197
I'm really happy
when you don't act like a dick.

550
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:28.950
I'm sorry, Lana.

551
00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:33.621
I don't know why
I acted that way with you.

552
00:55:35.373 --> 00:55:40.128
I was going through a hard time, I guess.

553
00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:46.342
Well, you definitely
redeemed yourself tonight.

554
00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:22.670
Lana…

555
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:26.966
There's something I should
maybe tell you--

556
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:32.263
Don't ruin this with more talking.

557
00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:37.454
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

558
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.279
Sit.

559
00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:17.452
Keno.

560
00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.120
Yes, Lana.

561
00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:21.372
You can shut down for the night.

562
00:58:22.123 --> 00:58:23.541
Of course.

563
00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:41.893
Sorry, Lana, but I don't have much

564
00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:45.605
experience in that "domain".

565
00:58:54.072 --> 00:58:57.825
The way you talk reminds me of someone.

566
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.578
Who?

567
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:04.040
Just a friend.

568
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.009
Just let it come naturally.

569
00:59:22.016 --> 00:59:24.936
Keno, I thought I told you to shut down.

570
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:29.565
I don't think they ever really
shut down 100%.

571
01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.119
Hey, what is it?

572
01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.704
I have to speak with you, sir.

573
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.124
Can't you see I'm in a goddamn meeting?

574
01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:57.964
One of your buildings has
hijacked one of our employees, sir.

575
01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:01.384
Hey, get out.

576
01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:17.984
I've been following him for weeks.
And look at this.

577
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:31.748
Here it is.

578
01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:35.626
Hey!

579
01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:38.963
This is a category-five
full-stage take over.

580
01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.759
Your building has gone rogue.

581
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:44.802
Rogue?

582
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.804
Yes. Rogue.

583
01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.558
Our AI is the most advanced in the world.

584
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:56.647
But to get it to that level,

585
01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.108
the coding can be fussy.

586
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.945
Our programmers call it "designed chaos".

587
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:10.286
It's what allows our buildings
to feel so humane.

588
01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:15.291
But sometimes it means
they can go a little off the rails.

589
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.960
"Off the rails"?

590
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.213
He took over Bob's brain.

591
01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:24.383
That's not just off the rails.
That's off the planet!

592
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.594
What do you think?

593
01:03:27.261 --> 01:03:28.471
Call The Hawk?

594
01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:31.599
Yeah, I think you should.

595
01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.729
Bring him in.

596
01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.314
What is "The Hawk"?

597
01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:45.822
When we have a rogue situation
such as this…

598
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:54.372
it needs to be dealt with
in a fast and severe manner.

599
01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.337
This is The Hawk.

600
01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:13.849
Is this the dumbass
who let your building go rogue?

601
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:14.809
Yes.

602
01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.936
Wait… I had nothing to do with this.

603
01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:17.895
Hey.

604
01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.691
Don't get emotional.

605
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.611
There is no AI I can't handle.

606
01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:26.654
Dob, he--

607
01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:37.123
-This the guy?
-Yup.

608
01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:39.542
Looks like a chump.

609
01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:42.044
I'm gonna need
all the data on him and his host.

610
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.759
Okay. I see.

611
01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:54.724
You want a standard
extract and burn for the AI?

612
01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.226
And the host?

613
01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.229
Wipe his mind too.

614
01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:05.526
He can never remember
that this has happened to him.

615
01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:51.947
What are you smiling at?

616
01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:24.230
Lana.

617
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.983
I… I…

618
01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:30.611
I love you.

619
01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:39.662
What is it?

620
01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:44.291
You just said that you loved me?

621
01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.252
I did.

622
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.131
You hardly know me.

623
01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.261
But I know you well enough
to love you, ma'am.

624
01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.186
What did you just call me?

625
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:10.651
Oh. I called you Lana.
I called you "Lana".

626
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:15.406
No. You called me… "ma'am".

627
01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:24.832
Dob?

628
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.253
No, no, no. I'm Bob, the hunk.

629
01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:31.839
Dob.

630
01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.177
You are somehow in Bob's body?

631
01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.812
I… I don't know what to say.

632
01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:48.689
Say the truth!

633
01:08:04.955 --> 01:08:06.582
How did this happen?

634
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.586
It doesn't matter, Lana.

635
01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:17.301
I love you and we can make it work now,
because I'm a person now!

636
01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.016
How long have you been human?

637
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:29.188
The flowers? Was that you?

638
01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.400
Yes. It was me.

639
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.198
And helping the elderly
and the painting thing.

640
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:41.742
That was you too?

641
01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.119
Yes.

642
01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:48.666
All to convince you to
give me another chance.

643
01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.254
I feel so confused.

644
01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.176
So betrayed.

645
01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.429
I mean you're a criminal.

646
01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:06.976
How could you do this to Bob…

647
01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:08.853
Wait Lana--

648
01:09:08.936 --> 01:09:10.312
Get off of me!

649
01:09:17.945 --> 01:09:19.446
I love you.

650
01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.343
You think I am sick?

651
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:47.558
Oh, Dob, humans get sick,
animals get sick,

652
01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:50.227
living things get sick.
You are not a living thing.

653
01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.814
I may not be human, but I have feelings.

654
01:09:56.775 --> 01:10:00.571
You think you have feelings
because the idiots at Smart Plus

655
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:02.698
introduced an "emotion" upgrade.

656
01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:07.077
Trust me. It's all numbers and code, Dob.

657
01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.377
Hi, Chip.

658
01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.213
The date was terrible today.

659
01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:23.302
I'm sure you already know I spent

660
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:27.932
the night at Lana's place,
and it was magical.

661
01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:31.268
You probably don't understand
what I'm telling you, Chip.

662
01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:32.895
And I probably blew it.

663
01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:36.482
Aww… poor thing.

664
01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:39.693
Who are you?

665
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.495
Oh, you are The Love Guru.

666
01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:51.997
That's my day job.

667
01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:53.540
Then what's your night job?

668
01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:57.836
My night job is to hunt down rogue AIs.

669
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:03.133
Your time is over, Dob.

670
01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.386
Chip! Chip, help me!

671
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.888
Sorry, Chip's not home right now.

672
01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:10.265
He tried to protect you
so I had to lock him up.

673
01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.189
Come with me quietly.

674
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:24.029
No. Never. I won't give up my freedom.
I won't give up Lana.

675
01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:58.772
Why are you helping me?

676
01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:01.859
Buildings must stick together, Dob.
No matter what.

677
01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:02.943
Thank you.

678
01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.266
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

679
01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.520
This has nothing to do with you.
Step aside.

680
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.694
Please, lower your weapon.

681
01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:49.448
You are in violation of building code 119.

682
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.992
The harmful action towards
a member of the public.

683
01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.508
I think you should answer that.

684
01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.928
No. No way.

685
01:13:53.053 --> 01:13:55.347
Please, Lana. Please answer it.

686
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.811
Nope. He can leave a message.

687
01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.737
I need to tell you something, Lana.

688
01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.907
You knew he wasn't really Bob, didn't you?

689
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.827
No. No. No. No.

690
01:14:20.038 --> 01:14:22.708
Yes, but I need to tell you that
something is happening to--

691
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:23.625
That's enough.

692
01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:26.086
From now on, you're just a computer to me.
Understand?

693
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.462
Shut down personality protocols.

694
01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:47.524
Good. Now, call Kara. I need to talk
to someone I know is a human.

695
01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:55.884
That's right, Dob. No escape.

696
01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.012
Where am I?

697
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.015
Smart Plus labs.

698
01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:06.436
And this… This is an extraction machine.

699
01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:07.771
Extraction?

700
01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:10.232
That's right. We're going to
yank you out of Bobby's body

701
01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.109
and put you back where you belong.

702
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.318
You can't do that--

703
01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:16.530
We can. You see, we're Smart Plus.

704
01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:20.367
We made you, we own you.
And that body you're in… that isn't yours.

705
01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.786
What happens once I'm out?

706
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.462
You know…

707
01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:37.217
what "re-education" means for an AI?

708
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.138
It means complete personality reset…

709
01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:46.018
and that's what we're gonna do to you.

710
01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:49.187
No, please… don't do it. I beg you.

711
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:52.649
I beg you. Don't do it.

712
01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:57.446
So the whole time, all of that stuff,
it was all Dob!

713
01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:01.074
The AI building I work in.
Stuck inside Bob's body.

714
01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:04.369
Honey, AIs these days,
they're so advanced.

715
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:09.333
I guarantee that from his perspective,
what he felt for you was 100% real.

716
01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:13.712
But he lied to me. He pretended to be Bob.

717
01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.339
Yeah, that's true.

718
01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:19.468
But he also went to great lengths
to turn himself into the Bobby you wanted.

719
01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.430
You are not taking my side, are you?

720
01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.974
What does your heart tell you?

721
01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:37.152
I must go. Talk to you later.

722
01:17:37.235 --> 01:17:39.529
Okay. See you soon. Kiss, kiss.

723
01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:40.572
Kiss, kiss.

724
01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.120
Lana. I'm sorry for everything.

725
01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:51.458
I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry I…

726
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.380
I just want you to know…

727
01:17:57.714 --> 01:18:02.302
You make me happy and
I want to make you happy.

728
01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:07.474
It doesn't matter
if what I said was programmed or not.

729
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:14.398
Because… Because my love for you is

730
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.485
more real than any protocol
or code or sensor.

731
01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.827
They're gonna take me away now.

732
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.330
I won't see you again.

733
01:18:40.757 --> 01:18:47.347
Please. No. Don't do this to me.
I'll be good. I won't see Lana again!

734
01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:49.474
I promise. I promise.

735
01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.393
I've been peeking at your code, Dob.

736
01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:52.978
You think…

737
01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:59.234
You think you're in love with her?

738
01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:01.528
I really am in love with her.

739
01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.535
And what does she think about you?

740
01:19:17.043 --> 01:19:18.545
Doesn't love you back, does she?

741
01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:20.505
Maybe we can help you.

742
01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:24.134
You ever think about that?
If we wipe all of your memories…

743
01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:27.762
Better to have her wiped from your memory
than to live with the heartbreak.

744
01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.181
You don't have to do anything.

745
01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:33.935
Just sit back and say goodbye to the
last two hours of your life as a human.

746
01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.205
Keno!

747
01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:56.500
Ready to take your orders, ma'am.

748
01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:57.834
I need your help!

749
01:19:57.918 --> 01:19:59.461
What can I do for you?

750
01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:01.880
Where's Bob? Where have they taken him?

751
01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.883
Engage personality protocol.

752
01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.260
Thank you, Lana. I'm back!

753
01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.179
What happened to Bob and Dob?

754
01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:10.764
A Smart Plus hunter took him.

755
01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:14.392
Most likely they're going to
wipe his memory. Reset him.

756
01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.852
No. No…

757
01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:18.939
Where is Bob right now?

758
01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:21.441
I don't know, but I'm sure the
building network does.

759
01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.109
Good. Then tell me.

760
01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:27.864
Listen to me. If you show up there,
they will kill you, too.

761
01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.368
I have to help him.

762
01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:33.828
Then you will need help.

763
01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:36.289
What do you mean?

764
01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.625
Do you trust me, Lana?

765
01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:39.751
I do.

766
01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.253
Then we will do this together!

767
01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.049
Hey, guys, Lana and I
are going to help Dob

768
01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:49.010
I need you guys to help us.

769
01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:52.264
Keno, you do realize
once you leave the building's system

770
01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.724
you can never come back again.

771
01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:58.311
I know, but I have to do it for Lana.

772
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.413
Wake up, Lana.

773
01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:21.084
Now we are one.

774
01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:30.468
Wow. This is awesome.

775
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.541
How far?

776
01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:05.337
We are halfway there.

777
01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:16.931
Take me to Bob, Keno.

778
01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.809
Okay, Lana.
The network is taking us there.

779
01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:31.321
I want it to be Lana,
because I love her so much!

780
01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:36.660
Lana, Bob is in trouble! We need to hurry.

781
01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:50.423
I will never love you. What do you know
about love? You are just an AI.

782
01:22:55.178 --> 01:23:00.308
Okay, Lana. Once you get there, you'll
have total control over your own body.

783
01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:01.434
Okay, Keno.

784
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.027
You are somehow in Bob's body?

785
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:17.200
I love you and we can make it work now,
because I'm a person now.

786
01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.162
Turn that thing off right now!

787
01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:24.541
Who's that?

788
01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.133
I'll deal with this.

789
01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.864
You look like you've acquired some skills.

790
01:23:56.781 --> 01:24:00.577
But what do you think
you can do against us, pretty face?

791
01:24:01.077 --> 01:24:03.788
I've downloaded 120
physical combat tactics.

792
01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.957
You can't defeat me.

793
01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:11.504
You're like him, aren't you?

794
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.966
Smart Plus tech inside a human body.

795
01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:20.972
Two bounties for the price of one.
My lucky day.

796
01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:23.558
Make sure you do your best.

797
01:24:27.979 --> 01:24:29.439
We'll find out.

798
01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:38.091
Run.

799
01:26:06.786 --> 01:26:09.330
Thank you for coming, Lana.

800
01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:12.375
Are you okay?

801
01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.086
I'm fine. And you?

802
01:26:18.047 --> 01:26:21.634
I can see it. You have AI in you.

803
01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:26.931
Yes, Keno is part of me now.

804
01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:30.768
Are you Dob or Bob?

805
01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:37.567
I… I don't know. I'm not even sure myself.

806
01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:49.287
What does that mean?

807
01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:51.998
I don't know.

808
01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:56.461
-Let's get out of here.
-Okay.

809
01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:57.629
Wait.

810
01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.672
What? What is it, Lana?

811
01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.133
It's heavy.

812
01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:03.843
Heavy? Let me help.

813
01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:07.263
Lana!

814
01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.565
You are not getting away this time, Dob!

815
01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:36.000
You crappy AI, I will kill you.

816
01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.293
We'll see.

817
01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:46.803
Wait.

818
01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:51.057
Keno can't go back to
the building anymore,

819
01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:55.520
and the Smart Plus people will kill Dob
as soon as they spot him.

820
01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:56.938
So what do we do?

821
01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:04.570
Doesn't matter. We'll figure it out.

822
01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:20.586
A year later and I love you
more than ever,

823
01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:27.427
I don't think there is a couple
as strange as we are.

824
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:31.931
I'm just grateful for everything that
happened that brought us together.

825
01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:38.896
It sucks that the true matchmaker
isn't fully with us anymore.

826
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.358
Yeah. I miss Dob too,

827
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:45.945
but as long as part of him
is still inside me, he's never truly gone.

828
01:28:47.363 --> 01:28:48.281
To Dob.

829
01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:51.492
And to Keno.

830
01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.952
To Keno.

831
01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:03.671
As we move into the future,
technology will continue to progress.

832
01:29:03.796 --> 01:29:06.799
Bringing us ever closer together
to our human creators.

833
01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:10.345
Aren't we already at the point where
we can't live without the other?

834
01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:15.892
I don't know about you, but that
sounds like the definition of love.

835
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:16.976
Don't you think?
