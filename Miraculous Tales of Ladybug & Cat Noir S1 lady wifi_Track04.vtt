&lrm;Yeah, of course not.

&lrm;Sorry to bust your news story.
&lrm;Next time double-check your facts.

&lrm;[Cat Noir] What's the plan?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.940
&lrm;Her powers come from her phone.
&lrm;In the basement, there's no service.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.540
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;No service, no power. Nice one.

&lrm;[Cat Noir] She locked the doors.

&lrm;You realize we might know
&lrm;each other in real life?

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.780
&lrm;[Ladybug] I doubt it. It's locked.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.420
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Not this one.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.620

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.820
&lrm;So... No, where did they go?

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.660
&lrm;[gasping]

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.900
&lrm;Stay. I won't tell anyone
&lrm;who you are, cat's honor.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.980
&lrm;Nobody must know who we really are,
&lrm;not even us.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.020
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.220
&lrm;[he sighs]

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.980
&lrm;[Tikki sighs]
&lrm;That was close.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.420
&lrm;Tell me about it.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.620
&lrm;[comic music]

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.140
&lrm;You were about to know
&lrm;who your love is.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.820
&lrm;What were you thinking?

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.380
&lrm;That's the thing.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.140
&lrm;I wasn't thinking. I followed my heart.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.460
&lrm;Your mask will fall one day, Ladybug.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.940
&lrm;Then you'll have to hand over
&lrm;your precious Miraculous.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.300
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Is that true? You're gonna tell him?

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.300
&lrm;Is that what your heart says?

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.020
&lrm;Your heart tells you one thing,
&lrm;but a superhero listens to her head.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.500
&lrm;[Alya] Got it!

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.500
&lrm;My new smartphone puts
&lrm;the old one to shame.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.620
&lrm;Just look at these pics.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.820
&lrm;What's with all these photos
&lrm;of Adrien?

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.700
&lrm;Well... with a mask and a costume...

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.460
&lrm;doesn't he look like Cat Noir?

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.020
&lrm;Are you out of your mind?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.220
&lrm;He's tons more legit than Cat Noir.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.260
&lrm;I happen to think
&lrm;that Cat Noir is pretty slick.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.420
&lrm;Stop taking photos of Adrien...

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.740
&lrm;unless you give them to me.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.180
&lrm;-Give it back!
&lrm;-No.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.940
&lrm;Come on, what if you drop it?

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.220
&lrm;You're so clumsy.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.500
&lrm;[they giggle]

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.780
