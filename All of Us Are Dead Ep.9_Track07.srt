It's almost like the virus
is evolving on its own.

We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

in the school science lab.

to get ourselves out of this catastrophe.

-Do you think his story is credible?
-Yes.

134
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,780
The research says
the initial reports of the outbreak

135
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,241
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and the high school.

136
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,828
And says the girl that was taken
to the ER was a student there.

137
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,498
I'm positive that Hyosan High School
was ground zero.

I don't know.

184
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,478
It looks like he became
something totally different.

185
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
I don't think he can die.

186
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
What if he climbs back up here?

187
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,777
He's bad enough…

188
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,614
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

189
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,699
You saw her fighting before.

Well…

You won't do that to us, right?

195
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,594
Would you believe me
if I said that I wouldn't?

196
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,846
Why do you have to say it that way?

197
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
Can you at least try
to make us believe you?

I don't think I was naive,
I think I was a coward.

205
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,089
I was too scared my grades would drop
and my mom would get mad.

206
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,632
So I didn't do anything.

I was too scared to make friends.

208

My mom would always ask me
what rank they were in class,

what their parents did,
how big their house was…

Firefighter Nam So-ju saved us,
and he did this despite the fact

556
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,925
that his daughter was nearby.

557

after he saved us

His daughter was everything to him.

necessary to save his daughter.

It's like the human and the monster
are fighting inside the patient.

00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
Is it at all possible…

652
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,104
that there are others like her?

[breathes deeply]

As per KDCA's recommendation,

655
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,237
it's best to presume

656
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,657
that they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

657

[foreboding music]

658

Going forward,

659
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,211
separate everyone from Hyosan

660
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,755
and considered them infected
but asymptomatic.

661
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,468
And monitor later rescues
separately and more closely.

00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,933
Yeah. You really are amazing.

665
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,854
To use us in that situation.

666
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,400
She didn't use you at all
she just made the best of the situation.

667
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,278
[Eun-hee] When it rains,
you set up your barrels.

668
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,197
And when it's windy,
you set up the turbine, right?

669
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,490
That's politics.

670
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,119
You'll use that video
for your campaign, won't you?

671
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,957
Even though you didn't save anyone,
you'll get lots of votes

672
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
like you did something huge.

673
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,253
Hey, she did.

674
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,841
She took full responsibility
just to get you out of this mess, okay?

675
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,056
She never told our captain
he should try to run and escape.

Whether or not he saves his daughter,

680
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,819
Mr. Nam will come out of this a hero.

681
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,323
That's what we're gonna be
working on right now.

682
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,659
Don't you want your captain to be a hero?

683
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,662
-That's not what I--
-And we're all on the same page.

Let's look at the big picture here.

685

From this moment on,
we are on the same team.

686
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,714
We just have to stick together.

For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport.

Do we look like criminals to you?

693

Why are you suddenly
imprisoning all of us?

694
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,315
Also, how dare you try to put handcuffs
on an assemblywoman, huh?
