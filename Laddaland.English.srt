1
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,240
I'm glad

2
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,439
all four of us are finally together.

3
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,560
Daddy, I want to see Lin Bing the panda.

4
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,719
Of course, son.

5
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,360
We will go today.

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
We will all go together.

7
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,919
I would rather sleep.

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,639
Please, can we go?

9
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,520
Please, Nan.

10
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,879
Please.

11
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,800
LADDALAND

12
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,199
-You like it?
-Yes.

13
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,160
Mom, I want to take a look inside.

14
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,279
Wait, let's take a picture first.

15
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,959
Take a picture later.
Pay off the house first.

16
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you like it?

17
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,639
Dad did this himself.

18
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,160
How nice, you can see the mountain
from your window.

19
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
You don't have a view like this
in Bangkok.

20
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,319
Mom, do you know what Bangkok has?

21
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,160
Grandma, my school, and my friends.

22
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,920
You aren't the only one
who left everything behind.

23
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
I told you that I don't want to be here,
yet you still dragged me here.

24
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why, did you love me all of the sudden?

25
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,399
There was only Nat back then.
You guys were fine.

26
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,839
NAT

27
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,879
Ben 10!

28
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,680
Ben 10!

29
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,079
Wow, Gekiranger.

30
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Dad, what is that?
Why is it following you?

31
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,800
Yes.

32
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,560
It follows us everywhere
no matter where we walk.

33
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,079
Do you know what it is?

34
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a...

35
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
magic eye.

36
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,680
Moron.

37
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
It's called an eye sensor.

38
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
All the new air-conditioners
have this feature.

39
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,879
It's called a "magic eye."

40
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,600
How else does it know where we are?

41
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,920
If you want to be an idiot, be my guest.

42
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,639
Cut it out.
No fighting at the dinner table.

43
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,759
I'm glad all four of us are finally...

44
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,279
Hi, Grandma.

45
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,959
Oh, I was busy unpacking.

46
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,600
It's okay.

47
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,959
It's a housing project.

48
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,879
If it was run down,
it won't be able to sell.

49
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,959
My own TV?

50
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,560
We're already lucky
to have one for the whole house.

51
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,360
Nan,

52
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,079
don't take a phone call during dinner.

53
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes,

54
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,680
my teacher taught me
not to take a phone call during dinner.

55
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
It's bad manners.

56
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,800
And has your teacher ever taught you
not to interrupt during a conversation?

57
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,319
Nan, speak nicely to your brother.

58
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,840
What's so funny?
I tried really hard to surprise you.

59
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay. Sorry.

60
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll open it then.

61
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,759
Put the glasses down first, maybe?

62
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
Yes, I forgot.

63
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,360
Do you need my help?

64
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,039
No, just stand over there.

65
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
Show off.

66
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,759
-Damn it!
-Oh, my god!

67
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,679
Thee, get the water!

68
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,759
Shit!

69
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,679
Hold on.

70
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,080
Hurry up, Thee.

71
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,279
Instead of christening the house,

72
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,559
you celebrate with a bottle of wine
and almost burned the house down.

73
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,159
It will be fine.
Just get the maid to clean up.

74
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,480
When you went to pick up the kids,

75
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,120
I hired a Burmese maid.

76
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,000
She does a fine job.

77
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,360
Let's save as much as we can, Thee.

78
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,240
You earn 60,000 baht a month.

79
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,440
The mortgage alone is 30,000 baht.

80
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,759
Parn, don't worry.

81
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,639
Don't forget that I take commissions too.

82
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,279
Yoi told me I can expect at least
another 20,000 baht a month.

83
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,639
Or else I wouldn't dare to live here.

84
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,360
Everyone who has joined our business

85
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,799
could say that they are financially set
for the rest of their lives.

86
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
EMPIRE
DIETARY SUPPLEMENT

87
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,519
My assistant, Mr. Theera,
is a great example.

88
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,679
He used to work at
an air condition company in Bangkok.

89
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,360
He has a dream like you all.
To own a house one day.

90
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,120
He had worked for 14 years.

91
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,919
Fourteen years!

92
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,000
In the end, that company couldn't make
his dream come true.

93
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,200
But within only three months

94
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,559
since Mr. Theera has joined us.

95
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Would you like to know
what he got last month?

96
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,480
Mr. Theera, why don't you tell everyone
what you got last month?

97
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,559
I put the down payment on a house.

98
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,480
A down payment! Wow!

99
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,080
Let's give him a round of applause!

100
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,000
Excellent.

101
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,919
Mom?

102
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,039
How come Nan has to
take the bus to school?

103
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,240
I gave you the car
to take my children home.

104
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,679
It's not for your husband!

105
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
I helped raise Nan for over ten years.

106
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,320
I have never put her
in an unsafe situation.

107
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,159
Mom, your grandchild is also my daughter.

108
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,440
And Nan is already 14.

109
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,480
There are kids younger than Nan
who take the bus.

110
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,840
Stop making excuses for your husband.

111
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,679
I'm not making any excuses.

112
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,559
But you got to be fair to him, too.

113
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,240
You never congratulate him
when he bought the house.

114
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,200
And now I don't have to work anymore.

115
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,480
Why should I give him credit

116
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,440
for doing what he is supposed to do?

117
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Mom, I got to go now.
I need to go buy some groceries.

118
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,679
Go ahead. You got to catch a bus.

119
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,840
Hurry up before it gets
any hotter outside.

120
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,600
Okay.

121
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,279
Hey. Go away.

122
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Go!

123
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
Go!

124
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,200
You always say that my mom
likes to spoil her kids, so what's this?

125
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,399
There's a zero percent interest promotion.

126
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,639
Don't worry. I can make the payments.

127
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,679
Nat will want one, too.

128
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,879
Whose cat pooped here?

129
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,679
Here you are.

130
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,759
Thee!

131
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,679
What the heck?

132
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,759
Do you have a problem?

133
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,320
I am sorry.

134
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,399
I was trying to hit the cat
that pooped in my yard.

135
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,639
My cat did that?

136
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,720
-Yes.
-Then I'm sorry.

137
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,759
I will take care of it.

138
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Okay.

139
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Nid.

140
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,840
-Nid.
-That's okay. It's not a big deal.

141
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
Don't worry.

142
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm Somkiat.

143
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,080
I went to work in Bangkok for a month

144
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
so I didn't get to say hello.

145
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,039
I am Thee and this is Parn, my wife.

146
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,399
-Hello.
-Hello.

147
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,159
Chowguay took a dump in their yard.

148
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,679
Get a broom and clean it for them.

149
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,840
I am so sorry.

150
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,279
I will take care of it.

151
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,639
Oh, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

152
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh, no. I better do it.

153
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,480
Take this and clean it for them too.

154
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,919
Excuse me, I got to go now.

155
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,879
I think Somkiat's family is a bit strange.

156
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,759
Just let them be.

157
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,879
Hey!

158
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Hey!

159
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,639
About my offer to work at my house...

160
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,440
Hey, you.

161
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
Hey.

162
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,440
-I'm serious, Mom. Taew has a crush on me.
-Why do you think so?

163
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,080
Because I am handsome.

164
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,120
Yes, you are the most handsome boy
in the world.

165
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,879
Mom, a police car. Hurry!

166
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,759
Nat, don't run.

167
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Nobody lives here.

168
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,240
The foreigner owns the house
but he barely comes to stay.

169
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,159
He usually comes around the New Year.

170
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,159
When was the last time you saw the maid?

171
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,000
Several days ago.

172
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,320
I noticed that the door
was broken this morning.

173
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,480
So I called the police right away.

174
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,200
Mom, lift me up.

175
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,799
Mom, what are they doing?

176
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,039
Maybe they are filming a movie.

177
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,599
Lieutenant, the back door was pried open.

178
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,160
I will go inside to check.

179
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,920
Affirmative. Be careful.

180
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,079
Lieutenant, the house
has been ransacked...

181
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,079
and stinks.

182
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,319
Oh, shit!

183
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,960
What happened, sergeant?

184
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,480
There is a female body
stuffed inside the fridge.

185
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,039
Her face is completely disfigured.

186
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,599
There was a homicide at house no.8

187
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,640
in Laddaland Village, Muang district,
Chiang Mai province.

188
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,799
The police have found
the body of a Burmese woman

189
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,720
who is believed to be about 20 years old.

190
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,079
The body was beaten
with a thick wooden stick

191
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,359
and her face was severely burned by acid.

192
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
The murderer tried to hide

193
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,119
her body inside the refrigerator.

194
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,880
The police suspects that

195
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,160
the murderer must have known the victim.

196
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,559
The motive for this homicide
is an extramarital affair.

197
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,160
Thee.

198
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,839
Someone died in our village today.

199
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,559
It was the Burmese maid
at the foreigner's house on the corner.

200
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,240
How is that possible?

201
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Why?

202
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,279
Nothing.

203
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,200
Has Nan heard about this?

204
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,920
Not yet.

205
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,200
Good, don't tell her yet.

206
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,480
Or else your mom will call
and complain again.

207
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,079
It's bad that this had to happen
in our village.

208
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,759
There are dead people in every village.
We just didn't know about it.

209
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Shit!

Parn, take her to bed.

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,880
Let's go honey.

216
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,519
Let me go!

217
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,279
-Let me go!
-Please calm down.

218
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,119
Makin! Let me go!

219
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,799
Makin! Let me go!

220
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,480
She is here! Let me go!

221
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,880
Let me go!

222
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
Someone died in our village,

223
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,519
and you didn't think of telling me?

224
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,200
It got to the point that
Chat's husband is selling the house.

225
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,640
They saw Makin walking around their house.

226
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
Nobody would want to stay.

227
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,880
I wouldn't even come back to pack
if I were them.

228
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,279
Please pray for her soul.

229
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
I almost hired her to work at my house.

230
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,480
I'm lucky that I didn't.

231
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,039
Else, I'd be freaking out now.

232
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,519
Thee, do you remember the girl
that you wanted to hire?

233
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,960
That girl left a long time ago.

234
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,279
Stop listening to
all that nonsense already.

235
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,119
Are the kids asleep?

236
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,799
Nat is. But Nan is not home yet.

237
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,319
She went to her friend's house
to work on a report.

238
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,799
We just moved
and she is already coming home late?

239
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,079
You should lecture her.

240
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,279
What happened?

241
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,599
A girl came out of nowhere
and ran in front of my car.

242
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,839
I almost hit her.

243
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,519
So close.

244
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,240
Ma'am.

245
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,559
Are you okay?

246
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,240
Shit!

247
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,200
Do you want to come live with me?

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,200
Thee, let's go to bed.

250
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,720
Nan called that she's almost done.
Her friend will drop her off.

251
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,880
I will go downstairs to finish up my work.

252
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,720
Nan.

253
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,359
Nan.

254
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,519
Nan.

255
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,920
Nan.

256
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,279
Your move, punk.

257
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,599
Thee!

258
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,720
I don't think he took anything.

259
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
I came downstairs just in time.

260
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,279
Yes, correct.

261
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,440
Yes.

262
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,759
Yes. Laddaland Village.

263
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,960
Thank you.

264
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,920
What happened to you?

265
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,160
Who dropped you off?

266
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,160
-My friend.
-A girl or a guy?

267
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,039
It's just a friend.

268
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,920
What's the difference
if it was a girl or a guy?

269
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,000
-How come you're home so late?
-I already told Mom.

270
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,960
I know that!

271
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,400
But what kind of report
took you until 1 a.m.?

272
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,960
The kind that wasn't finished!

273
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,799
I would have come home if it was done.

274
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,799
Don't you think I wasn't sleepy too?

275
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,480
I have to get up for school tomorrow.

276
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,880
-Nan!
-I will go talk to her.

277
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,480
Hey!

278
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Don't point the gun at anyone like that.

279
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,559
It's not loaded.

280
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,480
It's a gun. It's always dangerous.

281
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,960
You better be careful
if you want to use it.

282
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,759
I just wanted it for protection.

283
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,519
A burglar just broke into my house.

284
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,240
Always spending.
Ever think of earning money?

285
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,960
I've tried to find more customers.

286
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,440
You mean your sewing business?
That doesn't earn crap.

287
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,920
All the food you eat.
It comes from money I earn!

288
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,119
Why don't you stop buying
our kid expensive toys then?

289
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,359
Don't you dare lecture me!

290
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Chowguay, wait!

291
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,759
Chowguay, stop!

292
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,920
Stop!

293
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,400
It's good for them to play together.

294
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,239
We don't have to tire ourselves out.

295
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,679
How is your mother-in-law?

296
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,840
She has the same disease.

297
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,559
But now it's getting worse.

298
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,000
The doctor recommended
a complete checkup in Bangkok.

299
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,079
You're not scared
that it's just the two of you?

300
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,159
What can I do?

301
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,559
How about this? When Mr. Somkiat
isn't home and you are free,

302
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
you can hang out at my house.

303
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
Dad, Chowguay is a spy.

304
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,719
His collar has a camera.

305
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,679
My dad said it is very popular in Bangkok.

306
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
-Dad, let take a look at the photos.
-Okay.

307
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,159
Hurry, Dad.

308
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,559
My notebook is upstairs. This way.

309
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,199
Nat, don't run upstairs. You might slip.

310
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,119
Parn, can I ask you something?

311
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,639
Shall we see where the cat went?

312
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,840
Here, Dad.

313
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,519
That's a pool.

314
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,280
-That's Aunt Dang
-It's the pool at our village.

315
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,480
-I can see just the legs
-It spied on us too.

316
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,519
Hey, those are my legs and Golf's.

317
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,880
Look at this photo.

318
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,199
What's the matter, Parn?

319
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,679
Pip, why did you stop?

320
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,239
Because Pai did.

321
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,719
Hey, what are you doing?
Just take me home.

322
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,239
Is this the house where that person died?

323
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,599
Don't you see the yellow tape?

324
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,199
It looks just like in the movies.
Let's check it out.

325
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,440
Are you nuts?
Why the heck do you want to go inside?

326
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:01,599
Let's check it out.
It will be quite a thrill...

327
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,440
I don't want to get home late.
My dad already yelled at me last time.

328
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,239
Are you that afraid of your dad?

329
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,800
You guys go in. I'm wearing a skirt.
I don't want to climb the fence.

330
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,039
She doesn't want to climb up
because she's wearing a skirt.

331
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,639
Up to you.

332
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,760
-Okay.
-Fine.

333
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Wait.

334
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,480
-I'm feeling cold with no reasons.
-Let me take some photos.

335
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Hey, what's that?

336
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,880
Stop.

337
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,519
I'm just messing with you.

338
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,360
Damn you.

339
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,480
Come on.

340
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,800
You're bad.

341
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,559
Pip.

342
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,400
Pip.

343
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,000
-Don't go inside.
-We will go in just a few minutes.

344
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,039
PIP

345
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,679
Sorry. This number...

346
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
Pip.

347
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,480
Pip.

348
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,199
Pip!

349
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,840
-Stop messing around. It's not funny!
-Got you there!

350
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,360
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you aren't coming in.

351
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,639
That was fun!

352
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,000
Hey! what are you doing? Open it!

353
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Open it!

354
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,440
Mai.

355
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,880
Pip.

356
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
Nan.

357
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:17,920
Nan, wait!

358
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,719
Nan, I said wait!

359
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,719
I said wait! Didn't you hear me?

360
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,440
Open the door!

361
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,920
-Thee.
-Nan!

362
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,360
-Thee, calm down.
-Open the door. Come out and talk!

363
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,719
What's going on, Mom?

364
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,760
It's nothing. Go back to bed.

365
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,760
What did you do last night?

366
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,119
I saw a ghost last night.

367
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,159
What did you do last night? Answer me!

368
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,599
I'm serious. I went to that haunted house
with my friends last night.

369
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:16,840
And there's a dark shadow that floated by
and we all screamed.

370
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,920
If you can't come up with a better story,
get out of my face!

371
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,800
It's nothing, son. Eat your food.

372
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,960
Not now, Mom. I have a splitting headache.

373
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,199
My granddaughter saw a ghost
and no one cares.

374
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Mom, Nan was lying.

375
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,400
She went out with her friends
and told us she was working on a report.

376
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,599
Even if she went out,
it doesn't mean she lied about that.

377
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,440
Seriously, do you agree with your husband
that she lied about seeing a ghost?

378
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,639
Are you going to blame everything on Thee?

379
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,119
If he wants to be the head of the family
then he has to take the responsibility.

380
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,400
If you didn't get knocked up,

381
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,320
I would've never let you marry him.

382
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,840
Mom.

383
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,000
And if your dad were still alive...

384
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,760
Mom, stop comparing Thee to Dad, okay?

385
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,960
Dad had passed away for many years now.

386
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,320
And even if Dad was still here,

387
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,559
no matter how much Dad hated Thee,

388
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:50,679
Dad wouldn't have made Nan
hate her own father!

389
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,519
You're willing to put your kids at risk.
You're so selfish.

390
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,679
Hey, how is your new home?
Everyone is happy, right?

391
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,920
It's fine.

392
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,320
Okay, another thing.
Our salary will come late for this month.

393
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:27,320
What? Don't act like you're shocked.
Come on.

394
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,679
It is all our fault.

395
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,800
We didn't reach the sales target
that our Bangkok branch expected.

396
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,679
It's just a little problem.
It's not a big deal, right?

397
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,400
And?

398
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,760
This had happened to me before.

399
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,199
It was for three months at that time.
I was so stressed at first.

400
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,480
I thought, how could there be
no salary for three months?

401
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,400
But then, I got paid in a lump sum.

402
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,599
And there's the compensation, too.

403
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,400
Now, when the company says
they will pay late,

404
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm actually very happy.
Don't be stressed.

405
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,079
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

406
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,480
JUNE 2010 INVOICE
TOTAL OVERDUE BALANCE 31,224 BAHT

407
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,320
TOTAL BALANCE 714.27 BAHT

408
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,800
PREVIOUS BALANCE 1,316.10 BAHT

409
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,679
Let's cancel Nan's
Blackberry calling package.

410
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,800
It's too much for a ninth-grade student
to have a thousand-baht phone bill.

411
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,000
I already told you so, but you insisted.

412
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,840
Is Nan asleep yet? I will go talk to her.

413
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,840
She went to her friend's dorm for a report
and she will be home late.

414
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,239
What?

415
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,159
She still dares to come home late?
I thought I made myself clear last time.

416
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,079
Nan is very stubborn. She resists harder
when you are harder on her.

417
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,920
Your mother makes even the nicest kid
become a spoiled brat.

418
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:44,159
It's fortunate that
she didn't raise Nat too.

419
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:06,440
Sorry. I was being too harsh on you.

420
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,679
So which friend
did she spend the night with?

421
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,800
Hey, what did you guys see
the other night?

422
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,119
I didn't see anything myself.

423
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,719
But when I heard Mai scream,

424
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,320
I ran.

425
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,480
What a jerk!

426
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,679
Maybe Mai had fooled us?

427
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,400
I don't think so.

428
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,079
When she screamed,

429
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,079
she looked horrified.

430
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,039
Jerk!

431
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,559
Nan!

432
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:05,480
This is "working on a report"?

433
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,519
How dare you behave like this?

434
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,760
Like what?
I was just playing with my friend.

435
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,559
Do you know how embarrassing
that was for me?

436
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,920
Embarrassed?

437
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,679
Aren't you embarrassed
to touch a guy like that?

438
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,840
Didn't your grandma teach you that?

439
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,079
She always does. You never did.

440
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,119
Don't think of having kids
if you can't raise them.

441
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,960
I still haven't excused you
for lying to me last time!

442
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,360
And you dare to talk to me like this?

443
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,519
Have you ever listened
when I talked politely?

444
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:36,599
I already told you I saw a ghost.

445
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,840
Yet you called me a liar
instead of being worried for me.

446
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,599
-That's because you lied!
-No, I didn't!

447
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,679
-Your village is haunted!
-Stop that nonsense already!

448
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,599
It's not nonsense.
Your village is haunted!

449
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,079
The whole village knows the truth!

450
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,159
-You are the--
-Stop talking!

451
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:50,719
You are the only one in denial!

452
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,280
Your village is haunted! There are ghosts!

453
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
Stop it! I said there are no ghosts! None!

454
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,760
-There are!
-No there aren't!

455
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,840
There are! Your village has ghosts!

456
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,360
There are ghosts here!

457
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,400
What are you doing?

458
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,079
-Get out!
-Let me go!

459
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,920
-I said get out of the car!
-What are you doing?

460
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,159
-No! I'm not going!
-Get down!

461
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,920
Let me go!

462
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,199
Let me go!

463
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,239
-Come here.
-Let me go!

464
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,199
-Come here.
-Let me go!

465
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,000
-I told you to come here.
-Let me go!

466
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,079
Come in!

467
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,199
Let me go, Dad! I don't want to go in!

468
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,599
I said let me go already!

469
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,920
No! I don't want to go in!

470
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,199
Come in!

471
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,440
Let go of me!

472
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,719
-Come in!
-Let go of me!

473
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,840
Let go of me!

474
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,960
-See?
-Let go of me!

475
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,840
-Look, are there any ghosts?
-I won't look!

476
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,840
Let me go!

477
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,239
Let me go!

478
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,280
Let me go!

479
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,400
Let me go already!

480
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,400
Let me go!

481
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,719
Let me go!

482
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:35,239
Bye, Mom.

483
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,440
Nan.

484
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,599
Nan is going to stay with her friend.

485
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:43,360
She will be back on the weekend.

486
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,679
Why did you let her go?

487
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,280
My mom will take her back to Bangkok
if I don't let her go.

488
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,960
Do you want that?

489
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,719
Where are you?

490
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,199
I am at the airport now.

491
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,719
I am about to board my plane to Bangkok.

492
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,440
I got called back
to take care of the marketing there.

493
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,400
What about me, Yoi?

494
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
Thee.

495
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,679
We are all adults here.

496
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:47,719
Don't you get what I mean?

497
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,800
Yoi.

498
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,039
Yoi!

499
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,000
You bastard.

500
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,679
It's good that the company is stable now.

501
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,079
We got to this point because of your help.

502
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,760
I was so surprised when I saw you.

503
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,119
I didn't think you know where I live,
Mr. Manop.

504
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,519
It's good that you came here early
or I would have gone out by now.

505
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,639
How come you have never called me?

506
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,519
I know you are very busy.
I was afraid to bother you.

507
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,360
My life is so hectic
because I don't have you nowadays.

508
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,480
I heard that
your new secretary is very good.

509
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,039
But I liked it better
when you were working for me.

510
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,679
I will be very happy
if we can work together again.

511
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,039
Hey!

512
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,639
Thee.

513
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,239
Why are you home early today?

514
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,400
I have a headache.

515
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,440
So I left early.

516
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,119
Thee, I'm going to pick Nat up.

517
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,480
Parn.

518
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,719
Parn.

519
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:42,760
Thee.

520
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,840
What's the matter?

521
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:48,599
Nothing.

522
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,800
I just have a headache.

Time for work.

538
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,960
Are you coming
to that village with us tonight?

539
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,119
Laddaland Village?

540
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,960
Damn that creepy place.
You still dare to go?

541
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,800
Right. Only the idiots still live there.

542
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:16,880
Go right ahead.

543
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,280
I hope you find what you're looking for.

544
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:26,000
Hey!

545
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,320
Shit!

546
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:32,960
-Hey!
-Let me go!

547
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:36,360
Hey, I need help.

548
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,840
Hey, stop!

549
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:41,679
What's wrong with you?

550
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,360
How could you do that to the customer?

551
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:44,719
He was shoplifting!

552
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,159
Just call the police!

553
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,440
This is unacceptable.
Leave now. You're fired!

554
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,079
I'm not leaving!

555
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,360
If I go, how the hell will I live?

SAVINGS DEPOSIT PASSBOOK

What's that voice?

558
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,119
Golf, what are you doing?

559
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,239
Nat, come here.

560
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,480
What were you guys playing, Golf?

561
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:03,079
What if something happened to him?

562
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:07,719
He hid inside the closet.

563
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,000
I was just joking with him.

564
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,159
Joking?

565
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,000
If you are going to play like this,
then don't play here anymore.

566
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,159
Go home now.

567
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:28,159
Your son locked my son inside the closet.

568
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,320
What would happen if nobody was home?

569
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:34,960
Golf.

570
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,360
Did you do that to his son?

571
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:47,920
Satisfied?

572
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:51,480
Go inside.

573

01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:33,519
Parn!

576
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:35,360
-Parn!
-Yes?

577
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:36,440
Where is Nat?

578
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,760
He went to play outside with Golf.

579
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,119
Nat!

580
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:15,559
Nat!

581
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,199
Nat!

582
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,840
Nat!

583
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,039
Nat!

584
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,079
Nat, is that you?

585
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,320
Nat, is that you?

586
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:33,559
Hello, Parn.

587
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,679
Hello, Thee. Where are you now?

588
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,199
Nat is already home.

589
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:00,599
Why did you play
inside that foreigner's house?

590
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,280
Answer me.
Why did you play inside that house?

591
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,519
Golf told me to go get Chowguay.

592
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,480
Your son is too much now!

593
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,840
He forced my son to go
inside that foreigner's house.

594
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,960
What are you going to do
if something happened to my son?

595
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:24,880
Has anything happened?

596
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,039
How dare you say that?

597
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,079
Are you done?

598
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,079
What kind of a father are you?

599
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,480
If you can't teach your own son
then just call him out here.

600
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,679
I will teach him in your place!

601
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,639
I can teach my own son.

602
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:41,400
You go tell your wife

603
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:43,199
to mind her own business.

604
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,239
Give me back my money first.

605
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:46,760
When did I ever borrow your money?

606
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,800
Your wife asked my wife
for 10,000 baht last month.

607
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,079
It's you who can't handle your shit.

608
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,760
If you're damn proud,
take care of your family with your money.

609
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,320
Why do you have to bother others?

610
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:15,239
Here's your money!

611
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,280
And keep out of our business!

612
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,719
Damn cat!

613
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:19,000
Excuse me?

614
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,399
I'm ready to pay.

615
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,720
Oh, okay.

616
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,560
Do you want some more sausages?

617
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,760
How much?

618
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,680
Twelve baht.

619
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,560
Keep the change.

620
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:24,319
Why didn't you tell me?

621
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:26,479
How would it help if I told you?

622
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,079
Is it any better to keep it to yourself?

623
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,039
I have a job interview
the day after tomorrow.

624
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,279
I just need to borrow the money for now.

625
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
I will put it back when I get paid.

626
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,560
I am going back to work.

627
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,239
Mr. Manop has opened a new branch here
in Chiang Mai.

628
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,600
You want to go back to work
or go back to him?

629
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:57,560
You used to do marketing in Bangkok
for about ten years.

630
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,479
It should be easy for you to expand
the market for us here.

631
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,560
Actually, different people
in different locations

632
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,840
have different natures
that will vary accordingly.

633
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,199
From my experience,

634
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:12,319
my marketing strategy would be...

635
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,199
I'm sorry.

636
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,560
From my experience,

637
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,479
any time we want to change the consumers

638
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,000
or change the consumers' habits

639
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:28,960
we should...

640
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,680
I'm sorry.

641
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,920
There must be some emergency at home.

642
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,960
Parn, I'm having a job interview.

643
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,920
Mr. Thee.

644
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,439
Mr. Somkiat shot everyone in the house.

645
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,079
He was probably stressed about work.

646
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:11,840
His factory went bankrupt
with ten million baht in debt.

647
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:15,640
It's true. Nid borrowed money
from so many people.

648
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:19,039
Did she ask you too?
I thought she only asked me.

649
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,880
Me too.

650
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,520
I am reporting a homicide.

651
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,760
One male, two females,
one boy at Laddaland Village.

652
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:29,600
Poor Golf.

653
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,520
Someone said his skull caved in
where he was shot.

654
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:37,319
Didn't you hear anything, Mr. Thee?

655
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,680
Mr. Somkiat has been dead
in that house for days.

656
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,600
I don't want to live here anymore.

657
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,319
- Let's move out.
- Where will we move to?

658
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,000
Our home is here.

659
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,439
I'm about to get a new job.

660
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,039
Everything will get better.

661
01:13:58,079 --> 01:13:59,920
It is not about work anymore, Thee.

662
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,840
Didn't you see?

663
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,039
They have been dead for days.

664
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,039
-That means the last few days--
-It was just all in our heads.

665
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,520
Pack up.

666
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,239
Let's go back to Bangkok.

667
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,039
Let's start over.

668
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,920
It's easy to say that, Parn.

669
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,119
But we still have to pay off this house.

670
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,960
If we move now,

671
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,960
I will lose the house

672
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:26,680
and the installments.

673
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,359
What would I have left?

674
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:38,760
You have me and the kids.

675
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,960
Weren't we happy back then,
even when we didn't have our own house?

676
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,159
I don't want to go back
so your mom can look down on me.

677
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,680
You care how she feels about you.

678
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,560
But don't you care
how the kids and I feel?

679
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,159
I don't care, Parn?

680
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:08,319
Who do you think
I'm doing all of this for?

681
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,359
I bought this house for you and our kids.

682
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,439
So we can all be together.

683
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,159
Is this "not caring," Parn?

684
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:24,560
Let's go back to Bangkok.

685
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,680
If we can't afford a house,
we can rent like before.

686
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,279
And Nan will stay with us.

687
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,000
I will help.

688
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,239
I will go back to work.

689
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,920
Do you want to go back to work that bad?

690
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:43,479
You keep nagging me about going to Bangkok
because you want to see him, right?

691
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:47,680
Hey, wait. Listen to me carefully.

692
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:51,560
How many times do I have to tell you
that Mr. Manop is just my boss.

693
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,520
Just your boss?

694
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,720
Why did he come all the way here
in Chiang Mai?

695
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,399
And so? I wasn't the one who went to him!

696
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,560
Who comes or goes isn't the point.

697
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,720
The point is,

698
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:04,439
what were you two doing?

699
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:12,159
I will try to believe that
you are saying all of this

700
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,920
because you are angry.

701
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,960
But if you really think that
I am that kind of person,

702
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,119
we can't live together anymore.

703
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:42,680
FOR SALE

704
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,479
LADDALAND

705
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,520
Nat!

706
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,399
Nat! Come down right now!

707
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,159
How many times did I tell you
to put your toys away?

708
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,560
I didn't take them out.

709
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,319
So I did then?

710
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:02,039
Golf did.

711
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,119
Nat.

712
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,319
Don't lie to me.

713
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,680
They all went to Bangkok
and they are not home.

714
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,119
They already came back.

715
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:12,479
We are playing hide and seek now.

716
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,520
Don't lie to me!
They haven't come back yet!

717
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,560
They did.

718
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,800
Nat, stop lying!

719
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:21,039
Golf!

720
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:22,520
-Nat!
-You can come out now!

721
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,880
I don't want to play anymore!

722
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,640
-Nat!
-Please come out!

723
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,840
Golf.

724
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,840
Golf, I don't want to play anymore.
Come out.

725
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,880
Golf, come out already.
I don't want to play anymore.

726
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:36,479
Golf!

727
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,039
Nat!

728
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:41,760
Golf, I don't want to play anymore.

729
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,399
Golf, come out now.

730
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,560
-Nat!
-Golf!

731
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,239
My mom is yelling at me!

732
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,680
Golf. I don't want to play anymore.
Come out.

733
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:02,479
Golf!

734
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,840
Enough. Stop lying to me!

735
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,520
I'm not lying.

736
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,680
Nat. Don't lie to me!

737
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,399
I didn't lie.

738
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:14,159
I told you to stop!

739
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,680
I'm not lying.

740
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,119
So what were you doing just now?

741
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:19,079
I'm not lying!

742
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:21,039
You said Golf is here. Where is he?

743
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:23,359
I guess he already went home.

744
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:26,399
That's not true. Nat, don't lie to me.
Stop lying to me!

745
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,479
I'm not lying.

746
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,479
Why are you a bad child?

747
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,760
Why are you a bad child?

748
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,279
Didn't I already tell you?

749
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,920
Why? Stop it!

750
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,720
Stop crying now!

751
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,119
-Parn!
-Stop!

752
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,039
-Parn!
-Stop crying!

753
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:42,960
-Parn!
-Stop!

754
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,960
Why are you hitting him?

755
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,560
Are you out of your mind?

756
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:50,479
What's wrong with you?

757
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,279
Goodness, am I dreaming?

758
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,159
I'm honored that
you are actually calling me first.

759
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:36,199
Mom...

760
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,520
It's okay.

761
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,560
Even if I hate your husband's guts,

762
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:50,920
you are still my daughter.

763
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,039
And I love my grandkids.

764
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:57,439
If you can't stand staying there anymore,
feel free to move back here.

765
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:01,239
I can tolerate looking at your husband
once or twice a week.

766
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:04,479
It's better than seeing you
and my grandkids haunted by ghosts.

767
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,680
Do you want me to talk to him?

768
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:08,399
That's okay, Mom.

769
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,600
I will talk to him tomorrow.

770
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,760
Nan,

771
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,239
pack up. We're going back to Bangkok.

772
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,039
Excuse me.

773
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,199
Is anyone home?

774
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:12,640
I'm sorry.

775
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,279
EMERGENCY ROOM

776
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:30,119
Please calm down.

777
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:31,600
Please stay calm.

778
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:34,720
There's nothing there.

779
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:36,680
Nat, please stay here.

780
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:46,000
Parn.

781
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,720
Parn.

782
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,560
Go away. Leave me alone.

783
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,239
Do you love that house so much?

784
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:58,680
Do you love it that much?

785
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:01,199
How about your kid? Look!

786
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,560
If you love that place that much,
then just go back and live with it.

787
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,000
Nan is so damn unlucky
to have a dad like you!

788
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:13,840
Go to hell!

789
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,199
-Parn
-Go!

790
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:41,600
Dad,

791
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:44,960
can you sleep with me tonight?

792
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:47,880
Okay, son.

793
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:00,319
Nat.

794
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:02,359
Do you like this house?

795
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:12,399
Yes, but I like our old house more.

796
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,840
Nat.

797
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,640
Nat!

798
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,600
Nat!

799
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,640
Nat!

800
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:03,199
Nat!

801
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,920
Nat!

802
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:07,359
Nat!

803
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,800
Nat!

804
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,800
Nat!

805
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,640
Nat!

806
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:17,960
Nat!

807
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:19,600
Where are you?

808
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:27,239
Parn,

809
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,920
Did you come to pick Nat up?

810
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,680
Is he with you, Parn?

811
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:08,000
Nat!

812
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:25,359
Nat!

813
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,079
Nat!

814
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:14,239
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

815
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,079
Golf.

816
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,079
Is Nat here?

817
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,920
Where is he?

818
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:13,880
Thee!

819
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:14,880
Nat!

820
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:15,960
Nat!

821
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,439
Nat.

822
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:33,399
Nat.

823
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,479
Nat!

824
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:50,079
Nat!

825
01:35:51,239 --> 01:35:53,439
Nat! Are you in here, son?

826
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:49,720
Mr. Somkiat, where is my son?

827
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,279
Asshole! Where is my son?

828
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,880
Nat!

829
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:11,880
Nat!

830
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:14,920
Nat, wake up!

831
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:18,680
Nat, Wake up! I am here!

832
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,319
Nat!

833
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,199
Nat!

834
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,600
Nat!

835
01:40:26,119 --> 01:40:27,520
Nat!

836
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:31,239
Nat!

837
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,800
Nat!

838
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,079
Nat!

839
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,640
Nat, wake up! I'm here.

840
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,279
Thee!

841
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,000
Thee!

842
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:34,359
Thee!

843
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:37,520
Thee!

844
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:37,880
NA

845
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:24,600
Nan, did you know?

846
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:27,119
Up until my final year of university,

847
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,880
I had so many plans.

848
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:36,399
But when...

849
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:40,359
I knew I have you in my belly,

850
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:45,279
all my plans fell apart.

851
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,880
I kept thinking,

852
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:51,800
how can I be a mother at that age?

853
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:54,399
How can I raise a child?

854
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:02,119
Then I made a decision

855
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:04,079
to tell your dad...

856
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,079
that I wanted an abortion.

857
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:12,760
I thought we would break up.

858
01:44:14,199 --> 01:44:15,920
But on the next day,

859
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:19,119
he went to see your grandma.

860
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,560
He told her

861
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,560
that he will propose to me.

862
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,760
Grandma yelled at him like crazy.

863
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,640
But your dad didn't say a word.

864
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:43,359
He just said...

865
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:51,520
"It's my family,

866
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:54,720
I can take care of them.

867
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,199
It's my family,

868
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,439
I will look after them."

869
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,800
Nan, he really loved you, you know.
