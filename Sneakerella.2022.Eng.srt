<i>Not all fairy tales begin</i>
<i>in a land far, far away.</i>

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
<i>Ours begins right here.</i>

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>Do you recognize it?</i>

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>It's home to many kings and queens,</i>
<i>though they don't all wear crowns.</i>

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>A land of possibility and opportunity.</i>

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:26,943
<i>Though for many, these dreams can feel</i>
<i>as far away as a castle in the clouds.</i>

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>Once upon a pair of sneakers,</i>

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>far from the gleaming towers</i>
<i>of this kingdom,</i>

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:37,328
<i>there lived a special boy</i>
<i>who was full of kindness and creativity.</i>

12
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>Like many in this town,</i>
<i>he grew up believing in the idea that</i>

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>the perfect pair of kicks could</i>
<i>make him fly, make him soar.</i>

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>And, with his head full of sketches</i>
<i>and his heart full of hope,</i>

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,551
<i>he held tight to these dreams,</i>

16
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:56,222
<i>no matter how hard the world around him</i>
<i>tried to keep his feet on the ground.</i>

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,728
Whoo.

18
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,939
Whoo!

19
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,276
Come on, come on.

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,584
Oh!

21
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
- Get out of here!

22
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,747
Sorry! Sorry.

23
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,353
Man.

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,104
- Whoo!

25
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,904
- Yeah, I see you.

26
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,281
Come on.

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,661
Let's get it, come on. Oh!

28
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,553
- What?

29
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,517
- What?

30
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,978
You see this?

31
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,830
Hey, hey. Whoo!

32
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,040
Hey. Oh.

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,208
Hey, hey. Yeah.

34
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,460
El.

35
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,088
<i>But no matter how hard he tried to soar…</i>

36
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,051
<i>…his stepfather</i>
<i>and selfish stepbrothers had other plans.</i>

37
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:24,973
<i>For they needed him here with his feet</i>
<i>firmly planted on the ground.</i>

38
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,100
El, you've spent enough time
with that display.

39
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,977
There's a million things going on
right now,

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,646
and I honestly don't know
how to get you to focus.

41
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,025
Come over here. The shelves need dusting,
and straighten up in the back.

42
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,737
And clean off the counter
with all your mess. Please.

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,363
- Wait.

44
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,448
Don't I have the day off?

45
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,074
I thought Stacy and Zelly
were working today.

46
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,578
Yeah, I'm fully booked. I've got
a future venture capitalist meeting.

47
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,205
- It's kind of a big deal. Yeah.
- Impressive.

48
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,832
- See?

49
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,167
But I-- I kinda had a thing--

50
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,585
Yeah, I'm busy too.

51
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,464
Whoops.

52
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,008
- Sorry. I have judo practice.
- And clean that up too, El.

53
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,803
Look, I have a very important
dinner meeting with a customer.

54
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,890
I wanna bring them here after,
so this place has to be spotless by 7:00.

55
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,600
- Okay--
- Listen. You hear what I said?

56
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,186
- I--
- By 7:00. No more distractions.

57
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,646
- But can I--

58
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,984
Really? Sami's waiting for me.
I told you I had the sneaker drop today.

59
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,111
And we told you we had real lives.

60
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,279
- Sorry.
- Sorry, dude.

61
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,530
- Wow.
- Next time.

62
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,242
- Hey, Sami. I--
- <i>Yo, dude, where are you?</i>

63
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,369
-<i>You're gonna mi--</i>
- Bye, Sami.

64
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,870
- No distractions.
- Can I just--

65
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,914
- Let's go, boys.

66
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,083
- See ya.
-"No distractions."

67
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,501
- Later.
- Bye.

68
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,626
Hey! Hey, Sami, sorry. Sorry I'm late.

69
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,379
Dude, where have you been?
I thought you had the day off work.

70
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,006
Yeah, so did I. So did I.

71
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,883
Oh, step Vader strikes again.
I swear, that guy--

72
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,468
- Come on. We're gonna be late.

73
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,637
- We're already late.
- Oh, watch out! Watch out!

74
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,472
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Sorry, Gustavo.

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,225
Sorry, G.

76
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,852
- Hey, you need help with this?
- Yeah, <i>gracias</i>.

77
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,228
Dude, we gotta go.

78
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,647
Come on. We're already late.
Like you said.

79
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,401
Gustavo, I know you're strong,
but this is not a one-man job. Okay?

80
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,445
- That's why you're here.

81
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,955
Wow.

82
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,791
Over by the tomato patch, <i>por favor</i>.

83
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,419
You know, this is a lot of dirt
for one guy's tomatoes.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,713
Well, it's my job
to tend to anything around here

85
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,966
that needs a little extra love
and assistance.

86
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,468
Big or small.

87
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,014
Ah, Gustavo! Come on.
See you rocking them Tailwinds. Crispy.

88
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,726
What can I say, eh?

89
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,144
They suit me, don't you think?

90
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,645
All right, you feeling yourself.

91
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,732
Your mother always knew
exactly what I needed.

92
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,193
A great talent.
She always picked the perfect pair.

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,111
Yeah. She did.

94
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,073
Eh? Why don't you come visit sometime?

95
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,201
Help me keep her flowers blooming?

96
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,037
- Yeah, uh…
- Come on. Come on.

97
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,164
Come on. Wrap it up.

98
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,750
Like Rosie,
we are always here for you. You know that.

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,752
Uh, G, we are super late.

100
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,837
- Yeah. So sorry.
- Like, so--

101
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,465
It was kind of you
to interrupt your plans to help me, El.

102
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,884
- Of course.
- You're your mother's son, I see.

103
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,886
- Yes, sir.

104
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,638
El, the subway! It's coming!

105
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,099
Come on, come on.
We're gonna miss the express.

106
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,225
Come on, come on.

107
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,977
Come on. Change, change, change.

108
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,654
-<i>Walk.</i>
- Let's go.

109
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
<i>Walk. Walk.</i>

110
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,074
Run!

111
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
Come on.

112
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,369
Somebody hold the door.

113
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
Wait, wait, wait!

114
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,872
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

115
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,584
We made it.

116
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,963
I can't believe we stopped
for Gustavo. We almost missed it.

117
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,297
But we didn't.

118
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,801
Yo!

119
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,848
- Dude, I hope we get there in time.
- Me too.

120
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,561
Adidas and King's collab,
the rerelease of the 1984 Adidas Forum.

121
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,814
Darius King's rookie sneaker
is about to be ours.

122
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
You see the updated gray colorway, right?
Space gray?

123
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,527
- The shape, the material…
- Oh, my gosh. It's butter!

124
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,613
So butter. It's butter.
This drop is about to be epic.

125
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,782
Butter, butter, butter!
There's no better word.

126
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,661
These shoes will change our lives.
I brought my half. You get yours?

127
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,205
Mm-hmm.
Sold my Air Max 97s to my girlfriend.

128
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,707
"Girlfriend." Which one? Hmm?

129
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,043
You got, like, ten of them.

130
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,880
Listen, you gotta kiss a lot of lady frogs
before you find a princess, okay?

131
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,882
- Well, until then, you're stuck with me.
- Mmm.

132
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,091
Least your kicks are.

133
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,179
I don't care if I have to wear 20 pairs
of socks to share these shoes with you,

134
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,723
as long as I can retire these bad boys,
I'll be happy.

135
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,558
- Let me at them.
- You can't clean them.

136
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,643
- I already tried. Stupid fingerprint.
- Let me at them.

137
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,772
Come on. Welcome to the factory.

138
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,873
Oh, no.

139
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,668
Don't kill me.

140
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,003
El, you're scaring me.

141
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,630
Good.

142
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,986
What did you just do to my sneaker?

143
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,781
Oh, I-- I was trying to--

144
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,075
Dude, I love it. Do the other.

145
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,910
Okay, um…

146
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,372
Okay.

147
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,968
- Hold very still.
- Okay.

148
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,095
And boom!

149
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,270
- Stop!

150
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,148
This is the hottest crime scene
I have ever worn.

151
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
Yeah, they'll do.

152
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,257
- Sami.

153
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,301
What are you doing?

154
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,553
You are just very talented.

155
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,311
We could still use this money on materials
for you to make us your own pair instead.

156
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,106
What-- Don't-- Remember the first pair
you made in the sixth grade?

157
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,109
- I swear your mom was ready to call Nike.
- Sami, I don't do that anymore.

158
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,778
But you could.

159
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,739
Look, you flipped your kicks
for a pair of real sneakers. All right?

160
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,657
From a legit designer,
not your best friend.

161
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,493
You are a legit designer.

162
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,370
What makes someone legit anyway?

163
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,456
Sami, when's the last time you actually
saw me make a pair of sneakers?

164
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,625
I just scribble in my notebook. That's it.

165
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,836
Mmm. That's funny. I think I hear
your stepfather talking, not you.

166
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,838
Is he wrong? Is he wrong? Hmm?

167
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,801
I'm a stock boy. That's it. All right?
And not a very good one at that.

168
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,885
Meh.

169
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,886
Ooh.

170
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,431
Come on, come on, come on. Thank you.

171
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,434
So, how did you convince the overlord
to let you go today?

172
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,103
I might have locked up
without telling him.

173
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,187
Bold.

174
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,314
If we get back in time,
he won't know the difference.

175
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,071
Okay,
I think he's gonna know the difference.

176
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,281
"Made to soar."

177
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,034
Can we?

178
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,412
Let's go get it.

179
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,831
Oh…

180
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh… I wanna lick 'em.

181
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,544
All hail the King.

182
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,463
Okay, but, look, if you are gonna be
in a hurry to get back,

183
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,549
I'm wearing them first,
'cause what you're not gonna do,

184
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,468
is scuff our brand-new kicks
on the very first day, okay?

185
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,220
- Sneaker prenup rule number--
- Oh, my gosh.

186
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,973
Whoa, hold up.

187
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,017
Where did you get those King6 shoes?

188
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,768
They almost look like Sleeks.

189
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,478
- Are those player exclusive?
- Oh, uh…

190
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,771
Yo, cutters!

191
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,189
Line's back here.

192
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,316
- Yeah, man.
- Get back in the line.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,527
- No.
- Hey, cutters!

194
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,320
Yo, I'm never making it back to work.

195
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,323
- There's like a thousand people.
- I can see that.

196
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,908
- Next group, come on up.
- Let's go.

197
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,452
- Keep moving.
- No, dude, we can't-- I--

198
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,162
- Yo! The line's back there.
- Okay.

199
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,914
Do I need to pull up
and personally make it clear to you?

200
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,876
- It's okay. We're--
- Oh, hey. Coz.

201
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,128
I'm so glad you found me.
I've been waiting for you.

202
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,713
- Y'all cappin'.
- Nobody's cappin'.

203
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,006
- This is our cousin.
- Yeah.

204
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,216
Nah, th-these are my cousins and see,

205
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,635
- I've been saving our spot in line.
- Yeah.

206
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,054
- We're family.
- So, thank you.

207
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,431
- Thank you. Bye. Have a good day.
- Thanks.

208
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,100
Whatever. You know they not.

209
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,311
Can we call security? This is messed up.

210
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,272
Hey. That was really sweet. Um…

211
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,690
Um, I'm Kira.

212
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,859
El.

213
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,864
Hi. I'm Sami. I'm not a part of this, so…

214
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,616
That's my friend, Sami.

215
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,785
- Hi, Sami.
- I just said that thing. Hi.

216
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,453
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, I appreciate the save.

217
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,207
Yeah, of course.
I mean, guy's a total hypebeast, right?

218
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,376
He deserves to be cut in line anyway.

219
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,544
- I think he's just amped up.
- Nah, what do you mean?

220
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,046
I mean, you saw his Zebras, right?

221
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,548
Yeah.

222
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,343
You see how the knit upper
gets darker just as it meets the boots?

223
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,930
It's wet. He probably
scrubbed those shoes down this morning.

224
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
- He prepped hard-core for this drop.

225
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,018
- Wow. I can't believe you noticed that.
- Well--

226
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,354
El believes that sneakers
are a window to the soul.

227
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,522
Kinda like a mood ring.

228
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,815
To the soul?

229
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,441
- Show her.
- No.

230
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,485
- It's this trick he does. Really cool.
- It's not a trick.

231
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,195
It's this thing that his mom taught him--

232
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,655
- Stop.
- What did your mom teach you?

233
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,864
He's a sneaker psychic.

234
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,617
- Okay, El, I have to see this now.
- I'm sorry. It's really nothing.

235
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,328
Hmm. Come on. Show me what you got.

236
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,497
Okay. Okay. All right.

237
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,416
Um…

238
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,792
Check out that dude. See him?

239
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
- Yeah.
- Okay, um…

240
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,257
Sporting a classic.
Thinks "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

241
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,802
Can't go wrong with the GOAT.
Stable, reliable, good taste,

242
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,847
gives you Christmas gifts
that are actually on your wish lists.

243
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,348
Puts some cash in your birthday card.

244
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,018
Hmm. Not much of a psychic.

245
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,186
You could say that about anybody
and how would we know?

246
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,479
Kick it up a notch.

247
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,899
All right, check her out.

248
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,984
Hot pink kicks.

249
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,571
She got the colorful base, but she had
to go and heat it up with the laces.

250
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,240
She's fearless.
She laughs in the face of fear.

251
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,284
No way she walks around that busted grate.

252
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,618
Are you joking?

253
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,497
I don't know.
No New Yorker steps on those grates.

254
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,001
Yeah, my money's on the sidewalk.

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,172
- Voilà!
- Oh!

256
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,342
You are amazing! You're amazing!

257
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,136
You are a sneaker psychic.

258
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,305
- Sami, you weren't lying.
- I know.

259
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,890
No, I'm just--
You gotta pay attention.

260
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,184
People are telling you
a story about who they are.

261
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,561
That's what a perfect pair of sneakers is.

262
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,896
At least what it can be.

263
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,149
You know, you just gotta give somebody
a chance to be real, right?

264
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,236
- But, by your logic…
- Uh-huh.

265
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,823
…why would all these people then line up
to wear the same shoe?

266
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,033
Mmm.

267
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:55,580
I-- I guess if you put enough
of yourself into a design, it's gonna hit.

268
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,667
But at the end of the day, once
I slip on that sneaker, it's my story.

269
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,503
All right. Sorry, everyone.

270
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,922
We're officially sold out of
the Forum sneakers for this drop.

271
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,757
- Thanks for coming.

272
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,093
- Do you see that guy?
- Did you really need four pairs?

273
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,679
- Are you-- Is that necessary?
- You have two feet, man.

274
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,930
Can I get one?

275
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,431
This is the worst day of my life.

276
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:18,061
I don't know. This is the most fun I've
had talking about kicks in, well, ever.

277
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,064
Yeah, I mean,
this is, like, the most fun I've ever--

278
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,942
We-- W-We're so in sync right now.
I mean, it's very-- very fun. I--

279
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,026
- Stop.
- Huh?

280
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,570
I think what he's trying to say is
it's really nice to meet you.

281
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,988
- Yeah.
- Hey, hold up.

282
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,574
I thought you said she was your cousin.

283
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,578
Yeah, we are cousins. We're family.
It's like a family reunion. Because--

284
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,455
- You have friends. Okay…
- So what's up?

285
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,583
I have an idea. Hey, how about--
How about we, uh…

286
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,127
- Run!

287
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,254
Run! Hey! Sorry, excuse me.

288
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,547
Come on. Let's go!

289
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,134
- Sorry, get out of the way! Move!
- You ain't gonna get away!

290
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,845
- Whoa. Go! Go, go, go!
- There they are!

291
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,806
- Out of the way! Let's get 'em!
- Yo, what?

292
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,808
Save yourselves. I got wheels.

293
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,018
- Bye, Sami!
- We gotta go.

294
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,436
I see them!

295
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,146
Yo, get 'em.

296
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,522
- They're still behind us.
- Wait.

297
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,399
Up for an adventure? Come on.

298
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,609
- They're getting away!
- Run!

299
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,737
Yeah.

300
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,697
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

301
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,532
Get 'em! Yo, what the-- Yo, come on.

302
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,160
- Adios!
- You should be running!

303
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,959
Whoa, wait. Where are we even going?

304
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,670
- We're going to Queens. Come on.
- Queens?

305
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,590
You know, when you said "adventure,"

306
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,469
I thought you were gonna show me
something, I don't know, new?

307
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,221
Oh, so you've seen everything, huh?

308
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,973
Maybe.

309
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,684
What?

310
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,146
You got more tricks up your sleeve,
sneaker psychic?

311
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,442
Oh, tricks? No. No way. Just home.

312
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,916
- Hey!

313
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,001
You see?

314
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,089
- What time is it?
- Showtime!

315
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,175
- Yo!

316
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,098
Yo!

317
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,445
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

318
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,114
Whoa!

319
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,826
- It's your turn. Come on.
- Yeah!

320
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,287
- Come on. Let me see. Let me see.
- Okay.

321
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,969
There ain't nothing better.

322
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,306
- Wow. This really is the best ever.
- Yes!

323
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,101
And I gotta say
that galakto stuff was really good.

324
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,755
- Oh, my gosh. El--

325
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,381
Hurry!

326
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,300
Oh, my gosh.

327
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,095
It's great. It's a shower!
Where are you going? Whoo!

328
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,180
El!

329
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,141
It feels great! It feels great!

330
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,518
- Come on! Come on! It feels great!
- El!

331
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,312
El, I can't get my hair wet.

332
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,646
Your hair looks great!

333
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,731
Let's go.

334
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,238
Was that new enough for you?

335
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,033
All right, anything else I need to see?

336
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,118
Mmm, how about…

337
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,662
that?

338
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,791
Hey, I recognize it.
I can see that from our apartment.

339
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,001
You're a city girl, huh?

340
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,713
Okay.
Well, I bet we can get you a closer look.

341
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,549
Follow me, Manhattan.

342
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,218
Okay.

343
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:25,762
Be careful, okay?

344
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,846
Okay.

345
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,141
The legendary Astoria graffiti wall.

346
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,436
It's always evolving and changing.
You know, it's kinda like this city.

347
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,065
Everyone gets a chance to express
themselves, and now it's your turn.

348
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,108
Thank you.

349
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,527
I don't know what to do.

350
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,364
Spray whatever you're feeling right now.
Anything.

351
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,759
Let's see what you've got, Manhattan.
Oh, word. That's how you feel?

352
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:12,851
Hmm.

353
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,230
That's, uh…

354
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,692
- I'm confused.

355
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,695
- Turn around.
- Hmm?

356
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,614
- Made a frame.
- Ah.

357
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,283
If the wall is always changing,

358
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,119
I wanna make sure I can always
remember what it looks like right now.

359
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:33,872
Cheese.

360
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,386
You know, my dad grew up in Queens.

361
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,889
- Really?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,266
I mean, he talks about his roots a lot,

363
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,353
but I can't even remember
the last time he set foot around here.

364
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,525
Well, if he needs a refresh,
apparently I'm also a tour guide, so…

365
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,737
I'd give you four stars.

366
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,533
What? Come on. Look at this? Come on!
How is this not five-star material?

367
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:14,954
Maybe add in some more sneaker readings,
and I'll consider bumping you up.

368
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,626
Okay. It's never enough, never enough
for Manhattan. I get it. I get it.

369
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,089
Well, Sami said that your mom
taught you all that. Is it true?

370
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,135
Yeah. She, uh-- She did.

371
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,764
Before she, uh, passed.

372
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,601
It's kinda why kicks mean so much to me.

373
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,688
It's, like, the only part of her
I have left.

374
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,107
I didn't realize.

375
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,942
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

376
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,236
You know…

377
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,197
I miss her.

378
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,117
But every day she's with me.

379
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,994
Every time I slip on my kicks.

380
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,125
That's a pretty cool legacy.

381
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,712
I mean, my family is
full of sneaker junkies,

382
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,589
but I don't think any of them
see kicks the way you do.

383
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,552
In fact, will you help me with something?

384
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,096
For you, Manhattan, anything.

385
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,809
Okay. What do these say about me?

386
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:20,937
Uh…

387
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,315
And don't go soft on me now, okay?
I can take it.

388
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,610
They-- They don't really say anything.

389
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,531
I mean, they're not bad. They're--
They're just a little…

390
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,867
- basic.
- Hmm.

391
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:39,122
You know, just a little more basic
than I would assume from King. I'm sorry.

392
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,042
So you're saying I'm basic?

393
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,837
No. No. No, I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean, you know, the shoe--

394
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,465
Y-You deserve a-- a one of one.

395
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,550
Uh…

396
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,095
- What?
- Nah, you're right.

397
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,848
You should've seen your face.
It was so funny.

398
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,060
You're right. They are basic.

399
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,938
And I was worried about that
because I am not basic.

400
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,400
So, if you were worried
they weren't fresh, why'd you cop them?

401
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,569
Is that, like, a Manhattan thing?
Y'all do that up there?

402
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,862
It's a life thing.

403
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,158
Because sometimes you gotta try
something out and hope it surprises you.

404
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,997
Today, I tried out these kicks,
and they didn't.

405
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,083
- No. At all.
- No. No, not this time.

406
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,713
But today, I also tried
going on an adventure with you.

407
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,383
And…

408
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,134
Are you surprised?

409
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,429
Yeah. And then some.

410
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,107
Oh, sorry. It's my sister.
I was supposed to be home by now.

411
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,360
Is that the time?
No. No, no, no, no. Shoot!

412
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,778
- Wait, what?
- I'm deep-fried.

413
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,364
- No, but I-- Okay.
- Here, take my hand.

414
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,949
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

415
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,325
I gotta go.

416
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,661
- So, this was--
- Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

417
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,538
Do you wanna follow me,
and I can follow you back?

418
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,622
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

419
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,082
About the Sleeks and how I got them.

420
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,585
- I should really just tell you.
- Hey, I'm sorry. I gotta catch this.

421
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,130
Hey, wait up. Okay, but I never got your--
El, wait!

422
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,382
- I'm sorry!

423
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,636
- Hey, Liv, yeah.
- <i>Well, where are you?</i>

424
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,973
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just--
I lost track of time. Thank you.

425
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,520
Roger's here.

426
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,565
Your chariot, Miss King.

427
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,734
Really, Roger? Tracking my phone?

428
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,528
You didn't leave me much choice,
the way you ran off this afternoon.

429
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,990
- Hmm?
- My bad.

430
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,326
- All right. Okay. Bye, Liv.
- <i>Kira? Kira.</i>

431
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,047
Sorry. Excuse me.

432
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,388
- Where have you been?

433
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,642
Hey. Uh, look, I'm sorry, okay?
I-- I lost track of time.

434
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,768
You lost track of time?

435
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,104
There should be no time
for you to lose track of.

436
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,315
You were supposed to be here. Working.

437
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,735
I know. I had a-- I had a thing.

438
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,571
I told you I was bringing
someone important here tonight. Right?

439
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,823
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yes.

440
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,157
And what did we find?

441
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,492
What?

442
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,829
Huh? A dark store, locked door.

443
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,207
Totally unimpressive.

444
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,042
- And totally embarrassing.
- I--

445
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,003
This is the real world, El!

446
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:17,382
Not some doodle or some nonsense
you're dreaming about. Okay?

447
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,676
The real world.
You've got to get yourself right.

448
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,346
El, I honestly don't get it.

449
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,182
You weren't disappearing and acting up
when your mother was here.

450
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,559
She didn't use me as a stock boy.

451
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,479
Okay? And you never even yell at them
when they stick me with their shifts.

452
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,564
Don't even.

453
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,774
No, you switched the schedule
without even asking me.

454
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,026
He does it all the time.

455
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,154
Zelly, am I the one that locked up
and left without telling anyone?

456
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,073
No, Stacy, remember that was El?

457
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,411
No, how about you tell your dad about
how you were supposed to be working--

458
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,079
Hey, listen. That's enough.

459
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,041
El, you're gonna take
all the shifts next week.

460
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,584
- Hey, hey! Hey-- Hey!
- That's not fair!

461
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,044
- Hey! And get this place clean.
- Sorry.

462
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,796
I have more important people
coming tomorrow.

463
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,299
And until further notice, you're grounded.

464
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,384
- I didn't--
- End of story.

465
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,680
Boys, let's go. El's closing up tonight.

466
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,599
I hope this sinks in.

467
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,684
Yikes.

468
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,935
We'll be right up, Dad.

469
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,357
- Dude.

470
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,443
Did we or did we not agree
to just stay out of each other's way

471
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,862
to make this
miserable arrangement tolerable?

472
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,448
That doesn't mean that you can just shove
your shifts on me.

473
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,284
- Oh, "shove"?
- Why are you always complaining?

474
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,495
We're the ones who had to leave
everything behind in Jersey

475
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,579
to come out to this dump.

476
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,789
This place is not a dump.

477
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,334
Are you sure about that, El?
It's not a dump?

478
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,673
We just couldn't figure out
your system in the back.

479
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:43,843
So, it might need some organizing.

480
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,515
Oops.

481
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,853
He "had a thing."

482
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,357
- Later.
- Have fun.

483
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,403
You got this.

484
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,991
Thanks.

485
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:24,963
Mom?

486
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,270
Mmm.

487
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,773
<i>Hello, Miss King.</i>
<i>You have reached the penthouse.</i>

488
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,900
Mom, the gala committee is getting
completely bombarded

489
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,902
- with ticket requests.
- The guest list's been closed

490
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,236
- for weeks.
- Mom! I'm home.

491
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,947
- We're in here, honey.
- Finally.

492
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,283
I had the most incredible day.

493
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,370
Oh, apparently. So incredible that
you completely missed dinner.

494
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,080
And all the gala prep. Hmm.

495
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,083
Yeah, I know, but I was at Dad's drop

496
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,460
and while I was in line,
I actually met this really handsome--

497
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,253
Whoa, whoa. Honey. You were in line?

498
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,631
You could've just called the office
to get yourself a pair.

499
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,841
- No.
- You were researching the Sleeks, right?

500
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,511
I asked Kira to test out the prototype
for the hybrid.

501
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,720
So you wore them out today?

502
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:56,971
So, what's the word, honey?

503
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,056
- Um--
- I'm telling you,

504
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,891
low-tops are really trending right now.

505
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,518
The Sleeks are perfect.

506
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,853
You get me some solid numbers,
and I'll consider it.

507
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,647
Dad, Sneakercon is
only a couple months away

508
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,441
and we need to dominate if we wanna
get our numbers up from last year.

509
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,860
It's not like the numbers
last year were terrible.

510
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,195
No, but it wasn't great.

511
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,738
They were down from the year before,

512
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,365
which was a little down
from the year before that,

513
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,533
so we just need something big.

514
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,244
And that's why I'm telling you,
the Sleeks are what King6 needs.

515
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,453
- Dad?
- Darius?

516
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,247
I know there's a lot
of pressure right now.

517
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,042
This designer is a big deal for us.
He's a proven hit-maker.

518
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:29,045
I do like that he's launched
these big campaigns. I'll say that.

519
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,131
He's had three
of the biggest launches last year.

520
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,298
You gotta trust me, Dad.

521
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,508
Something on your mind, Kira?

522
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,845
Yeah.

523
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,182
I just don't think that the Sleeks
are gonna put us back on top.

524
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,560
Oh? And why not?

525
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,022
They just-- They don't say anything.

526
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,857
I mean, there's no story behind them.

527
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,153
They're-- They're not bad,
but they're just a little basic.

528
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,363
Oh, you did not just call me basic.

529
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,532
I just-- I think that we could do better.

530
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:01,036
Dad, I mean, we're not exactly tapped
into the street up here.

531
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,412
We need a new voice.

532
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,956
It feels like we need
to find someone fresh.

533
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,793
Okay, I have a pile of research
that says differently.

534
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:09,878
It's just my opinion.

535
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,839
And shouldn't
my opinion count for something?

536
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,841
It does.

537
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,511
Your mother's right.
Problem is, I learned a long time ago,

538
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,973
you cannot run a business
on your opinions alone.

539
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,642
Talent, passion. It's only part of it.

540
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,063
You see, my team has experience,
and they do all this research

541
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,941
and if all that says the Sleek is what
we need right now to put us back on top,

542
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,193
that's what we doing.

543
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,904
- Dad, come on. Just give me a shot.
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,198
You gave Liv a chance when she asked.

545
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:42,160
I'm really happy that you wanna be
more involved in the family business,

546
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:45,038
but a lot of jobs rely on these decisions.

547
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,041
So, you gotta come at me
with something other than,

548
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,045
"They're basic. I'm right."

549
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,713
- You know what I'm saying?
- You know what?

550
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,257
Babe, it can't hurt to keep looking.

551
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,051
Darius, we have a little time.

552
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,103
All right. I don't think
you're gonna find this person,

553
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,270
but I'll let you try.

554
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,272
- Wait, wait. What?
- So, this is the deal.

555
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,066
- Kira…
- Mm-hmm?

556
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,361
…if you find a designer
that we should consider,

557
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:22,659
someone that speaks to you, tells a story
and has the experience to back it up,

558
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,285
we'll try it out.

559
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,287
- Really?

560
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,331
Dad, this means so much to me.

561
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,501
- You did hear me say "and," right?
- Yeah. Yeah, Dad, I did.

562
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,669
All right. Good.

563
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,755
Now, the gala's in two weeks,

564
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,968
and if we haven't found a designer
that changes the game for us by then,

565
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,053
we'll go with your sister's Sleeks.

566
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,349
- Okay. What's next?
- Well, we have the gala charity auction.

567
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,601
- Oh, that's all your mom.

568
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,103
- I got a call coming.
- No.

569
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,312
Yeah, I gotta take this.

570
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,522
- Oh. Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

571
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:53,565
Thanks.

572
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:54,983
You got it, kid.

573
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,947
Hey, call the Sneakercon team
and tell them to wait.

574
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:02,657
We're gonna keep looking.

575
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,207
- No.
- Yep.

576
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,292
No way. No.

577
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,376
- Mm-hmm.
- She's--

578
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:17,756
- No, but-- but i-it can't be. It can't be.
- Dude, I didn't-- Oh, my Go--

579
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,508
- Look at your face! What is going on?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

580
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,177
Sami. No creases.

581
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,887
- You touch it, you buy it.
- Sorry.

582
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,555
God.

583
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,639
- Ooh.
- Sorry.

584
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,477
We were hanging out with Kira King.
Kira King.

585
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,271
Darius King's daughter,
aka, sneaker royalty.

586
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,898
How'd I not know?

587
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,068
I've had the King's poster on my wall
since I was seven. It's the King.

588
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,653
That's crazy.
Like, she's like a princess, yeah?

589
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,199
Oh, no, Sami.

590
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,242
- I messed up.
- Don't even worry about it.

591
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,745
Like, you would know
who Kira King is by sight. Come on.

592
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,330
- Cute.
- Thanks.

593
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,628
Sami, listen. Okay, I dissed
her kicks. Her King6 kicks, all right?

594
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:57,754
I dissed her father.

595
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,090
Okay, yeah, but what were you gonna do?
Lie to the girl?

596
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:02,926
- You've gotta call it like you see it.
- Why are you not freaking out like I am?

597
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,220
El, you're missing the big picture here,
okay?

598
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:08,056
Now that we know who she really is…

599
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,935
And boom!

600
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,481
- Eh?
- The King's charity gala?

601
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,109
Yeah. Now you know how to find her again.
You're welcome.

602
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,485
Okay, okay.

603
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,737
At the most exclusive sneaker event
of the year?

604
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,323
Great idea. It's not gonna happen.

605
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:28,326
What? Dude, how is this not, like,
the definition of fate?

606
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,996
- Oh, come on. You like her. She likes you.
- Hey, you don't know that, okay?

607
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,583
Yeah, okay, I was sweating
from the heat between you two yesterday.

608
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,884
Stop, all right?
You said you saw, like-- like, heat?

609
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,469
Just a little bit.

610
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,763
Dude, just take a shot.

611
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,475
It's never gonna happen. Not gonna happen.

612
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,560
Why?

613
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,813
It's not. I-I-It's just not.
It can't, all right?

614
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,024
It's not scientifically possible,
because I am just--

615
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,567
If you say "stock boy"…

616
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,776
I was gonna say "nobody."

617
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,111
Oh, that's nice.

618
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,655
I'm a nobody, and look at her.

619
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,366
She's a total somebody.

620
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,828
Okay, so you wanna show her
you're a somebody, show off your talent.

621
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,748
- Design some sick kicks for the gala.
- Sami, it's in two weeks.

622
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,833
- There's not enough time for that.
- Best get to work then.

623
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,251
It's not gonna happen.

624
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,795
Look, you can't show up
in your beaters, okay?

625
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,548
And I know you wouldn't
wanna do that anyway. Look at them.

626
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:27,594
This is your shot
to show Miss Kira King who you really are.

627
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,179
Come on.

628
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,513
- Plea--
- El?

629
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,100
Not who he says you are.

630
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,019
El, I need you out here.

631
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,145
Coming.

632
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,857
- You're crazy.
- Think about it.

633
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,192
It's never gonna happen.

634
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,152
Hey, never say never.

635
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:47,447
You should really consider
the craftsmanship and the material.

636
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,282
It's Italian leather.

637
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,575
- It's very nice.
- Mmm.

638
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,245
But I think it's a little outside
my price range.

639
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,373
You're on your feet all day
at the restaurant.

640
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,416
Don't your feet deserve a treat, hmm?

641
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,878
- El! There you are.
- Mrs. Singh!

642
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:03,797
Oh.

643
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,881
Mmm, how you doing?

644
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,008
You know,
I've been meaning to drop these off.

645
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,928
- Okay, what you got for me?
- I wanna make sure you had these

646
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,222
just in case
your allergies acted up this fall.

647
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,556
- Thank you.
- Your mom always swore

648
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,766
- by my home remedies.
- That she did.

649
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,185
- So give them a try, <i>beta</i>, okay?
- Will do.

650
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,188
- Love the window by the way.
- Look, I'll show you.

651
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,023
Aw. You're so sweet.

652
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,526
Aleko let me rescue the clock hands
from the trash so…

653
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,195
Aren't you clever? Rosie would love it.

654
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,698
- You think?
- Think about what I said Mrs. Singh.

655
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,409
I'd be happy to throw in
a free pair of Odor-Eaters.

656
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,786
Did he just tell me my feet stink?

657
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,037
Quite possibly.

658
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,623
Bye, Mrs. Singh.

659
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:39,708
Bye!

660
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,002
I don't get this neighborhood.

661
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,004
They all pretend to be one big,
happy family.

662
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,131
But when it comes down to it,
where are they?

663
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,466
- I mean, they don't know you.
- And that's my fault?

664
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,177
Look, I've brought in all kinds
of styles and new items

665
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,096
so everyone will have something
to pick from.

666
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,806
I'm really trying.

667
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:56,683
And obviously you don't know them either.

668
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:58,560
Yeah, well,

669
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,438
looks like the shop's going back
to the sneaker business anyway.

670
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,482
What?
Hey, maybe I could curate something--

671
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:07,110
I've spoken to Foot Locker
about buying this space.

672
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:11,698
What are you--

673
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:18,538
- You're selling the store?
- If I can get one of these execs to bite.

674
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,041
We're already a month behind
in the mortgage and--

675
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,751
- The way things are looking, I--
- You-- No.

676
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,504
We can do a GoFundMe. All right?
A-- A fundraiser--

677
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,173
No, no, no, El!

678
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,924
You always got your head in the clouds.

679
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,676
Not everything works out
the way you want it to.

680
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,094
You think I don't know that?

681
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:35,889
Huh?

682
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,064
Mom wouldn't want you to sell.

683
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,319
- And if you ever loved her--
- Hey, hey! I did love her!

684
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,741
You think this is something
I wanted to do alone?

685
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,244
Why do you think I've been so hard on you?
Trying to keep this store afloat.

686
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:00,830
Enough is enough.

687
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,334
Sometimes you just gotta
let your dreams go.

688
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:26,022
Hello, I did it.
I got it all figured out.

689
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,774
Logan's brother's best friend, Jeremy,

690
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:29,776
and his cousin are working in catering
at the gala.

691
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:32,904
So as long as we get there
before the event starts

692
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,781
he'll sneak us into the service entrance.

693
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,243
Cool.

694
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:41,204
You think it's too uncool to go
as waiters? I was totally thinking that.

695
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,997
But it's fine.
We can costume change there.

696
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,793
- He's selling Laces.
- What?

697
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,131
Trey's selling Laces.

698
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,969
He can't-- He can't do that, can he?

699
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:57,971
He just did.

700
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:05,854
The thing that my mom loves most is gone.

701
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,355
- Hey.

702
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:10,608
- It's gone.
- El, that is not true.

703
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,112
You're still here.

704
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,159
And as long as you carry on her legacy,
she's not fully gone either.

705
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,660
Sami, Sami! I--

706
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:23,621
I don't know how to do that.

707
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:27,876
Okay? This--

708
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,422
This place is everything to her.

709
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,591
- It's--
- This place is…

710
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,097
- It's just a place, El.
-"Just a place"?

711
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:43,850
- Come on. I didn't mean--
- Just--

712
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:47,729
I didn't mean it like that.
Listen, I love this place.

713
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:52,067
I think I know about ten ways
to lace up my kicks because of this place.

714
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,820
Because of your mom.
Your super cool, funky mom.

715
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,156
I miss her.

716
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,575
Me too.

717
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,079
A lot.

718
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:10,585
And I think we both know
what she'd want you to do.

719
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,007
Get up.

720
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,220
Come on. You've got sneakers to make.

721
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:34,169
See the person, then you'll see the shoe.

722
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:56,941
Whoo!

723
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,201
Whoo!

724
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,341
Oh.

725
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:29,010
- This is whole grain, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

726
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:31,179
Yeah, whole grain.

727
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:33,348
- So, uh, where's your dad?
- He's out.

728
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:35,892
He has some thing tonight
with the Foot Locker rep. Why?

729
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:38,853
N-No reason. I--

730
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:42,941
I was just thinking I would finish up
inventory for the week.

731
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,609
You know, make up for the other day.

732
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,112
Hey, don't even worry about the dishes,
okay? I'll get them later.

733
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:50,365
Um, have fun, you know,
at that thing that you have tonight.

734
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,242
It's judo. Everyone forgets.
It's all good.

735
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:53,618
See ya.

736
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:56,830
Does that seem odd to you?

737
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:00,792
Yeah.

738
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,516
Inventory's the other way, El.

739
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:18,852
Yeah, yeah.

740
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:23,523
Yeah, I was just checking the door
to make sure it's locked. It is.

741
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:27,360
You guys ate fast. Well, I'm just gonna go
back there and get to work, you know?

742
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:28,570
I think he's lying.

743
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,530
I don't think he's telling the truth,
Stacy.

744
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:32,490
No, Zelly. He's not.

745
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:35,785
- Hey, that's my phone. I need my phone!
- Oh! Back it up.

746
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,496
Pretty weird fit for stocking shelves.

747
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,416
And just because Dad's out
doesn't mean you're not still grounded.

748
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:44,127
Look, guys, please.
I have someone very important to meet.

749
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,629
He puts in hair extensions,
and he thinks he's all that, huh?

750
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,590
It's not hair extensions.
It's a sponge brush, okay?

751
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,175
- Do you sponge?
- Guys, seriously. Please.

752
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,052
- It looks really nice.
- That's nice.

753
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:53,053
- No!
- Come on!

754
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,138
- Come on. Get in here. Come on!
- No!

755
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,307
- In you go.
- Come on.

756
00:50:57,932 --> 00:50:59,559
See ya!

757
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:02,187
- Guys, no. No!
- Later!

758
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:07,984
Please! Please! I'm running out of time!

759
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,946
- Later.
- Have fun.

760
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:14,824
Oh.

761
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,121
- Hey.
- Whoa! Unbelievable.

762
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:22,332
We're one step ahead of you here.

763
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:25,043
But we're this close
to Dad getting us out of here…

764
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:27,003
- Yeah.
-…and you're not going to ruin it for us.

765
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:28,296
- Guys--
- What do you wanna say?

766
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,923
All right, tonight is important.

767
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:31,841
- Oh, yeah.
- I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

768
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,260
Let me out! Guys!

769
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,513
You got that tight enough? Thank you.

770
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:38,682
- We're going.
- All right. Yeah, cool.

771
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:39,891
You wanna take shifts or like?

772
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:41,184
Guys!

773
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,395
I have somewhere to be!

774
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,857
Guys!

775
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,863
Think, think, think, think, think.

776
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:09,129
Please, please, please.

777
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:12,674
Just a little push to wake the beast.

778
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:26,730
Gustavo?

779
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,608
- What are you doing here?
- Hey--

780
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,610
I love you! I love you.
Wait, how did you even--

781
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:35,196
Don't you have somewhere to be?
Let's go! Come!

782
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,907
It seems like you were in need
of a little assistance.

783
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:39,534
I'm okay, but--

784
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:41,494
- Uh, dude! El, hello!
- Are you--

785
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:44,372
- Where have you been?
- I was-- I-- They-- It's a long story.

786
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:45,874
Oh. Hey, G.

787
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,585
What's he doing here?

788
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:49,753
Hey, a little faith, Sami.

789
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,671
Now, if we are going to make this happen,

790
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:53,590
you need
the most important ingredient of all.

791
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,718
- What?
- Mmm.

792
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:58,428
Huh? How--

793
00:52:58,511 --> 00:52:59,679
People talk.

794
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,015
The whole neighborhood's
talking about your sneakers.

795
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:04,934
Try them on. Try them on.
Let's see how they fit. Oh, yes.

796
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:06,728
Whoa!

797
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:08,188
Whoo! Hey!

798
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,689
Ah. Whoo!

799
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,983
Wow, those are some shoes, my friend.

800
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,611
- Hey!
- Nice.

801
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:16,863
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Hey!

802
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:18,740
So, we are ready for the big night then?

803
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,492
- Yeah, I got bad news, El.
- What?

804
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,619
Did we miss the hookup?

805
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:25,121
Yeah. I'm sorry, dude.

806
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:30,168
- I did all this work for nothing.
- It's not for nothing.

807
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,504
Maybe we could find another way in?

808
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,967
You put in the work, El.
Don't give up so easily.

809
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:08,540
- Whoa!
- Has this always been right here?

810
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:11,501
Well, vintage cars don't randomly appear.

811
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:03,970
Whoo!

812
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,138
El, you look incredible!

813
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,980
- Whoo! Come on!

814
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:19,319
- Yes, sir!

815
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,466
Oh! Woo-hoo!

816
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,301
Yeah!

817
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,064
- Hold up, what?
- We can't keep the threads?

818
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,163
- Oh.
- Oh,

819
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:55,623
I guess the right threads
do get you through the door.

820
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:02,213
Okay, El, let's look for a side entrance.

821
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,841
Maybe we can still find Jeremy
or his cousin to let us in.

822
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:07,177
Uh, tickets, please.

823
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:10,055
- Oh, yeah. Tickets.
- Yeah, tickets.

824
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,306
Yeah, everyone needs a ticket.

825
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:12,766
- Yeah, uh, we--
- Tickets.

826
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:15,477
Sami.

827
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,073
Yeah, enjoy your evening.

828
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,201
- Thank you.
- We shall.

829
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:54,683
This is a lot.

830
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,812
- Hello, good evening.
- Oh, word! They've got spoon appetizers!

831
00:57:58,895 --> 00:58:01,106
Sir, I'm-- Sami. I'm so sorry.

832
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:03,942
- She really likes that.
- That's good. That's really good.

833
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,610
Thanks. Mmm.

834
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:07,404
- That is not classy.

835
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,574
- I'm good. Thank you.
- More for me.

836
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:14,327
I think I'm gonna take a lap.
See if I can find Kira.

837
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:17,580
Hey, don't forget. You're a rock star.
Let me get your picture.

838
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,294
- Okay.
- Don't eat everything.

839
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,046
Get lost. Mmm.

840
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,259
E-E-Excuse me?

841
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,468
Mm-hmm? What?

842
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:31,970
Who is that?

843
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:37,100
- We need those sneakers.
- We've never seen anything like them.

844
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,060
That's 'cause they're one of ones.

845
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:40,895
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

846
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,940
I mean, you can try to convince him
to make you a pair,

847
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:46,443
but I've been waiting for years.

848
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,278
- He's the designer?
- Yep.

849
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:49,612
Well,

850
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,032
who's he with?

851
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,451
Um, he's with me.

852
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,370
No. She means who's he with? The company.

853
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,124
Um…

854
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,877
I'm not at liberty to say.

855
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,545
Did you sign an NDA?

856
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,214
Mmm. I can't even tell you that.

857
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,426
- Come on. She's messing with us.
- You sure about that?

858
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:20,894
- I am going to find out who he's with.
- Yeah?

859
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,229
- Good luck. I'm gonna beat you to it.
- All right.

860
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,276
- Have you seen--

861
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:32,572
My team is all over this.

862
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,865
Oh, my God.

863
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:36,034
Okay, so it's not King.
Is it King or is it not King?

864
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:39,037
I need to know.
Those shoes are out of this world.

865
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,753
Apparently three brands are chasing him,
and he hasn't committed yet.

866
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:49,964
I'm telling you.
He's got some top-secret collab brewing.

867
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,426
Oh, my God. Did you see
what I saw? I mean, it's amazing.

868
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,554
You know it's gonna
be all over the next issue of <i>Complex.</i>

869
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:58,264
Does anybody know his name?

870
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,934
- Do you know anything…

871
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:03,978
Have you seen this designer
that everyone's talking about?

872
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,731
Yeah, he does.

873
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:08,108
These are incredible.

874
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,819
He has designed for everyone.

875
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,448
- Oh, sorry.

876
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:18,785
Oh, my gosh.

877
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:51,670
Oh, sorry.

878
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,508
Uh…

879
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:05,266
It's you.

880
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,435
El, I was worried I'd never see you again.

881
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,689
Wait, why are you here?

882
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:13,191
Well, I was, um, hoping to see you.

883
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,236
- Uh…
- Wait.

884
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,530
This time I want to show you something.

885
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:20,949
Come on.

886
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,788
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.

887
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:28,540
It's all yours, Miss King.

888
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:30,041
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

889
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,212
Where you taking me?

890
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,591
Whoa.

891
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:40,218
Voilà.

892
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:43,054
Whoa. Whoa!

893
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,139
Yo!

894
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,183
Oh, my God. This is sneaker heaven. Oh!

895
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,021
- El!
- Oh, my God.

896
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,440
Oh, my God. You got the tie-dyes.

897
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:56,568
- Got the tie-dyes.
- Oh, my-- Jordans? Did Jordan sign this?

898
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:59,571
- Oh, God! This is amazing.
- Oh, my God.

899
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,490
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

900
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:07,203
Thank you.

901
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:13,376
Ooh, I got chills. This is my dream.

902
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,254
My mom would love this.

903
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:20,425
So, which ones are your favorite to wear?

904
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,802
Are you kidding?

905
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,513
I'm not allowed to touch them,
I mean, never mind wear them.

906
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:27,724
What? Not even once?

907
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:30,518
Whoa. No-- No way.

908
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,191
Yo. Yo. You haven't touched these?

909
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:39,736
Your dad's OG Blues from the finals
when he hit that buzzer-beater

910
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:41,613
against the Celtics? I don't believe it.

911
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:47,118
Okay, one time when I was a little kid
and I wore them out to the elevator,

912
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,829
but then I chickened out
and put them back.

913
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:54,793
You know, um,
I think these might not be your size.

914
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:57,420
You know, you didn't really inherit
the height of your father.

915
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,089
They were a little bit too big, huh?

916
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,425
Aight. Enough about my family. Tell me.

917
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,095
What kicks you rocking tonight?

918
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:06,179
Um…

919
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,351
You know, it's just a little…

920
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:13,353
Oh, my God.

921
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,440
Did you design these?

922
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,656
Wow. That colorway.
Wait, is that the graffiti wall?

923
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:25,740
Yeah.

924
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:30,370
Look at the soles.
El, I can see our whole day in them.

925
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,957
Wait a second.

926
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:38,753
- You're him! You're the guy.
- The guy?

927
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:39,921
Yeah, yeah, the guy.

928
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,591
- The guy with the secret celebrity collab.
- What?

929
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:46,302
The guy that everybody's
been talking about tonight.

930
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,179
My sister, Liv,
was going on and on about it.

931
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,348
Why didn't you tell me
the other day that you were a designer?

932
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,767
- And a phenomenal one at that.
- Manhattan.

933
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,396
You didn't tell me you were Kira King.
Huh?

934
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:59,941
Kira King. Like, that's something
that's kind of important to know.

935
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,317
Sneaker royalty?

936
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:02,819
- Royalty?
- Yeah.

937
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,864
Okay. That's fair.

938
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:10,994
I'm Kira King.

939
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,328
I know.

940
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,248
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

941
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:19,961
And listen, you have to come with me.
This is destiny.

942
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:23,214
'Cause tonight's literally my last chance
to prove to my dad that

943
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:26,718
there's a designer out there
who's actually saying something,

944
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,595
who's got a point of view.

945
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,388
And, El…

946
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:33,433
you're him.

947
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:34,601
W-Wait.

948
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:36,853
You're saying I should
design for the King brand?

949
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:37,771
Yeah.

950
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,230
- King brand?

951
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,523
- Like--
- Oh.

952
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,067
Oh, that's him.

953
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,110
- Who?
- Come on. My dad.

954
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,279
- Ladies and gentlemen…
- Come on. Now's our chance.

955
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:47,822
-…basketball legend…
- Right now?

956
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:52,077
…and your host for this evening's King6
Annual Charity Gala, Darius King.

957
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,455
My wife, Denise, and I
would like to thank you all for coming.

958
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,791
As a kid growing up
in the streets of Queens,

959
01:05:57,874 --> 01:05:59,209
I didn't always have the money

960
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,170
- to buy the freshest pair…
- Okay. Oh, God. I'm so excited.

961
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,422
Once he's done with his intro,
I'll grab him.

962
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:05,840
Who believed in my dream?

963
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:08,885
Yo, this is crazy. I mean, he's gonna
lose it when he sees your work.

964
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,136
Y-Y-You think so?

965
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,304
…to the next level.

966
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,681
And King6 was born.

967
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:15,975
Under the direction
of my eldest daughter, Liv,

968
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,688
we will be dropping something
unlike anything you've seen before.

969
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,692
Working with great talent,
people we believe in.

970
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,984
As I talk about Liv…

971
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,445
- Anyway, uh, he will.
- …I'm reminded…

972
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,031
Listen, you know,
it's kind of silly, but my dad,

973
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:33,702
he says that experience really matters,

974
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,745
so he's gonna want
to know everything about you.

975
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,914
Like where you're from
or what else you've done

976
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,874
- or who you've worked with.
- Oh.

977
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:40,959
- Okay.
- Yeah.

978
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:44,337
You're young, but the way you've blown up,
you've obviously had, like…

979
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,214
- Well-- I--
-…tons of professional gigs, right?

980
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:48,299
I got a lot riding on this.

981
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,015
I'm your guy.

982
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:00,812
I'm never going to forget tonight.

983
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:03,565
- S-Same.
- Where have you been?

984
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,483
Oh, good. You found her.

985
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,152
- Hey, Sami.
- Hi.

986
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:11,281
- You know these people?
- This is the guy.

987
01:07:11,364 --> 01:07:12,532
You're the guy?

988
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,160
Uh, I did design these,
but I'm not really--

989
01:07:15,243 --> 01:07:17,537
Of course, he's the guy.
I mean, look at the shoes.

990
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,123
Can I take a picture of you?
You look so beautiful.

991
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:21,416
Now, you get in there.

992
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,793
- Oh, stop being so modest.
- Yeah.

993
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:27,047
He's such a superstar.
Look at that power couple.

994
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,966
That's so cute. I'm gonna frame it.

995
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,136
I'm so excited.
I really want Dad to meet him.

996
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:35,347
Isn't this exactly who he told me to find?

997
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,431
Take a deep breath.

998
01:07:36,514 --> 01:07:39,059
You'll get a chance to introduce him
to Dad when he's done.

999
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,977
This program promotes honesty
and integrity,

1000
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:42,520
which are very important…

1001
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:43,855
I wish he'd hurry up.

1002
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,733
It is almost midnight, so you know
he always does the auction then.

1003
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:48,651
- Midnight?
- Oh, yeah.

1004
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:49,903
Midnight.

1005
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,823
Oh, no, we can't go.
You're about to meet King.

1006
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,659
That's exactly the problem.
I-- I screwed up.

1007
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:58,870
Okay, okay. G did warn us about midnight.

1008
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,914
I'm-- I'm sorry. What is going on--

1009
01:08:00,997 --> 01:08:03,208
Give it up for Darius King.

1010
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:06,461
He'll be stepping down
so we can start the auction at midnight.

1011
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:07,504
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:09,923
I really gotta get the guy
out of here right now.

1013
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:11,216
It's-- It's a-- Uh--

1014
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:12,592
- Wait. What?
- A curfew thing.

1015
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:13,677
- Follow me.
- Excuse me.

1016
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,220
- What is up with your friends?
- I don't know.

1017
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:17,055
- Excuse me.
- You can't leave yet.

1018
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:18,890
- Gotta go. Sorry.
- I'll be right back.

1019
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:20,225
- Come on.
- El!

1020
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:21,601
- Sorry.
- Hey, hey!

1021
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:23,853
No.

1022
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:24,938
My suit!

1023
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:29,067
What is happening?

1024
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:32,278
El, I'm covered in appetizers. Run!

1025
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,363
Excuse me.

1026
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,783
- Oh, shoot. I don't know.
- Wait, what are you doing? That's the up.

1027
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,205
I'm stuck!

1028
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,250
Jump!

1029
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:48,962
El!

1030
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:51,923
My shoe! My shoe! No!

1031
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,718
Don't let him leave.

1032
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:58,763
Leave it.

1033
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:02,100
El.

1034
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:03,893
- I'm sorry.
- We gotta go.

1035
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,854
How do I find you again?

1036
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,358
- Go, go, go!
- Watch out, people!

1037
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,871
- Wait!

1038
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:25,707
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1039
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,916
We're here!

1040
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,543
- No, wait.
- We're here. We're--

1041
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:36,676
Ooh.

1042
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,261
- Hey, Sami.
- Yeah?

1043
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:23,682
Why did everyone at that party think
I was this hot underground designer?

1044
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,517
One that's blowing up worldwide.

1045
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,815
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1046
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,526
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing m-much.

1047
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:37,529
- Just that you're a designer…
- Mm-hmm.

1048
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:39,948
…and you're really cool. And that's--

1049
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:42,575
That's about it.

1050
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:45,328
Samantha.

1051
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:49,499
- Okay, I may have hyped you up a little…
- Why?

1052
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:51,710
…but I barely said anything.

1053
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:54,754
I can't help what conclusions
other people might have jumped to.

1054
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:57,841
Okay, well, Kira asked me
if I have professional experience.

1055
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,468
- And?
- And--

1056
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:04,723
She wanted me to meet Mr. King.
So I said-- I said I did.

1057
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,350
- Dude, that's amazing!
- No, that's not good.

1058
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,310
That's horrible. I lied. I lied to her.

1059
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,856
Okay, do you think anyone at that party
was a 100% real?

1060
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:14,399
- Yes.
- No.

1061
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:19,279
Look, we both exaggerated a teeny
amount, and it's gonna turn out great.

1062
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:21,197
- Probably.

1063
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:23,742
Sami, how can I face her again
after this?

1064
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:26,494
So tell me again why he ran away.

1065
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:29,456
- He's an artist. They're all… You know.
- Mmm.

1066
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,791
I mean, Banksy doesn't ever show his face.

1067
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,252
And you're a really big deal, Dad.

1068
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,755
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, people get nervous.

1069
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:38,923
- Yeah, nice try.
- Okay, but Dad.

1070
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:42,344
Come on, look. Look at the work.
I mean, it speaks for itself, right?

1071
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:44,596
I admit it does draw me in.

1072
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,851
It's like looking at something
entirely new, but so familiar.

1073
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:53,605
It reminds me of home. I don't know why.
It's very colorful.

1074
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,148
Yo, I know that spot.

1075
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,193
Your mom took me here
when we first started dating.

1076
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:00,612
- Really?
- Yeah, they had, like, the best dessert.

1077
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,655
- It was like this custardy thing--
- Galaktoboureko?

1078
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,491
Yeah. Hey, how you know that?

1079
01:12:04,574 --> 01:12:05,825
He took me there.

1080
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:10,205
I still don't like that I don't know
anything about his background.

1081
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:14,959
He's worked with plenty top-tier brands.
Look how personal his work is.

1082
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,044
I trust him.

1083
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,089
I just really need you to trust me.

1084
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:20,674
Liv?

1085
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:26,054
I admit it's good work, but the unknown
factor just makes it very risky.

1086
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,642
Okay, Kira. You bring him in.

1087
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:35,939
We'll sit him down,
and if everything you say checks out,

1088
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,441
then we'll try to showcase it
at Sneakercon.

1089
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,151
- Really?
- Yes.

1090
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:42,362
- Thanks, Dad.
- You got it.

1091
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:43,655
- Love you, Dad!
- Peace!

1092
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,492
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

1093
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:54,290
Yo, King, can I take a selfie?

1094
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,750
- Darius!
- Over here.

1095
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,961
- What happened last night?
- I just met the King.

1096
01:12:58,044 --> 01:12:59,671
Yo, King I wanna score too.

1097
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:35,498
I just want you to understand
how much is on the line for us right now.

1098
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:36,666
Which is why…

1099
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:41,212
I'm gonna help you with anything you need.

1100
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,049
Okay?

1101
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,343
You will?

1102
01:13:46,426 --> 01:13:49,554
If this is what we're doing,
then let's really do it.

1103
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:51,723
Let's make it happen. I'm all in, okay?

1104
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,558
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1105
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:55,643
All right, now we just gotta find him.

1106
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,687
Yes! Call him. Text him right now.

1107
01:13:57,771 --> 01:14:01,232
Yeah, I can't.
I don't have his number or Instagram or--

1108
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,109
- So you've hung out twice…
- I know.

1109
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,695
-…and you didn't get any digits?
- Yeah.

1110
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:07,822
Girl, what's going on?
Your game needs work.

1111
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,282
- I need help.
- Yes, you do.

1112
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:10,575
I only have his first name.

1113
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:13,203
And I don't know how to find him,
but I do have his shoe.

1114
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:17,248
You talk about connecting with people
when we were at dinner, right?

1115
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:19,793
- Yeah.
- Well, we've got 40 million followers.

1116
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:21,628
Let's connect with them.

1117
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:23,421
Why don't we do a whole King6 campaign

1118
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:25,632
to find the designer
who has the match to the shoe?

1119
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:28,134
- Let's do it. All right.
- Yes. Let's do it. Let's plan. Okay.

1120
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,678
But let's make him come to us.

1121
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,513
- Maybe we could do a photo shoot?
- Yes.

1122
01:14:31,596 --> 01:14:33,431
We'll blast out a picture
of you holding the shoe.

1123
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:35,975
- We'll need a catchy tagline too.
- Yeah. Right? "Where's my prince?"

1124
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:37,060
I love it.

1125
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:52,575
Are you down?

1126
01:14:57,539 --> 01:14:58,915
All right, Internet. Let's do this.

<i>Breaking news</i>

I'm sorry. Okay.

1135
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:52,570
Excuse me.

1136
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:21,850
Where are you?

1137
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:38,491
El, why didn't you show up today?
You should have been there.

1138
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,535
I don't know. Okay? I don't know, Sami.

1139
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:42,245
You have seen this, right?

1140
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:44,372
A hundred million other people have.

1141
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:47,959
She put herself out there for you.
So you gotta answer her.

1142
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:49,544
Dude, she digs your work.

1143
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:54,799
And from how hard she's trying to find
you, I think that's not all she's into.

1144
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:57,719
Sami, this--

1145
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:03,767
This is so important to Kira.
Okay, and-- I-- I don't wanna hurt her.

1146
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,353
Oh, right,
because publicly ghosting someone

1147
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:08,563
is a great way not
to hurt their feelings, right?

1148
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:10,523
Sami, you weren't there.

1149
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:13,735
Okay, if you could have seen
the look of relief on her face

1150
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:15,570
when she thought
I was this big shot designer.

1151
01:18:16,654 --> 01:18:19,407
- She-- She doesn't want this El.
- Hey!

1152
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:21,493
- She doesn't. She doesn't.
- Nah-uh-uh.

1153
01:18:21,576 --> 01:18:22,744
You sit down.

1154
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,913
You don't talk about
my best friend like that.

1155
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:26,790
Disrespectful.

1156
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:30,794
Listen, why do you think Kira didn't tell
you she was Kira King on that first day?

1157
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:33,797
It's because she doesn't
care about that stuff, dude.

1158
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,424
And all those things people
said about you at the gala,

1159
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:39,552
I didn't correct them,
because to me they are true.

1160
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:41,012
They will be true.

1161
01:18:42,013 --> 01:18:46,685
But in order for the world to believe
that, you've gotta believe it first.

1162
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:47,852
Do you?

1163
01:18:57,779 --> 01:18:59,155
Are you sure this will work?

1164
01:18:59,864 --> 01:19:02,867
Um, if I'm your hype woman, let me hype.

1165
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:10,333
- You like?
- Yeah. I do.

1166
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:16,631
All right, your match is right here
and ready to meet.

1167
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:19,467
Lightning bolt emoji.

1168
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,262
- Send it. Send it. Send it.
- Mm-hmm. Done.

1169
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:26,683
Ha ha!

1170
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:29,561
- Kira!
- I'm so proud of you, El.

1171
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:31,312
- This is huge.
- Whoo!

1172
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:33,732
I'm right here, girl!

1173
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:45,994
- Dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude.
- What? What? What? What? What?

1174
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:47,704
- Oh, she DMed me.
- And?

1175
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:50,331
- Here. It's calling. Go. You're fine.
- What?

1176
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:52,834
Hello.

1177
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,587
Uh, hi. Hell-- Hello.

1178
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,297
- Where have you been?
- <i>I was--</i>

1179
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,631
I-- I…

1180
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:04,929
<i>I was being an idiot. I was afraid and…</i>

1181
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:09,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I'm-- I'm done with that now.

1182
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:10,727
Are you sure?

1183
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,608
- Listen, El, my dad's in.
- What? He is?

1184
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:19,861
<i>Yeah, he wants to set up a meeting.</i>
<i>And if you run again, I--</i>

1185
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:22,864
Look-- Look, I won't let you down.

1186
01:20:22,947 --> 01:20:25,158
- You promise?
- I promise.

1187
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:26,409
Just checking.

1188
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:29,704
- Okay, okay.
- All right. Bye. Bye.

1189
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,592
Whoo!

1190
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:46,805
He loves her! He loves her!

1191
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:50,141
- What's up, Zell? How you doing, bro?
- What's up, buddy? How's it going?

1192
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:53,561
- El and Kira King. He loves her.
- Hmm?

1193
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:56,022
- I'm in love!
- You're in love!

1194
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,149
Kira King? What's he up to?

1195
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,443
Dude,
you're designing sneakers for King!

1196
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:02,654
- Zelly, come here now.
- Yep.

1197
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:04,572
- Yo, what's up?

1198
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:06,908
- What?
- What? Look at this guy.

1199
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:09,119
- Who?
- He really think that he can play us.

1200
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:11,538
- What are we talking about?
- El's going down.

1201
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:12,580
Oh…

1202
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:56,624
I'm right here, girl. I'm right here.

1203
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:02,464
I'm right here, girl! Ooh!

1204
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:43,171
- Wow, look at this mess.
- Uh, so messy.

1205
01:22:43,254 --> 01:22:45,507
Ultra messy.

1206
01:22:58,728 --> 01:22:59,979
Come here.

1207
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,859
Perfect. I think I got the pic.

1208
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,486
El needs to know who he's messing with.

1209
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:55,201
Shh, quiet. Don't wake him up.

1210
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:24,814
- It's the big day. Did you oversleep?
- I know I set my alarm.

1211
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:26,816
Okay, we gotta roll, El.
You're gonna be late.

1212
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,069
I know. I just couldn't decide
between a tie or not, you know?

1213
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:30,862
I just want to seem professional.

1214
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:33,114
Well, you know what's professional?
Being on time.

1215
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,240
- Funny.
- Mm-hmm.

1216
01:24:35,533 --> 01:24:36,618
Dude.

1217
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:40,372
This is so beautiful.

1218
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:43,041
Is this what you're gonna show
King today? The Sneakercon design?

1219
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:45,168
Yeah. Inspired by Kira.

1220
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:49,172
Where's the sneaker?

1221
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,509
- What?
- Sami, where's the sneaker?

1222
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:55,345
Where's my sneaker?

1223
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:57,764
- Come on. We gotta go.
- I need the shoe.

1224
01:24:57,847 --> 01:24:59,599
- No, you don't.
- I can't go without the shoe.

1225
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:01,518
- Yes, you can. You've seen this, right?
- Sami.

1226
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:05,480
- Yeah.
- Listen to me.

1227
01:25:05,563 --> 01:25:07,732
Kira knows you.
She already knows you made that shoe.

1228
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,693
Now it's about your new designs.
I'm telling you.

1229
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:11,569
You bring this,
and you'll win everybody over.

1230
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,655
That is if we actually get on the subway.

1231
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:15,031
- So let's go.
- It's pretty good.

1232
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,991
It's not "pretty good." It's amazing.

1233
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:18,118
Come on.

1234
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:22,872
I'm enough.

1235
01:25:30,296 --> 01:25:31,381
Mmm.

1236
01:25:31,464 --> 01:25:32,507
- Bye.
- Kill it.

1237
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:39,472
- It was really lovely meeting you both.

1238
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:41,933
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you very much for our time.

1239
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,768
Good luck in your meeting.

1240
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:45,437
Don't we want the meeting to go bad?

1241
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:47,480
- What?
- Sucker.

1242
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:52,068
Shoot!

1243
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:57,490
Hey. Hey, Kira.

1244
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,370
You wanted a meeting with my dad, right?

1245
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,415
Go ahead.

1246
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:13,423
Your brothers had a lot
to say about you, El.

1247
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:17,510
Mr. King, those are my stepbrothers,
and y-you can't trust anything they say.

1248
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:19,804
Trust? You wanna talk about trust?

1249
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:22,474
Look, I can explain. Kira, please.

1250
01:26:23,641 --> 01:26:24,726
Sit down.

1251
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:34,361
Did you or did you not tell
my daughter you were a designer?

1252
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:37,280
A big-shot, underground designer
with fans all over the world?

1253
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:39,657
Yes. I-I designed those.
Um, I am a designer.

1254
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:40,867
But you lied.

1255
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:43,453
Yeah.

1256
01:26:43,536 --> 01:26:45,663
So you're a hustler. You're a scam artist.

1257
01:26:46,289 --> 01:26:49,834
This whole stunt was about you
creating a name for yourself.

1258
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:53,505
Use our brand, use our followers
to make some cash.

1259
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:56,091
- No, it's not like that. I'm not--
- It's not?

1260
01:26:56,174 --> 01:26:58,718
So is your father not in the middle
of trying to off-load

1261
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:01,638
his failing shoe store
that's drowning in debt?

1262
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:04,224
Trey's my stepfather.
Okay, it's my mom's shop.

1263
01:27:04,307 --> 01:27:06,518
Did you even design these,
or was this part of the hustle?

1264
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:08,853
No, no. Um, yes. Yes.

1265
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:10,605
That shoe right there, that's all me.

1266
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:12,148
That's-- That's everything.

1267
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:16,194
And we're supposed to believe you?
Sneakercon is in a couple of weeks!

1268
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:18,863
You've put us in a bind.

1269
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:20,657
And my daughter vouched for you.

1270
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:24,953
She put herself on the line
for the first time publicly, all for lies.

1271
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,456
I think we're done here.

1272
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,252
Don't ever come around my daughter again.

1273
01:27:42,303 --> 01:27:43,847
Kira. Kira, please.

1274
01:27:44,514 --> 01:27:47,142
Look. Look, I'm so sorry.

1275
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:49,394
- How could you lie to me?
- I didn't mean to lie.

1276
01:27:49,477 --> 01:27:50,937
You knew what this meant to me.

1277
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:53,815
You wanted me to be all those things
that everyone said I was. I--

1278
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:55,108
So this is my fault?

1279
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:56,651
- No, of course not.
- Unbelievable.

1280
01:27:56,735 --> 01:27:59,571
I'm-- No, I'm just saying
my designs, they weren't enough for you.

1281
01:28:02,365 --> 01:28:06,619
I thought if I told you I was a stock boy,
you-- you wouldn't look at me the same.

1282
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:11,166
Hey, don't cry. Come on. I--

1283
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:14,294
I'm that same dude from that first day.

1284
01:28:14,377 --> 01:28:16,588
- Oh, no. No.
- I am. Kira, come on.

1285
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:18,882
Now you're just someone
I never want to see again.

1286
01:28:18,965 --> 01:28:20,216
Goodbye, El.

1287
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,801
- I'm sorry.
- Security.

1288
01:28:21,885 --> 01:28:22,886
Kira, I'm sorry.

1289
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:27,557
- Kira, please. Come on. Hey.
- That's enough. You need to leave.

1290
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,767
Kira! Kira!

1291
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:30,810
- I'm escorting you out.
- I'm good. I'm good.

1292
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:37,484
- Hey, how'd it go? We in business?
- It's over.

1293
01:29:34,207 --> 01:29:37,585
Mrs. Singh. Come on. You know
I do this every Wednesday night.

1294
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:40,422
I'm going to have to get used
to doing it myself.

1295
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:43,800
- Honey, it's okay. It'll be my cardio.

1296
01:29:43,883 --> 01:29:45,844
I really can't believe you're leaving.

1297
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:47,429
It all happened so quickly.

1298
01:29:47,512 --> 01:29:49,889
Come here. Stay in touch.

1299
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:51,057
I'm really gonna miss you.

1300
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,942
<i>What would become of his dreams?</i>

1301
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:49,908
<i>Would he never see his passion and</i>
<i>talent fulfilled because of one mistake?</i>

1302
01:30:49,991 --> 01:30:53,703
<i>Or would the neighborhood he loved</i>
<i>and whose spirit he represented</i>

1303
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:56,456
<i>come together to give him one more chance?</i>

1304
01:30:57,374 --> 01:31:01,961
<i>Well, that would be</i>
<i>its own kind of magic, wouldn't it?</i>

1305
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:09,219
Kira. Kira.

1306
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:13,723
- Hey, today's the big day.
- Yeah.

1307
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:16,101
- It's game day.
- For Liv.

1308
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,770
No, for all of us.

1309
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:22,315
You're a big part of this company too,
Kira, and this family.

1310
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:26,027
- We're all Kings.
- I don't feel like one.

1311
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,779
Well, you gotta straighten your crown.

1312
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,031
You know, I've been really proud of you
these past few weeks.

1313
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:30,949
Why?

1314
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:33,368
Mom, I screwed up big time.

1315
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:35,245
- It was all a lie.
- All?

1316
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,956
Everything El said about his experience.

1317
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:39,624
He got in over his head.

1318
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:42,711
Then again, so did you.

1319
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:46,089
How is it my fault that he lied?
I don't understand.

1320
01:31:46,172 --> 01:31:49,050
Oh, I suppose it's impossible
that you wanted this so badly,

1321
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,553
you might have led him into saying
what you needed to hear?

1322
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,054
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

1323
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:56,558
Come here. Listen to me.

1324
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,271
It is not easy as a young woman
to stand up and have your voice heard

1325
01:32:01,354 --> 01:32:04,691
above everybody else's,
and especially your father's.

1326
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:06,359
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1327
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:08,236
- Yeah.
- Got a big mouth.

1328
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:09,738
Yeah.

1329
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:12,824
But you did.

1330
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,659
And I'm very proud of you for that

1331
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:18,455
because that means that you're starting
to find your own voice and trust yourself.

1332
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,710
- That means you're growing up.
- Yeah.

1333
01:32:23,793 --> 01:32:26,755
And you know what? Okay,
so you messed up. We all do.

1334
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:28,673
The most important thing is that you

1335
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:30,842
figure out what it is that
you can do differently next time.

1336
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,095
- Yeah, I guess you're right, Mom.
- Oh, of course I am.

1337
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:37,432
Baby, you know how many of these talks
I've given over the years to Liv?

1338
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:39,559
- Wait, really?
- Uh-huh. And to your dad.

1339
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:41,227
- Mm-hmm, absolutely.
- What?

1340
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:45,774
Baby, he did not become the King
on his own, my love, okay?

1341
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:47,984
- My baby.
- What's so funny?

1342
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:50,236
- Oh, baby. Aw.
- What?

1343
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,364
- You look great.
- Stop. Okay.

1344
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:54,157
Get up. We gotta go.

1345
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,034
- I love you.
- All right. Get up.

1346
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:57,118
All right.

1347
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,329
- Let me get that hair, baby.
- Were y'all talking about me?

1348
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:01,247
- No.
- No, no, no.

1349
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,874
Breakfast now.

1350
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:14,010
- No.

1351
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,720
No, no, no.

1352
01:33:17,263 --> 01:33:20,517
- What?

1353
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:09,107
- I gotta go.

1354
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:16,322
I feel like my arms
have gotten a little bigger.

1355
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:18,533
- Yeah, they've grown.
- I know.

1356
01:34:18,616 --> 01:34:20,326
Okay. Yeah. Are we almost done?

1357
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,412
- Only three more boxes for you…
- Three more boxes?

1358
01:34:22,495 --> 01:34:24,122
- …and half a box for me.
- Shoot.

1359
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:28,960
- Wow.

1360
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:30,378
Sami!

1361
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:32,589
- That's what I'm saying, bro.

1362
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:36,593
Dude, have you ever seen
two people work so hard to get to Jersey,

1363
01:34:36,676 --> 01:34:39,471
- or, in their case, work at all?
- Sami, listen. I--

1364
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:41,181
I need you to stall them.

1365
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:43,391
- I gotta get to Sneakercon.
- You're going?

1366
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:46,353
- Yes.
- Dude! Yes!

1367
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:48,063
Look, I gotta find Kira
and make things right.

1368
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:50,482
- I got kicks to deliver.
- I'm so proud of you, man.

1369
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:53,485
- Do what you do best. Make a scene.
- Say no more. Dude, I got you.

1370
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:56,780
- Here I go!
- Second round.

1371
01:34:56,863 --> 01:34:57,864
- Yo.
- You good?

1372
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,121
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.

1373
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:06,998
Hey, guys.
Do you need help with something?

1374
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:10,043
Help? Uh, yeah. I can bench,
like, two of you, so…

1375
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:11,127
You can!

1376
01:35:11,878 --> 01:35:13,213
- No.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah--

1377
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:16,007
- Sami, we're kind of in a rush here.
- Uh, oh, wow,

1378
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:18,426
- this is really, really cool.
- Don't touch that. Hey. No.

1379
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,636
- Ooh…
- Take that off. No.

1380
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:21,930
This was blessed by my sensei,
you understand? That was blessed.

1381
01:35:22,013 --> 01:35:23,682
- You can't put it on.
- It's awesome. Wow!

1382
01:35:23,765 --> 01:35:24,766
Take it off right now.

1383
01:35:24,849 --> 01:35:26,393
- Hey! No fingerprints.
- Shiny!

1384
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:28,645
- Come on.
- I don't know what's going on!

1385
01:35:28,728 --> 01:35:30,063
- We are leaving here.
- I'm excited!

1386
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:31,606
- Come on! Stop.
- Give it back!

1387
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:33,900
- Okay! Stop! Can you stop?
- Unbelievable. Give it to me!

1388
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:35,276
Okay, okay, okay.

1389
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,986
- I'm cool. I'm cool. Okay.
- Huh?

1390
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:38,697
- What is wrong with you?
- Here.

1391
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,074
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

1392
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:43,618
- Didn't wanna help you anyway. Bye, guys.

1393
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:44,703
Sheesh.

1394
01:35:49,332 --> 01:35:52,460
<i>Hello, Sneakercon and King6 fans.</i>

1395
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:53,586
Whoo!

1396
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:54,671
<i>Yes!</i>

1397
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,466
<i>We've got a lot in store for you today.</i>

1398
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:01,845
First, we are so excited to be giving you
an exclusive sneak peek

1399
01:36:01,928 --> 01:36:05,598
at the newest King6 kick,
the Sleek, which I personally developed.

1400
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:08,018
And how cool to be broadcasting directly
to our fans

1401
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:10,020
at Sneakercon Cleveland today.

1402
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:12,272
We have a special treat lined up
that you won't wanna miss,

1403
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:14,816
so be sure to watch live at 10:00 a.m.

1404
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:18,069
And thank you to all of our amazing
supporters who turned up this morning.

1405
01:36:18,153 --> 01:36:19,571
We love you.

1406
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:25,994
- Sorry. Didn't see you there. My bad.
- Dude, really?

1407
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:32,500
What?

1408
01:36:33,585 --> 01:36:36,087
- Zelly. Zelly!
- Huh?

1409
01:36:36,171 --> 01:36:39,215
Yo, what's up?
Can you smell the fresh Jersey air yet?

1410
01:36:40,216 --> 01:36:41,217
- El is gone.
- What?

1411
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:43,094
He's gone to some Sneakercon thing
at King6.

1412
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:45,055
What if he can get enough money
to keep the store?

1413
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,598
- Should we go there? I'll drive.
- Yeah.

1414
01:36:47,515 --> 01:36:49,517
- No.
- It's okay.

1415
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,727
Come on.

1416
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,895
Don't worry.

1417
01:36:51,978 --> 01:36:53,355
All right. Let's go.

1418
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:56,983
Dad! El took off, but we know where he is.

1419
01:36:57,067 --> 01:36:58,610
- Bye, Dad.
- We'll be back in an hour.

1420
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:00,070
- What are you talking about?
- Dad, move.

1421
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:01,821
- We got a schedule. Where is El?

1422
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:04,157
- What? Whoa, whoa.
- I'll see you real soon, Dad.

1423
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,825
Stop joking around. Get out of the truck.

1424
01:37:05,909 --> 01:37:08,703
- We're not joking around.
- Dad, it's all good. Just relax.

1425
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:09,746
- Get-- Wait!
- Bye!

1426
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:13,249
Where are you going? Get back here!
Get back here!

1427
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:14,959
You murdered my cone!

1428
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:19,547
I cannot afford this.

1429
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:23,134
Sami, okay. What is going on?

1430
01:37:23,802 --> 01:37:25,428
Can you just tell me where El is?

1431
01:37:26,012 --> 01:37:28,682
I can't deal with him trying to sabotage
anything to do with this deal.

1432
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,601
I know he doesn't want to leave. He--

1433
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:34,437
H-He just doesn't get it.

1434
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:37,107
No. You're the one that doesn't get it.

1435
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:40,735
Your stepson is talented,
and he's kind and he's hopeful,

1436
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:42,612
despite all your best efforts.

1437
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:43,697
You know what?

1438
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,282
I think it's time for you
to see El for who he truly is.

1439
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:49,661
-<i>Who's ready for some OG King?</i>

1440
01:37:49,744 --> 01:37:52,372
<i>We convinced the King</i>
<i>to dust off his famous '90s jam</i>

1441
01:37:52,455 --> 01:37:54,332
-<i>from his heyday on the court.</i>
- What?

1442
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:56,001
<i>Let's get '90s, Sneakercon.</i>

1443
01:37:56,084 --> 01:37:57,335
- Throwback.
- Hilarious.

1444
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:11,057
Kira, please.

1445
01:38:21,234 --> 01:38:22,819
- Please.
- No. It's okay.

1446
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,949
- What, El?
- Look, these are for you.

1447
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:30,744
Please take them. I'll leave right after.

1448
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:45,759
They have a little K on them.

1449
01:38:47,385 --> 01:38:49,637
- Is that for me?
- They're one of ones.

1450
01:38:52,098 --> 01:38:53,099
Just like you.

1451
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:58,813
Look, I know I lied to you.
And I'm sorry, okay?

1452
01:39:01,524 --> 01:39:02,609
That's not who I am.

1453
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:04,778
That's not who I was raised to be.

1454
01:39:05,278 --> 01:39:09,199
I'm the son of a magical, amazing woman

1455
01:39:09,824 --> 01:39:12,952
who taught me that sneakers can be
the window to s-someone's soul.

1456
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:17,290
That-- That they can show you
someone's experiences, tell you…

1457
01:39:19,584 --> 01:39:22,045
Tell you who someone is
and what they care about.

1458
01:39:22,837 --> 01:39:25,840
I'm sorry it took me this long
to say that. But all I care about…

1459
01:39:28,176 --> 01:39:29,177
is you.

1460
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:31,054
It's too late.

1461
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:34,891
We already have the kick
we're dropping today.

1462
01:39:34,974 --> 01:39:36,643
You think I came here for that?

1463
01:39:37,268 --> 01:39:39,229
I came here to say I'm sorry.

1464
01:39:39,312 --> 01:39:41,648
I came here for you.
I didn't come here for that shoe.

1465
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,191
Oh, no. You, out.

1466
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:45,026
You've done enough damage
around here already.

1467
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:46,986
- You completely embarrassed my family…
- Liv!

1468
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:51,199
-…and hurt my sister. Okay, just get--
- Oh, my gosh. Liv! Liv, it's okay.

1469
01:39:54,994 --> 01:39:56,579
El came here to apologize.

1470
01:39:59,165 --> 01:40:00,166
And so should I.

1471
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:01,209
- What?
- What?

1472
01:40:01,292 --> 01:40:02,210
What are you talking about?

1473
01:40:02,293 --> 01:40:04,629
I'm really sorry that I pushed you
to say all that stuff.

1474
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:09,009
My dad, he said that experience mattered.

1475
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:11,803
And I don't-- I don't know. I just--

1476
01:40:11,886 --> 01:40:14,848
I got so wrapped up in that
that I forgot what really matters,

1477
01:40:14,931 --> 01:40:18,601
what I want my family to stand for,
what I believe in.

1478
01:40:19,602 --> 01:40:21,646
Your talent. Your passion.

1479
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:25,150
El, you're amazing.

1480
01:40:25,734 --> 01:40:26,901
And I believe in you.

1481
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:29,195
And that should be enough.

1482
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,324
Look at his work, Liv.

1483
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,453
It's kind of spectacular, no?

1484
01:40:40,957 --> 01:40:42,334
I'm not the one you have to convince.

1485
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:46,671
You clearly put your voice into your work.
Can you bring it to the stage? Hmm?

1486
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:49,215
El, you got this.

1487
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,761
For you, Manhattan…

1488
01:40:54,012 --> 01:40:55,263
anything.

1489
01:40:57,682 --> 01:40:58,683
Oh, gosh.

1490
01:41:01,853 --> 01:41:04,647
Thank you.
Sneakercon, are you ready for this?

1491
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,772
- You got him!
- You feel me?

1492
01:41:45,855 --> 01:41:47,148
Go, El!

1493
01:41:47,232 --> 01:41:49,109
King,
you gonna let him get at you like that?

1494
01:41:49,192 --> 01:41:50,568
- This ain't the '90s.
- Oh!

1495
01:41:50,652 --> 01:41:52,737
- Throw down, King.
- This is what we doing?

1496
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:55,407
- This is what we doing?
- Give me some new-school bars.

1497
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:25,228
You got 'em!

1498
01:43:01,681 --> 01:43:03,391
Queens in the building!

1499
01:43:03,975 --> 01:43:06,102
Dad, hey. Look at his shoes.

1500
01:43:06,186 --> 01:43:08,480
Hey, King.
This kid's helping you hold it down.

1501
01:43:08,563 --> 01:43:09,773
I think they're pretty dope.

1502
01:43:09,856 --> 01:43:11,149
Hey, no, no!

1503
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,611
Quiet down. Quiet down. Everyone quiet.

1504
01:43:14,694 --> 01:43:16,571
Do you not really know who he is?

1505
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:19,783
Huh? 'Cause if you did,
you wouldn't be cheering.

1506
01:43:24,829 --> 01:43:26,664
-<i>You think he made a masterpiece?</i>

1507
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:40,345
Huh? Zelly, Stacy?

1508
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:42,639
What is going on?

1509
01:43:42,722 --> 01:43:44,140
- Wait.

1510
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:12,002
You get me?

1511
01:44:17,757 --> 01:44:19,676
Oh, now I see what's going on.

1512
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,762
Wow. El, you made that?

1513
01:44:23,263 --> 01:44:26,224
I just don't understand
why you never showed me.

1514
01:45:15,523 --> 01:45:16,524
Huh?

1515
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:20,612
Second chance…

1516
01:45:23,073 --> 01:45:24,074
Son?

1517
01:45:25,116 --> 01:45:26,951
Look, I got you.

1518
01:45:29,245 --> 01:45:31,498
'Cause everyone deserves a second chance.

1519
01:45:35,627 --> 01:45:36,628
Thank you.

1520
01:46:18,461 --> 01:46:19,963
You gotta go! Come on!

1521
01:46:24,759 --> 01:46:25,844
Yeah, El!

1522
01:47:29,616 --> 01:47:30,617
El, hey, man.

1523
01:48:54,034 --> 01:48:55,035
Huh?

1524
01:49:04,044 --> 01:49:08,590
<i>And so goes the story of the boy</i>
<i>who tried to soar in the King's shoes,</i>

1525
01:49:08,673 --> 01:49:11,593
<i>but ultimately found the best way</i>
<i>to take flight</i>

1526
01:49:11,676 --> 01:49:13,636
<i>was to stay true to his roots</i>

1527
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,890
<i>and maybe give a little lift</i>
<i>to the next dreamer.</i>
