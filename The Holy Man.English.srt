1
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,399
I’m so glad that the Abbot
has sent an active monk

2
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,520
to Don Kanun Temple.

3
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,119
There’s someone ahead.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Please pick them up.

5
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,759
I don’t think we can.
It’s full. It will be crowded.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,640
The Mercedes is quite big.
Be generous.

7
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,920
Come. Get in.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,079
The one who has the most things,
sit on the inside.

9
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:12,959
Good Karma can be found
in this life, right?

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,840
Look at your big face, full of virtue.

11
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,840
Is that right?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Turn away!

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,159
-My ear!
-That’s a pig.

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,519
The pig is going to bite my ear.

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Hey! Red lipstick.
Go sit in the back seat.

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
How can you sit with the monk like this?
It's crowded. I can't drive.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,319
Go. Just go.

18
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,879
That’s not it.
You grabbed the wrong gear.

19
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,439
Who farted?

20
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,079
-Did you eat a rotten dog or something?
-Open the door.

21
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,719
Don't mess up the seat.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,000
-Hurry!
-You've got an upset stomach. Go.

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,919
Go sit in the back.

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,159
So sad.

25
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,280
Mama is dead.

26
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,479
Move. Stop!

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,919
-Stop! Move out the way.
-Why?

28
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,479
-You move!
-Why should I? I won't.

29
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,360
Please give way to the monk.

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Let me tell you,
my mama's body hasn't been treated.

31
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,639
If we don’t get there in time,
she will be rotten.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,159
Me too.
If I don’t get to my wedding in time,

33
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,199
I will be rotten too!

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Getting married? Take off your hat.

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
-No!
-Take it off.

36
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,879
No!

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
Let me see.
How many snakes are on your head?

38
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,439
You're crazy.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Please give way.

40
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,319
-I'm going to the wedding!
-I won't give in.

41
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,439
-So no one goes anywhere.
-No!

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,719
-Move!
-Go!

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,639
Please stop.

44
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,680
You don’t have to stop us.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
I won’t give up either.

46
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,319
I didn’t come to stop you from fighting.

47
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,560
It's a simple thing.
You should disagree.

48
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,960
We are all Thai anyway.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
Well, half-Chinese.

50
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,280
Do not give in. It's humiliating.

51
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,439
These big events,

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,639
let them destroy the bridge.

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,039
Before you two fight,

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,439
please let me through. It's almost noon.

55
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,720
Okay!

56
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,199
The cortege goes left.

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
That’s it!

58
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,639
The groom.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,639
Aren't you ashamed?

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,360
They can go left. We can too.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,360
To the left!

62
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,319
Why stand there?
Aren't you rushing to the wedding?

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,720
You take your mother to the funeral.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,759
Aren't you coming back to the temple?

65
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,839
-Your lip is drooping.
-Let's go back.

66
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,199
Mama is dead.

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Mama is dead.

68
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,120
Come.

69
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,720
-Yes.
-Hurry.

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,759
Help me push.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,759
-Push!
-Harder!

72
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,720
You guys

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,519
are lucky to push the monk's car.

74
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,759
Yes.

75
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,319
The monk first. Please get in.

76
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay. Thank you.

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,879
You only sleep and eat all day.

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,519
If you have time,
drink something soothing.

79
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,720
Yes.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
HERMITAGE FOR MERIT

81
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,279
-Let's go.
-Okay, Song.

82
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,959
It's not what you think.

83
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,360
The locals don't know
that there's a new monk.

84
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,240
Where are they going then?

85
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,240
They go to the place
they believe in more than temples.

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Please come.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,399
In five minutes,
the medium will start a ritual.

88
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,360
Who brought a sacrificial offering?
Put it here.

89
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Who hasn't brought one?

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,800
Please offer some token.

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,399
On the right side are garlands.
On the left are eels.

92
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,639
Set birds and fish separately on the left.

93
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,399
Who hasn't made an offering?

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,199
The medium will start soon.

95
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,639
Welcome... What?

96
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,680
Buy a sacrificial offering.
Buy eels and you will

97
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,839
find things easy.

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
What? Father.

99
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Wow! You are lucky.
Master Phoem welcomes you in person.

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
Master Phoem!

101
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,680
Phoem is here!

102
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,079
He's going to meet his people himself.

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,279
Up close and personal.

104
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,079
The market and temple are very close.

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,040
Just turn right here and we're there.

106
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,519
Almost there.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wait up.

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
We're here.

109
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,319
Let me get the door.

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Please.

111
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,759
Weirdo?

112
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,480
Weirdo!

113
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
Where is he?

114
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,240
You can look around. I'll park the car.

115
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,679
Sure.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Weirdo!

117
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,799
Shit!

118
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,639
I ran over the monk.
I'm going to hell!

119
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,480
He must have shit himself. I ran over him!

120
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Does this happen often, Song?

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,519
Lucky that it's my robe.

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,759
If it was the lower robe,
it would bring rain.

123
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,000
Weirdo!

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
He must be sleeping.

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Weirdo.

126
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
Is there someone weirder than Song?

127
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,480
What are you doing, Weirdo?

128
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,360
Come on out. Weirdo!

129
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,639
-Hey!
-Ouch!

130
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,879
Is this Weirdo?

131
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
No, sir.

132
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,480
Liang is happy that you come here
so I can make a merit.

133
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,080
Liang, why didn't you go home?

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,759
What are you doing at the temple?

135
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,000
Stupid!

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,080
I came here to welcome him.

137
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,440
Have you seen Weirdo?

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,080
Today, there's
a ceremony at the hermitage.

139
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,399
A big one. How can he miss that?

140
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,279
Stupid!

141
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,279
Right?

142
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,200
Above limits. Live your full life.

143
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,759
Do not drink more than two.

144
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,799
A true man...
does not drink more than two.

145
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,679
A great warrior...

146
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,320
does not drink more than two.

147
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Thai with folk-song hearts...
do not drink more than two.

148
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,200
The shark!

149
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,759
Boy, are you going to eat it all?

150
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,399
Do not drink more than two bottles.
These are just...

151
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
one bottle each.

152
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,000
Welcome, everyone.
Make some merit.

153
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,799
Superman!

154
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,200
HERMITAGE

155
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,159
It's time for the medium.

156
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,720
Come. Welcome.

157
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Get back.

158
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,120
The spirit is here.
Pay respects to him.

159
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,159
The spirit goes to the wrong medium.

160
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,679
Change it now.

161
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,759
The spirit is in you, Kradong.

162
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,080
The spirit is here now.

163
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,559
What? Why wake me up? You bastard.

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,919
She’s a woman but has the voice of a man.

165
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,559
It's really sacred.

166
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,200
Pray!

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
I know everything.

168
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,960
But can you let me have some rest?

169
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,200
So many people.
How can I answer you all?

170
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Just pick four or five people
that are in big trouble.

171
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,639
Bua Klee, what's your problem?

172
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,360
Stop! Don't tell me. Same old thing.

173
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,399
Your husband.

174
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,120
My husband
hasn't come home for weeks.

175
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,799
He's with someone.

176
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't worry.

177
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,720
Just buy seductive oil and
sprinkle it around to bring him back.

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Seductive oil.

179
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,639
MAKBOON SUPERMARKET

180
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,480
Make your lover crazy about you.

181
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,600
Sixty-nine Baht per bottle.
Buy ten, get one free.

182
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,399
Yoy. Can't you eat or shit?

183
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,200
Speak! Yoy.

184
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,600
I want a wife, sir.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,240
Whoa!

186
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,600
How hard can it be? She just died.

187
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,519
Hey!

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
Died?

189
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,480
-Get out!
-So,

190
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
-I don't need one.
-Get out!

191
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Get out! Get the hell out!

192
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,679
Get out!

193
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,480
Why so angry?
Why drive me away like this?

194
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,080
I didn't drive you away.

195
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,519
How hard is it to have a wife?

196
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,759
How about Bau Klee?
Her husband's about to leave her.

197
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,200
No! I don't want to be his wife.

198
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
Don't say something like that.

199
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Why so picky?

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,039
Shit.

201
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,279
She's angry.

202
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,120
Get out!

203
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,600
The spirit is gone.

204
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,080
What about the rain, Master Phoem?
You postpone it for months.

205
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,519
-Right!
-Yes.

206
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,120
What's wrong with you, Muek?

207
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,720
No, father.

208
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,639
How can you do that to a crazy man?

209
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,279
He's trouble.

210
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,159
Just hit him.

211
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,360
-Send him away.
-Yes, father.

212
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,519
This is the place.

213
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
We can take advantage
of people's beliefs.

214
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,120
Clear!

215
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,519
We have some business to offer.

216
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,960
Interested?

217
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,279
I wonder if the business

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,679
involves money?

219
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,840
A lot of money.

220
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,279
You bastard. You asshole. Weirdo.

221
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,399
Curse you. You lazy man.

222
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,480
Go to hell, Weirdo.

223
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
Stupid!

224
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
It will get back to you,
I warn you.

225
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,759
None of your business!

226
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,879
Do it together. Don't go on about it.

227
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,519
None of your business!

228
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
A temple is like a house.

229
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,480
If the house is dirty,
who would want to stay in it?

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
So is the temple.

231
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,200
If you look around and it’s not pleasant,

232
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,840
who would want to come?

233
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,600
I got a match.

234
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,679
-I want this one.
-Don't worry. I brought a lot.

235
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,279
-So many.
-I'm here.

236
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,879
Hey!

237
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,039
Don't fight over it.

238
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,240
Hey. What are you doing?

239
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,559
Stop! Where are you going?

240
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,679
Come back, fatty.

241
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,839
-A ghost!
-A ghost is coming.

242
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,480
How's that?

243
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,599
It proves that children are more
afraid of a ghost than a monk.

244
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,720
Weirdo.

245
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,319
Don't ask.

246
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,440
What happened to me?

247
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,279
I won't tell you. I'm used to it.

248
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,000
Is he Weirdo?

249
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,799
That's him.

250
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,400
Hello, sir.

251
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,559
Weirdo.

252
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,160
Mana. I want you to accept me.

253
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,319
And I give all my heart to you.

254
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,119
Please love me a little
but love me for a long time.

255
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,119
Love me, sir.

256
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,960
-Love me.
-Song, catch him.

257
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,799
Not me, him!

258
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,799
-Love me.
-Stop shaking me.

259
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,000
We have a new monk.
We need to celebrate.

260
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,680
This is good, father.

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Bring me here again, please.

262
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,960
-Cool.
-I'm your father.

263
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,400
My ears are sore. So noisy.

264
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,400
Don't they have someplace else?

265
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,200
-There's grandfather over there.
-So lame.

266
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,799
Where's Tui? Help me look for him.

267
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,880
I looked everywhere, no sign of him.

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,000
I told you to find Tui,
I'm not playing around.

269
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,200
Father. Did they come with Tui?

270
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,839
Don't call him Tui. Call him Pattana.

271
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,240
When did you come, Master?

272
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,000
Right, we didn't see you.

273
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,119
It's dark but you wear sunglasses.

274
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,640
What can you see?

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,880
-Our boss is waiting there, Master.
-To boost the negotiation.

276
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,440
Welcome, Master.

277
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,920
Give him a seat.

278
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,920
These girls will help in our negotiation.

279
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,039
-Nice.
-Please.

280
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,960
Come.

281
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,839
-Let me join.
-The fun is over there.

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,160
-Here.
-I can't see any bread.

283
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,480
Just boobs.

284
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,000
What business are we talking about?

285
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,559
I'm applying for the
Subdistrict Administration Organization.

286
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,160
To be honest.

287
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,160
You have the people’s hearts
and I have these things.

288
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,240
You want me to be a canvasser.

289
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,079
Attracting the locals, right?

290
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,240
Good that you understand things easily.

291
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,160
It's not that easy, because money...

292
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
cannot buy me.

293
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,400
I didn't mean that, Master.

294
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
You said the right thing.

295
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,400
Money can’t buy me

296
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,000
If it's not enough.

297
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,359
I'd give you an amulet
but your boobs will weaken its power.

298
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,000
You're saying that

299
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,119
the reason that people
don't come to the temple

300
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,240
is because they believe in
silly things, right?

301
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,480
Something like that.

302
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,720
Many monks cannot stay here.

303
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,559
You move.

304
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
Hey.

305
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,960
It's hard to change old people.
I understand.

306
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
But we have to persuade people

307
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,559
towards the right direction.

308
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,960
I think you'll have to
use a lot of effort.

309
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Or...

310
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,440
Or what?

311
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,079
-Wait for a miracle.
-Miracle!

312
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,799
Go to sleep before miracles happen.

313
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
Hey.

314
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
Tell the parents tomorrow.

315
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,480
They have to come to study.

316
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,559
And be in our care.

317
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,039
-Yes.
-Hey.

318
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,079
Wake him up so he can sleep properly.
I'm going to bed.

319
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Weirdo. Go to bed.
He's going to sleep.

320
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,559
Hurry.

321
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,960
He's been here for a while.
Hasn't he got some sleep?

322
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,599
So funny. Just go.

323
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,559
Have fun with me downstairs.

324
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,240
Take a shit with me. I need to shit.

325
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
-Do you think I can be a president?
-If you can, so what?

326
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,200
You have to try to choose me.

327
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,160
I don't have an ID card.

328
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,200
No ID card.

329
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,920
Weirdo. Come in with me.

330
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,839
No.

331
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,279
-Please.
-No.

332
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,440
Please.
I'll choose you to be president.

333
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,599
-Fine.
-Close it.

334
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,319
It's not stinky.
You're just not used to it.

335
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,880
-Go!
-Don't drive me off.

336
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,119
Go to hell.

337
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,880
Liang!

338
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,160
What?

339
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,359
What is it?

340
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,559
Pong cursed me to death.

341
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,559
Why curse him, Prompong?

342
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,200
And he's selling me a coffin.

343
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,920
Liang. I'll give you a coffin for free.

344
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,599
Good. Give it to me too.
I like free stuff.

345
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,319
Go to hell. I'll punish you.

346
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,559
Brother.

347
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,519
I don't think you should
ask for alms yet.

348
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,400
Yes. No one offers food to a monk.

349
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,039
People don't know
there's a new monk yet.

350
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,279
To ask for alms

351
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,240
is a monk's duty.

352
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,400
Yes, sir.

353
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,599
Let's go.

354
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,559
Mana.

355
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,759
Very good.

356
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,400
Honey, did you prepare the food?

357
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,799
I'll offer food to a monk.

358
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,680
Today is Saturday.

359
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
Get the rice in the bag.

360
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,839
Get everything in the bag.

361
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,599
It takes you so long to get home.

362
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,680
You are very drunk.

363
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,559
If you didn't have ears,
you would be an eel.

364
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,680
-Did the monk come?
-No.

365
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,240
How did I love him?

366
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,680
-Did he come?
-No.

367
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,079
Are you all right? Need anything else?

368
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,799
If you said no,

369
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,200
then what's standing right here?

370
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,079
Please, sir.

371
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
I want to do a good deed.

372
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,079
Aren't you Thai?

373
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,279
Why don't you offer food to a monk?

374
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,640
You act like this in this life,

375
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,039
what will your next life be like?

376
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,359
You don't do good deeds.

377
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
I'll kick my wife to show you.

378
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,839
Do you want to see?

379
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,240
I'll kick my wife to show you.

380
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,960
-Invite the monk for me.
-You don't make a merit.

381
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,119
It's not good.

382
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,519
Making merit is not good?

383
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
I'll take one.

384
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,559
Sure.

385
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,480
May you be blessed.

386
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,119
Please, sir.

387
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:16,640
Weirdo.

388
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,279
Mana.

389
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,680
May you be blessed.

390
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,240
Paniang. Let's go home.

391
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,599
Brother!

392
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
-Brother!
-What is it?

393
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,039
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

394
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,079
Brother, they are

395
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,559
gathering here again.

396
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,640
Do you want to study?

397
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,599
-Yes!
-Yes!

398
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,119
Where's Song?

399
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,480
Get Song here, Weirdo.
Ah, Mana.

400
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,759
Don't yell like crazy.

401
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,359
Yes. I'll go.

402
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Song! Song!

403
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
-Hey!
-Hey!

404
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,400
What are you doing here?

405
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,359
-Why are you here?
-Why are you there?

406
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,039
I'm thinking.

407
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,319
Do you know who I am?

408
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,559
Uncle!

409
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,680
I don't understand.

410
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,680
You must look like a clown.

411
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,920
So he doesn't remember.

412
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,519
He may not know where his house is.

413
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,960
You...

414
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,960
find a place to teach the children.

415
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,559
Help me with this.

416
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,799
No problem. Right, Liang?

417
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,359
Stupid!

418
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,519
What problem?

419
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,319
Where did you get all this?

420
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,599
I helped the children's parents.

421
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
And...

422
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,759
-What?
-Nothing.

423
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,240
They are very happy

424
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,559
that their children are here with you.

425
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,680
They are very generous.

426
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,599
We helped

427
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,640
-and got all of this.
-What is it?

428
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,240
They don't offer food to a monk.

429
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,960
But very generous

430
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,200
to give all this stuff to the children.

431
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,279
-Yes, Brother.
-It's good.

432
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,200
Yes.

433
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
Thank you very much...

434
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,519
-My pleasure.
-...for helping me.

435
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,359
Excuse me.

436
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,880
You...

437
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,359
pack it up.

438
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,480
Mana.

439
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,200
My pleasure, Brother.

440
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,640
You walk strangely.

441
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,920
What is it?

442
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Lying is bad.

443
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,400
What are you saying?

444
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,440
I know lying is bad.

445
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,279
But I do this with good intentions.

446
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,480
Where will you take all this?

447
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
To offer food to a monk.

448
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,759
To a monk?

449
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,839
-What's wrong with my ears?
-There's a new monk. Will you go?

450
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,640
I raised you since you were a baby.

451
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,759
You never made me a meal.

452
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,920
Don't you want to be a good daughter?

453
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,720
We did many bad things.

454
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,839
Better make a merit.

455
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,920
I don't want to go to heaven now.

456
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm afraid of heights.

457
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,039
We should test our new monk.

458
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,640
It's a good thing.

459
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Sacrificing your time to help society.

460
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,200
How can I help you with applying?

461
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,599
I want to get number nine.

462
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,640
I don't want number 13. It's bad luck.

463
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,759
How is 13 worse than nine?

464
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,400
I don't understand. Can you prove it?

465
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Many hotels don't have room number 13
or a 13th floor.

466
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,000
It cannot be proved.

467
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,680
If it cannot be proved,
why do you believe it?

468
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,119
Do not believe it at all.

469
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,400
What if someone gives you money?

470
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,160
One gives you nine million.

471
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,599
The other gives you 13 million.

472
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,200
-Which do you choose?
-Thirteen million.

473
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,519
Aren't you afraid of bad luck?

474
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,759
-Go.
-Clear!

475
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,279
Didn't you preach to him?

476
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,920
I'm done.

477
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,880
Done? It's not the same as on TV.

478
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,559
-How's that?
-When they finish singing,

479
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,160
“More, more! One more song!”

480
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,920
There's no "More preaching!"

481
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,920
More. Again!

482
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,200
-What do you want me to do?
-Easy.

483
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,920
You get long hair like
those famous singers.

484
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,799
Brother, more! Give me your right hand.

485
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,119
Weirdo.

486
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,680
You should be...

487
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,079
Kicked.

488
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,279
He asked for a right hand.

489
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,160
So I gave him a right foot.

490
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,960
You're crazy.
Asking a monk to have long hair.

491
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,799
Help! They're fighting.

492
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,519
Hey.

493
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,320
What do we do?

494
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,400
Stupid! Go on with it.

495
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,679
The police are here!

496
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,079
Come on! The police are coming.

497
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,639
Let's talk.

498
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,960
Only one scene and you are here.

499
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,760
-I'm broke.
-Yeah?

500
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,960
They broke your nose.

501
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
-Are they gone?
-Yes.

502
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,119
-I'm okay.
-Enough.

503
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,920
What are you doing? Help.

504
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,440
Don't do it.

505
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,800
You committed a sin. You lied.

506
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,760
It would be more of a sin

507
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,079
-if you let them beat him.
-What's that?

508
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,119
-What?
-What's more,

509
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,920
this is a monk, not a municipality.

510
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,199
-Don't jump.
-Don't jump.

511
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,679
-Do not jump.
-Dad, don't jump.

512
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,840
What's wrong?

513
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,679
My husband is about to kill himself.

514
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,400
Please stop him.

515
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Please help my dad.

516
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,119
When there's a good thing,
never tell me.

517
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,519
Always tell me when things are bad.

518
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,159
Let me help.
Because I can always help you.

519
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,840
Hey!

520
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,960
The monk is here.

521
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,320
Do you hear me? The monk is here.

522
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,760
Why do you want to jump?

523
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,079
Do you see him as orange juice?

524
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,360
No? You must see him as a banana.

525
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,639
-Get down. Why do you want to jump?
-I won't.

526
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,119
I'm broke.

527
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,719
They say Liverpool is the best.

528
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,079
But it's not. I have nothing left.

529
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,719
I want to die.

530
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,280
Are you sure that you have nothing left?

531
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,639
Yes, I'm broke.

532
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,119
All gone. Nothing left. I want to die.

533
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,199
I want to die!

534
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,159
What did you have when you were born?

535
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,400
-Nothing.
-What about now?

536
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
You have a house.

537
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,519
Your mom, daughter, and wife.

538
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,760
And you say you have nothing.

539
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,119
Liverpool did this to me.

540
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,320
-I want to die.
-Fine!

541
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,039
If you want to die, just jump.

542
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,679
Good.

543
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
Your wife is still young.

544
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,679
She can find a new husband
who's better than you.

545
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,320
Think wisely.

546
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,559
You earn some money
and put it on Liverpool.

547
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,320
Everything is Liverpool.

548
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,599
Why don't you think about Arsenal?

549
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,719
Your daughter is growing up.

550
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,320
Think about her. How can she live?

551
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,559
Dad's dead.

552
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,880
Mom has a new boyfriend.

553
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,199
Hey!

554
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,000
Shit.

555
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,519
And if you don't die?

556
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,679
Handicapped for sure.

557
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,960
Maybe paralyzed.

558
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,719
Enough! Stop.

559
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,039
You don't have to say more.

560
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,239
I won't jump.

561
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,760
You two!

562
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,960
You two

563
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,800
are having bad luck.

564
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,840
You have to exorcise.

565
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,760
Hey. We're having bad luck.

566
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,280
How can it be?

567
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,119
I just won a lottery.

568
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,280
-Right.
-Right.

569
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,280
-Nonsense. Let's go back.
-Let's go.

570
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,719
-How can I have bad luck?
-I can't have bad luck.

571
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,639
Crazy.

572
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,320
There are few people these days.

573
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,440
These two just stir it up.

574
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Wanting to have bad luck?

575
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,840
Please.

576
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,840
Pattana is here.

577
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,840
Clear!

578
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,760
Come apologize tomorrow.

579
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,360
-Yes.
-I'll help you first.

580
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,599
-Yes.
-Just go.

581
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,960
Let's go.

582
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,519
If you want anyone to have bad luck,

583
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,559
I'll arrange it.

584
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,639
What are you laughing at?
Let me join you.

585
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:08,880
Go!

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
It's not good, Weirdo.

587
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
Hello.

588
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,960
We need to talk.

589
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,400
I want you to control him.

590
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,920
Stop the trouble at the hermitage.

591
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,039
I didn't think I would see you here.

592
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,039
I didn't expect

593
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,440
to find Tuam and Prik's son
in the yellow robe.

594
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
You too.

595
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,280
You still have the job of lying to people.

596
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,039
This is not a threat.

597
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,719
Do you want to die?

598
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,639
To die is an eternal truth.

599
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,679
Die first to be a senior ghost.

600
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
Die later to be a junior ghost.

601
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,320
I'll see you at the welcoming ceremony.

602
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,599
It'll be fun.

603
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,760
Well said.

604
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,079
If this wasn't a temple,
I'd have him shoot you.

605
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,639
People here would like to know

606
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,679
this man before he became a monk.

607
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
What has this monk

608
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,320
ever done?

609
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,559
Do you want a kick?

610
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,639
Hey!

611
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,199
Here!

612
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,559
Hey!

613
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,400
We're in trouble.

614
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,440
My amulet.

615
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,079
I got it!

616
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,960
A frog! I thought I had it.

617
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,360
What will happen to
the people who believe him?

618
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,239
Will the spirit be angry?

619
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:15,880
Absolutely.

620
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:19,840
These poor people

621
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,760
have bad luck without knowing.

622
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,360
Yes.

623
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,559
Everyone here

624
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,719
will have bad luck.

625
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,079
How can you come up

626
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,760
with the junior ghost?

627
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,159
Let's go.

628
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,800
We will have bad luck.

629
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,320
Let's go.

630
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,880
Let's go home.

631
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,519
Go back home.

632
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,239
It's not true.
Why do you make that up?

633
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,440
To turn crisis into opportunity.

634
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,400
They're frustrating father.

635
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,360
-I'm not in the mood.
-Hey!

636
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,639
Don't overthink it.

637
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,800
Look at the people
who respect the spirit.

638
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,239
They come here with hope.

639
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,360
But I won't say
anything about the monk.

640
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,800
Up to you.

641
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,039
Do as you think proper.

642
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,440
Chess!

643
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,280
It's okay. You stay in the car.

644
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,000
Do you want to study at the temple?

645
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,800
Do you want to go with me?

646
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,159
Or are you busy?

647
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,079
Or free?

648
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:06,079
Mr. Liang, where are you going?

649
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,039
Do you want to go to
the hermitage to exorcise?

650
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:10,400
Let me see.

651
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,960
Your face looks dark
like a burned coconut.

652
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,719
Isn't it?

653
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,519
-See?
-Som.

654
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,880
Look at yourself.
You almost have no shadow.

655
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,960
I'm dead!

656
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,239
Not yet.

657
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,480
But you will be
if you don't stop talking.

658
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,400
It's annoying! Go.

659
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,079
I just try to be good.

660
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,119
Annoying!

661
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,239
What are you doing?

662
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,039
Where are you going?

663
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,119
Stupid!

664
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,239
People who don't believe in bad luck
are like a dog with no fear of hot water.

665
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,719
Oh, shit!

666
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,119
Seng! How's my table?

667
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,920
Why don't you worry about me,
not the table?

668
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,920
Fix it for me. It's falling.

669
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,840
-You...
-Wait.

670
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,960
Let me ask you something.

671
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,400
They say that our homes

672
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,360
have bad luck. Do you believe that?

673
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,480
Stupid! Sorry, Seng.

674
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,280
I don't know about others.
All I know is

675
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,760
when Liang is back,
he will have bad luck.

676
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,280
But I don't believe in bad luck.

677
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,840
Bad luck is caused by action.

678
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,280
Do good deeds and you get good deeds.

679
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,239
I believe that.

680
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,679
It's like if we plant Durian trees,

681
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,519
we'll get Durian in return.

682
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,880
If we grow jackfruit, we'll get jackfruit.

683
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,440
Brother.

684
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,119
We grow green beans,
why do we get sprouts?

685
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,119
-Hey!
-I'm watching drama.

686
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,079
I'm watching football.

687
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,360
-I'm watching drama.
-Muay Lek.

688
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,400
You have to go school. Go to bed.

689
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,760
No!

690
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,679
-Go to bed.
-No.

691
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,920
It's not clear. Boring.

692
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:30,039
-I'm bored too.
-Go to bed.

693
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,960
-Muay, take the milk.
-No.

694
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:34,719
Look at her.

695
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,440
Just like her mother.

696
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,159
It's a draw for Liverpool.

697
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,920
Are you addicted to it?

698
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,239
What are you saying? I'm not.

699
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,519
I've watched it for 20 years.

700
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,880
Never miss a single match.

701
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,880
Twenty years.

702
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,559
So do you know

703
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,239
why the football field

704
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,280
isn't a circle?

705
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,320
If it's circle,
how can they do corner kicks?

706
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,360
Do you want to be kicked?

707
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,400
It's blurred again.

708
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,119
You see for me.
I'll adjust the wire up there.

709
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,599
Let me know.

710
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:30,559
How is it?

711
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,880
Slowly.

712
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,159
They're taking the penalty kick.

713
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,880
Who's shooting?

714
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,079
I don't know.

715
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,079
Who?

716
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Seng!

717
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,320
Seng, what's wrong?

718
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,719
Hong.

719
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,239
Hong. Wake up.

720
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,800
-What?
-Hong.

721
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,920
Wake up.

722
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,519
-Who's daring to wake me up?
-It's me.

723
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,719
Muek.

724
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,079
I have good news for you.

725
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:15,280
I think you are good. So I will tell you.

726
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,760
-Do you know?
-Tell me.

727
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,559
The spirit

728
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,719
said that anyone
who has "s" in their name

729
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,039
will have bad luck. A big one.

730
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,239
Do you believe it?

731
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:35,280
I do.

732
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

733
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,000
I have "s" in my name. I believe it.

734
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,760
I do too.

735
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,159
I do.

736
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,239
Seng Saraphee.

737
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,559
I have "s" in my name.

738
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,800
Shit!

739
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:55,000
Why "s"?

740
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,840
Simple.

741
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,440
Hang a banana in front of your house.

742
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,840
And put a sign saying
"There's no "s" here".

743
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,000
How many bananas, sir?

744
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,840
Just one.

745
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:13,800
I think the more the better.

746
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,480
Who is she?

747
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,079
My wife.

748
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,559
She will have bad luck
because of her mouth.

749
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,000
Tell your wife.

750
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,519
Do you want to die
because of your mouth?

751
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,880
Do you believe? Just one banana

752
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,480
can repel bad luck.

753
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:36,880
Are you whispering?

754
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,719
If you don't believe it,

755
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,079
then get out.

756
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:43,119
Who dares not to believe me?

757
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,519
Where are you going?

758
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,960
The spirit will be mad.

759
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,880
You stay.

760
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,519
You!

761
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,840
You stay here.

762
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:57,159
Old man!

763
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,159
You disrespect me!

764
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,519
The spirit is gone.

765
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,239
Who believes his word?

766
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,599
You can buy bananas
at the supermarket downstairs.

767
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,039
How much?

768
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,800
Buy ten, get one free. Only 69 Baht.

769
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,119
Only here. Come in.

770
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:26,000
THERE’S NO “S” HERE
SOM

771
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,960
What's this, Som?

772
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,280
Don't take it off.

773
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,239
The spirit told me to do it.

774
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,639
Are you trying to repel bad luck

775
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,440
or calling for it?

776
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,239
There's no "s" here.

777
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,559
And you write "Som".

778
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,920
Why are you writing your name?

779
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,239
You foolish wife. I need a drink.

780
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:06,800
You bastard!

781
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:09,719
If I'm smart, you still drink.

782
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,679
Boring! I'll play some cards.

783
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,280
Not good.

784
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:28,039
What?

785
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,400
I can fight.

786
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Som!

787
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,440
Open the door for me.

788
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,000
I'll go to bed.

789
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:46,559
Som!

790
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,719
Open the door.

791
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,480
-Me again?
-Just go.

792
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,800
May you be blessed.

793
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,400
Do you have something on your mind?

794
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,119
Do you know about your friend?

795
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,079
Your two drinking friends
have been beaten up.

796
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,119
Saraphee and Sornrapong.

797
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,960
Two of them got beaten up.

798
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,000
It doesn't end well.

799
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,800
-Beaten up?
-Yes.

800
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,239
Who did that to my friend?

801
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,519
Nothing is impossible.

802
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,519
People are believing that
anyone with "s" will have bad luck.

803
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,960
Look at those two drunk guys last night.

804
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,519
What will happen

805
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,920
if the people in the temple
and Song get it too?

806
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,440
Master.

807
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,239
Yes. What?

808
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,039
My mother had to die when grandmother...

809
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,760
Hey!

810
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,840
-Who are you?
-Thieves.

811
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,639
-We are robbing you.
-Robbing? Come on then.

812
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:18,679
I'm a ghost.

813
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,679
Are you afraid?

814
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,760
A ghost. I'm scared. Stay away.

815
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,840
Hey!

816
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,000
You said he was alone.

817
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,320
A good man is protected by a ghost.

818
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:31,559
A ghost!

819
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:35,599
Go.

820
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:37,039
Why are they running?

821
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,880
Shit!

822
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,880
It can't get in.

823
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,800
It can.

824
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,519
But it's upside down.

825
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,920
Stupid!

826
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,960
Walk by yourself.

827
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,760
I won't carry you.

828
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:05,639
Stop arguing.
We can get in right there.

829
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:08,000
What's that?

830
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,519
Let's go.

831
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,840
Shit!

832
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:13,239
Wait for me.

833
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:18,480
It's too small. Who can get in?

834
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,639
What?

835
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:26,519
Where are my shoes?

836
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,199
Where are you going?

837
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,840
Hey!

838
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,599
-Wow.
-A lot of them.

839
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:39,079
It's like a shop.

840
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,599
-I go first.
-What?

841
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,679
What's this? Hey!

842
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,239
Hurry.

843
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,440
Hurry!

844
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,840
Get down.

845
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,599
How are you doing, sister?

846
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,280
Do you like it? I'm a responsible man,

847
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:45,880
but I have to work.

848
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,920
Help! Brother, help me.

849
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,920
Brother! Brother!

850
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,079
Brother! Are you sleeping?

851
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,199
Brother!

852
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,400
-You scared me.
-Open the door please.

853
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,440
What's happened?

854
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:19,039
You seem afraid. What did you do?

855
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,440
Hey!

856
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:24,559
Hey!

857
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:27,440
What is it, Song?

858
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,480
Close the door. Hurry.

859
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,880
Tell me, what are you running from?

860
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:47,440
Ghost. A ghost.

861
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,880
Song.

862
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,880
You are old.
You shouldn't fall for silly things.

863
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,119
Ghosts don't exist.

864
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,519
If it does, it can't beat you.

865
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,280
Because you have muscle.

866
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,960
Ghosts don't have muscle.

867
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,920
You can eat, they can't.

868
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,039
They can't beat you.

869
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,840
-You should sleep in Weirdo's room.
-No, Brother.

870
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,960
He's scarier than a ghost.
Can I sleep here?

871
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,000
This is my place.

872
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:19,599
You sleep here.

873
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:22,000
-Yes.
-You tear off my net.

874
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,239
Close the window.

875
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,000
-It's windy.
-Close the window.

876
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,719
What are you so afraid of?

877
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,360
You are crazy.

878
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:05,719
Shit!

879
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,519
Many people here
were at the market

880
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,119
the day the monk
persuaded Seng to jump off.

881
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,760
PLEASE VOTE FOR
PATTANA RAENGSONGTHAM (TUI)

882
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,679
Right! He had an "s" in his name.

883
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,199
But he didn't believe the spirit.

884
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:23,679
Seng had to die.

885
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:25,760
Everybody,

886
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,119
do we respect the spirit?

887
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,039
-Yes.
-Believe in him.

888
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:35,440
We love the spirit. We trust him.

889
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:36,679
We love him.

890
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,599
I love and respect him too.

891
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,960
No less than anybody else.

892
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:44,719
Beside the spirit,

893
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,559
I also respect Master Phoem.

894
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,800
A thing like this

895
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,599
is called,

896
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,360
Claw me

897
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,199
and I'll claw thee.

898
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,400
Why do you have to frame the monk?

899
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,400
Frame? It's called

900
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:16,880
a scapegoat.

901
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,039
Isn't it working?

902
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:24,639
I'll talk to them.

903
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,360
You!

904
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,719
Who would believe you?

905
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,119
Do you forget that I'm a medium?

906
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,320
The spirit's agent.

907
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,239
If you want to destroy
everything I've built

908
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,119
then get out!

909
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,440
But I want you to know one thing.

910
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,199
Everything I did,

911
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,880
I did it for you.

912
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,960
I'm Pattana.

913
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:05,440
I'll serve all of you.

914
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,079
-Snack.
-Snack, here.

915
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,400
Mana, I'm hungry.

916
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:21,800
Want me to help?

917
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,559
Mana, I'm hungry.

918
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,440
With regret--

919
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,280
With pleasure.

920
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:46,840
Why are you in a hurry?
Where are you going?

921
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:48,559
To the temple.

922
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,599
Will you make a merit?

923
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:53,320
You will not get one.

924
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,800
Muek told me
Paniang is at the temple.

925
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,039
Temple? Why?

926
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,239
She's not going to be a nun.

927
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:02,880
Want to know?

928
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,920
-Come with me.
-Easy.

929
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,159
A smart person should use his brain,
not his force.

930
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,960
Let me help.

931
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,840
I guarantee that your daughter

932
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,559
won't go there ever again.

933
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,400
T for tiger.

934
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,239
B for box.

935
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,760
K for Kite.

936
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,119
B for Bowl.

937
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,920
-O for own.
-O for owl.

938
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,960
Okay. That's it for today.

939
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,480
Will you be back tomorrow?

940
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,559
Of course. She'll come.

941
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,519
Is that right, teacher?

942
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,159
-Of course.
-Attention!

943
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you, teacher.

944
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,000
Thank you.

945
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:00,159
Slowly.

946
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,960
Since you've been teaching the children,
they are having a lot of fun.

947
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,599
Thank you very much.

948
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,480
She's no beauty pageant
but she loves children.

949
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,400
I feel at least
it can ease what I have done.

950
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,280
Brother.

951
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,039
I would like to ask

952
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:31,760
if I can dismiss her?

953
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,800
-Sure.
-Really?

954
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,320
-Thank you, Brother.
-Easy, Weirdo. Ah, Mana.

955
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:42,199
I'm not milk. Do not shake me.

956
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,679
Send her home.

957
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,599
Yes, sir.

958
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,880
Hello.

959
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:01,159
-Hello.
-I'm Sayan's parent.

960
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,400
Thank you for taking care of him.

961
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,119
So he will not study here anymore?

962
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,840
I ate already, sir.

963
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,360
So he will not study here anymore?

964
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:21,440
Talk properly.

965
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,400
So he will not study here anymore?

966
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,400
No. He has to go to
hospital in Bangkok.

967
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,840
You should too.

968
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,440
Good luck then.

969
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,239
I'll get the car.

970
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,960
You don't have to dismiss us.
Sayan. Let's go.

971
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:45,880
Good luck.

972
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:49,280
Nothing.

973
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,039
Let's go.

974
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:58,280
I feel relaxed with the children.

975
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,920
Mana is not a beauty pageant.
I don't like children.

976
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:04,880
But if you like them, I'll like them too.

977
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,920
It seems like you don't want to go back.

978
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:11,559
Do you want to sit?

979
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,360
Why do you go to the hermitage?

980
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:24,039
When you're there, you get hurt.

981
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,920
Because...

982
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,320
I love someone there.

983
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,599
I don't care if I'm hurt. But...

984
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:37,559
she doesn't know.

985
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:41,400
Love her more.

986
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,199
If she knows, she'll love you back.

987
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,800
Really?

988
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:52,599
Really.

989
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,800
Do you travel a lot?
I've been everywhere.

990
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,480
North. I've been there.

991
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,880
South. I've been there. East.

992
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:25,880
I've been there. Everywhere.

993
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,639
I've been there.

994
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,199
You have to do a lot of good deeds

995
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,800
so you can go to heaven.

996
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,039
We should go back.

997
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,760
Let's go!

998
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,639
How can it be this bad?

999
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,239
Hey!

1000
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:27,280
I'm broke.

1001
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,360
-Only three Baht left.
-Want to do it again?

1002
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,440
Mr. Pattana will arrange it.

1003
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:38,079
But you will give something in return.

1004
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:42,559
Okay?

1005
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,079
Liar goes to hell.

1006
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,360
You scared me.

1007
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,960
It's Mana.

1008
01:07:59,079 --> 01:07:59,920
Hey.

1009
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,760
Song. Do you know

1010
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,239
why mosquitos like to
fly around the ears?

1011
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,280
-Ears have holes.
-Wrong.

1012
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,079
Actually, it flies all over our bodies.

1013
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,199
But you cannot hear.

1014
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:20,960
Hey.

1015
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:23,199
But I can hear everything,

1016
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,000
know and see everything.

1017
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,720
But I say nothing.

1018
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,159
-I don't want them to fly around my ears.
-You asshole!

1019
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,840
Hey.

1020
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,880
I'm not stupid.

1021
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,800
I'm crazy but not stupid.

1022
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:43,880
Right, Tick?

1023
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,479
Where are you rushing to, Song?

1024
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,079
Driving so fast.

1025
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,439
To do some business.

1026
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,680
Wow. You must have a lot to do.

1027
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,119
I told Weirdo to help you.

1028
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,000
Huh!

1029
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,640
How can he help me?

1030
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,720
There's only Paniang who can teach.

1031
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,600
I haven't seen him yet.

1032
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,600
-Just go.
-I will hurry back.

1033
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,359
-Hello.
-Hello.

1034
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:17,239
I want you to repel all the bad things.

1035
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,359
Please. Help me.

1036
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,800
Please.

1037
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:40,600
Please, Brother.

1038
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,239
Let's see with our own eyes.

1039
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,680
Let's see.

1040
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,680
Are you here for your daughter?

1041
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,840
I come here for my hermitage girl.

1042
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,640
-Muek.
-Yes?

1043
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,079
She said she's here.

1044
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,439
Father.

1045
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:36,439
She's in the monk's house.

1046
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,359
-I told you.
-Why's she in there?

1047
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,960
You act like this.

1048
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,119
You should be a monk in Pattani.

1049
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:13,479
Don't worry. We cannot hide.

1050
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,439
Finally, everybody knows.

1051
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,279
Disgusting!

1052
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,880
-I won't come here anymore.
-I won't respect him.

1053
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,600
I won't offer food.

1054
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,439
I'll take all the money to the hermitage.

1055
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,119
He never gave us numbers
for the lottery.

1056
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,159
Really bad.

1057
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,079
Anybody who knows would be afraid to come.

1058
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,800
-Get out of here.
-You don't regret it.

1059
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,319
I can explain this.

1060
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,359
-Look at him.
-Making excuses.

1061
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,560
-Pervert.
-We see with our eyes.

1062
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,119
Everyone sees it.
Do you want to make an excuse?

1063
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,239
Get out of the temple.
Get out of here.

1064
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,359
-It'd be better.
-You should be...

1065
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:58,560
Clear!

1066
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,159
-Get out!
-Get out!

1067
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:08,079
Paniang.

1068
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:10,840
-Get out!
-Get out!

1069
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:16,600
Quiet. He's not a monk anymore.

1070
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,239
He should leave.
Take off the yellow robe.

1071
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,239
-Get out!
-Leave.

1072
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,039
-Go!
-Get out!

1073
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:31,800
-Get out of here.
-Right!

1074
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,520
What's going on?

1075
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,079
Why?

1076
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,079
Did he shit in your cupboard?

1077
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,359
Your brother took her in his house.

1078
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,479
How could it be, father?

1079
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,640
-Everybody saw.
-With our own eyes.

1080
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:58,319
Get out of here.
Maybe the rain will fall.

1081
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,359
-Go!
-Get out!

1082
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:06,640
-Get out!
-Leave.

1083
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,880
Okay. If it make everyone happy,

1084
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:16,479
I'll leave.

1085
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,119
It should be like that.

1086
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:22,520
Ashamed, aren't you?

1087
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,119
You lied.

1088
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,520
-Go.
-Get out.

1089
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,159
Get out. Go!

1090
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,279
Go!

1091
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:52,159
Get the hell out.

1092
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,359
-Go.
-Go now.

1093
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:00,239
-Who did you drive away?
-Stupid!

1094
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,000
-Your brother.
-Stop making merit.

1095
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,640
I feel ashamed.

1096
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:09,159
-He was with a woman.
-I gave him a lot of money.

1097
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,840
All of you believe the spirit.

1098
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,920
Ask him!

1099
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,239
Ask him the truth.

1100
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,279
I know. I believe the spirit.

1101
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:21,600
I asked where he was,
he said, "At the club".

1102
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,760
Go!

1103
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,000
Right.

1104
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:26,960
He knows the truth.

1105
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,319
The spirit will tell the truth.
Let's meet at the hermitage.

1106
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,039
Of course. We'll see.

1107
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,279
Why are you keep drinking?

1108
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:50,159
-Drunk like a dog.
-So you admit to having dog as a husband.

1109
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,920
-Give me your money.
-I won't.

1110
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,359
I haven't paid for Teng's tuition fee.

1111
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,119
-He might not get to study.
-I didn't study, I can survive.

1112
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,399
You want him to be stupid as you!

1113
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:13,439
What are you yapping about, Mom?

1114
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,039
Yapping till father died.

1115
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,000
Your father died because of alcohol.

1116
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:21,479
You will too.

1117
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:25,680
Good. Just die. I'll be fine.

1118
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,920
Where are you going?

1119
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,279
To drink with my friends.

1120
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,079
Don't get into a fight.

1121
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:36,720
I know. You say that every day.

1122
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:38,880
You still do it every day!

1123
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,399
Get a haircut. It's too long.

1124
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:42,720
It will be short then.

1125
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,640
This son...

1126
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:51,079
-Teng.
-Mom.

1127
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,119
Are you hungry? Here, fried rice.
Have some.

1128
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,000
You don't have to.

1129
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,880
How are you?

1130
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:18,800
I'm fine seeing you in jail.

1131
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,199
I was going to bring you alcohol.

1132
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,079
But I respect the police.

1133
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:29,520
Be good in there.
Don't let them kick you out.

1134
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,239
You're being sarcastic.

1135
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:44,119
I talked to the village leader.

1136
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,680
He promised to bail you out.

1137
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,800
But I think

1138
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:57,840
you have to stay in jail.

1139
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:03,439
Remember.

1140
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:06,119
A gangster's life

1141
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:08,720
only ends with death,

1142
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:11,960
or jail, like you have now.

1143
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,399
I was in the wrong direction
but I improved myself.

1144
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,319
I have a lot of money for you.

1145
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,840
Just do not stay
in the temple, will you?

1146
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,680
Hell is waiting for you.

1147
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,399
Why do you say that?

1148
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:02,720
You never make merit.
All you did is sin.

1149
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05,920
You expel a good monk.

1150
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:10,359
Everybody saw

1151
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,119
that monk with a woman.

1152
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes. I saw that too.

1153
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,680
With my own eyes.

1154
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,560
That's right.

1155
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,960
You saw it.

1156
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,439
I saw it.
The monk is with my woman.

1157
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:33,319
Why do you say confusing things?

1158
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,079
The monk was being framed.

1159
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,680
Bullshit! There's no spirit.

1160
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,439
They lied to us.

1161
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,279
Shit.

1162
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:48,720
They're escaping.

1163
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:50,159
Hurry.

1164
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,920
HERMITAGE

1165
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,880
Everyone!

1166
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,840
Listen!

1167
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:21,439
If you choose me,

1168
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,439
there won't be bad people like this.

1169
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:27,720
We'll punish them.

1170
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,600
-Yes.
-Hey!

1171
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:34,920
-Hurry. Let's go.
-Good that I wore shorts today.

1172
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,880
Hurry. They're following us.

1173
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,680
There!

1174
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,399
-Hurry. Paniang
-Why are you following me?

1175
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,239
Hurry.

1176
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:48,960
Hey!

1177
01:20:55,319 --> 01:21:00,119
What a mess! It's a mess.
What happened?

1178
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,880
It's gone.

1179
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,520
What happened?

1180
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,560
Help!

1181
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,279
What happened?

1182
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,079
Brother.
Phoem and Paniang are in trouble.

1183
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:22,039
Where are they?

1184
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:28,119
Do not run.

1185
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:29,640
Don't run.

1186
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,800
Don't run.

1187
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,800
You won't get away.

1188
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,239
What should we do, father?

1189
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:47,479
Just call the police.

1190
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,960
Why police?

1191
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,000
They didn't get fooled.
We are being lied to.

1192
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,119
-I bought so many bananas.
-Right.

1193
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,720
-Do it now!
-Hey! Stop.

1194
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,600
-We have laws.
-Yes.

1195
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:04,239
You fooled us.
It's against the law.

1196
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,000
-Right!
-Hey!

1197
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:08,600
Prison is not for dogs.

1198
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:10,399
He called us a dog.

1199
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,039
Father!

1200
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:26,319
Father.

1201
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:34,199
Paniang!

1202
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,399
Weirdo!

1203
01:22:42,039 --> 01:22:43,399
He can't swim.

1204
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:45,079
Neither can I.

1205
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,119
Weirdo!

1206
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:51,359
Weirdo!

1207
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:02,000
Brother. Help.

1208
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:04,399
-Brother.
-He's gone.

1209
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,119
Where is he?

1210
01:23:12,439 --> 01:23:14,039
Where?

1211
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:15,239
Hey.

1212
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:21,000
They're there!

1213
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:28,199
Make way.

1214
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:30,319
Make way for me.

1215
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,760
Weirdo. Hey, Weirdo.

1216
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,239
Weirdo. Where's the Brother?

1217
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:38,880
He's not waking up.
What should we do?

1218
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:41,039
CPR!

1219
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,800
Mouth to mouth.

1220
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:46,279
Hey! With this Weirdo...

1221
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:47,800
I'll do it.

1222
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,359
-He woke up.
-He survived.

1223
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,760
-Father.
-Hooray! He's not dead.

1224
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,880
Phoem. Give me a hand.

1225
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:03,600
-Give me your hands.
-Grab here.

1226
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:06,399
Where's Brother?

1227
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:09,680
-Brother!
-He's pushing me up.

1228
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,079
-Get up here. Brother.
-He's here.

1229
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,640
-Brother!
-Dive and see, Weirdo.

1230
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:16,359
Dive!

1231
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,000
-Where's Brother?
-Brother.

1232
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:21,359
Is he dead?

1233
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:23,039
I can't see him.

1234
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:25,159
Brother.

1235
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,159
Brother.

1236
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:28,960
Hey! That's his robe.

1237
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:31,479
-His robe, there!
-Let's see it.

1238
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,119
Is that Brother?
Somebody dive in and get it.

1239
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,239
He's dead.

1240
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:38,000
Don't curse him.

1241
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:40,239
Song.

1242
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,880
-Song.
-A ghost!

1243
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:47,640
-Song.
-Hey!

1244
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,880
I'm here.

1245
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,000
Brother.

1246
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,720
He's in the water.

1247
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,560
He's still alive.

1248
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:58,680
I'm not a fish.

1249
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,399
Why don't you come over?

1250
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:03,239
-I can't.
-Why not?

1251
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,039
The lower robe is gone.

1252
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,760
Someone get a robe. Get it to him.

1253
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:14,880
Brother. Be careful of the fish.

1254
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:16,279
-It's cold.
-Hurry.

1255
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,039
Get the monk and all the liars!

1256
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:22,960
This place will be better,
and the rain will fall.

1257
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,239
-Right.
-Why do you say that?

1258
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:27,159
-Catch him.
-What?

1259
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:29,399
It will rain this evening.

1260
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:32,560
Rain? What?

1261
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,880
What are you saying?

1262
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,560
You will see this evening.

1263
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,880
-Trust me.
-Fine.

1264
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,159
How can it rain?

1265
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,439
Last chance.

1266
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,439
We'll see this evening.

1267
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,199
He's in church.

1268
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,119
How is it?

1269
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,000
-It's cloudy.
-No, it's not.

1270
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,520
It's dark.

1271
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,920
-Do you want to bet?
-How much?

1272
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:15,800
Brother. What if it doesn’t rain?

1273
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:21,119
Right. It doesn’t look like rain.

1274
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,359
If I say it will rain, then it will.

1275
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:27,800
Monks cannot lie.

1276
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:30,880
Yes, you two

1277
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,159
are too old.

1278
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,399
Just trust the monk.

1279
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,600
Who can we trust?

1280
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,319
One is a fraud.

1281
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:42,119
The other is an expelled monk.

1282
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:43,920
-You're right.
-Yes.

1283
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,079
Trust me. Choose me.

1284
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,079
And I will give you everything.

1285
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:51,920
-Even--
-An asshole like you

1286
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,680
cannot do what you promise.

1287
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:56,880
It's him. He paid me to get to the monk.

1288
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,960
Liar!

1289
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,359
-He's lying.
-Don't trust her.

1290
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:04,760
Don't trust them.

1291
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,119
-Hey!
-She's lying.

1292
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,079
This Pattana paid
the medium to lie to people.

1293
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:13,159
That's right.

1294
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:18,439
You, curly hair. You paid me
to go out of the temple when she came.

1295
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:24,119
-Get out!
-You too.

1296
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:25,399
-Clear!
-Clear!

1297
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:43,560
Brother.

1298
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,039
How did you know it would rain?

1299
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:50,880
I listened to the weather forecast.

1300
01:27:51,159 --> 01:27:52,000
Weather forecast.

1301
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,000
I thought you could make it rain!

1302
01:27:58,199 --> 01:27:59,600
Listened to the weather forecast!

1303
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:33,279
You look happier
since you start making merit.

1304
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,159
The rice is hot. Be careful.

1305
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,720
Thank you.

1306
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:57,880
Wait for me.

1307
01:28:58,239 --> 01:28:59,680
Why don't you help?

1308
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,159
It spilled. How can we eat now?

1309
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,479
It's wet. Will it work?

1310
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,359
It's okay. If it doesn't work,
throw it away. If it works, keep it.

1311
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,439
-No harm.
-Okay.

1312
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,199
It doesn't work.

1313
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,720
It's all wet. How can it work?

1314
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:28,479
You have to try.

1315
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,239
See? It works. Keep it.

1316
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:39,720
This is a director's joke.
We play it for him.

1317
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:43,319
Actually, I don't want to.
Same old joke. Let me try--

1318
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:04,359
