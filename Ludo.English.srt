1
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,240
He's given me permission to go out.

2
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,480
Nobody gave you permission.

3
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes! He has!

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,519
No your father certainly has not!

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
First of all, he is not my father.

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,599
Really?

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,439
Whose father is he then? Mine?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
Anyway, I don't know.
I need to go now.

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,519
Go where?

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,920
I have to go...

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Go where ?

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,879
I told you, I have to
go to the college festival.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't you dare lie!

14
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,400
Why are you talking bullshit?

15
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't lie ! I know
you are going out for a night out...

16
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,159
...dressed like a slut!

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
Don't think I'm stupid.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Ma... don't be so dramatic.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,439
Dramatic? Who is being dramatic?

20
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,640
All those TV soaps have really messed up
your brain !

21
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,359
Messed up ? Yes I'm messed up ! A daughter
like you will drive anyone insane !

22
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,000
Where do you think you are going
dressed like this? Huh!

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
Where are you going for night out?

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,919
Ria! Just try stepping out!

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,840
I swear Ria!
I will break your legs!

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,280
Ria! This is the last time!

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
I will see you!

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,199
I'll never ever let you in again!

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
Rickshaw!

30
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,759
Rickshaw!

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,000
Ria! Don't forget what I told you!

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
Shit!

33
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,039
You left your phone back at home?

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,280
I'm not sure...

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,439
Look again!

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
Do you have Pele's number?

37
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
How will I have it?

38
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,080
Just call Babai!

39
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,439
Uff...

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
Hey! Where are you?

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,879
My balls have grown fungus
waiting for you!

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Hey sexy! Say something!

43
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,599
Hey bro! What's up?

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,319
Bro I am fucking screwed...

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
...I called up Ria,

46
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,280
I said that I am waiting,
and was generally talking...

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,439
...called her sexy and all...

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,599
Told her to stop cock teasing and come...

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Spoke to her for a bit...

50
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,879
Then, you know,
this serious voice answers...

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,600
I will cut your fucking balls off.

52
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
What the fuck man!

53
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,879
You find it funny?

54
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,040
That's why I don't tell you shit!

55
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,199
Stop laughing you fucker!

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,199
Asshole! Fucker hung up!

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,879
All three together?

58
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,240
Who sits where?

59
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,759
First you, then her, tight!

60
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,319
Are you ready?

61
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,040
What's up?

62
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,279
Just hanging.

63
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,480
So tell me...

64
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,680
Hey pass me a smoke.

65
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,160
Uff... What style man!

66
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,680
Motherfucker it is then?

67
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,600
Is this your brother's scooter?

68
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
Just sit here!

69
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,000
What, tell me...

70
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,519
Did he buy this with his bodyrub money?

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,759
Don't you guys know?
His brother is a masseur!

72
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,839
Fuckers, he is not a masseur!

73
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,879
Then what?

74
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
How much was this for?

75
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
50 bucks.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
What bullshit man!
50 bucks for this crap?

77
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,959
Where did those two go?

78
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,040
So? Think you will score tonight?

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
Confidence dude! Whatever you do,
do it with confidence.

80
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,680
And don't fuck this up.
I set this up just for you!

81
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,879
Okay cool! But, where?

82
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,160
In a hotel.

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
In the same room?

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
Full orgy, brother!

85
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
What a shitball show!
You call yourself a manager!

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
Fuck man how was I supposed to know?

87
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,639
Not a cat around.
You call this a show?

88
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
There are more bands than fucking people.

89
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,160
What do you mean? Fuck you!
We need shows!

90
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,759
How the fuck do I know everything?
I am a manager, not a pimp.

91
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,279
Hey you, what
the fuck's going on?

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,439
Yeah? Who the fuck are you?

93
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,240
Don't you see what's going on?
Blind fuck!

94
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,160
Don't touch me!

95
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,519
I'll break your balls motherfucker!
Stop fucking around!

96
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,439
What did you say?

97
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,560
I'll give it to you
real good motherfuckers!

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I'll shove this up your cunt,
you little fuck!

99
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,319
Come alone if you have the balls fucker!

100
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
Babai let's go!

101
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,839
Go, go, go!

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Fuck your mother, fucktard!

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,759
Something,something yes I want
It's something that I want

104
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,040
It's what I see what I say
Yes I chant, I want

105
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,439
The city, the bridge
the corporation, railway station

106
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,000
Crooked words dirt and turds

107
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,879
The buildings they have fangs
They bite at night

108
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,959
I know it's bad to want
But then I'm sunburnt

109
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,040
A little hot juicy 
I want a little pussy

110
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,320
Drool spills from my lips
Dark shadows lurk blood drips

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,159
Hungry for blood restless as fuck
If you can get away, do it, good luck!

112
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,480
The game must be played
It's time that you prayed

113
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,480
You must play the game
You can't stay the same.

114
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,799
Something something yes I want
It's something that I want

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,799
It's everything that I want

116
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,440
A little something that I want

117
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,039
You! Put that down.
Don't drink openly.

118
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,879
We could get into trouble...

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Enjoying the holiday huh?

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Is your daddy wearing the helmet at home?

121
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,679
Sir, please let us go, it's a holiday.

122
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,679
Take out your license!

123
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Sir please, I've left
my license at home...

124
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Then come, let's go the police station!

125
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,519
Sir, please sir, let us go...

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,279
Please sir!

127
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,639
Call the patrol car.

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,519
Sir, we really need to get back home.

129
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,679
But sir, we didn't do anything.
You're harassing us just like that.

130
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
Just like that? Huh!

131
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
Stinking of booze!
'Just like that'!

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,080
Here, dear girl!

133
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,679
Don't be scared!

134
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,120
Let me see your bag!

135
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,279
Pass the bag!

136
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,799
Come on then, get going!

137
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,799
Go home!

138
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,519
Now fuck off!

139
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Go, Fuck off!

140
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,080
They fucked us good, those dumb fucks!

141
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,159
They took the money.

142
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,679
Didn't leave us any cash!

143
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,039
They literally turned us into beggars
fucking shitheads!

144
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm telling you man, let's go back home!

145
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,360
How many times are you going to count?

146
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,480
We are fucking broke.

147
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,360
Oi Payel, come here...

148
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,480
What?

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Just give me your hand...

150
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,720
Why?

151
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,720
You Bitch!

152
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,000
What the fuck!

153
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,639
Crazy!

154
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,759
So, then let's check out the hotel?

155
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,879
Hotel?

156
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,159
Fresh as fuck
Fish fry I want

00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,240
It's not light
But dark I want

And if you can't give me shit
A bomb is what I want

164
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,840
Husband and wife! Really?
Where's your marriage certificate?

165
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,919
We've to tell cops everything.

166
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,120
We have only dormitories.
Will that do?

167
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,240
We don't want any more trouble!

168
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
We've only single beds.

169
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,600
Where have you come from?

170
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,480
Sorry nothing for just one night!
No, we don't want any police problem!

171
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,639
How can we let students stay overnight?
Find some other spot.

172
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,720
Amar Hotel

173
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,519
I hope there are no
identity fuck ups here...

174
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,559
Maybe we should offer more money?

175
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,559
Sir? Do you have any vacancy?

176
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,799
Hello sir!

177
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Sir, can we get a room?

178
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,120
Strange!

179
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,480
Sir?

180
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,639
What a fucking hotel!
We just got in and the power's gone?

181
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,360
Weirdo!

182
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,440
What a dick, shining his torch
on our faces like that!

183
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,919
Where do you think that fucker went?

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,039
Just wait!

185
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,440
He asked us to wait.

186
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,879
Now what?

187
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,960
Where's this guy?

188
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,639
Come let's check upstairs.

189
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,639
I mean...must we?

190
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,360
He said he'll be back.

191
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,879
Careful, watch the steps!

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Just shine the torch will you!

193
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,399
Fucking dickhead!
Was that really necessary?

194
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,840
Come on!

195
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,799
Let's go!

196
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,440
You have to behave like a dick!

197
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,639
Fucker!

198
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,639
What happened?

199
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,519
You go first.

200
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,919
Bloody dick brain!

201
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,079
I'm so, so hot
My burning bad

202
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,920
I feel sooo hot
So so hot

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,839
I'm a furnace inside
Believe it or not

204
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,599
It burns a lot
It's so so hot

205
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm so, so hot
My burning bad

206
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,839
I feel sooo hot
So so hot

207
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,039
I'm a furnace inside
Believe it or not

208
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,759
It burns a lot
It's so so hot

209
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,680
What the fuck was going on in that hotel?

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,079
Dude, you didn't see it!

211
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
What the hell was happening?

212
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,519
What was happening?

213
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,039
What the fuck was happening?

214
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
Sir, please turn on the AC

215
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,480
What was happening?
Fuck! What?

216
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You think Ria will do me?

217
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
Yeah yeah she will...
you think you can manage ?

218
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Yes boss, but where?

219
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,960
Where! where where fuckface!

220
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
What the fuck was happening!

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,079
You shouldn't play with something hot!

222
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,960
Didn't your dad tell you boy? 

223
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm burning in the flame of beauty

224
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,839
I feel sooo hot
So so hot

225
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,319
There's a heatwave in my body

226
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,640
I feel sooo hot
So so hot

227
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,039
I'm burning in the flame of beauty

228
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,000
I feel sooo hot
So so hot

229
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,440
There's a heatwave in my body

230
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,279
I'm sooo hot
So so hot

231
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,279
Let's go!

232
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,640
Did we miss something?

233
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,200
-Forget it man!
-Hey where you going?

234
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Hello! Popuda!

235
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,759
Do you have a room available?

236
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,200
Oh Popuda, you don't have to
call the cops...

237
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,160
Hello!

238
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,440
What did Popuda say?

239
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,799
This sucks!

240
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
Ria...

241
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,519
What?

242
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,920
Strawberry...

243
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,160
Blueberry.

244
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,839
Extra Dotted.

245
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,440
Shall we just put the condoms
on our thumbs or what?

246
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,319
What a fuckall place we live in.

247
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,279
Can't even get laid!

248
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,759
You said it...

249
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,720
And then those two useless fuck faces!

250
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,680
And this bitching heat!

251
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,200
A.C. (air conditioning)

252
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,160
Shopping mall

253
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,759
Come on.

254
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Ready!

255
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,359
Set.

256
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,599
Go!

257
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Fucker!

258
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,279
Come on!

259
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,160
What ? Let's go!

260
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,480
Your mall idea was kickass!

261
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,200
Well, someone had to do something!

262
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,599
So what shall we do now?

263
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,000
Do I have to spell that out as well?

264
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,480
Put your hand on your waist.

265
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:50,960
Why?

266
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,759
Just do it!

267
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,519
No!

268
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Please do it, please!

269
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to take a picture.

270
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,200
You're looking good in that dress.

271
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,079
You are looking like a model.
Put your hand on the waist.

272
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,279
Drop the sari a bit?

273
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,799
Come down? Let me do a close-up.

274
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,680
Come...

275
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,240
Want to take one together?

276
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,119
Hey dickhead!

277
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,720
Where's the booze?

278
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,240
How the hell am I supposed to know?

279
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,559
Whose bag is it?

280
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,680
Yours...

281
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,839
Whose bottle is it?

282
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,559
Yours...

283
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
Who is going to bring it?

284
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,200
Your dad will bring it you fuck!

285
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,079
Why do you pull his leg all the time?

286
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,720
No not this way.

287
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,880
No not this way.

288
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,200
Hey!

289
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,079
What the hell are you doing?

290
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,440
What happened to you?

291
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,400
What happened bro?

292
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,119
Why are you panting like this?

293
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
Where's the booze?

294
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,720
Hey asshole!

295
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,640
Where are you running from?

296
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,519
Just shut it ! Fucker...

297
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,519
You want booze, this, that, everything!

298
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,359
I am not your father's servant you moron!

299
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Oh really...

300
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,000
You keep drinking that.
I will eat this.

301
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,559
Hey!

302
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,759
What?

303
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,759
Don't go there...

304
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,799
Why?

305
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,200
I am telling you...

306
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,839
Come with me...

307
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,599
Why?

308
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,920
Tell me.

309
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,119
Do you want to talk or play?

310
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,359
What the fuck!

311
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,880
Hey fucker...

312
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,359
What's there to see? Huh?

313
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,799
What's your problem huh?

314
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Are you fucking deaf or what?

315
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,440
Do you think this is a free show?
You old pervert!

316
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,000
What happened bro?

317
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,119
Shhh, quiet! Stop shouting!

318
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,960
What do you want me to do?

319
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,200
Just shut up!

320
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,720
-What happened?
-I don't know.

321
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,680
Hey!

322
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,640
Fucker!
I've had it with you.

323
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,920
What the fuck?

324
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
Pele, what's wrong with you?

325
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,960
You fucking faggot!

326
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,920
What are you doing!
Get up.

327
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,160
Get over to that side!

328
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,960
Stand back over there and don't move!

329
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,319
This is too much man,
I'm warning you!

330
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,920
Fuck off and shut your face!
Just stand there and shut the fuck up.

331
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,720
I understand,
he's young, hot headed.

332
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,920
Fetch some water!
Do something.

333
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,880
Fuck! Just chill!
He's fine!

334
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,759
Shut up... I'm telling
you for the last time!

335
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,720
Babai!
There's no water.

336
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,559
We are old people...

337
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,480
We have nowhere to go,
We are stuck here.

338
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,799
Where have these shit heads come from?

339
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,759
What's your fucking problem?

340
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,599
Who are these people?

341
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,720
-Who are these people?
-I don't feel good about this.

342
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm telling you, man...

343
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,599
Are you scared of a couple of oldies?

344
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,799
Bro, enough! Stop acting like a cunt.
Sorry.

345
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,519
Here, have some booze.

346
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,640
Drink up. Here,
have a sip.

347
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,240
-Here, have a sip.
-Why the fuck did you hit me?

348
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm sorry,
My apologies!

349
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,359
Don't be so hot headed!
Just drink and be cool.

350
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,480
You seem tired.

351
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,319
Why don't you rest here?

352
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,440
We can all leave in the morning.

353
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,119
You guys wait here, okay ?

354
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes, we can wait here, but...

355
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,400
He is not feeling well.

356
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,359
Do you guys have something to eat?

357
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
It's a long night...

358
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,759
You have any munchies in that bag ?

359
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,079
Nothing!

360
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,440
This is all there is...

361
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,319
I won't have it anymore.

362
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,839
Give it to me.

363
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,599
I don't think she should drink that!

364
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,640
My throat is burning!

365
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,119
Take it slow.

366
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,400
Find some water, please!

367
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,759
I'll be right back.

368
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Where are you going?

369
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,640
-Where are you going?
-Take it easy.

370
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,079
Take it slow.
Try to sit straight please.

371
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,359
Try to sit straight please.

372
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,840
Shall we play?

373
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,800
Which color goes to who?
Red green yellow blue.

374
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,440
These colours deceive.
Do you have a clue?

375
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,639
Choose your colours.
The game has chosen you.

376
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,719
I choose the game's choice.

377
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,559
I choose the game's choice.

378
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,639
Blue.

379
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,400
Green.

380
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,480
Yellow.

381
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,079
A six and a five.
Try and stay alive.

382
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,800
Now I've got the four.
No one's safe anymore.

383
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,880
Girl you got four in the cup.
Why don't you just eat him up?

384
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,840
Eat him up?

385
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,920
Eat him.

386
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
Should I eat him now?

387
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,239
Yes.

388
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,719
Ria!

389
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,719
Ria! Get up. Come!

390
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,280
Get up!

391
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,239
Get going!

392
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:47,079
Ria! Don't go to the escalator.

393
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,840
Don't go on the fucking escalator!

394
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,960
Babai got killed!
Oh God, Babai's dead!

395
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,840
God! You saw that Babai died.

396
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,679
I didn't do anything.

397
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,239
I've committed no sin.

398
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,880
It all happened because of these whores.

399
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,440
Babai got killed!

400
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,599
You saw it God!
Babai was eaten.

401
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,800
I've done nothing.

402
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,199
I didn't commit any sin.

403
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,320
Don't you want to fuck? Huh!

404
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,480
Come on. Let's do it.

405
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,559
I'll fuck you good today!

406
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,880
You think you can handle it?

407
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,800
Leave her!

408
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,639
Shut up bitch!

409
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,039
Come on, let's fuck!

410
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,000
Bloody whore.

411
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,119
I should fuck you first.
Fucking whore!

412
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:20,239
Enjoying it? Huh!

413
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,199
You want to Fuck? You Asshole!

414
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,880
Don't go there. Don't!

415
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,400
Listen! Listen to me.
We could get out that way. Come with me.

416
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,119
What is this place!
Why did I come here?

417
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,000
Listen.

418
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,000
Let me tell you a story.

419
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,920
A long, long time ago...

420
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,199
They made a mistake.

421
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,519
A grave mistake.

422
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,559
And so they fled. They ran.

423
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:07,679
But how could they escape?

424
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:14,559
They were immortal.

425
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:28,559
Since they were kids,
they used to play a game.

426
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,639
The game of "finding the game".

427
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:40,679
Everyone in the Irum family
knew about this mysterious game.

428
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:50,119
Mirumi and Kirama Irum.
They knew the story well.

429
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,239
The forbidden game called for them,
beckoned them, whispered to them at night.

430
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:19,960
The flute was the key to the game.

431
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:24,960
But they weren't supposed to know that.

432
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:31,320
They were fools. They did not know
that the game was a master of illusion.

433
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:38,679
The game had been
locked away for centuries.

434
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:47,360
The Irum clan were the chosen
keepers of the game.

435
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:55,039
The most dangerous game 
of the world.

436
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:08,159
If the game ever found a way out,
It would result in disaster.

437
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,880
Fusing root magic and illusion,

438
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,320
with powerful chants,

439
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,039
the Irum clan had contained the evil game.

440
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:34,280
The game,eager for release,
was patiently waiting,

441
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,559
for the keys of fate to turn.

442
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:26,360
The ancient, cunning game
was thirsting for only one thing.

443
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,920
Blood!

444
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,559
Their father, Shaman Faruk Irum,
was an alchemist and occult practitioner.

445
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,360
The dirty old game had managed
to evade him and escape,

446
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,960
hallucinating Mirumi and Kirama.
Making them do as it pleased.

447
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,559
I curse you.

448
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,719
Father!

449
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:25,360
It was a cruel and inhuman
hunger they felt.

450
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,599
They couldn't eat human food anymore.

451
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,840
Every pore of their body
cried out for something moist.

452
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,199
As if their very life had been
suddenly sucked out of them.

453
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,320
Blood.

454
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,760
Sweet.

455
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,719
Fresh.

456
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:51,360
The elixir of life.

457
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,639
The game was playing with them.

458
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,559
It's not easy to be a monster.

459
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:17,599
The game didn't let them eat.

460
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:24,480
They rotted,wasted and withered away.
Mirumi and Kirama.

461
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,119
Death eluded them.

462
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,360
Their's was a poisoned life.

463
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,000
An unending,impossible existence.
An inhuman suffering.

464
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,960
Time stopped making sense.

465
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,599
As if it had ceased to exist.

466
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:06,239
They hid,for what
felt like centuries,

467
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,760
in the basement of
an old,dead temple.

468
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,440
And they hid
the cursed game with them.

469
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,360
But this was a game of fate and chances

470
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:26,039
and fate has its own twists.

471
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,679
The game was playing with them.

472
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,599
for thousands of years.

473
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,719
Exactly like it played with others,

474
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,679
Like it's playing with you right now.

475
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,600
Oh no.

476
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:43,439
They went insane,

477
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,359
blinded by their bloodlust.

478
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,119
Senseless, rootless, lifeless.

479
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,720
The devil had captured them.

480
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:14,239
The old game suddenly
sprung its surprise.

481
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:16,640
A new player.

482
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,159
Oshini Irum.

483
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:51,800
She was born of the same seed,
belonged to the same clan.

484
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,760
She had spent her whole life waiting
for the game to come to her.

485
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,520
They couldn't even begin
to imagine what was to follow.

486
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,680
Oshini had been handed down

487
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:47,039
the family heirloom.
The fatal flute.

488
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:54,119
Mirumi and Kirama had the cursed game.

489
01:12:55,479 --> 01:13:01,199
But Oshini the Shaman,
she had the key.

490
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,560
Mirumi!

491
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:50,600
Mirumi!

492
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,800
Your father had no clue
how powerful the game is.

493
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:28,880
you both are equally inept!

494
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:36,680
You and your lover,

495
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,000
I want that game.

496
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:51,439
I know what to do with it.

497
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:59,800
You don't know anything.

498
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:05,800
And you will never know.

499
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:20,039
One needs to transcend for that.

500
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,600
One needs to seek transcendence.

501
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,880
Who knows,when or what

502
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,800
how the dice will roll?

503
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,239
Drops of blood tears your eye

504
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,000
who knows, when how or why

505
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:05,039
The unbridled game wanted
a practitioner, a skilled hand.

506
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:10,319
Someone whose roll of dice could begin the

507
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:15,840
game's killing spree - across the world.

508
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,640
I won the game.

509
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,880
Do you have a room to rent?

510
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,960
This story isn't over yet.

511
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,760
The game has just begun.
