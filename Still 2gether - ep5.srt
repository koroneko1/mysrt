2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,800
Phukong.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,080
Have you got your seat?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
I heard the third years are busy.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,000
-How do you have time for this? -It depends on who's on the trip.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,920
Have a seat.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,240
-Hey. -Hello.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,480
-Hello. -Hi.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,240
-Hi, Boss. -These two seats aren't taken. Sit down.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,880
-Pear. -Have a seat.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,400
Come sit here.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,520
Hold on.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,720
-I'm hungry. I haven't eaten yet. -They'll stop somewhere.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,560
-Hello, guys. -Hello.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,320
Welcome, everyone, to the Music Club's volunteer camp.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,240
Last year, we went into the woods.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
This year, we will go to the beach.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,200
We're going to celebrate the success of the 2U event on this trip.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Right.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Starting now, there will be no Music Club or Cheerleading Club.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,440
It will be just…

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
-Us. -Right.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,440
When we get there, I'll need to check in, hand out the Wi-Fi password,

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,480
ask for the hotel receipt and…

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
What are you mumbling about?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm reminding myself of what to do.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,320
Being a leader just spoils the fun of this trip.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
But I'm having fun.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
Of course you are.

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,000
You've got nothing to do because you throw all your duties at me.

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,920
I didn't even have time to have breakfast.

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,480
No worries. I've got that covered.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
Here.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
You take care of work.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,640
Let me take care of you.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
What a jerk.

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm just opening it for you.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,240
I take the best care of you. I don't deserve this attitude.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Right. How about you drink it for me, then?

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,320
No need. I've got mine too.

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm excited, actually.

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
It's our first trip to the beach.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Trust me. I'm more excited than you are.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,760
Guys, I have something to ask.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
Well, I…

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,320
No, it's my friend. He wants to surprise his boyfriend on their anniversary.

47
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,080
-What do you-- -Stop.

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,240
Do you really think we don't know that it's you?

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,160
We've known each other since forever.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,440
Don't be shy.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,840
So have you known it all along?

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,560
-Fong knows. -Ohm knows.

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
Everyone knows.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,120
Whatever.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,080
I want to throw an anniversary surprise for Wat at the beach.

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,280
But privately. Just the two of us.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,680
How about some explicit activities on the beach?

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,800
Any idea, Fong?

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,360
I hope Fong the Philosopher won't disappoint me.

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
How about beach activities?

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,880
I already said that.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
-Seriously? -I'm not finished.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,760
I mean playing guitar on the beach.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
-Along with the sound of the waves. -Wow.

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,560
-Under the stars. -Great.

67
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
You can spend your club's budget on that.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,960
Right.

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,480
As expected of Fong the Philosopher.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
-That's awesome. -Brilliant.

71
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,920
By the way, what song should I play?

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Hold on a second.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,600
Before you discuss the song,

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
you should make sure your boyfriend remembers the anniversary.

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,640
-Otherwise, it will blow up. -You mean the plan?

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,320
Your face, maybe. Of course I'm talking about the plan.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Why do you need to ask?

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Damn it.

79
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,280
It's our anniversary.

80
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
He can't miss it.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Are you sure he'll remember it?

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
-Wat. -Yes?

83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Do you know what today is?

84
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,360
Of course I do.

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,960
I've spent this year waiting for it.

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
What a relief.

87
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,040
I've got only one concern left, then.

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
What is it?

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
About Dim and Green.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,600
They're still fighting.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,040
-Dim and Green? -Yes.

92
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,640
They seem happy to me.

93
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
-Look. A good drummer… -It's been so long since we had a trip.

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
-Don't touch me, or I'll slap your hand. -You slapped my hand.

95
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Yes, they do,

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,800
but they aren't happy together.

97
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,800
-Hey. -That's awesome.

98
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,280
Remember the contest we're in?

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Why do they have to fight now? We're going on a trip here.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
We can't avoid them forever.

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,680
What should we do if they fight again when we get there?

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
They're a couple after all.

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
They'll make up in the end.

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Just like us.

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,800
You're being cheesy again.

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
Everyone!

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,680
The club president will commence the beach cleaning activity now.

108
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,280
Here.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
-Why do you always make me talk? -Just kick off the activity.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,960
Guys!

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Clean the beach.

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Get in the water

113
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
and get as drunk as you like.

114
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,400
-Are you thirsty? -Hey.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
-Drink up. -No. Stop fooling around.

116
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,200
Better, little fool?

117
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,320
Thanks.

118
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Let's go.

119
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
What about you?

120
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Don't you need it?

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,920
The sun can't hurt me. Come on.

122
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,640
MUSIC CLUB VOLUNTEER CAMP THEME: SEA AND SAND

123
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Are you guys ready?

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
Ready?

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,920
Ready.

126
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,120
Give me some noise. One, two, three.

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,840
-Yeah! -Yeah!

128
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
Very nice.

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
Where are Dim and Green?

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,880
Here we go again. How could you say that?

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,800
No way. I won't let you do that.

132
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
-You're always like this. -I won't do this anymore.

133
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,840
How could you say that? Both have the same number of people.

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
You're always like this You always have excuses.

135
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Easy. What's happening?

136
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Just talk nicely.

137
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,640
The big house we booked has electricity problems.

138
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,840
So they're giving us two smaller houses instead.

139
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
That sounds okay.

140
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,520
One house has an air-con and the other doesn't.

141
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,320
Green wants the house with the air-con for the Cheerleading Club.

142
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,960
-That's unfair. -Right?

143
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
Calm down first.

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
Have you forgotten? The Music Club is the host of this activity.

145
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,000
We should get the house with the air-con.

146
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,040
Have you forgotten?

147
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
This hotel belongs to my friend.

148
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,400
We get to stay for free because I'm her friend.

149
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
You always come up with your connections.

150
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm so done. If we can't negotiate, I guess we need to fight.

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,280
-You're dead. -Fight him.

152
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,800
It's not just you who knows how to fight.

153
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,360
-Come on. -Take it easy.

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
-Fight me. -Bring it on.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Don't stop me! Let me go.

156
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,960
-Come on. Go ahead. -Bring it on.

157
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,120
-Crappy. -You'll lose.

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,040
No, you will.

159
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm going to beat you.

160
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,040
I thought they would beat each other up.

161
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,600
Exactly.

162
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,880
Things escalate every time they fight.

163
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Wait and see. When they're done fighting, they'll make us take sides.

164
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,800
Everyone, be in your position.

165
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Winners get the house with air conditioners.

166
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,560
Losers get their asses out and sleep with the mosquitoes.

167
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Fine!

168
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
What the hell?

169
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Green.

170
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
I think we can all sleep together in one house.

171
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,440
If he talked to me nicely, things wouldn't come to this.

172
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
He challenged me.

173
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,120
He clearly looks down on us. We can't let him get what he wants.

174
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,800
-But… -No, Tine.

175
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,000
Think about what I had to live with.

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Every time he went out,

177
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,120
he promised to come home before midnight. And what happened?

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
-He came home in the morning. -Exactly!

179
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
Today, we'll show them and make them realize

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,080
who we really are.

181
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,640
I can tell he's feeling bad.

182
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,880
Not likely.

183
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,040
Of course. Believe me.

184
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,960
He wants to say "I'm sorry" so bad.

185
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,720
You guys can't go soft on them.

186
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,880
Beat them up. Understand?

187
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,920
-Okay. -Are you sure?

188
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,880
-Understand? -Yes.

189
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,600
All right. Now that everyone is ready,

190
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,960
welcome to a beach volleyball match

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,520
between the Music Club and the Cheerleading Club.

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,840
The winner will get the air-conditioned house.

193
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Wat!

194
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,000
-Get the ball. -That's it.

195
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
MUSIC 2, CHEER 1

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll get back at you for sure.

197
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Leave me alone.

198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
MUSIC 4, CHEER 3

199
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Wat.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,360
Use your force.

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,120
-I saw you did this. -I don't know how to play.

202
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
You're pulling your punches.

203
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm not good at this.

204
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,320
MUSIC 14, CHEER 16

205
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
Boss, receive the serve.

206
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
-Boss. -Boss.

207
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Yes?

208
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,480
What's wrong with you? That was an easy serve.

209
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
Go get the ball.

210
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
It's over there.

211
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
Damn you.

212
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,160
MUSIC 17, CHEER 19

213
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,280
-Mil. -Block it.

214
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,400
The cheerleading team gets the point.

215
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Mil!

216
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,680
What was that?

217
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,440
I wasn't quick enough.

218
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
What is wrong with you guys?

219
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Come on, Dim. They're all boyfriends.

220
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,000
If you want to fight us, spike hard, gentlemen.

221
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,280
Boyfriends?

222
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Sarawat is the only one with a boyfriend here.

223
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
Mil.

224
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,120
Could it be…

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,080
Wait.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,520
I thought my senses were sharp.

227
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
Since when?

228
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,320
When did you become my brother's boyfriend?

229
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,920
You should ask your brother.

230
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,840
Right.

231
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,440
-Hey. -Calm down.

232
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,640
-Easy, boy. -Wat, don't be mad.

233
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,680
Phukong was about to tell you.

234
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
You knew about this too, Man?

235
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,840
No. It's not like that.

236
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,400
Boss told me not to tell you.

237
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,080
You said I shouldn't tell him.

238
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
No. You said I shouldn't tell him.

239
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
You knew this too, Boss?

240
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,960
Boss, you asshole.

241
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,000
-And the game is over. -Man!

242
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,160
The cheerleading team wins!

243
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,280
Man, get down here. Come here!

244
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
-Don't run away. -Over, my ass. It's not over yet.

245
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,560
-We get an air-con. -We get an air-con.

246
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,440
-We get an air-con. -We get an air-con.

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Nice.

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
Perfect!

249
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Give yourself a big round of applause.

250
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,240
They messed with the wrong ones.

251
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
It's their fault to challenge iron ladies like us.

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,760
Guys, it's going to be so cold here,

253
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,520
because this is an air-conditioned house.

254
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,480
We have rooms upstairs and a big room over there.

255
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Let's get our spots, people.

256
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,520
-Pear, come here. -Let's go upstairs.

257
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,000
-Let's stay downstairs. -Okay.

258
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,880
-I'll take this bed. -Sure. Go ahead.

259
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Better, little fool?

260
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,200
I want to throw an anniversary surprise for Wat at the beach.

261
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,560
Tine.

262
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
What's wrong?

263
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,720
Isn't it nice to stay in this cozy room?

264
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,400
It's nice, but the surprise I've prepared for Wat is now ruined.

265
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you need my help?

266
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,680
How are you going to help me?

267
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
Let's talk about you and Mil.

268
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,680
What's going on? You've never said anything.

269
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,400
-It's nothing. -Spill it.

270
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
I'm going to take a nap.

271
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
Nice.

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,080
Good luck, then.

273
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,640
We lost because of you guys.

274
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,960
What a bunch of suckers.

275
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,480
You're all hen-pecked.

276
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,240
What?

277
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,000
We're screwed because of you.

278
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,920
If you talked nicely, we'd all be in that house.

279
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,880
-Right. -It's hot in here.

280
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Do you want me to talk nicely to him?

281
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,800
Not a chance.

282
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
What?

283
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,360
What are you two fighting over anyway?

284
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,440
We're on a trip here. Let us have a good time.

285
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
You caused such chaos.

286
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
It's so hot in here.

287
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,760
You don't need to know what the fight is all about.

288
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,520
Let's say my dignity has been trampled.

289
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
Dignity bullshit again.

290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Dim!

291
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,200
The seafood you've ordered is here.

292
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,320
Here we go.

293
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,360
Here.

294
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
There's another box.

295
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,800
Damn.

296
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,280
All from the market.

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
-Great. -When did you order this?

298
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
Just a while ago.

299
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I bought it all from the market. Nothing left for them to eat.

300
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
You're such a kid.

301
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,160
So what?

302
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,800
They get the house with the air-con.

303
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,760
We get the seafood here.

304
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
-Are you happy? -Very happy.

305
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
What the hell!

306
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,560
What was that sound?

307
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,520
Seriously?

308
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,240
-It's because of you, Wat. -No, it's you.

309
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,600
It's your fault.

310
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,600
Sorry. The breaker broke down because of a short circuit.

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,440
Our electrician will fix it tomorrow.

312
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,000
Do you have any rooms left?

313
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,600
We are fully booked.

314
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,000
Can you please stay with your friends tonight?

315
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
I'll bring you guys extra beds.

316
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
Sure!

317
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
What do you say?

318
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,680
No need. We can stay here just fine.

319
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,280
Come on, Dim.

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,920
-It's burning inside. We can't sleep. -Right.

321
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,800
We need a fridge for the seafood.

322
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
We can't stay here.

323
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,120
Dim, you better make up with Green.

324
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,600
How about this?

325
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,120
You share the seafood with Green.

326
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,320
He loves good food. He'll come around.

327
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,040
True.

328
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,400
I know that deep down you want to make up with Green.

329
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,680
Why are you pretending you don't want to?

330
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,920
You still have his picture on your phone screen.

331
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,880
Swallow your pride. It's no big deal at all.

332
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Right.

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,920
Are they sold out?

334
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,280
Okay. Thank you.

335
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,480
They said a guest here bought it all.

336
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
It must be Dim who bought all the seafood before us.

337
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,600
See?

338
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,440
Green.

339
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,920
Well…

340
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
We'd like to share the house with you.

341
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,320
We didn't come empty-handed.

342
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,040
We have all the seafood from the market.

343
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,520
We can share.

344
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,440
I'll give you one-third of the seafood.

345
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm okay with the house sharing.

346
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,640
About the seafood, I want two-thirds of it.

347
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,520
No.

348
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
I'll give you one-third. Take it or leave it.

349
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
I won't.

350
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,840
Then no seafood for you. Let's go, guys.

351
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,720
-Hey. Calm down. -Let's go back.

352
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,840
-Look at him. -Dim.

353
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
This is who he is.

354
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,840
He's always like this.

355
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,040
He can't stand losing. He just has to win.

356
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,440
He always gets what he wants.

357
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,080
Even our online channel too.

358
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,960
What? An online channel?

359
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,840
What are you talking about?

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,640
Well, we were naming our channel together.

361
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,920
We agreed to name it GreenDim at first,

362
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,040
but Dim changed his mind.

363
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,680
He wanted to put his name first. He wanted DimGreen.

364
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm the leader. My name must come first.

365
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,960
What?

366
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,320
We had to compete in that stupid volleyball game

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,360
just because you wanted your name before his?

368
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,640
It's a big deal. It's my dignity.

369
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,520
-Unbelievable. -Right, everyone?

370
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,080
Guys, bring this inside. Let's eat seafood together.

371
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,200
-Let's do it. -Bring it inside.

372
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,400
Give me a hand.

373
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Let's get inside. Come on.

374
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,680
-What a stupid fight. -Let's grill it.

375
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,200
-Green, let's eat. -I paid for it.

376
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
It's the club's budget.

377
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
-Wat, that's my money. I paid for it. -Let's eat.

378
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
-Wat, these crabs look yummy. -Right.

379
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,440
It's GreenDim, then.

380
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,320
It's unfair.

381
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,080
I always please you when you pout.

382
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,120
Why can't you do the same for me?

383
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,800
Who are you looking for?

384
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,600
Your brother.

385
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,040
Seriously.

386
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,360
When did you two get together?

387
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,800
When he became a cheerleader,

388
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,320
but I had liked him long before that.

389
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,320
Are you serious with him,

390
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,800
or do you just want to get back at me?

391
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,960
Why would I do that? It'd be a waste of time.

392
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,320
I'd rather spend my time playing football with your brother.

393
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,840
So you are serious.

394
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,320
If I wasn't,

395
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

396
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,680
Take good care of him,

397
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,960
or I'll take him back.

398
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,360
You're using my words against me?

399
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,560
Fine.

400
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,080
-Go find him. -Is he over there?

401
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,480
Phukong, here you are. I looked for you everywhere.

402
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,480
Where have you been?

403
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Well…

404
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,240
I've asked for your brother's permission to date you.

405
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Are you kidding me?

406
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,640
I have no reason to do that.

407
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,200
I don't know. You've always fooled me.

408
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,240
You tricked me into playing football and building models with you.

409
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,400
All the time.

410
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,800
I wasn't tricking you.

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
I just wanted to get close to you.

412
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,440
I told you a million times that's the brother zone.

413
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,120
-Huh? -I know.

414
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,280
-Here. -You just can't remember, can you?

415
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,800
But for me,

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,160
patting the head is like "I like you."

417
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
Can I get your hand?

418
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,640
Hand, please.

419
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Look at me.

420
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,520
What are you doing?

421
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,720
Holding hands is like…

422
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
"you're my boyfriend."

423
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,320
Aren't you feeling embarrassed?

424
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,440
Why should I be? My boyfriend is so cute.

425
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,600
Did you just realize that I'm cute?

426
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,960
Right. I got something for you.

427
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
-What is it? -I drew it the best I could.

428
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
Where is it?

429
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,280
Are you sure you're an architecture student?

430
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Is this the best you've got?

431
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,360
Wait. Let me see.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
Wow.

433
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,640
It's not so bad. Judging from the eyebrows, I can tell who this guy is.

434
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,400
Give it back.

435
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,640
Come on.

436
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
You gave it to me. It belongs to me now.

437
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
And to whom do I belong?

438
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,720
To whom?

439
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,720
To the one sitting with you now.

440
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,960
Boss.

441
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
It's your chance now.

442
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
Confess to her already.

443
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Right.

444
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,760
What should I say?

445
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,600
You can start with your football jersey.

446
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,320
Tell her they printed it wrong.

447
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,240
It was supposed to be her name.

448
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,200
Go ahead.

449
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,080
-Come on. -I don't think so.

450
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,600
Trust me one last time. Please.

451
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,000
Don't back off. Go on.

452
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Go ahead.

453
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,160
That's it.

454
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,560
Boss.

455
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,720
Why are you here by yourself? Are you okay?

456
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm fine. It's just…

457
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,840
I'm a bit worried about school, and I don't want to spread the flu.

458
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,320
-I see. -Right.

459
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,560
About school, you can talk to me.

460
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
I may not seem like one, but I'm a real nerd.

461
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,520
-Are you serious? -Of course.

462
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,960
And about the flu,

463
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
are you going to spread it to me?

464
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,480
No. I won't do that.

465
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,240
By the way, how is it going with you and that Cute Piggy?

466
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,320
It wasn't supposed to be "Cute Piggy."

467
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,960
What should it be, then?

468
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,520
Take a guess.

469
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,680
CUTE XXXXXX

470
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Cute Bear?

471
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,240
No, it's not.

472
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,320
Try again.

473
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,840
Cute Puppy?

474
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,160
Why would I print that?

475
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,920
I don't know.

476
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
I'll give you clues.

477
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,880
She is very cute.

478
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,200
She is also kind.

479
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
When she sees someone get hurt,

480
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,480
she always helps them.

481
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,640
Who could it be?

482
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,680
Cute Doctor?

483
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Who is it?

484
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,240
Do you like one of my friends?

485
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
Right? Which one? I'll introduce you.

486
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
He likes you, Pear!

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
-What? -He likes you!

488
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,800
I can't hear you!

489
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,840
Boss likes you!

490
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,320
-Hello, Type. -Hello.

491
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
-What are you doing? -I'm just thinking about you.

492
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm at the beach.

493
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,160
There are many couples here,

494
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
but I'm all alone

495
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,840
without my boyfriend.

496
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,040
I can't listen to your complaint.

497
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,400
-I have to meet someone. -What? Who are you going to meet?

498
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,840
With a man who has thick eyebrows, a mustache, and a lustful face.

499
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
With a mustache and beard?

500
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,800
He sounds suspicious, though. Don't go near him.

501
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,000
-Do you hear me? -I think so.

502
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
But it's too late now. I do trust him.

503
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Hello? What did you say?

504
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,400
Type, can you hear…

505
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,760
Type, how did you get here?

506
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,080
By plane, of course.

507
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,240
But I can stay for one night and go back tomorrow.

508
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,080
-Just one night? -Right.

509
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,520
That's okay. One night is enough for me.

510
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Enough for what?

511
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,960
Well…

512
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,760
All right.

513
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,320
While I was away, did you have your eyes on someone else?

514
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,920
Here we go again. You always ask me that.

515
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,560
Who would I lay eyes on?

516
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,400
I have eyes on you and only you.

517
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,800
I told you to trust me.

518
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm kidding.

519
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
I do trust you, Man.

520
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,800
You told me yourself that it was difficult to get me.

521
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't open my heart to anyone so easily, you know?

522
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,360
Why are you being romantic today?

523
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,840
Are you sick?

524
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,720
It's kind of weird.

525
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,480
-What I'm telling you is… -Is…

526
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,600
A long-distance relationship is tough.

527
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,640
It requires trust and patience.

528
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,680
And I want you to be patient.

529
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I'll do the same for you.

530
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,120
That's it. Let go of my hands.

531
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,400
Type.

532
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
I miss you.

533
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,680
Okay.

534
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,240
"Okay"?

535
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
Just "okay"?

536
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,240
Okay.

537
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,560
How could you respond to me with that?

538
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I've always missed you. We are so far apart.

539
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,400
-We get to meet once in a blue moon. -Man.

540
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,120
You can't say I don't miss you now.

541
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,400
Okay.

542
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,000
Okay.

543
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,880
So we have…

544
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,800
just one day, right?

545
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,920
Yes.

546
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
Should we just…

547
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,840
do it now?

548
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,400
Do what? No.

549
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,080
Do what we always do.

550
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,360
Come on. Don't be shy.

551
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,160
Where are you going?

552
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
Should we start?

553
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,840
Hello, Green Grub Grub's fans.

554
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,600
Long time no see.

555
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,840
As all of you know,

556
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Green and I had a fight.

557
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,840
That's because I forced him to name this channel DimGreen.

558
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,320
I wanted to put my name first.

559
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,400
So I want to say I'm sorry to him.

560
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,840
Louder.

561
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,600
From now on, this channel will be called GreenDim.

563
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,520
No, it won't be.

564
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,520
Our channel's name isn't GreenDim.

565
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,800
From now on, this channel will have a new name.

566
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,200
It's Sunshine and Daisy!

567
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,480
How did you come up with that?

568
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,080
Why?

569
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,400
It's your band's name.

570
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
Sunshine Daisies and Butter Mellow.

571
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,160
You will be Sunshine,

572
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,600
and I'll be Daisy!

573
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,440
So you let my name come first.

574
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,400
Yes.

575
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,920
Why are you so cute?

576
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,240
Let me give you a kiss.

577
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,040
-Stop. We're still doing a live video. -It's fine. Let them know.

578
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,280
Wait. It's embarrassing.

579
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,920
Let's start our first video properly.

580
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,480
Everyone, our first episode will be

581
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,920
"Sunshine and Daisy on the Beach."

582
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
See you later.

583
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,680
-On the beach? -Yes, on the beach.

584
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,920
I'll do it till you drop. Let's take the camera too.

585
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,240
Help me. Anyone!

586
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,440
Smelling the earth out of the wind Blowing towards me

587
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,960
From very far away

588
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,600
On this gigantic planet We are just small people

589
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,000
Looking up to the vast sky and ocean

590
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,280
Smelling the earth out of the wind Blowing towards me from very far away

591
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,440
On this gigantic planet, just choose

592
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,320
Your desired

593
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,080
Path

594
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
How was it?

595
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Did you feel the love?

596
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,640
How would I feel that?

597
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,680
It's not a love song.

598
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,360
How is it not?

599
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,000
Every song I play for you,

600
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,040
I play with love.

601
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,480
Yuck.

602
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
You're being cheesy.

603
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
Where did you go earlier?

604
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,440
To get you this towel.

605
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
Your hair is wet.

606
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,440
You might catch a cold.

607
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,960
Why don't you take good care of yourself like you take care of me?

608
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,280
Why?

609
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm your boyfriend.

610
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,960
I need to take good care of you.

611
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
Right?

612
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,200
But a relationship is about give and take.

613
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,640
Let's do this.

614
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,760
When you're too lazy to take care of yourself,

615
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,480
let me take care of you.

616
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,120
Okay?

617
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,840
Taking care of me is easy.

618
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,400
Just let me grab your boobs.

619
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,160
My boobs?

620
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,400
All right. Go ahead.

621
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,760
Put your hands here. Do it.

622
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,280
Grab them.

623
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,840
-Do it. -Hold on.

624
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,480
I thought you were bold. Very disappointing.

625
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,880
SARAWOW GLOWING BRIGHT

626
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Earn.

627
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,760
We have plenty of squid here. Get some.

628
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,920
Come here.

629
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,200
Don't go anywhere.

630
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,640
-Well, well. -Why don't you say something to them?

631
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,880
Is Boss all right?

632
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
-Boss. -Are you that thirsty?

633
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,640
-What's with him? -Talk to them.

634
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
We're going now. Don't get drunk.

635
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
-Really? -What is it?

636
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,120
You suck.

637
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,120
You had a very good chance this evening. Why did you run into the water?

638
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,240
What happened?

639
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Look.

640
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,840
-Wat. Tine. Did you know-- -Shut up.

641
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm telling them.

642
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,200
This evening, Boss had a chance to confess his love to Pear,

643
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,520
but he just ran into the water.

644
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,000
Were you that shy?

645
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,440
It was hot.

646
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,760
-Hot? -Yes.

647
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,840
-I went for a swim. -Are you sure?

648
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,280
What's wrong with that?

649
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,960
-Why do you keep looking at your watch? -What?

650
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,960
Have to go somewhere?

651
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,240
No.

652
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,040
What's wrong?

653
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,720
Nothing.

654
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,000
You can talk to me.

655
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,360
I'll get some ice.

656
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,280
We ran out of ice cubes here.

657
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,240
Tine.

658
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,440
We still have a lot.

659
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,520
-Boo! -Hey!

660
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,360
Why did you guys come?

661
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,960
Because we wanted to.

662
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,440
We're here to witness your little surprise for him.

663
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,720
One more thing, I'm going to film a video for Phuak to see.

664
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,120
So how is it going?

665
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,760
It's going nowhere. Look.

666
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,760
He's still drinking with his friends. He might be drunk already.

667
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
I'm not sure if this will work.

668
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,720
I've got a plan. Don't worry.

669
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,040
Just take him for a walk along the beach.

670
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,160
Leave the rest to us.

671
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
We'll take care of it.

672
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,440
You're so smart.

673
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,000
-Are you sure? -Just trust us.

674
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,280
It's so good here.

675
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,880
With you, anywhere is good.

676
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
Wat.

677
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,400
Have you ever thought

678
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,200
about what you would've done if I had turned you down that day?

679
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,920
Not really.

680
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,960
Were you that confident?

681
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,960
I wasn't.

682
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
But when I love someone,

683
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,040
I don't keep my heart in reserve.

684
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,920
The worst-case scenario

685
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,040
was I got hurt

686
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,320
and got over you.

687
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,720
Then you're lucky I didn't turn you down.

688
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Right.

689
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,280
I was lucky enough to see you cry too.

690
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,680
Hey.

691
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,840
Don't rub it in.

692
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,960
Since that day,

693
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,520
we have been through a lot together.

694
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes.

695
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,720
Wat.

696
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Come.

697
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,440
The football game is on.

698
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Can I go watch the game?

699
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
But today is…

700
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,840
It's Manchester United versus Liverpool. It's about to start.

701
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,960
Let me check it out.

702
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,760
Where is Wat?

703
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,240
He went to see a football game.

704
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Oh.

705
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,440
So much for a smart plan. It failed.

706
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,880
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,960
Hey. How about this?

708
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,160
Since he's gone,

709
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,640
let's get drunk by ourselves.

710
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,320
Yes?

711
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
Now we all learn that

712
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,160
not everyone can remember their anniversary.

713
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,120
Keep that in mind.

714
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
-Guys. -Yes?

715
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,760
I read this somewhere.

716
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,200
Scrubb once asked his fans.

717
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,920
If they listened to the same song 100 times over,

718
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,320
would they still be into the song?

719
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,840
For me, I would.

720
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,280
But him?

721
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm not so sure.

722
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
You're not sure.

723
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,280
-Do you want to know his answer? -Yes.

724
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,760
-Then go ask him. -What?

725
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,000
-Ask him? -Yes.

726
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,320
You promised him, didn't you?

727
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,080
That whatever is on your mind, you'll speak out.

728
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I did.

729
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,160
If you want to know whether he's still into you or not,

730
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,320
you have to ask him.

731
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,600
-Right. -Go ahead.

732
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,880
You have a point.

733
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,040
-Tine. Let me help you. -Tine.

734
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,600
Have some water.

735
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,600
What happened to you?

736
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,680
I went out for a walk,

737
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,040
and I just tripped over.

738
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,200
Did you hurt yourself?

739
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,240
Let me see.

740
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,440
Just be more careful next time.

741
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,240
Do you have anything to say to me?

742
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,560
I can always tell when you're being weird.

743
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,680
Please tell me.

744
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,480
You said we'd have a heart-to-heart talk.

745
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,920
Fine.

746
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,400
I didn't trip over.

747
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,880
I fell because I was drunk.

748
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,160
The reason I was drunk

749
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,280
is because you forgot our anniversary.

750
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,280
I asked you to take a walk

751
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,720
because I wanted to surprise you.

752
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,440
I was going to play guitar for you.

753
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Okay.

754
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,840
It's good you got it out.

755
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,480
I have something to tell you too.

756
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,160
I…

757
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,920
didn't forget our anniversary.

758
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,400
I prepared you a surprise as well,

759
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,480
but Dim ruined it.

760
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,320
I had Boss pretend to call me out for a football match.

761
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Do you get it now?

762
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,640
It's all screwed.

763
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,280
Did you really remember?

764
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,440
Are you doubting me?

765
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,480
You are my first boyfriend.

766
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,520
How could I forget our day?

767
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,240
You're overthinking it, Tine.

768
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,480
So…

769
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,000
Is it too late to ask for that surprise?

770
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,520
Would you like to go to a concert with me?

771
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,360
Wow.

772
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,760
Good evening, sir. May I see your ticket, please?

773
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Mr. Tine.

774
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,000
This way, please.

775
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Follow me.

776
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,320
What are you doing?

777
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,560
-Good evening, Mr. Tine. -Please have a seat.

778
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,280
Good evening.

779
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,120
Here.

780
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,320
Welcome, all honorable guests, to the celebration

781
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,480
of having this nuisance in my life for one whole year.

782
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,320
He didn't even know…

783
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,520
that he had been revolving around my universe long before.

784
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,240
Million stars in the sky

785
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Is there any star that stays still?

786
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,800
The one that doesn't revolve around Any other stars

787
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,680
I have never seen any

788
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,720
My star is traveling so far off

789
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,240
Every star is just so far apart From each other

790
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,080
I guess your star is just the same

791
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,680
They can take many light-years to meet

792
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,440
But when two stars see each other

793
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,280
Seasons change

794
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,720
So do the orbits

795
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,840
When you and I meet each other Our lives change

796
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,760
It all changes Our hearts beat in the same rhythm

797
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,040
You revolve around me I revolve around you

798
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,240
And the two stars rotate themselves

799
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,640
You attract me, I attract you

800
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,840
The two stars shine beautifully On each other

801
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,120
You attract me

802
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,040
I revolve around you

803
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,720
And the two stars rotate themselves

804
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,680
You attract me, I attract you

805
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,520
The two stars shine beautifully On each other

806
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,000
You revolve around me I revolve around you

807
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,120
And the two stars rotate themselves

808
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,760
You attract me, I attract you

809
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,680
The two stars shine beautifully On each other

810
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,880
Thank you.

811
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,080
-What is it? -No.

812
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,520
-It's a secret. -What are you doing?

813
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,480
-What's going on? -I wonder what it is.

814
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,720
Happy anniversary.

815
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,480
Let's grow old together.

816
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,720
-Let's hear some noise. -Yeah!

817
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,680
Hello, Wat.

818
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,320
I got a surprise from you that night.

819
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,440
So you'll get this video from me instead.

820
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Wrong.

821
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,440
When did you come?

822
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,240
Since you started recording.

823
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,880
What song are you playing?

824
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,720
Last year, you wrote me a song.

825
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,840
So I was trying to write you a song this year.

826
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,200
Do you want to know what it's called?

827
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,440
-Can you even write a song? -I tried for you.

828
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,720
-What is it called? -It's called "Sarawat."

829
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,760
Let's hear it.

830
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,200
For someone I get to meet For the first time

831
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,080
Some words are suddenly clear in my heart

832
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,600
Those words are telling me You are the right one

833
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,640
I can't even find the reasons

834
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,360
For someone who is not like The person in my dream

835
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,800
But you know what?

836
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,880
It must be you, just you

837
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,880
That's all it takes To stop me right here with you

838
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,080
Though I could turn back time

839
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,160
I'm sure I'd pick you every time

840
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,720
I know it right away At the first glance at you

841
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,320
You're the one I've been waiting for

842
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,840
You don't need to be like The person in my dream

843
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,520
Being who you are is already enough

844
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,800
The one who stands right beside me And ready to walk together

845
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,600
If I'm asked who is good enough for me

846
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,160
My answer is you

847
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,680
If I'm asked who is good enough for me

848
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,800
My answer is…

849
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,640
You

850
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,240
Was it good?

851
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,280
Keep looking at me like that,

852
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,240
and I'll knock you out with a kiss.

853
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,760
Are you challenging me?

854
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,680
Keep looking at me like that,

855
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,960
and I'll kiss you till you moan.

856
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,000
He's taken. Sarawat.

857
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,000

858
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Let's grow old together.

859
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,280
Fine. I'll grow old with you.
