1
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,560
Didn't I tell you

2
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,280
not to talk to her

3
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,479
as long as you're living here?

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,000
When I locked eyes with Nut earlier,

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
-my heart was beating really fast.
-What?

6
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,000
You're just like him, Little Prince.

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,439
You really care for me.

8
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,680
Now that you know
I'm not related to Neung,

9
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,319
you won't kick me out, will you?

10
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,319
If I wanted to,

11
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,319
I would've left you
at the temple that day.

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm a bear, not a dog.

13
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,840
Listen. He's just a kid.

14
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,879
Haven't you heard people say
that you should never work with kids?

15
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,560
If you don't trust meâ€¦

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
you could try going out with me.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,560
Everyone, look.

18
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,000
Teddy is acting
more and more like a human.

19
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,680
How?

20
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,800
You seem to have a lot on your mind,

21
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,919
like there's something you want to say

22
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,719
but you won't say it.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,680
You used to say all your thoughts
when you were a teddy bear.

24
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,039
I guess the more time I spend with humans,

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,080
the more I know that
there are some things we shouldn't say,

26
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,360
because they can hurt someone.

27
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,560
But some things, I just don't understand,

28
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,120
so I don't know what to say.

29
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,439
If being a human is so hard,
turn back into a teddy bear.

30
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,879
Come back to us.

31
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,439
I'm trying.

32
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
I almost found out who gave me to Nut,

33
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,039
but I was still wrong.

34
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,879
Maybe Nut won you
after playing darts at a temple fair?

35
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,159
No!

36
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,759
He said someone important gave me to him.

37
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
I must be more important
than a prize at a fair.

38
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,920
Calm down, Tofu.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Look, he gets angry
like a real person now.

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,959
-He's kind of similar to Nut.
-He's kind of similar to Nut.

41
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,079
Hey!

42
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,240
Why are you here?

43
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,000
I brought in your laundry.

44
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,360
What should I do next?

45
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,199
You need to go and iron them.

46
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,000
-Iron?
-Yes.

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,839
Don't tell me you don't know how to do it.

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Listen.

49
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,160
This is linen,

50
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
so it needs high heat.

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
Put the heat on high for linen.

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,079
Then start ironing.

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Go slowly, see?

54
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,040
Go over the whole thing.

55
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
That's it.

56
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,160
You try this side.

57
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
Slowly.

58
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
Yes.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't iron over the buttons.

60
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,279
Here.

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
What you do

62
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,079
is gently push the iron
between the buttons like this.

63
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,079
Slowly.

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,639
See?

65
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,279
Yes.

66
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,160
Try it.

67
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,600
Here.

68
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,959
Oh, Tofu.

69
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,079
Here.

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,800
Like this, slowly.

71
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,759
Hold the fabric with one hand.

72
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,879
Yes.

73
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Nut, are you hurt?

74
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
No,

75
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,279
it's just hot.

76
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,399
Was it hot?

77
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,079
Touch your earlobes.

78
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,319
Is it better?

79
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,000
A little bit.

80
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
Hold your earlobes.

81
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,839
What for?

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Just do as I say.

83
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,519
No.

84
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
-Like this.
-No.

85
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,319
Like this.

86
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,920
It's all right, it's not hot anymore.

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Why do I feel so hot?

88
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,679
Is this the sound of my heart or yours?

89
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,639
Get out. You're not good.

90
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,799
I'll do it myself. Go.

91
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Go on.

92
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,879
Beary,

93
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,840
why are you all hot and sweaty?

94
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,360
I was ironing.

95
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
Maybe it gave me fever.

96
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,720
Can ironing cause fever?

97
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,679
Right?

98
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,639
Tell me how you feel.

99
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm not sure.

100
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,120
I feel hot all over.

101
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,080
There are butterflies in my stomach.

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,679
My heart is beating fast too.

103
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,960
You don't sound like you have fever.

104
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,120
Oh, he can't understand you.

105
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,960
Hey, Tofu,

106
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,000
are you sure

107
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,000
that the only thing you did was iron?

108
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
It really was.

109
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,039
But while I was ironing,

110
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,039
Nut said he was hot,

111
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,840
so I held his earlobes.

112
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,519
-Held his earlobes?
-Held his earlobes?

113
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,720
Did you hold anything else?

114
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,759
No.

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,960
You did just that and then got all hot?

116
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,559
Ha, what do single people know?

117
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,440
Little One, tell them.

118
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,720
I think you like Nut, Tofu.

119
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,039
That's why your heart beats fast

120
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,159
and you get butterflies
when you're near him.

121
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
It's that feeling you get
when you really like someone.

122
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
When you're near them

123
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,399
and lock eyes with them,

124
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,919
your heart starts beating fast.

125
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,759
But I'm just a teddy bear.

126
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,320
How can I like my owner?

127
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,960
Don't forget, Beary,

128
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,200
you're not just a teddy bear anymore.

129
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:41,200
But I have to turn back
into a teddy bear anyway.

130
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,960
I don't know
when I'll turn back into a teddy bear,

131
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,759
but I've decided that

132
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,799
before that day comes,

133
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll make the most of my time with Nut.

134
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,480
Nut, are you hurt?

135
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,840
No,

136
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,960
it's just hot.

137
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,480
Hold your earlobes.

138
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,759
What for?

139
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,600
Just do as I say.

140
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,759
-Like this.
-No.

141
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,120
Like this.

142
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,360
Why do I feel so hot?

143
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,519
Is this the sound of my heart or yours?

144
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,559
I'll be off, Mom.

145
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,039
Nut.

146
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,919
It's my first time making it.

147
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,039
It might not be very good.

148
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,799
By the way, how's the shirt?

149
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh,

150
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,320
where's Mom?

151
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,879
Nut.

152
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,679
I'm sorry, I overslept.

153
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh, and your lunch?

154
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,559
I already made it for him.

155
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm off to work, Mom.

156
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,919
You should go back to sleep.

157
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Bye.

158
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,399
I can't even wake up
to make lunch for Nut.

159
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,679
How am I supposed to do
other things for him?

160
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,399
Don't worry, Mrs. Na,

161
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,080
anyone can oversleep.

162
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,559
As long as you stay healthy,
Nut will be happy.

163
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,039
Have some apple juice.

164
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,200
Song's father said
it's good for the heart.

165
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,279
I want you to try some.

166
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you.

167
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,399
You're so lovely, Little Prince.

168
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm sorry, Mrs. Na.

169
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,279
I made you oversleep.

170
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,559
But if I didn't do thisâ€¦

171
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,840
Nut wouldn't be happy.

172
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,240
Go on.

173
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
What are you making?

174
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,960
Apple juice.

175
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,480
Thank you.

176
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,519
FIRST LOVE

177
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,480
It's my first time making it.

178
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,320
It might not be very good.

179
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,399
Want to try it?

180
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,159
Yuck.

181
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,080
Try it. I put a lot of effort into it.

182
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,000
Here.

183
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,119
How is it?

184
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
Delicious, right?

185
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,359
Hey,

186
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,319
it's great.

187
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,960
Iced Americano with no sugar,

188
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,920
but with all my heart,
in exchange for your lunch.

189
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,200
How come your food looks terrible today?

190
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,720
The pork is all burnt.

191
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,960
There's no food for me today then.

192
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,119
I'll throw it out for you.

193
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,920
No,

194
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,720
I can eat it.

195
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Gen,

196
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,759
Nut's taste is so weird.

197
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,759
He gives yummy-looking food
to other people,

198
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,240
but eats burnt pork by himself.

199
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,319
What's so special about that pork?

200
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,480
If he can eat stuff like that,
all is not lost for me.

201
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,920
I have an idea.

202
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
You're crazy.

203
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,359
What's up?

204
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,799
What?

205
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,400
You bought an air fryer?

206
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,319
Why?

207
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,079
I'm going to learn to fry pork.

208
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,200
I'll impress Nut with my cooking skills.

209
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,640
You never cease to amaze me.

210
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
I'll bring you some to try later.

211
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Bye now.

212
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Oh, Prib.

213
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,519
Oh, Mr. Anik.

214
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Any updates on Tarn's case?

215
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,839
The police
still haven't ruled out anything,

216
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,599
for both the conflict with TRD
and his personal problems.

217
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,880
In his personal life,

218
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm certain there's no woman involved.

219
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,640
What makes you think so?

220
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,079
Since he came back to Thailand
two years ago,

221
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,839
he hasn't dated anyone.

222
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,279
He never forgot his first love

223
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,640
and he never got serious with anyone.

224
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,079
I was really touched by that,

225
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,519
so I created a page called

226
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,759
"Once Upon Our Time" to tell his story.

227
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,519
If you check it out,
you might understand him more.

228
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,039
ONCE UPON OUR TIME

229
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,880
I didn't know
that Tarn could never love me,

230
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
so I made a move on him.

231
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,599
In the end, I failed.

232
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,039
We became good friends instead

233
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,920
and grew a lot closer.

234
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,880
After you've read the page, if you want
to know anything else about Tarn,

235
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
you can ask me.

236
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,599
Hey!

237
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,279
You puppy,

238
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,119
you're such a child.

239
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,200
Dad,

240
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,519
are you a BL fanboy?

241
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
Are you crazy?

242
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
It has to do with my case.

243
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,079
You have cases like this now?

244
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,519
That's pretty trendy.

245
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,680
Of course.

246
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,160
It's Neung's friend's case.

247
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,960
I just realized

248
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,759
that he's not manly.

249
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
Not manly?

250
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
Just the fact that he's a guy
who likes guys

251
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,480
makes him not manly?

252
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,920
Hey, wait,

253
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,279
what do you think I mean?

254
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,920
What I mean by manly is masculinity.

255
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,200
A person of any gender can be manly.

256
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,680
How did you understand it?

257
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:00,960
Dad,

258
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,279
keep working.

259
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,240
I'll be the chef tonight.

260
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,960
What do you want,
omelet, fried egg, or steamed egg?

261
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,759
No thanks.

262
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,839
Chef Dad will take care of it.

263
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,519
Go take a shower.

264
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,160
You stink. Go.

265
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
Stink? Take that.

266
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,160
Go on, you puppy.

267
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh, dear.

268
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,519
Come have some fruit, Mrs. Na.

269
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,039
What are you looking for?

270
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,279
Saen.

271
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,160
I haven't seen him.

272
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Did he come home last night?

273
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,880
I think so.

274
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,279
He probably left before you woke up.

275
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,519
Right,

276
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,200
I woke up late today.

277
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,839
I should scold him though.

278
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,720
He could have woken me up.

279
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,440
I don't know
how long he'll be gone this time.

280
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,640
He used to work in a factory
outside Bangkok

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,279
and he would come home every week.

282
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,160
Sometimes he would be gone for a few weeks

283
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,759
or even months.

284
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm not coming back to Bangkok
this weekend.

285
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
Again?

286
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
But it's my birthday this Saturday.

287
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,799
Saen?

288
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Saen?

289
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,000
Hello?

290
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,640
Did you get cut off?

291
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,359
Saen is in a meeting.

292
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,559
Do you have a message for him?

293
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,000
Please let it be about work only, though,

294
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,119
because he's working right now.

295
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,759
I'm sorry.

296
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,960
I'll call again later.

297
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,200
Since that year,

298
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,880
he and I haven't celebrated
a birthday together.

299
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,039
That's okay,

300
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,880
we can celebrate together

301
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,240
and make it a huge party.

302
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,319
But I just had my birthday.

303
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,680
But Nut's birthday

304
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,079
is coming up this month.

305
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,519
That's right.

306
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,880
It's only a while

307
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,319
until September 8.

308
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,799
You know his birthday?

309
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,200
He told me once.

310
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,079
Nut is back.

311
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,519
Hi, Mom.

312
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,559
Here.

313
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,559
Didn't you eat my food?

314
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,640
Don't look so sad. Open it up first.

315
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,960
YOURS. MOM'S.

316
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:11,960
Tofu pudding.

317
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,160
Beans in syrup.

318
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,920
-Fried tofu.
-Yes.

319
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
You got these for me?

320
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,799
Can't you read?

321
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,319
KEUNCHAI'S

322
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
Keunchai's,

323
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,759
Mom's,

324
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
yours.

325
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,920
Mine.

326
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,720
Thank you, Nut.

327
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,519
I'll finish all the tofu pudding.

328
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:55,200
By the way,

329
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,680
who gave you that pork recipe?

330
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,559
I just followed my gut,

331
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,240
why?

332
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,799
Nothing.

333
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,240
But next time, use less heat.

334
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,519
If I keep eating that,

335
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll get cancer.

336
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay,

337
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,920
it won't be burnt next time.

338
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,000
I said don't burn it.

339
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,279
Yes, not burnt.

340
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,000
I gathered some more evidence.

341
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,799
Before Tatarn was attacked,

342
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,720
apart from his co-worker,
Mrs. Sajjaree Burarat also called him.

343
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,720
-That's Saen's surname.
-Yes.

344
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,319
She's his wife and Tatarn's aunt.

345
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,279
Isn't that odd?

346
00:26:58,839 --> 00:26:59,960
She lives in Bangkok,

347
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,559
but someone saw her in Chiang Mai

348
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,519
when Tatarn was attacked.

349
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,640
Saen never said that his wife
was in Chiang Mai.

350
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,119
It seems like he's hiding something.

351
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,559
Find out

352
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,960
when Sajjaree arrived and left,

353
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,039
and where she went.

354
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,440
Yes, sir.

355
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,599
Please put that away.

356
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,039
Your lieutenant called about the case?

357
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,400
Yes.

358
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,880
We got new evidence
in Neung's friend's case.

359
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,799
So,

360
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,559
do they know who did it?

361
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,119
We still can't say,

362
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,079
but it looks like this wasn't
a normal robbery and attack.

363
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,440
Neung's friend is an activist

364
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,440
and he comes from a wealthy family.

365
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,839
He inherited a lot of money,

366
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,559
so maybe someone is trying to harm him.

367
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,920
The thing I least want to happen

368
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,759
is a family conflict.

369
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,519
That's true, Dad.

370
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,319
If the perpetrator
is someone close to you,

371
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,799
that hurts like nothing else.

372
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,599
Dad,

373
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,559
when do you have to get back to work?

374
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,799
Tomorrow, why?

375
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,799
Nothing.

376
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,440
BRAT

377
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,599
Brat.

378
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,759
BRAT

379
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,279
BRAT

380
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,799
BRAT

381
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,599
What is it, you imp?

382
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Man, you're so cold.

383
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,079
Say what you have to say.

384
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm about to sleep.

385
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
We start filming next week.

386
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,119
So?

387
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,680
Will I get to see you?

388
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:36,960
I don't think so.

389
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,480
But I want to see you.

390
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,400
Why do you want to see me?

391
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,440
Well,

392
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,759
my dad is busy,

393
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,200
so I want an older relative
to come and give me support.

394
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,799
When did I become your relative?

395
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,599
I keep treating you like an uncle

396
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,480
because I wish you were my family.

397
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,519
Oh,

398
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,279
or should I call you

399
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,559
little brother?

400
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,200
You punk, brat, hoodlum,

401
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,880
disrespectful crazy person!

402
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,559
Now, I can sleep soundly.

403
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,079
You're such a psycho.

404
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,759
See you around.

405
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,559
Sweet dreams. Good night.

406
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,480
Kiss, kiss.

407
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,400
Song, you idiot!

408
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,039
I don't know why
I'm so sleepy all the time these days.

409
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,400
If I didn't set three alarms,
I wouldn't have woken up.

410
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,000
I think it's good to rest a lot.

411
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,799
You look much stronger now,

412
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,119
and more energetic during the day too.

413
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,799
-Mom.
-Yes?

414
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,279
We start shooting today,
so you don't need to make me lunch.

415
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,759
I'll eat on the set.

416
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,839
Bye now.

417
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,039
Nut.

418
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,319
Chu.

419
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,839
-Hello.
-Hi.

420
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,119
We went to the market and got you this.

421
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,279
Thank you.

422
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,680
-I'll hold it for you.
-What?

423
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,720
It smells so good.

424
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,559
Hey, listen.

425
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,039
Tofu, do you know where Jan went?

426
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,599
Oh,

427
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,960
is she not home?

428
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,440
No. When I woke up this morning,
I saw her get into a taxi with a suitcase.

429
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,359
She probablyâ€¦

430
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
went to see Mr. Saen in Chiang Mai.

431
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,799
No wonder. They just had a fight.
She must be trying to make it up to him.

432
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,119
Why are you so nosy?

433
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,960
You're unbelievable.

434
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,000
By the way,

435
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,559
how's Na, Tofu?

436
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
She hasn't been out to give alms lately.

437
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,519
She's fine.

438
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,799
Tofu,

439
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,640
you know you can talk to me.

440
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,759
Wellâ€¦

441
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,839
Mrs. Na

442
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,279
hasn't been cooking for Nut.

443
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,319
And she's been feeling sad

444
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,359
and even blaming herself.

445
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,240
She feels worthless.

446
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,839
I understand her, Tofu.

447
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,599
She wants to do things for her son,

448
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
like cook for him.

449
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,960
She wants to do
whatever that makes him happy.

450
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,279
But now that he's a grown-up

451
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,240
and he goes to work,

452
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,079
she feels like

453
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,319
she's not useful anymore.

454
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,559
Do you understand?

455
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,359
And Na is always at home.

456
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,440
She never goes out.

457
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,160
So now

458
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,359
that she's not cooking for her son,

459
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,680
she probably feels worthless.

460
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,359
And what is it like
to feel you're worth something?

461
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,599
Well,

462
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,720
that has to do withâ€¦

463
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,440
I'll let Nhong explain.
He studied engineering.

464
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,839
-Nhong, explain it.
-I went to culinary school.

465
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,279
Come on, explain it.

466
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:45,559
To feel like you're worth something? Wellâ€¦

467
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,720
What?

468
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,960
I guess it's when you make
someone else happy.

469
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,599
But it doesn't have to be anything big.

470
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,079
It can be small things,

471
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,759
like giving them support
and making them smile.

472
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,119
And you also feel happy with them.

473
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,599
I guess that's the feeling

474
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,839
of being worth something.

475
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,960
Thank you.

476
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,199
You two are worth a lot to me today.

477
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,519
-Thank you.
-Heyâ€¦

478
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,480
-The fried dough?
-What?

479
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,719
Oh, it's so nice. Let me have one more.

480
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,920
I'll be off now.

481
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,880
Why did you eat it?

482
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,239
We bought it for him.

483
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,480
-It's for him.
-It's really good.

484
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,880
How can you say that?
Why didn't you give it to him?

485
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,039
Because it's good.

486
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,400
-Try some.
-No.

487
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,760
-It's great.
-You're so bad.

488
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,480
It's really great.

489
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,880
I think I understand now what it means

490
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,840
to feel like you're worth something.

491
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,199
When I was a teddy bear,

492
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
I listened to Nut

493
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,480
when he was happy

494
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,000
and when he was sad.

495
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,639
Now that I'm a person,

496
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,559
I feel I'm worth even more

497
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,719
because I don't just listen,

498
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,360
but I can help Nut and Mrs. Na
with a lot of things.

499
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,639
At least,

500
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,239
I don't have to wait to be hugged anymore.

501
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,880
I can hug someone
to make them feel better.

502
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,800
Even though being a human isn't easy,

503
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm enjoying it more and more.

504
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
Mrs. Na,

505
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,079
shall we make some snacks?

506
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,320
Do you like this location?

507
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,679
The place we booked canceled on us.

508
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Luckily,

509
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,880
my cousin is the deputy director here.

510
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,159
Who?

511
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,840
Joonjuea.

512
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,159
Oh, hi, Pritr.

513
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,559
-I would be in trouble if not for you.
-Yes.

514
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,840
You never come to me
when you're not in trouble.

515
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,159
Heyâ€¦

516
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,519
Oh,

517
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,719
aren't you Peeranut?

518
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,400
This school doesn't actually accept
students in the second semester,

519
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,599
but Na is my friend

520
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:01,480
and Sib has helped me in the past,

521
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,960
so I begged the director to let you in.

522
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,920
Study hard

523
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and don't get me in trouble,

524
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,400
okay?

525
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,639
Don't forget that your parents asked me
to keep an eye on you.

526
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,400
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

527
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,679
It has been around seven to eight years
and you haven't been back once.

528
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,719
Did you write the script for this series?

529
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,039
What's it about?

530
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,920
-Hey!
-Hey!

531
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:45,239
About life in high school?

532
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,519
You didn't use your experience
as material, right?

533
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,280
Of course, I did,

534
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,400
but not all of it.

535
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,920
I have both good memories of this place

536
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,760
and not-so-good ones

537
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
that I personally want to tell.

538
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
But this story isn't just about
the daily lives of kids.

539
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,960
It explores society within a school,

540
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,320
the class system,

541
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,320
power,

542
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,519
and oppression.

543
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,599
Interesting.

544
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,639
Does it

545
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,000
also include your love story?

546
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,159
Of course.

547
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,519
And it's not an odd thing anymore.

548
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,920
But it's still not normal.

549
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,920
If for you, normal means

550
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,960
only thinking the way you do,

551
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,280
then half the world would be abnormal.

552
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,519
For me,

553
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,719
everyone is normal.

554
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,760
Just because I'm not like you

555
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,760
or other people

556
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,679
doesn't mean that I'm not normal.

557
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,559
Please watch this show once it airs.

558
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,400
Maybe

559
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,519
it will help you understand
sexual diversity more

560
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,559
and be respectful to everyone,

561
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,199
no matter their age

562
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,440
or gender.

563
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
Please excuse me.

564
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,440
Cut!

565
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,840
See, Gen?

566
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,000
His acting is superb.

567
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,320
It isn't superb.

568
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,400
And he isn't acting.

569
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,519
He's being himself.

570
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,239
If he irritates you so much,

571
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,880
I can deliver the photos to the client

572
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,920
instead of you.

573
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,639
I don't avoid my responsibilities.

574
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,159
And I'm here

575
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,679
to support Nut.

576
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,760
Are you sure you're here just for Nut?

577
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,880
Aren't you here

578
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,679
especially for me?

579
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,559
I'm here to laugh when you fail.

580
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,159
Song,

581
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,760
go get changed right now.

582
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,119
Cameras, lights,

583
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,679
move to the basketball court.

584
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Hurry up.

585
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,760
Come on.

586
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,559
Juea.

587
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,519
What now?

588
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,760
The extra playing
the rival basketball captain

589
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,199
crashed his bike and is in the hospital.

590
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,000
What do we do?

591
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,000
Who can play basketball?

592
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,960
Call and see if we can get

593
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,159
someone in time?

594
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,199
I think we have someone.

595
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,760
I brought some food for Nut.

596
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,639
Isn't that kid with Nut?

597
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,599
That's right.

598
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,559
He plays basketball?

599
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,599
He doesn't just play. He's a god.

600
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,760
Andâ€¦

601
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,880
action!

602
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,519
Okay.

603
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,760
One more time.

604
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,039
What do you want to eat?

605
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:33,679
Daydreaming again.

606
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:10,719
Hey,

607
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,519
Nut!

608
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,639
Neung.

609
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,639
Are you okay?

610
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Hey,

611
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,559
Tofu!

612
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,360
Hey.

613
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,199
Here we are.

614
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,199
Are you okay, Tofu?

615
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,320
Can you keep playing?

616
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,360
Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore.

617
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,280
What's wrong with you, Nut?

618
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,119
Why did you barge into the set?

619
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,719
I'm sorry.

620
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,519
I was distracted.

621
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,599
Are you okay?

622
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,599
I am.

623
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,400
-Juea.
-What?

624
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,679
Keep shooting.

625
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,880
I'll go to the toilet.

626
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,679
-It's over there.
-I know.

627
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:55,800
Hey, I own this company.

628
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,920
Is it because we're at his school?

629
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,719
Why does he seem so distracted?

630
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,239
This is Nut's school?

631
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,519
I just found out too.

632
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,480
I met my cousin, the deputy director here,
this morning.

633
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,639
She said hello,
but he completely ignored her.

634
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:15,119
I guess he doesn't like her.

635
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,840
He's really stressed out

636
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,239
that we're shooting here.

637
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,000
Maybe he has some bad memories
about school?

638
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,559
Peeranut.

639
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,480
I know what you did.

640
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,199
Because of that,

641
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,880
I'll have to tell your parents
what you did.

642
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:19,960
Hey,

643
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,880
why aren't you in the girls' toilet?

644
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
You want to see our junk?

645
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:29,039
Does your dad know you're a sissy?

646
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,159
Hi, sissy!

647
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,280
Think you can fight me?

648
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,920
Why don't you go
ask your beloved Neung for help?

649
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,599
Oh, sissy!

650
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,440
This is a toilet, not a kennel.

651
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,000
If you're not peeing, get out!

652
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,000
If you want to gang up,
meet me on the court.

653
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,800
I'll play all of you.

654
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,760
Hey, let's go.

655
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,920
Are you okay, Nut?

656
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,719
I'm fine.

657
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,920
Thank you.

658
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,119
Nut.

659
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,920
I'm sorry.

660
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,800
It's okay,

661
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,159
it's just the film.

662
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:55,360
I'll get it replaced.

663
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,280
How did you become an extra?

664
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,239
Oh, Iâ€¦

665
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,920
Jeez.

666
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,159
I brought you a snack.

667
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:10,400
Your mom and I made it.

668
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,519
There were a lot of apples in the fridge,

669
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,000
so we made apple jelly for you.

670
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,199
I won't eat that.

671
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,760
Please try it. It's good.

672
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,320
How many times did I tell you

673
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,679
there's food on the set?

674
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,280
You don't need to bring anything.

675
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,360
But thanks

676
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,159
for trying to help me.

677
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,039
But don't do it again.

678
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,360
Why not?

679
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,440
People shouldn't get hurt for me.

680
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,440
I don't want you to get hurt either.

681
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,480
If you won't let me help,
then take good care of yourself.

682
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,000
I know.

683
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,199
I won't walk
onto a basketball court again.

684
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,239
Don't worry.

685
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,559
Nut.

686
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,599
Nut.

687
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,480
What were you staring at
so intently just now?

688
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,840
Song likes to stare
at something like that too.

689
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,000
Facebook.

690
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:36,320
Facebook?

691
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,599
It's like a notebook for your memories,

692
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,199
for contacting people.

693
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:44,639
Memories?

694
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:46,960
Why do you need to record them?

695
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,360
Why not just remember them?

696
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,360
Who can remember everything?

697
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,679
What if I get Alzheimer's

698
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,400
or lose my memory, like you?

699
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,159
Hey,

700
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,159
you should have a Facebook.

701
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:03,000
If we try to find it,

702
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,400
maybe we'll know who you are.

703
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,239
I don't have one.

704
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:15,960
Well,

705
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,480
how can I?

706
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,880
I don't even know what it is.

707
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,679
Can you teach me how to use Facebook?

708
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:27,559
You said that

709
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,000
if I remember who I am,

710
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,719
I have to leave.

711
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,920
I want to record my time with you,

712
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,119
so it can be my memory.

713
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,760
Cut.

714
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,519
That's a wrap!

715
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,039
Good job, everyone.

716
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:10,840
See you next week.

717
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,639
Let's go.

718
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:19,960
Mister,

719
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,519
how was I today?

720
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,679
As annoying as ever.

721
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,599
Oh, come on. I'm being serious.

722
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,800
What's your score
for my first day of acting?

723
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,159
Ten.

724
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,599
Out of a hundred.

725
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,039
Hey, that's not true.

726
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:47,559
I got through every scene in two
to three takes. Even Juea said I was good.

727
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,719
How can you give me just ten?

728
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,880
You've already complimented yourself.

729
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,119
You need me to do it too?

730
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,519
Well, I want you to praise me.

731
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:01,960
Doesn't your dad do that?

732
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:03,840
What do you need me for?

733
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,400
Song,

734
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,159
please go get changed.

735
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:16,679
Yes.

736
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,239
Hey, Song,

737
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,960
come eat with us.

738
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:35,960
Oh,

739
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,679
no thanks, Juea.

740
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,800
I have to go submit a report.

741
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,760
Okay then.

742
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,960
See you next week.

743
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,559
See you, Juea.

744
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:47,280
Hurry up.

745
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,280
Are you really mad at me?

746
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,840
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,400
I didn't know you were sensitiveâ€¦

748
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,800
about your dad.

749
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:21,559
If you feel bad

750
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:24,480
about hurting my poor little heart,

751
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,679
I'll let you make up for it

752
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:30,679
by driving me home.

753
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,920
What?

754
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,559
Wait,

755
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:35,519
are you high?

756
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,119
Why do I have to drive you home?

757
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,199
Just ride your bike home.

758
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,079
How can I?

759
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,840
I left it at home.

760
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:47,199
I knew you would drive here,

761
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,199
so I didn't bring my bike.

762
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,440
Please take me home.

763
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,800
Please, please,

764
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,320
please, please.

765
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:01,679
I promise

766
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,320
I won't be mad at you anymore.

767
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:05,800
Please, mister.

768
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:09,159
Get your head here.

769
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,000
Get your head here!

770
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:12,239
Take that!

771
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,280
Come on, take me home.

772
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,440
Go home by yourself.

773
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:18,400
You're being funny?

774
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,119
Come on,

775
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm all sweaty now.

776
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,320
Isn't your dad home?

777
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,159
He works in Chiang Mai.

778
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,280
He rarely comes home.

779
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,679
Why don't you go live with him?

780
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,239
I'm an adult.

781
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,639
I can take care of myself.

782
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,039
Besides,

783
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,000
I want to go to university here.

784
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,239
Where's your mom?

785
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,239
Sheâ€¦

786
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,199
died soon after Neung did.

787
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:15,880
Hey,

788
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,320
if you're going to ask so many questions,

789
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,039
why don't you come in?

790
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,039
I promise

791
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,360
to tell you my whole life story tonight.

792
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,320
Come on in,

793
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,679
huh?

794
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,840
No, I'm leaving.

795
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,599
Drive safely.

796
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,679
Don't just think about me

797
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,440
and hit someone's car.

798
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:44,360
Go inside now,

799
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,920
Song, you little brat.

800
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,639
Thanks for bringing me home.

801
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
Hey, Song, come eat with us.

802
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:32,679
Oh, no thanks, Juea.

803
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,880
I have to go submit a report.

804
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:39,400
You're a delivery boy.

805
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,519
If you can't find food, that's on you.

806
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,320
Oh, man.

807
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:03,400
Hello?

808
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,039
Hello, sir.

809
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,159
Would you like an egg
with your congee or not?

810
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,119
What?

811
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:11,880
I didn't order any congee.

812
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Someone ordered it for you.

813
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,360
Really?

814
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,039
Then no egg please.

815
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,920
Okay, thank you very much.

816
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,440
SONG: YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID
YOU WANTED TO SURPRISE ME.

817
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,159
SONG: WHAT IF I HAD A HEART ATTACK?

818
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:57,280
SONG: YOU WOULD HAVE WASTED MONEY
AND ALSO BE SAD.

819
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,000
GENSIT: WOULD IT KILL YOU
TO SAY THANK YOU?

820
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:19,400
SONG: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, KISS, KISS.

821
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,840
Hi, Tofu.

822
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,239
Today, Nut is wearing a dark blue shirt,

823
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,679
grey trousers,

824
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,360
a black backpack,

825
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,639
and a silver bracelet.

826
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,440
He's leaving the house at 9:06 a.m.

827
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,840
He looks confused

828
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,239
and so adorable
that I have to take a picture.

829
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,280
What are you doing?

830
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,480
Recording my memories with you.

831
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:22,960
I have a Facebook now.

832
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,519
Well,

833
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,360
you had locked your door last night,

834
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,280
so I called and asked Song to teach me.

835
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,159
You can't even type properly

836
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,960
and you still want one?

837
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,639
What's so special about it

838
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,719
that you needed Song's help?

839
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,320
Do you really want to use it

840
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:42,960
or do youâ€¦

841
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,119
Song said

842
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,079
I had to have a Facebook first

843
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,880
before I can add you as my boyfriend.

844
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,960
Add what now?

845
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:52,719
Boyfriend.

846
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,960
Song said

847
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,440
I can't add you as a friend

848
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,440
since I don't want to be friends with you.

849
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,119
Boyfriend my ass.

850
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,280
What did Song teach you?

851
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:05,440
Don't let me catch him.

852
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,719
Wait, Nut.

853
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,920
What is it now?

854
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,440
Please accept my boyfriend request?

855
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,800
Boyfriend my ass.

856
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,440
Nut.

857
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:50,719
Nut,

858
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,719
be honest with me.

859
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,800
Have you not been in love for a while?

860
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,199
You didn't have to choke.

861
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,400
So? Tell me.

862
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,239
I was startled.

863
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:07,119
Why did you ask me that?

864
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:08,480
Because of this.

865
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,400
I read your script. It's terrible.

866
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,400
The cutesy, romantic scenes

867
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,920
aren't cute or romantic at all.

868
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,960
I almost fell asleep.

869
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,920
You said you wrote it from experience.

870
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,360
What's the matter?

871
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,280
Real life

872
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,000
isn't sweet like candy, you know.

873
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,679
This is a BL series.

874
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,400
You need cute and romantic scenes
to please the audience.

875
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,400
I know,

876
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,400
but I'm not good at it.

877
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,880
You keep saying that,

878
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,079
and I understand.

879
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,000
You're used to writing realistic,
socially reflective scripts,

880
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,360
but the network doesn't want that.

881
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,000
They want something new.

882
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:48,239
Nut,

883
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,519
I think you're stuck in a rut.

884
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:55,039
I don't know what your problem is.

885
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,719
But I feel like
there's a wall in front of you.

886
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,559
I gave you a ladder, but why don't you
have the courage to climb it?

887
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,639
Go back

888
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:11,760
and think about
what your problem is and fix it.

889
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,079
I don't want to see a wall
in front of you your whole life.

890
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:48,360
We've already started shooting. Hurry up.

891
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,920
I don't want to give your ladder
to someone else.

892
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,559
Go find some references.

893
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,519
BE WITH YOU

894
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,039
Nut.

895
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,039
Why didn't you knock first?

896
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,639
Won't you accept my boyfriend request?

897
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,719
Get out.

898
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,719
Go.

899
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:07,519
Such nonsense.

900
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:08,920
Nut!

901
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,440
I'm working!

902
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,960
I can't add you as a boyfriend

903
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:19,559
or a friend.

904
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,400
What must I do to see your profile?

905
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:25,960
Just keep going at it,

906
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,880
and he'll soften up.

907
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,280
Believe me, Tofu, I have experience.

908
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:35,159
Really.

909
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:39,159
Oh, I have to go now.

910
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,960
Is it still edible?

911
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:17,039
Look,

912
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:19,199
-I'm eating the congee.
-Hey,

913
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,640
you're eating it just now?

914
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,439
Well, you bought it for me,
so I wanted to treasure it.

915
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,479
Then let it spoil
because that's all you'll get from me.

916
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,079
Oh, you're so mean.

917
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:34,720
How can I throw it away?

918
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,359
If I did, it would be like
throwing away your heart.

919
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:40,279
That's enough. Bye.

920
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,119
Enjoy your food.

921
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,960
Did you wolf it all down?

922
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,640
Come here.

923
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,720
We're friends now.

924
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,319
From now on, you're part of my memory,

925
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,560
Kuenchai.

926
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,159
Let's make up.

927
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,479
Yeah.

928
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,199
If I go back to being a teddy bear,

929
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,920
will I still have my memories as a human?

930
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,560
But people's memories
also fade every day, right?

931
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,000
That's why they use things to record them,

932
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:53,960
like photos, notebooks,

933
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:54,960
Facebook,

934
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,319
or even text messages.

935
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:15,920
Nut's Facebook

936
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,159
is probably full of his memories.

937
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:21,399
And maybe it also includes

938
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,279
what I'm looking for.

939
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,760
Nut's old school,

940
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,199
his Facebook,

941
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:43,720
and people from his past.

942
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,760
LANNA HOSPITAL

943
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,439
EMERGENCY

944
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,159
If you want it,

945
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,520
wait until I'm dead.

946
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,520
Your land is next to mine.

947
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,840
Just sell yours.

948
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,359
The client wants a big plot.

949
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:17,359
If you won't sell yours, I can't either.

950
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,960
Since you're not using it for anything,

951
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:22,119
just sell it.

952
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:24,600
Wasn't this your intention all along

953
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,680
when you bought the land next to Dad's?

954
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:29,600
I was just trying to make a profit.

955
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,840
You want a big plot
to sell to a financier, don't you?

956
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:37,279
Whoever I sell to is my business.

957
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,039
Are you going to sell it or not?

958
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:41,680
If they plan to build a factory

959
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,560
that will affect the environment there,

960
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,520
I'm not selling it.

961
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
I don't need money.

962
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,279
Oh,

963
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:49,079
you big environmentalist.

964
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:51,840
You care about saving the world
and helping other people,

965
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,640
but you won't help a relative like me?

966
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,960
You still consider me a relative?

967
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:00,720
When Mom and Dad died,

968
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,720
I didn't even see your name
at the funeral.

969
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,000
Don't call me family
only when you need something.

970
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:10,560
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

971
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,560
Your parents benefited
from the family business too!

972
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,279
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

973
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,720
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

974
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,119
If you want it,

975
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,159
wait until I'm dead.

976
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,720
Jan.

977
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:03,359
When did you arrive?

978
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,960
You said I didn't care about him.
Well, here I am.

979
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,920
I don't believe that you would come here
just because I said so.

980
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,239
Something is up, isn't it?

981
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,880
I did arrive in Chiang Mai
one day before Tatarn was attacked.

982
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,960
We met up at a cafe

983
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:30,680
near my hotel to talk about land.

984
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,760
Land?

985
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:33,279
Yes,

986
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:36,399
the piece of land in Ratchaburi
that he inherited.

987
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:40,479
A buyer is interested and contacted me
because I'm his last living relative.

988
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,319
I was arranging the business deal.

989
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,760
But after that,

990
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,640
I didn't see him again,

991
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,399
because I returned to Bangkok
the following day.

992
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,199
But you took a late flight.

993
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,399
Where did you go and what did you do?

994
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:02,439
Oh,

995
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,640
do you need to know all that?

996
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,880
Yes,

997
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:10,720
I need to talk to everyone
who is involved with Tatarn.

998
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:12,880
Please cooperate.

999
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yes.

1000
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,600
Well, I didn't do much.

1001
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,119
I stayed at the hotel.

1002
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:30,319
In the evening, I went out for dinnerâ€¦

1003
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,039
then I went to the airport.

1004
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:41,920
Even though Tatarn and I
had some problems,

1005
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:44,520
I never wanted to kill him.

1006
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,920
I assure you,

1007
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,720
I had nothing to do with the attack.

1008
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,359
SARAPEE POLICE STATION

1009
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,640
She may have a financial motive,

1010
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,960
but there's no evidence that she did it.

1011
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,319
When I asked Saen

1012
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,960
if Tatarn had any problems with anyone,

1013
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:35,800
he didn't mention Sajjaree at all.

1014
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,000
Is it possible that they're in
on it together?

1015
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,439
Why did the police question you?

1016
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,159
Were you here when he was attacked?

1017
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:54,800
Why should I tell you?

1018
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,000
You never tell me where you're going.

1019
01:15:58,039 --> 01:16:01,159
If you want to know so much,
I'll tell you.

1020
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:03,479
I came to talk to Tatarn that day
about land.

1021
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,119
Is that all?

1022
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:09,960
Do you think there's something more?

1023
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,760
Do you think I hurt him?

1024
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,479
Listen.

1025
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,680
If you want to know more,
go ask the police.

1026
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,840
I already told them everything.

1027
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,920
I'm leaving now.

1028
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,199
Man,

1029
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:46,640
people are so complicated.

1030
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:48,720
What's that, Tofu?

1031
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,279
He's so eloquent now that he's human,

1032
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,079
so highbrow.

1033
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,520
It's Nut.

1034
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:58,680
He's so good-looking.

1035
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,880
Seriously? How?

1036
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,880
He looks mad all the time.

1037
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,199
But okay, I get that he's like your god,

1038
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:08,720
so say whatever you want.

1039
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:10,600
He's so cute

1040
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:12,359
and he's usually kind,

1041
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,279
but he was really mean today.

1042
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:17,800
What did he do to you?

1043
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,920
Nut.

1044
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,399
I brought you some milk.

1045
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,720
Nut.

1046
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,840
FIRST LOVE

1047
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,359
Nut, do you want some fruit?

1048
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,279
Yes,

1049
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:02,479
I'm revising it now.

1050
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,000
LET'S EAT. YOUR MOM IS WAITING.
I'M HUNGRY TOO.

1051
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:15,680
He does nothing but work.

1052
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,640
I don't know what to do.

1053
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:12,119
Kuenchai.

1054
01:20:16,039 --> 01:20:17,000
Kuenchai.

1055
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,199
Get down.

1056
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:21,600
Get down.

1057
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:30,439
Tofu!

1058
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,279
Tofu,

1059
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:03,840
where did you get a key to my room?

1060
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,119
Wellâ€¦

1061
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,960
Who gave it to you?

1062
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,880
It's my Mom, isn't it?

1063
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:22,159
Isn't it?

1064
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:25,680
Why did you go in there?

1065
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,920
What do you want?

1066
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,760
-Nut.
-Why did you go inside my room?

1067
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,800
I'm sorry.

1068
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:32,720
Mrs. Na was worried about you.

1069
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,840
You're doing this again, Mom!

1070
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,079
When will you understand

1071
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,000
that going into someone's room
without permission

1072
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:49,920
is an invasion of privacy?

1073
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:54,159
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1074
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,520
You did!

1075
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:58,560
Both then and now.

1076
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,159
You meant to.

1077
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:04,199
Stop using love as an excuse.

1078
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,279
You just want to control everything

1079
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:10,000
without respecting my rights.

1080
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,800
What happened?

1081
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:16,159
Iâ€¦

1082
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,600
Stop talking!

1083
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,840
It won't make anything better.

1084
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:23,399
Nut, calm down.

1085
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:24,479
Are you hungry?

1086
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,640
I made some of that burnt pork you like.

1087
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,960
I won't eat it!

1088
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,840
Nut,

1089
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,439
come with me right now.

1090
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,960
Come here this instant.

1091
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,239
What's wrong with you?

1092
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,960
You're out of control!

1093
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,520
Didn't you hear what my mom did?

1094
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,720
What your mom did,

1095
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:57,960
she did it
because she's worried about you.

1096
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:01,560
Okay.

1097
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,399
Her method may have been wrong,

1098
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,199
but you're guilty too.

1099
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,279
It's because you're doing this.

1100
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:11,119
You lock yourself in your room
and just work.

1101
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,279
You never pick up my calls,

1102
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,720
isn't that true?

1103
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,800
Honestly,

1104
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,039
what's your problem?

1105
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,760
I'm stressed about work.

1106
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,960
I can't write romantic scenes for Juea.

1107
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:36,720
Why? I thought the story
was based on your life.

1108
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,279
Or did things between you and Neung

1109
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,520
not end well?

1110
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,399
I never went out with him.

1111
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,479
Then who did you date?

1112
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,880
Nut,

1113
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,239
whatever makes you unhappy,

1114
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:58,439
don't think about it.

1115
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,000
Don't obsess over it.

1116
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:03,960
Look ahead,

1117
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,079
look around you,

1118
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,600
and open up your heart.

1119
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:11,439
It might make you happier.

1120
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:13,560
What are you saying?

1121
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:15,640
You'll find me a boyfriend?

1122
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,920
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

1123
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:22,000
is to find a new one, right?

1124
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,800
If you're happy,

1125
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:27,840
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

1126
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,960
will come to you naturally.

1127
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,000
That's easier said than done.

1128
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,520
I've been looking,

1129
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,079
but I haven't found anyone.

1130
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,359
You know that.

1131
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:42,760
Shall I find someone for you?

1132
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:43,800
It's easy.

1133
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,439
Two people you know,

1134
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,920
they're crazy about you.

1135
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,319
It's either Prib or Tofu.

1136
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm sorry, Prib.

1137
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,680
You cooked for Nut,

1138
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,520
but I made him angry,

1139
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:01,600
soâ€¦

1140
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,199
It's fine.

1141
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:06,520
It's not your fault.

1142
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,439
Not Nut's fault either.

1143
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:10,760
It was an accident.

1144
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,239
I understand.

1145
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:14,479
I can cook again another time.

1146
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:31,039
It's okay. I'll clean it up.

1147
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,159
By the way,

1148
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,560
how come Nut's work
has to be revised so much?

1149
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:43,439
Do you know?

1150
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,920
Juea said his romantic scenes
still aren't good enough.

1151
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,119
I guess his past is pretty bitter.

1152
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:54,359
What does his past

1153
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,600
have to do with his work?

1154
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,560
He's writing about his life.

1155
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:00,880
Even if it's a little sad,

1156
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,600
that's okay,

1157
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,880
because I'll add sweetness to his life,

1158
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,760
and then things will go well.

1159
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,960
I'm sorry, Prib.

1160
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,880
You too, Tofu.

1161
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:24,520
Sorry for losing my temper.

1162
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,640
It's okay, Nut.

1163
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,800
I understand everything.

1164
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,239
I'll make you fried pork another time.

1165
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,720
You can look forward to that.

1166
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,359
Something wrong, Gen?

1167
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,119
I have an emergency.

1168
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,359
Sorry, Prib. Go home by yourself.

1169
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:46,520
What?

1170
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:55,840
Nut.

1171
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:00,720
All right,

1172
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:03,319
I'll call you a taxi.

1173
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,279
You're doing this again, Mom!

1174
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:24,680
When will you understand

1175
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:27,560
that going into someone's room
without permission

1176
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,439
is an invasion of privacy?

1177
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:44,520
What are you doing?

1178
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:49,199
I just want to know what you wrote.

1179
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:53,960
What I write is my business.

1180
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,319
NEXT EPISODE

1181
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:12,760
Mister.

1182
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:14,600
Song!

1183
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,079
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

1184
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:21,119
But you chose to get involved.

1185
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,239
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

1186
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:26,039
without affecting our work.

Are you happy, Nut?
