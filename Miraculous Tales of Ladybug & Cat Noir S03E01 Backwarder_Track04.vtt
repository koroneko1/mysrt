00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.020

‎Wait! We have to fight, Fu!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.820
‎Let's use the Miraculous. I'll take
‎the Ladybug and you take the Black Cat.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.220
‎But what if we fail? They'll get the box.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.780
‎And the world will end! Come with me!
‎We'll be safe in England!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.860
‎-Marianne?
‎-Leave without me.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.140
‎I'd rather stay and resist,
‎even without the Miraculous.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.020
‎I'll come back for this. And you.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.620
‎I'll be waiting for you.
‎Right here. Every day.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.580
‎Marianne,
‎I've never told you this, but I...

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.940
‎Shh! Tell me when you come back!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.380
‎ Over there! Catch them!

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.340
‎Now go!

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.860
‎ Come on! Faster! The box!
‎We must get the box!

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.980
‎Girls, we have a very serious situation!

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.580
‎Adrien and his father have been invited
‎to the royal wedding this weekend.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.220
‎That's the "emergency" you called us
‎over here for on a Saturday morning?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.020
‎You don't get it!
‎Kagami and her mother are going, too!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.820
‎Which means Adrien and Kagami
‎will spend an entire weekend together!

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.540
‎And?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.580
‎What if Adrien is blown away
‎by her dress and hairstyle?

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.140
‎And if they dance together?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.140
‎And what if they tour the city
‎on a romantic horse ride?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.020
‎It would be the end of the world! They are
‎taking the Star Train to London at 11 AM!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.180
‎That's in less than two hours!
‎We've gotta do something, fast!

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.620
‎-Ugh!
‎-We could...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.220
‎organise a demonstration
‎and make the trains go on strike?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.820
‎Nah! They'd just take a helicopter
‎or a private jet.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
‎I know! We'll dress you up
‎as British megastar Adeline,

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.100
‎so you can slip into Buckingham Palace!

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.780
‎You'll lure Adrien away from Kagami
‎at the reception

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.020
‎and waltz with him
‎in the grand ballroom and--

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.100
‎Then, when Adrien finds out
‎you're not who he thought you were,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.500
‎he'll be disappointed
‎because he hates lying.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.060
‎He'll fall head over heels in love
‎with Kagami, given that she never lies,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.620
‎and you'll get locked away
‎in the Tower of London.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.700
‎Why don't you just kidnap Kagami?
‎That's cool.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.300
‎-That would be bad!
‎-No way we can do that, Juleka!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.220
‎Listen, Marinette, the best thing to do
‎is just spill your guts to Adrien

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.620
‎once and for all,
‎before he takes off for London!

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.260
‎-Couldn't we try Juleka's idea instead?
‎-Mmm, mmm!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.180
‎But I just can't do that! I can't talk to
‎him without stumbling all over my words!

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.700
‎I've been trying for months and...

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.660
‎And... you're right!
‎It's about time things changed!

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.420
‎I'll find the courage, somehow!
‎Thanks, girls!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.700
‎-You sure you'll be OK?
‎-Yeah, sure!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.740
‎I'll let you know what happens!
‎Bye, girls!

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.860
‎-Wayzz! What's going on?
‎-Marinette, you must come with me!

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.460
‎Master Fu needs you!

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.500
‎Do you think it's serious?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.660
‎Master Fu
‎wouldn't send Wayzz if it wasn't!

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.460
‎You mean like the time
‎he locked himself out of the house?

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.340
‎It's about time Fu learned
‎how to write and send texts!

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.900
‎Write! Thank you, Tikki!
‎That's the answer!

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.980
‎I'm gonna write Adrien a letter
‎and give it to him just before he leaves.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.380
‎Then I won't mess up anything
‎when I open my mouth!

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.740
‎"Dearest you... When you love someone,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.860
‎you must never hold back
‎from telling them.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.900
‎One day, you might realise it's too late

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.620
‎and all your hopes and dreams are ruined,
‎with no way to go back in time.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.540
‎I want to tell it to you today, before you
‎leave, so you can take my words with you.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.780
‎I hope they'll make their way to
‎your heart and, when you come back,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.260
‎you'll give me a chance to prove how true
‎these words really are. I love you."

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.220
‎-I love you!
‎-Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.940
‎-She's got a crush!
‎-Look at her, she's got a crush!

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.340
‎Come on, kids!
‎It's not nice to make fun of poets!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.780
‎Maybe this isn't
‎such a good idea after all.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.780
‎Marinette...

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.740
‎Doctor! Is Master F... I mean, Grandpa OK?

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820
‎Of course he is.
‎You know what men are like.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.900
‎-A hiccup and they think they're dying!
‎-My time has come!

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.540
‎Here you go! Fetch this from the pharmacy
‎and he'll be back on his feet in no time.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.580
‎And don't forget to eat more veggies,
‎Mr Chan! You need fibre, for gut's sake!

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.620
‎-Mr Chan?
‎-You can never be too careful!

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.020
‎Marinette, if anything happens to me,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.740
‎I want you to take care
‎of the Miracle Box!

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.340
‎-You'll be the new guardian, and--
‎-Oh, come on, Master Fu,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420
‎you're overreacting!
‎It's just a little bellyache!

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.620
‎I am 186 years old, remember.
‎The doctor doesn't know that.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.060
‎You're going to be fine.
‎I'll go and fetch your medication, then.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.980
‎Wait! That's not why I called you here.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.940
‎Go to the address written here,
‎down on the riverbanks, at 11:00am.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.820
‎You'll see a woman there wearing a pretty
‎brooch shaped like a Chinese ideogram.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.700
‎-Give her this letter.
‎-Who is she, Master?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.940
‎Someone I've always loved,
‎but have never seized the moment to tell.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.060
‎Master! You've got a sweetheart!
‎But... why today?

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.580
‎Because I'm just realising
‎that I've waited way too long.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.340
‎I don't know how much time I have left,
‎but I don't want to waste another moment.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.780
‎You're so right! If you don't do it now,
‎you'll probably never do it!

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.980
‎I'm going to do what I need to do today,
‎too!

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.980
‎-Thank you.
‎-Bring the medication back fast!

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.820
‎I don't care what the doctor says.
‎I don't have a good feeling about this!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.700
‎You can count on me, Wayzz!

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.020
‎Hey, wait! Adrien's train is leaving at...
‎Oh, no! That's in 20 minutes!

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.740
‎The meds, Master Fu's and Adrien's letter.
‎You won't have time to do everything!

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.820
‎I won't have time! But we might!

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.340
‎Tikki! Spots on!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.140
‎Yeah!

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.700
‎Spots off!

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.260
‎-Adrien!
‎-Marinette?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.460
‎Here! Read this in the drain...
‎on the train.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.140
‎I've never told you kiss... this...
‎but what I want more than anything else

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.700
‎is written on this piece of paper...
‎and only you can give it to me.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.060
‎Sorry! Medical emergency!

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.740
‎I did it! I gave him the letter!
‎I actually did it! After all this time!

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.580
‎Why did I wait so long? It was so easy!

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.860
‎I'm so proud of you, Marinette!
‎You were right to take the plunge!

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.780
‎All right, time for the next one!
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.460
‎I'm feeling a sense of uneasiness in you,
‎Gabriel-san!

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.500
‎I think I just don't like
‎being away from home, that's all.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.900
‎He who hopes gives himself
‎the opportunity to obtain what he desires.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.020
‎But he who fears always ends up
‎with the very thing he dreads.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.940
‎I shall remember that, Tsurugi-san.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.420
‎-Hello again, Mr Ramier.
‎-How are you today, Miss Lenoir?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.780
‎Today's the day!
‎I know he's coming. I can feel it.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.180
‎He really is a very lucky man.
‎He doesn't deserve you!

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.780
‎-Hello, ma'am!
‎-Look! Ladybug?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.380
‎Yeah. I have a letter for you.
‎The mailman asked me to give it to you,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.860
‎-because there was something wrong with--
‎-I know perfectly well who sent you.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.700
‎-Oh!
‎-Go now.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.500
‎The less we talk,
‎the safer your secret will be.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.220
‎But thank you, Ladybug.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.940
‎I've been waiting for this moment
‎for a very long time.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.340
‎You're welcome, ma'am!
‎It was very nice meeting you!

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.620
‎Morning, ma'am!

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.980
‎Here! It's very urgent!

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.380
‎Uh, look... Thank you for this
‎very moving, heartfelt declaration,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.660
‎but I'm taken and my name's not Marianne.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.380
‎Uh! So, if you have Master Fu's letter,
‎who's got the prescription?

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.700
‎"When you love someone,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.620
‎you must never hold back from telling them
‎when you have the chance.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.540
‎Because, one day,
‎you might realise that it's too late

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.340
‎and that all your hopes and dreams
‎are ruined,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.340
‎with no way to go back in time
‎and do it over."

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.300
‎"Too late?" "Hopes and dreams... ruined?"

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.340
‎This means he doesn't love me any more?
‎That it's too late for the two of us?

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.900
‎-Oh! Miss Lenoir!
‎-We promised each other...

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.460
‎All this pain... All these years
‎of waiting... for nothing!

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.180
‎-Father?
‎-We are about to depart.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.140
‎-Stand clear of the doors.
‎-This train will not depart till I say so.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.380
‎Who do you think you are?

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.180
‎I am Gabriel Agreste
‎and I'm not feeling well.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.260
‎And until I'm feeling better,
‎nobody goes anywhere! Is that clear?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.340
‎Mmm-hmm. Yes. I'm sorry, Mr Agreste.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.020
‎-We've got work to do.
‎-Ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.700
‎we have a sick passenger on board.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.660
‎Our departure will therefore be
‎slightly delayed until further notice.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.500
‎I can feel a whole lifetime of hope...

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.260
‎The hope of being reunited
‎with one's true love,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.020
‎only to find out
‎that the waiting has been in vain!

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.420
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise her!

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.260
‎Miss Lenoir? Wait!

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.220
‎Backwarder! I am Hawk Moth!

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.380
‎I'm granting you the power to make up
‎for lost time by stealing it from others!

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.700
‎All I ask for in return
‎is Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.060
‎Thank you for giving me a second chance,
‎Hawk Moth!

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.340
‎Mrs Lenoir?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.940
‎No more time to waste!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.620
<i>‎This just in. There's a new</i>
<i>‎supervillain at large.</i>

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.100
‎I... I'd better go check on my father!

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.060
‎-Occupied.
‎-Oops! Sorry!

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.660
‎Gotta go, huh?

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.380
‎Plagg! Claws out!

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.060
‎Oh, no! I've seen that brooch before!
‎If my love letter

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.740
‎caused this kind of reaction,
‎it's a good thing Adrien didn't read it!

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.300
‎Oh, no!

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.940
‎Phew! Here!
‎You'll be safe here in a meantime!

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.220
‎Oops! Milady, OK you are?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.580
‎-Are you OK, Milady?
‎-They've been hit by a supervillain!

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.460
‎I saw that. Looks like
‎she's making them go back in time.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.460
‎I'm sure the akumatised object
‎is the brooch with the Chinese ideogram.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.700
‎I trust you!

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.500
‎-Not so fast!
‎-There you are again, you ghastly bug!

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.100
‎Once I've touched you, all I have to do
‎is wait for you to transform back!

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.620
‎-Then you can give me her Miraculous!
‎-Not right now.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.420
‎First, I'll follow her
‎so that she can lead me back to the man

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.180
‎who gave her those earrings!

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.820
‎What? You know the Guardian of
‎the Miraculous? You must take me to him!

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.020
‎Fu? Of course!
‎He's the one who broke my heart.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.580
‎He's been hiding
‎under a false name for a long time.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.380
‎But now, thanks to you, Hawk Moth,
‎I'm going to find him again, at last,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.740
‎and make up for all that lost time!

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.460
‎Ha, ha, ha!
‎What a delightful twist of fate!

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.980
‎Cat Noir, I was at Master Fu's earlier!
‎We can't let her touch me,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.900
‎or she'll lead Hawk Moth
‎straight to the Miracle Box!

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.700
‎I'll gladly be your bodyguard, Milady!

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.780
‎In no time, you'll be back the way
‎you were before you got akumatised!

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.580
‎Return to sender!

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.900
‎Hey! Be nice to Milady!

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.820
‎You're wasting your time
‎while I grow stronger!

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.100
‎We won't defeat her this way, Cat Noir!

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.340
‎All I need is one hit!

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.540
‎Ha, ha! Time's up, Cat Noir!

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.220
‎Grr!

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.980
‎Wanna play hide-and-seek, huh?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.100
‎I've got all the time in the world!
‎I'll find you sooner or later!

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.340
‎And once I've defeated you,
‎you'll lead me straight to my sweetheart!

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.340
‎Then, I'll be able to get my hands
‎on not only their Miraculous,

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.140
‎but all the other magic jewels as well!
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.620
‎-It's time we made a plan!
‎-A helping hand from fate is in order!

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.100
‎Lucky charm!

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.820
‎-A pipe?
‎-That's incredible!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.980
‎I was just thinking, "Why don't we redo
‎the fountain's plumbing while we're here?"

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.620
‎OK! I know what to do. Follow me!

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.340
‎She's gone away.
‎Quick! Let's make the most of it!

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.380
‎-Take this!
‎-Hmm?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.500
‎There! Now tie the pipe round your ankle!

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.580
‎This seems more convoluted than usual.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.660
‎It's the most complicated ever!
‎I have to stay focused!

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.740
‎-I'm with you, Milady!
‎-OK! Now, stretch your arm out like this

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.940
‎and take a few steps back
‎until the string is pulled tight.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.340
‎Perfect! Now raise your arm
‎and say "cataclysm" backwards!

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.340
‎Mylsc... slymca... "msylcatac!"

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.300
‎-Msylcatac!
‎-Excellent! Now pull the tube back to you!

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.900
‎-Right, now, follow me!
‎-To the ends of the Earth, Milady!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.540
‎Come on!
‎You're merely delaying the inevitable!

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.580
‎Sorry, we got a little held back!
‎But we're all yours now. No more timeouts!

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.500
‎My sweet, darling Fu,
‎soon we'll be back together again!

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.340
‎-I'm sorry!
‎-Sorry for what?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.540
‎For this!

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.780
‎-Tahw rof yrros?
‎-One down!

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.620
‎I can't believe Fu chose
‎such a cowardly Ladybug,

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.260
‎who would sacrifice her own Cat Noir!

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.100
‎What are you doing? Why don't you
‎just take Cat Noir's Miraculous?

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.620
‎You'll understand soon enough.
‎He's powerless now! But I want Ladybug!

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.020
‎She's my only ticket back to Fu!

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.380
‎Ah! My ankle! I think I've sprained it!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.860
‎You're mine!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.580
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.140
‎No!

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.700
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.420
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.740
‎Gotcha!

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.660
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.700
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.460
‎Pound it!

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.860
‎Well, at least I think so. 'Cause I still
‎don't understand what all that was about!

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.580
‎That's because we girls
‎are mysterious that way!

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.660
‎Oh! Oops!
‎Sorry, but I'd better scat, super fast!

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.580
‎-Why the rush?
‎-It's a secret! Cats are mysterious, too!

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.020
‎What happened to me?

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.500
‎I give you the wrong letter earlier.
‎I hope you'll forgive me.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.380
‎I can't change the past, but I hope
‎this letter will change your future!

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.180
‎Don't believe for one second
‎that you've won, Ladybug!

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.340
‎I've acquired more information that will
‎enable me to track the Guardian down!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.900
‎And even though no one in Paris
‎goes by the name of Master Fu,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.380
‎I will find where he's hiding.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.340
‎Soon, I'll be able to have him decipher
‎the spell book for me

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.660
‎and maybe, who knows, even get my hands
‎on every Miraculous known on Earth!

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.740
‎I know it's taking a long time...

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.300
‎-You seem to be feeling a lot better.
‎-Oh, yes, I am.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.140
‎Our incident has been resolved.
‎This train for London is about to depart.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.300
‎Stand clear of the doors.
‎We apologise for any inconvenience.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.820
‎-Marianne, I...
‎-Fu, I...

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.980
‎Marianne,
‎I'm sorry I took so long to come here.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.900
‎I always felt as long as
‎I was in charge of the Miracle Box,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.460
‎I'd be a danger to anyone I'm close to.
‎But that's all in the past now.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.340
‎I know you always
‎wanted to do what's best.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.540
‎I know what a responsibility it is,
‎being the Guardian of the Miraculous.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.820
‎Unfortunately,
‎Hawk Moth now knows that I know you.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.140
‎-Yes. He could hurt you to get to me.
‎-We can't be together until he's defeated.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.860
‎I have full trust in the ones I've chosen.
‎They will succeed.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.060
‎Now it's my turn to go and hide,
‎my sweet, darling Fu.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.820
‎Marianne,
‎I've never told you this but I... I...

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.540
‎Shh! Save it for when I get back!

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.260
‎Why doesn't he just tell her?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.420
‎It's probably not the right time yet.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.460
‎How about you?
‎When will it be the right time for you?

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.380
‎I'll tell you if I'm still alive after
‎seeing Adrien again tomorrow morning.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.660
‎So, how did it go?

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.340
‎-Did you tell him?
‎-Yeah... I mean... kinda.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.180
‎Basically, I gave him a letter.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.300
‎Woohoo! Yeah!

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.980
‎-Tell us exactly what you wrote.
‎-Oh, not much.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.460
‎-It's not really important, is it?
‎-What? How can you say that, girl?

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.380
‎Uh... Hey, Marinette!

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.900
‎-Hey!
‎-I was surprised when I read your letter.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.660
‎But since it seemed important,
‎I spent the whole weekend

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.660
‎walking around London looking for it!
‎For you.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.860
‎-Thank you!
‎-I'm glad I could help!

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.540
‎Disaster!

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.180
‎Disaster?
‎He had you on his mind all weekend.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.100
‎-He even brought back a gift for you!
‎-Yeah, what is it?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.060
‎-Come on, show us!
‎-Open it!

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.820
‎No, we're good! Trust me.
‎We really don't need to open it!

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.180
‎Constipation capsules?

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.860
‎What a beautiful display of pure love!
