The procedure is too complicated to scale.
It's literally brain surgery.

He doesn't care about me.

512
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,354
Yes, he does.

513
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,483
When he was locked up,
all he wanted was to help his girls.

514
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:18,860
Because we're his medicine.

515
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,071
He needs our blood to stay alive.

516
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,949
So?

517
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,159
"So"?

518
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,328
[Bert] My dad needed me
and my brothers too.

519
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,664
So he kept us locked away for a long time.

520
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,833
We didn't even see the sun
until we were all grown up.

521
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,669
[Bert] But Albert's not like that.
He gave you a life.

522
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,587
And maybe…

523
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,632
I'm not saying he was right,
or even good, but…

524
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,218
he could've been worse.

525
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,430
So that makes… that makes it okay?

526
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,639
No, but…

527
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,934
Well, maybe there's no such thing.

528
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:57,231
Maybe life's just a bunch of accidents
and tragedies and…

529
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,193
[Bert] No one's really okay.
We're all just doing our best.

530
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:05,156
In a world where it's way too easy
to do your worst.

531
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,118
Your dad loves you.

532
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,079
Well, maybe
it's a messed up kind of love, but…

533
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,417
Well, they kind of all are
