1
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,800
So, according to you,

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,079
everything started
with the arrival of the new students.

3
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,359
When a new species is introduced
into an ecosystem, it is always altered.

4
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,719
The new one can devastate
the flora and fauna of a place,

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
breed endlessly,

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,560
or cause more subtle changes
which end up perverting everything.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,119
Are you referring to the new students
as if they were another species?

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,719
I don't want to believe
that Marina's... dead.

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
Nowadays, we use social networks
to present ourselves to others.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,719
What we show, or what we hide,

11
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,079
says a lot about who we are.

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,399
And this is what the pair work
I want you to do is about.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,040
I want you to create

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,519
your partner's profile
for a social network.

15
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,560
Wasn't this language
and literature class?

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,319
Welcome to Las Encinas, man.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,879
We can demonize social networks,
like other schools do, but...

18
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,079
we can also use them to learn.

19
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,439
Please, take advantage of the opportunity
to investigate, to question each other.

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,519
And most of all, adapt this to your goal.
What is it, Christian?

21
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,799
I just have a question.
What can I improve in my profile? Nothing!

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,799
It can be improved.

23
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,239
When he was talking about privilege
and intelligence, he didn't mean you.

24
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,840
Boom! Take that.

25
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,920
Guys...

26
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
Please, be creative.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,159
Use photos, videos, interviews,
whatever you want.

28
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,920
You have all the school's resources
at your disposal.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Nobody leaves until they have a partner.
Choose one and come by my desk.

30
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,120
Here's your chance.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,599
To do what?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,200
What do you mean, "to do what"?
Our plan for Miss Palestine.

33
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,239
Go and tell her you want to work with her.

34
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,439
You are with me, right?

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,480
That way, I'll get to see you more.
You've been avoiding me.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
What a silly thing to say.
Of course we'll work together.

37
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,120
So, want to work together?

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,639
You won't have much to do.
My profile rules.

39
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,159
And once we upload some photos
of your trophies and the girls you get,

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,840
yours will be done in no time.
Then we can smoke a joint.

41
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,840
Shut up!

42
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,840
Samuel.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,159
We can work together if you want.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
You and I?

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
OK.

46
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,199
Want to work together?

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
-But we have nothing in common.
-Even better.

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,439
We can learn more about each other.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
Motherfucker.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,560
-Nano, are those burgers ready?
-Almost there. Why the hurry?

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,719
Get a move on.

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,560
I said you had experience.
They're complaining.

53
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,439
-Samu, don't bust my balls.
-Hurry.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Here you are.

55
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,080
We were so happy in this town
without these snobs!

56
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,280
I don't know where she is.
Carla's avoiding me.

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
You must have done something.

58
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,319
You have to take care of her.
You won't find another one like her.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,080
I've told you before, haven't I? Huh?

60
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
-Put your phone down, please. We are here!
-It's my dad. He wants me to train.

61
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,960
-Sorry.
-Hey, waiter, thank you.

62
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,360
-I've had faster service.
-Sorry. We have new staff.

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,319
I wish you were as good at working
as you are at making excuses.

64
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,879
This is overcooked.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,919
You know I can't answer back.
That's why you're doing this.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,639
-He's talking to me.
-Just eat it. It looks good.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,039
She read my message. It's blue.
Why won't she answer?

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
I get it.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
-Is it clear?
-Yes.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
Nano, what's going on?

71
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,319
Nothing.

72
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,879
-Besides, they're leaving, right?
-That's up to you.

73
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,560
Give me time.

74
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,280
Good afternoon.

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,240
-Nano, tell me what's going on.
-Samu, it's nothing.

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Forget it.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,319
Guys, I'm leaving.

78
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,759
-You're leaving? How come?
-Gotta train, I told you.

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,120
-But finish your food.
-If I do, I'll be late.

80
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,920
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

81
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,279
Should I write to her again or...
send her an audio message?

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,279
I'll send her an audio message. Yeah.

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,759
Hey.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
How much do you want?

85
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,439
It's good, you'll see.

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,240
Hey. We can finish this one if you want.

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,040
Can I ask you a question?

88
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,759
If it's about the other night,
it's best if you don't.

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
I was drunk. And... I wanted to try.

90
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,439
Just to try.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,399
Guys... are... not my thing.

92
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,120
-What?
-You wanted to suck my dick.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Come.

94
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,920
You OK?

95
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,600
Shit.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,319
They're freezing.

97
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
What are you doing?

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,279
Putting it on the seat,
so you're more comfortable.

99
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,920
What is it? Thought the Muslim boy
was gonna rob you, or what?

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
No, it's not that, but...

101
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,759
I don't feel comfortable.

102
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,360
Let's stop.

103
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,040
What is it?

104
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,759
It was you who wanted it.

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,399
Dude...

106
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,839
Are you really freaking out?

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,519
No, but, leave me alone, OK? I'm going.

108
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,879
Describe your relationship
with the new kids.

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,920
-It was normal, nothing special.
-And with Omar?

110
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,199
He's a friend.

111
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,079
Ander. What's up, man?

112
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey.

113
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,160
-How was training yesterday?
-Good.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Very good, man.

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
-My dad's cracking the whip, but good.
-OK.

116
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,399
Listen.

117
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,120
-You know you can tell me anything?
-Sure, I know.

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I mean,
we've been friends our entire lives.

119
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,920
Yes.

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,439
I'm off to train.

121
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,519
Now, a hobby.

122
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,519
-You've been recording for ten minutes.
-Give me a hobby, and I'm done.

123
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,639
Seriously, I didn't plan
to work so hard on my part.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,639
I thought they strove for excellence here.

125
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,839
-Tell me something I don't know.
-Fine, but not here. I'd feel awkward.

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,759
Let's go.

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
-Come on!
-What are we doing here?

128
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,800
Don't ask. We have ten minutes
before the basketball players arrive.

129
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,839
And you should know,
I've shown this to very few of my friends.

130
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,759
Now I'm ready.

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
-Are you recording?
-I'm recording.

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
You'll end up with a great project.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,319
Why did you make these videos?

134
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,320
For a school project.

135
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,559
That's all.

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,720
Marina loved to dance.

137
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Siblings?

138
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,759
One, you know him. Nano.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Nano.

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,279
How's it going
in the kitchen at La Cabaña?

141
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,120
For him, or for me since he started?

142
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,480
OK. I'm writing you get along famously.

143
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,879
So we're lying, right?

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,519
Then you can write that I get along
with my brother.

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,799
Look, I'm happy my brother is out of jail.

146
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,399
It's just that sometimes...

147
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,039
What?

148
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,600
Let's not get intense. Photos.
Do we use what we have, or take new ones?

149
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,679
I can dance, but posing for photos
is entirely different.

150
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,879
Let me see.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
This folder.

152
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,000
-Yes, that one.
-OK.

153
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,559
This one's really cool.

154
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,240
What are you talking about?

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,080
This one's not bad,
but none of them show your face.

156
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,279
-That's normal.
-Normal, yeah, right.

157
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NUNIER, INC.

161
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,519
Sorry.
I opened something I shouldn't have.

162
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,039
-It's no secret he's my father, right?
-Why do you have all those articles?

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,200
Well...

164
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,440
Because...

165
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,120
It doesn't matter.
Let's do this later, OK?

166
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,679
-See you tomorrow, Carla.
-Bye.

167
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,080
Hi there.

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,080
See? No problem.

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,399
OK. I didn't want to complicate stuff
with your boyfriend.

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Don't worry. We are only texting.

171
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,399
Fine. I'll go smoke a joint,
and we'll talk later.

172
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,039
What did he say?

173
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,879
The poor thing is clueless.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
He's afraid if you see us talking,
you'll suspect and get jealous.

175
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,919
Me? Jealous of that guy?

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,679
He's more muscle than brain
and can't tell the difference--

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Of course not.

178
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
How about we do it again?

179
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,360
With Christian.
I'm so glad you persuaded me to do it.

180
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,720
-I didn't persuade you.
-I want to do it again.

181
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,799
Say yes, please.

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
We'll talk later, OK?

183
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,120
OK.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
So, how do we go about this? My--

185
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,320
My place or yours?

186
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
My parents wouldn't like me
to be seen with you.

187
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,799
They don't know me.

188
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,559
All my friends' mothers say
I'm the perfect son-in-law.

189
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
For my parents, the perfect son-in-law
prays five times a day, facing Mecca.

190
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,559
Do you do it?

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,639
Yes. It helps me find myself.

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,799
We're not getting married.
It's a project.

193
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,799
Can't we work on it during breaks?

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,360
I've written some questions.
Answer them by tomorrow.

195
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
And we're done.

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,279
We'll talk tomorrow.

197
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,759
Wow.

198
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,279
I think Miss Palestine is not going
to make it easy for you.

199
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,799
If I were you...
I'd put in a little more effort, honey.

200
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,840
-Please!
-Shut up!

201
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,159
Excuse us.

202
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,879
We have this project--

203
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,679
-Hi.
-Hi.

204
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm looking for Samuel.

205
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,000
He's on a break. Out back.

206
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,639
-That way.
-Thanks.

207
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,159
Hey.

208
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,840
Hey, what's going on?

209
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,159
-I was looking for your brother.
-And you found me.

210
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,840
It's gonna become a habit.

211
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,919
Fuck!

212
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,639
How's everything here?

213
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Fantastic. I'm a total chef.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,840
I can tell.

215
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
Hello.

216
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
They told me you were out here.

217
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,919
-Want some?
-No, thanks. Enjoy.

218
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
Listen... Sorry I left like that.

219
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,360
Don't worry.

220
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,919
Want to work on the project?

221
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,360
My name is Marina,
and as you know, I like to dance.

222
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,039
But what I would really like to do
is make documentaries.

223
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
Do investigative reports.

224
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,519
The truth is,
that has always been my dream.

225
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
Although, I don't know now...

226
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,559
-Why not?
-How could I call myself a journalist

227
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,679
if I now have the chance
to expose somebody, and I don't do it?

228
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,720
Nobody's gonna blame you
for not ruining your father.

229
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,519
Not even if I had incriminating evidence?

230
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,960
There's money in the safe
in my father's office at home.

231
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,320
And, about a year ago,
I needed to take some.

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,799
We all know the combination.
It's my date of birth.

233
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,720
So, I opened the safe,
and there were photos,

234
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,399
documents, and some emails.

235
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,320
They were addressed to a minister
in the government.

236
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,159
My father was telling him that,
because the budget was so tight,

237
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
the materials might not be
of the best quality.

238
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
Was it about my school?

239
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,159
I don't know,

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,000
but I think something similar happened
with your school.

241
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,200
Now you know more than any of my friends.

242
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,240
Don't even think of using that
in the project, OK?

243
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Of course I will!
After the part about you liking to dance.

244
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,080
-That you have a corrupt father.
-Don't even joke about that.

245
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,679
-But of course!
-Samuel.

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,039
Break is over.

247
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,960
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

248
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,279
Waiter!

249
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,039
Bye, thanks.

250
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,399
Hi, how are you? Go ahead, please.

251
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,240
Hello.

252
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,240
Good afternoon.

253
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,759
-Why are you here? What do you want?
-To introduce myself to your parents.

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,960
Hi, how are you?
Guzmán Nunier, pleased to meet you.

255
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,840
-I'm your daughter's classmate.
-Hello.

256
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,080
-I came to ask if I may study with her.
-You'd better leave.

257
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,480
Why? What's the matter?

258
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,559
That I'm not a Muslim?
That my father is who he is? What is it?

259
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,399
I said we'd work during breaks.

260
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,840
-What's the problem? Who's his father?
-Dad...

261
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,919
-Guzmán, go.
-He paid for her scholarship.

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,279
I think it would be best
if you let me stay...

263
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,759
and work with her.

264
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,799
Why have you come here? To insult me?

265
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,879
Do you know, because of your father,
my son and others

266
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,320
have to travel 30 km to go to school?

267
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,919
Do you know
how many kids could have died?

268
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,720
Sir, I've come in good faith
to ask if I can work with your daughter.

269
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,039
Leave.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
Enough, Guzmán.

271
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,720
What do I have to buy so you let me stay
and explain myself?

272
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,759
What's going on?

273
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,799
Guzmán, please. Go.

274
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,480
We know this is a difficult time.
But we need to ask you some questions.

275
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,200
How was your relationship
with your sister?

276
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,799
What kind of question is that?

277
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,039
I loved her very much.

278
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,759
Hi, sweetie.

279
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,000
Have you taken your medication?

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,079
Listen, if you have any discomfort,
nausea, or whatever, tell me, OK?

281
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, sweetie.

282
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,599
-Are you OK?
-Yes, great.

283
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,279
You know Mom only talks about my pills
when she mixes anxiety meds with alcohol?

284
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,160
It's hard for her, Marina.

285
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
It's no picnic for me either.

286
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,920
Hey.

287
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,759
Hey, Marina.

288
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,720
What did we say?

289
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,920
Huh?

290
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,480
Through good times, bad times, and?

291
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
And the times that are fucked up.

292
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,359
What are you doing?
The store's unattended.

293
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm going. Don't worry.

294
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,119
-Keep an eye on it.
-Yes. Nag.

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,640
HI, ARE YOU STILL FREAKED OUT?

296
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
There's money in the safe
in my father's office at home.

297
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,839
We all know the combination.
It's my date of birth.

298
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,480
To give it a sentimental touch.

299
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,559
What are you doing?

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,440
Recording fancy girl in your free time?

301
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,720
-It's for a school project.
-A school project.

302
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,000
How modern. Come on, Spielberg,
it's dinner time.

303
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,400
GORGEOUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

304
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,400
WAITING FOR YOU IN MY BED...
THINKING OF YOU

305
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,759
DON'T SAY THAT, YOU ARE KILLING ME...

306
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,160
-Hi, hon.
-Hi.

307
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,359
-What are you doing?
-Chatting with Christian.

308
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,319
-About what?
-Not much.

309
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,440
But it was getting interesting.

310
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,279
Do you want to join me so it gets better?

311
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,839
We'll have a good time.
What do I tell him?

312
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,039
Tell him you only get turned on
if they know how to play.

313
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,279
And ask him if he knows how to play.

314
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,599
And if he's willing to go all the way.

315
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,119
You are into this!

316
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,839
He wants to know
what my boyfriend would think.

317
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,880
That you're a very naughty girlfriend.
And you want to be worse than naughty.

318
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,759
I am a very naughty girlfriend.

319
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,680
And I want to be... worse than naughty.

320
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,039
What would you do to me
if I were there with you?

321
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,839
I'd treat you like a queen.

322
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,119
Tell him you have your boyfriend for that.

323
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Now, I'm in the mood for something else.

324
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,519
He says...

325
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,279
"I'm so turned on."

326
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,200
Should I continue?

327
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,440
Make him come.

328
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,839
Hey, you.

329
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,839
-Yes, you.
-Christian.

330
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,119
Whatever your name is. I have a question.
Do you know this Muslim guy?

331
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,839
-Nadia's brother?
-Yes, Omar.

332
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,799
-Why? Who talked to you about him?
-Ander, he told me about him.

333
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,240
Buddy, you want to score?
Wow, I didn't think you smoked, but...

334
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,680
-I guess we all have our vices, huh?
-Right. And what exactly does he sell?

335
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,680
-He has grass, paki, pollen, acorns--
-Acorns?

336
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,440
Another kind of hash, dude. Softer.

337
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,160
-They're drugs, right? Okay.
-Joints.

338
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Whatever you want, he can get it.

339
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,319
Give me a call,
and I'll send you his number.

340
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,319
-Already thinking about planting a bomb?
-Yes, on your face!

341
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,599
...on your face!

342
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
Hi, Nadia.

343
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,559
Listen, sorry about yesterday.

344
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,640
-It got out of hand.
-I shouldn't be talking to you.

345
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,160
What were you thinking?

346
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,240
I went with the best intentions
to show your father I am a good person.

347
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,799
Nailed it.

348
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,839
After all,
arrogance runs through your veins.

349
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,799
Nadia.

350
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,039
Good morning!

351
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,079
How can I make it up to you?

352
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,240
Relax.

353
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
And nothing.

354
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,279
I finished the project without you.

355
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,640
The information I had was enough
to finish your profile.

356
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:04,599
Martín.

357
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,480
I have a question. It's about the project.

358
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,519
Nadia says she's finished,
but I really think it's incomplete.

359
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,680
-May I?
-Yes, of course.

360
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Is this all you have?

361
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,960
Four photos and...

362
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,720
I don't know.

363
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,200
How much more does one need
to introduce oneself on social media?

364
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,920
Nadia, I think there's something
you haven't understood.

365
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,359
At this school,
we take projects very seriously.

366
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,400
They're as important as exams.
Or even more. This is a demanding task.

367
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Guys,
I thought I had explained myself clearly.

368
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
When I read your profiles,

369
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,519
I want to get a clear idea
of who your partner is.

370
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,440
You're making a lot of effort, Martín,

371
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,720
for someone
who doesn't deserve much attention.

372
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,880
No, I don't try too hard.

373
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,119
I think she can do it,
and she can be the best in the class.

374
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You all can if you try.

375
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,119
The emails were addressed to a minister
in the government.

376
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,599
My father was telling him that,
because the budget was so tight,

377
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,759
the materials might not be
of the best quality.

378
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,359
I can't stop thinking
about our chat yesterday.

379
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,960
It was very instructive.

380
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,599
-We'll have to put that into practice.
-I'm all yours.

381
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,559
Your place or mine? Probably yours.

382
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Are you going to meet up
with this moron?

383
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
-What about Polo?
-Guzmán, mind your own business.

384
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,799
-My friend's girlfriend is my business.
-Not at all.

385
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,079
-You heard her, man. Go away.
-You can't order me around in my school.

386
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,759
Too bad your school's my school.
Besides, we're both asking you, so... go.

387
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,559
Let me explain this to you, you idiot.

388
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,039
Neither you nor anybody

389
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,400
from your shitty town can say anything
to me.

390
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
Know why?
Because, to me, you don't exist.

391
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,960
If I hit you,
that might confirm my existence.

392
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,079
What are you doing?

393
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,279
This nobody is trying to steal
your girlfriend.

394
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,400
"Your girlfriend, my school, my rules."
Your concept of property is a bit much.

395
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,559
If I get the girl,
it's because she wants it.

396
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,000
You calm down, too.

397
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,119
-Sorry, babe.
-Did you hear that? He calls her "babe"!

398
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Look, don't...

399
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,839
Let's go, Guzmán. Please.

400
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,319
That's enough.

401
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,119
So, at your place, then? We'll talk.

402
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,559
Why were you so calm
while I defended your girlfriend?

403
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,519
-Why are you getting involved?
-Because he's stealing her, don't you see?

404
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't be old-fashioned.
You sound like a Neanderthal.

405
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,480
Whatever you say,
but I know what I saw.

406
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,279
-So put an end to this, Polo--
-Guzmán, it's arranged.

407
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,480
She's hooking up with him
because I want her to.

408
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,839
It's a game, OK?

409
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,599
Let's see, Polo...

410
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,279
What the fuck do you win in this game?

411
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,119
But, Guzmán, we're using him.

412
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,319
She hooks up with him,
but I tell her what to do with him.

413
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,519
And while they do it...

414
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,000
I watch them.

415
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,200
But, man...

416
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,759
Shit, all right.

417
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,079
I didn't know things were that bad.

418
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,960
-But--
-Listen, what if Carla falls for him?

419
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,559
Anyway...

420
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,279
End this as soon as possible, Polito.

421
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,440
OK?

422
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Martín? I have a question. May I come in?

423
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,240
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

424
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I know that...

425
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,799
with the new kids getting
into the school and...

426
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,480
them being at a disadvantage,

427
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,720
it's logical for you
to give them more attention.

428
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,640
How can I say it without sounding rude?

429
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,319
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll find the words. Tell me.

430
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,640
Do you think

431
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,400
it's OK to pay more attention to a girl
with such archaic and non-feminist values?

432
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,920
You want me to discriminate?

433
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,359
No, just don't pay
so much attention to her.

434
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,680
She doesn't pay your salary,
the rest of the parents do.

435
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,119
I am your teacher, Lu, not your employee.

436
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,480
And I'm telling you
that your contract is renewed annually.

437
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,519
And that the idea of the new kids
getting into the school was not...

438
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,240
popular with our parents.

439
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,519
It was just a front.

440
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,799
Think about it.

441
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,480
About whose side you are on.
Have a nice day.

442
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,119
I wish those three had never come
to the school, that's all.

443
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,200
-Do you hate them so much?
-I'm not the only one, I can assure you.

444
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,440
Hello.

445
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,599
Hello. What are you doing here?

446
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,079
-Want to work on the project?
-Sure.

447
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,680
Do you want to take pictures
since we have good lighting?

448
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,920
-Don't be shy, tell me how to pose.
-I think this is stupid.

449
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,119
Let me see.

450
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,599
Is this how you see me? Only this?

451
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,559
Don't be afraid to sexualize me.
Relax, take a couple more.

452
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,720
Get dressed.

453
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
You are so boring, really.

454
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,519
-What are you doing?
-Who cares? No one's here.

455
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,599
Since we are here,
and you're not looking at me...

456
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,079
at least ask me questions, OK?

457
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,759
Well... I don't know.

458
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,000
Why were you hell-bent
on doing this project with me?

459
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,759
To make fun of me?

460
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,079
Since you're not taking pictures,
I'll take one of you. Stand there.

461
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,599
There's good light.

462
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,200
Let's see.

463
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,319
Turn around.

464
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,240
Turn slightly to your left.

465
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,559
To your left, Nadia! Are you dyslexic?

466
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,400
-I should delete it.
-Why?

467
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,000
It doesn't say anything about you.
I have no fucking idea who you are.

468
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,759
I'll wait for you outside.

469
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,119
What happened?

470
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Some men came asking for Nano.

471
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,759
I didn't let them in,
and they forced the door open.

472
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,559
-Let me get this--
-Nothing happened.

473
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,720
They only meant to scare her, that's all.

474
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,759
-I told her it won't happen again.
-Was it the guys from La Cabaña?

475
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,240
Who from La Cabaña?

476
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,519
-What about La Cabaña?
-Come.

477
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,039
Who from La Cabaña?
What did you get into?

478
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,039
Shut the door.

479
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,960
Tell me, Nano...

480
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
do you think it's normal for junkies
to come here and threaten Mom?

481
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,359
-I owe a lot of money, Samu. A lot.
-What? You just got out of jail.

482
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,400
I owe it to people in there.
To the people who protected me.

483
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,839
-I promised them a lot of money.
-What are you saying?

484
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,720
-What are you saying?
-Things were messed up there.

485
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,759
And I had to find a way to get by.

486
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,599
Look at the present they gave me.

487
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
I didn't tell you so as not to scare you.
But now, I need to pay up.

488
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,119
If something happens to me,
I don't care, it's my problem.

489
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,519
-But I can't let anything happen to you.
-Are you being serious, Nano?

490
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,000
Do I look like I'm joking?

491
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,119
Help me.

492
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,359
How?

493
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,880
I saw what fancy girl told you.

494
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,359
About her father's papers.

495
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Help me get them.
I can sell them, blackmail him.

496
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,319
You're telling me you used my computer
when I've told you--

497
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,759
Can you think of a better way
to get 40,000 bucks?

498
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,640
If you have one, tell me.

499
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,279
Nano, you're on fucking parole.
I can't let you do that.

500
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,240
If I don't do it, we are fucked.

501
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,559
Mom... you, and I.

502
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,599
Brother, I'm screwed.

503
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,319
I'll do it myself.

504
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,119
I'll get you the papers.

505
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,880
-Hi.
-Hello.

506
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,839
Fuck!

507
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
Looking for this?

508
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,640
You have no right to search my room.
How did you find it?

509
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,440
Guzmán, a good friend of yours.

510
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,079
Do you know what can happen
if you test positive for drugs?

511
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,960
-It's the second time I've bought.
-And why?

512
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,240
-Why do you want to ruin your career?
-Come on, it's just a joint.

513
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
You are an idiot.

514
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,000
This is the last time.

515
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,960
Carla.

516
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,440
I think we should drop
this thing with Christian.

517
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,039
-Why?
-I've been talking to Guzmán.

518
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,200
For fuck's sake.

519
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,519
As I was telling him about it,
I realized it sounded crazy.

520
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,599
What are we doing?

521
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,920
Are we really going to stop experimenting
and having fun

522
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,599
because of what your friend thinks?

523
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,960
We all know what he's like.

524
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,759
Listen, we are playing with fire.

525
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,400
It's not normal.

526
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,559
It's not normal for people our age
to do these things.

527
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,559
And that's it.

528
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,240
-Right?
-When have you and I been normal?

529
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,359
My mom's a wine-making marchioness,

530
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,440
and your moms are a pair of rich
and influential lesbians.

531
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,640
You and I are anything but normal.

532
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,079
I don't know.

533
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,119
You don't want to relive the other day?

534
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,640
Or yesterday?

535
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,039
Because I can't stop thinking about it.
And I know you.

536
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,720
-I know you feel the same.
-I don't think it's the same.

537
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,680
Our lives are already written.
And I'm not saying they're bad lives.

538
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,279
But, why not stray from the script,
at least a little bit?

539
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,720
I don't know.

540
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,240
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

541
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,880
-What? That you love me?
-Huh?

542
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
-I do love you.
-I love you.

543
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,759
-And you?
-I love you.

544
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,039
-I love you.
-I love you.

545
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:37,960
Wait in the lobby.

546
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,400
We'll continue talking in a while.
Thank you.

547
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,280
Polo, you may come in.

548
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,440
Sorry, why do you want to talk to me?

549
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,920
They are questioning everybody,
don't worry.

550
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
They suspect Guzmán.

551
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,960
Really? Yes.

552
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,039
Good morning!

553
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,280
Good morning.

554
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,920
-Good morning.
-A bit sluggish this morning?

555
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,239
I'm a little tired.

556
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,360
I have to show you what I've done.
I have your profile almost ready.

557
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,599
I am still a bit stuck with yours.

558
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,199
How come?

559
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,159
We can work on it
this afternoon at my place.

560
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Sure.

561
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:35,639
But my mom's at home.
It may be better to do it at yours.

562
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,559
Of course.

563
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,719
-Are you OK?
-Yes. I'm still sleepy.

564
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,199
-What the fuck did you do?
-Calm down.

565
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,400
-You got me in trouble!
-I'm worried about you. You're my friend.

566
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,719
Then talk to me,
don't snitch to my parents.

567
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,480
You know how I feel about drugs.

568
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,440
-After what happened to my sister.
-Get over it already!

569
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,760
Get over what happened!
And stop messing with the rest of us.

570
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,559
Would you say Guzmán is violent?

571
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,639
You suspect Guzmán?

572
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,239
Guzmán wouldn't hurt his sister
or anybody else.

573
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
It's just a draft.

574
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,360
If you want,
we can change the whole thing.

575
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,400
I don't know.
I feel a little exposed, Samuel.

576
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
Besides, you end it by saying:

577
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,719
"Sad, intelligent eyes
which seem to have suffered too much."

578
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,719
-Too much?
-I don't know.

579
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,639
Maybe this is nothing but a bored
and vain rich girl putting on an act.

580
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,800
Why would you do that?

581
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,400
To keep guys away
and avoid being upended by love again.

582
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,320
I've never felt that.

583
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,440
You're not missing out, really.

584
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,000
You don't want it to happen again?

585
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,800
I don't know, it scares me.

586
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,679
What are you scared of?

587
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,679
Hello. How are you?

588
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,679
Hi. What are you doing here?

589
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,639
How did you let him talk you into this?

590
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,400
-She's here to work on the project.
-So is Samu.

591
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

592
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,960
OK, we're off.
We don't want to bother you.

593
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:04,880
OK.

594
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,719
Nadia. Don't let him tease you too much.
Whistle if you need me, OK?

595
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,840
Guzmán!

596
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,599
Honey, I'm calling you, and you're...
You're not answering.

597
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,760
I don't know what you're doing,
or where you are.

598
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,159
Please, call me when you get this, OK?

599
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,480
So?

600
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,239
Why are you being so flattering?

601
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,239
Am I a challenge,
or a bet you made with your friends?

602
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,239
Let's see how long it takes
the Muslim girl to fall for me.

603
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,599
What?

604
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,400
Is your self-esteem so low

605
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,880
that you think
I'd only be with you because of a bet?

606
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,280
Then I'm a challenge.

607
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,519
-The impossible turns you on.
-I feel comfortable with you.

608
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,360
We have a lot in common.

609
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,320
Come now, I doubt that.

610
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,800
Well, you believe in your God.

611
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,000
You respect your parents.
You're responsible.

612
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,639
Me too. Look.

613
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,559
Here we go again!

614
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,719
See?

615
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
Only I wouldn't strip
to show you I believe in Allah.

616
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,079
-Put your shirt on. Or you'll catch cold.
-We all have our ways, Nadia.

617
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,079
And it is true that I often use my body
and my charm to get what I want.

618
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,119
Maybe I don't quite believe

619
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,239
someone could like me
just for what I think or feel.

620
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,480
-Do you have your cell phone on you?
-Want to take a picture?

621
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,760
No.

622
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,159
No!

623
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
-Well?
-Guzmán.

624
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,280
Not so brave now, huh?

625
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,840
-Please!
-Come on, laugh now!

626
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,880
-Come on, stop it.
-Laugh at me now.

627
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,159
-Go on, laugh.
-Please, Guzmán!

628
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,079
-No!
-Look.

629
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,320
-Please!
-No.

630
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,000
-Come.
-Guzmán! Please!

631
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,760
I was winning.

632
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
OK. Should we continue?

633
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,239
-Can I use your bathroom?
-Sure, it's right over there.

634
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,199
Right...

635
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,199
I don't feel so good,
and it would be embarrassing...

636
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,639
-Use the one downstairs.
-OK, thanks.

637
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,320
You still need a couple of photos
at the end, but it's ready.

638
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,519
Hi, Dad.

639
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,440
Hi, Nadia.

640
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,239
-Are you at school?
-No.

641
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm with Samuel, doing homework.

642
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,360
-Sure, with the waiter.
-Put him on.

643
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
-I want to ask him something.
-Eh... Of course.

644
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,519
He's in the bathroom, one second.

645
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,880
-Shit, I have to find Samuel.
-Go.

646
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,239
Marina!

647
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,400
-Have you seen Samuel?
-He's in the bathroom.

648
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,920
-The one downstairs.
-Shit!

649
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,280
Samuel.

650
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,599
-Hello? You still there?
-Dad, one moment.

651
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,039
What am I doing?

652
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,840
Samuel!

653
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,079
-Samuel!
-What?

654
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,639
It's my father.

655
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,400
-Tell him we are studying at your house.
-Hello?

656
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,519
Hi, Mr. Shanaa. It's Samuel.

657
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,159
We are at home, working on something
for school.

658
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,920
-We're almost done.
-What are you doing?

659
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
I couldn't find the bathroom.

660
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,679
-It's down there!
-I couldn't find it.

661
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,360
Nadia will be there soon, OK?

662
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,039
Nice place!

663
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,639
Listen, where's your mother?

664
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,559
ALMOST THERE

665
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,679
-She's rarely here.
-Right, of course.

666
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,119
I suppose marchionesses
also have things to do.

667
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,599
-Hello, Mirella.
-Hello.

668
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,519
Hello.

669
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,199
Yeah, well, she always says
they have been social parasites,

670
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,880
and a blight on this country,
but she got into wine.

671
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,559
Into making it, that is,
not drinking it.

672
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,039
Although, every now and then,
she opens a bottle.

673
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,119
-I'll introduce you one day.
-OK. Cool.

674
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:08,719
Wow, nice bathtub you marquises have!

675
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,519
-Hello, Mirella.
-Hello.

676
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,880
Carla is expecting me.

677
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,960
Hey, you don't see me
just as a sex object, right?

678
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
It's OK!

679
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,440
It's OK, don't worry. You can carry on.

680
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,800
On the plus side, I'm more comfortable
than I was at Marina's.

681
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,719
Polo.

682
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,039
-What?
-You haven't told him?

683
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:06,760
The other day, I was there, watching you.

684
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,960
Did you think you'd fuck my girl
without me enjoying it?

685
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:10,880
Polo!

686
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,360
What's he talking about? Is that true?

687
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:14,880
You knew?

688
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,920
Poor guy!

689
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,840
He thought he was hooking up
with a Spanish grandee.

690
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,960
You imagined yourself a married winemaker?

691
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,239
You're making fun of me?

692
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,400
-No, we're not.
-No.

693
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,559
I think you are.

694
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,079
Fucking rich people!

695
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,039
-Let's talk.
-Fucking snobs.

696
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,960
Christian!

697
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:39,519
-Let's talk about it.
-No! Do you realize what you have?

698
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,400
Take care of her, please, man!

699
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,360
You can't let people fuck her!

700
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,039
And you watching, on top of it!
Fuck off, will you?

701
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,039
Good evening.

702
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,800
How can you be so stupid?

703
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,000
If you didn't want to,
you should have told me.

704
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,599
I did tell you,
but you didn't listen to me.

705
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,440
What's the matter?

706
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,480
Do you care so much
about that bumpkin's feelings?

707
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,239
The only bumpkin here...

708
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:14,920
is you.

709
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,599
Fuck off!

710
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,000
You don't tell me to fuck off, Carla.
Carla!

711
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,920
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

712
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,239
HEY, FINALLY

713
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,360
SORRY. I'VE BEEN BUSY

714
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,000
WANT SOME POT?

715
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:48,519
NO, I'D RATHER SEE YOU WITHOUT AN EXCUSE

716
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,599
-Hi, darling.
-Hi, Dad.

717
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,239
How did it go with Samuel?

718
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,360
It went well. We finished the project.

719
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,880
Were you at Samuel's?

720
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,400
-Dad...
-I didn't expect this from you.

721
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,119
You lied to me.
Daughters like you don't do that.

722
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:13,679
I don't want those people
to change you, Nadia.

723
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,440
And I don't want you to disappoint
your mother and me.

724
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,360
We have sacrificed a lot for you two.

725
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,480
Don't make us feel we made a mistake.

726
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,119
No more lies.

727
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:33,280
Don't you have to study?

728
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:35,559
There is no power or strength saved
in Allah.

729
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,639
Omar, leave me alone, I have to study.

730
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET TOMORROW?

731
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,159
I'M REALLY BUSY

732
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,360
You don't have it?
You said you would get it.

733
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,920
I couldn't do it.
I'm not going to rob her father.

734
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,880
-You'd rather save her family than ours?
-I didn't do it because I like her.

735
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,679
I really like Marina.

736
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,880
You dumbshit!

737
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:07,760
You have no shot with her. Samu!

738
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,679
What?

739
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,280
You're screwing me over for a girl
who doesn't care about you.

740
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,719
You are an idiot!

741
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:21,639
Guys, I got all your projects in my inbox,

742
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,199
and I wanted to thank you.
I'm very happy with them.

743
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,280
I imagine you've realized this was

744
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,679
a very important project
to get to know ourselves better,

745
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,159
and to find out what it is
that we want others to know about us.

746
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,480
What is the image we want to project?

747
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,760
What is it we hide from others?

748
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:42,920
Are we really...

749
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,800
what others believe we are,
or do they only see our best side?

750
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,199
You want me to tell you
what Marina was like?

751
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,280
Marina was light.

752
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:56,280
Marina was...

753
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,440
one of those people
you meet on a Monday and...

754
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,440
you want to look in the face,

755
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,760
because she will smile
and brighten your day.

756
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,199
Do you have any more questions?

757
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,079
Guzmán...

758
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,320
Maybe there's one thing
you didn't know about your sister.

759
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,639
Look.

760
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,840
We got the autopsy results.

761
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,079
She was pregnant.

762
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,159
