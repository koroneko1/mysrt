00:38.280 --> 00:40.000
Hey, d'you think
T-Rexes eat a lot?

00:40.160 --> 00:43.120
We're about to find out unless
Ladybug gets back real soon!

00:43.800 --> 00:45.920
Woohoohoo!

00:46.480 --> 00:49.600
Yeah! It's all good,
we found the dino call!

00:49.600 --> 00:51.240
It had rolled
under my cyclotron!

00:51.800 --> 00:53.440
Ah!

00:55.520 --> 00:56.600
(High-pitched call)

01:00.800 --> 01:03.880
Oh, yes, who's a good
little T-Rex? You are!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.040
Coochie, coochie,
coochie, coochie, coo!

01:06.040 --> 01:10.000
- Everything OK, Carapace?
- Oh! Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.040
Pound it!

01:11.600 --> 01:13.560
Good luck with
your good little T-Rexes!

01:16.240 --> 01:17.280
Bye!

01:18.680 --> 01:22.040
Maybe it wasn't the best idea
to bring you back to life!

01:22.200 --> 01:23.800
What'll I do with you guys now?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.840
You'll eat
my entire food budget!

01:25.840 --> 01:28.000
<i>I'll buy them!</i>
<i>I'll put them on an island</i>

01:28.000 --> 01:32.720
<i>and turn it into a theme park!</i>
<i>I'll be rich! Ha, ha, ha, ha!</i>

01:33.640 --> 01:34.840
Catch you later!

01:38.360 --> 01:39.400
Shell off!

01:40.360 --> 01:41.400
Thanks!

01:42.680 --> 01:44.200
Something's wrong, isn't it?

01:44.520 --> 01:47.160
Well, uh...
well, why wasn't Alya...

01:47.160 --> 01:50.920
- I mean, Rena Rouge here today?
- Oh! Uh, because we needed you,

01:50.920 --> 01:53.880
and only you! And you rocked it!
Way to go!

01:53.880 --> 01:55.800
- I did?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:58.080 --> 01:58.960
Bug out.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.280
We weren't followed?
No sign of Shadow Moth's traps?

02:09.280 --> 02:12.080
- Nothing to report.
- Perfect! Spots off!

02:15.400 --> 02:17.480
Alya, I wanted
to ask you something.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.240
Ah! You noticed!

02:19.240 --> 02:21.560
It's crazy how my costume
automatically adapted

02:21.560 --> 02:24.600
to my new role! And it gave me
the idea for my new name.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.960
- Rena Furtive!
- Cool, yes... but secret!

02:29.120 --> 02:31.560
We agree that, officially,
the Miraculous of the Fox

02:31.560 --> 02:32.920
doesn't have a holder any more.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.640
You did tell Nino you'd never be
Rena Rouge again, right?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.760
Well, it's just...

02:38.920 --> 02:41.080
Alya, everyone has to believe

02:41.080 --> 02:43.040
you can never use
a miraculous again.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.520
So you can be our spy
without anyone suspecting.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.160
And cover you with my power
of illusion if Shadow Moth

02:48.160 --> 02:50.560
has you followed or,
if he ever shows himself,

02:50.560 --> 02:52.840
I can follow him.
I know, I know.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.080
For the plan to work,
no one can know about it.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.440
And no one means<i> no one.</i>

02:57.440 --> 03:00.480
Even Nino has to believe you'll
never be Rena Rouge again!

03:00.760 --> 03:03.520
- Or Rena Furtive?
- Or Rena Furtive.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.840
Oh!

03:05.320 --> 03:07.640
I just don't know
if I can lie to Nino like that.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.160
- We share everything, and...
- It's too late to turn back.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.360
Tell yourself it's not lying,
it's more --

03:13.360 --> 03:15.120
You don't lie to your boyfriend!

03:15.120 --> 03:17.680
If Nino ever finds out,
he'll never trust me again!

03:17.840 --> 03:19.640
I had to keep the truth
from my best friend

03:19.640 --> 03:21.720
for a very long time,
so I know how you feel.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.600
Girls? How about an Ultimate
Mecha Strike XXIII tournament?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.760
Whoa! Sorry, but,
uh, we're doing homework, Dad!

03:28.760 --> 03:31.760
Again? Your teachers
sure give you loads of homework!

03:31.920 --> 03:34.720
And see? I still have to lie
to my family.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.640
I haven't hung out
with Dad for months.

03:36.640 --> 03:41.680
But we don't have a choice.
We've gotta protect our secrets.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.720
Fine, I'll tell him.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.160
I... I... um...

03:48.000 --> 03:51.080
Somebody wants to play
Super Penguino!

03:51.800 --> 03:54.160
There's something
we gotta talk about first.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.240
What?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.320
Uh... I... uh...

03:58.320 --> 04:00.080
Uh, I can't do this.
It's too hard.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.840
- You're starting to worry me.
- If I do this,

04:02.840 --> 04:04.520
it might change
so much between us.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.960
Oh, no! Don't say it!
Anything but that!

04:07.280 --> 04:10.200
- Anything but what?
- You don't love me any more!

04:10.360 --> 04:13.640
- What? No! Of course I do!
- What is it, then?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.200
Nino, it's about
our superhero secrets.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.400
Ladybug and I had a chat, and...

04:20.120 --> 04:22.440
OK. I'm no longer Rena Rouge
and I never will be.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.280
She won't give me
a miraculous again.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.400
She thinks
it's become too dangerous.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.520
Now it all makes sense.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.240
It was so weird, you not being
there with us, last time.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.400
Well,
it's a super bummer, for sure.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.360
But if Ladybug thinks
it's better for you.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.760
Why were you so scared to tell
me? We can share everything!

04:38.760 --> 04:40.480
And nothing
will ever change that!

04:41.040 --> 04:43.160
Yeah, we can share everything...

04:46.280 --> 04:47.520
You did the right thing.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.200
It's safer
to protect our secrets.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.080
Yeah.
It's probably better that way.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.720
It'll be time
for our "evening walk" soon,

04:59.720 --> 05:01.960
- if you know what I mean.
- And while the bug

05:01.960 --> 05:04.520
is out patrolling
with the kitty, the sly fox

05:04.520 --> 05:06.920
will cover them in case
the mean moth sets a...

05:06.920 --> 05:08.600
Oh! Let me show you something!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.480
I took a few selfies
with my new costume.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.840
There are tons of details!

05:12.120 --> 05:14.680
Check this out, by the neckline.
Isn't it way cool?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.440
- Alya...
- I think I like it better.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.400
Oh! What if I did a survey
on the Ladyblog

05:19.400 --> 05:21.160
and let people vote?

05:21.360 --> 05:25.040
(Sighs) Alya, Rena Furtive
means Rena Invisible.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.520
- No one can ever see these!
- Oh! Right, I forgot.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.040
Bummer! It's getting hard to
find material for the Ladyblog!

05:33.760 --> 05:36.000
I still have raw footage
of Cat Noir's stunts.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.560
Depending on how I edit it.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.120
Yes, that's an awesome idea!
Come on! Let's go!

05:41.120 --> 05:42.640
(Alya groans)

05:52.680 --> 05:53.600
Huh?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.120
Hey!
Since we got out early today,

06:00.120 --> 06:01.280
shall we catch a movie?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.800
Uh... I'm not so sure.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.880
Go on! You have time,
we'll meet up later!

06:06.520 --> 06:08.080
So, what's playing
at the movies?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.320
Alya, slow down!

06:10.480 --> 06:12.280
<i>After Ladybug and Cat Noir...</i>

06:12.800 --> 06:15.200
<i>- Cat Noir, come back!</i>
<i>- I'll always love you!</i>

06:15.200 --> 06:18.320
<i>"Ladybug and Cat Noir 2.</i>
<i>The Arrival of Rena Rouge!"</i>

06:18.320 --> 06:21.120
What about Carapace?
Has everyone forgotten Carapace?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.840
<i>Cat Noir, forget about Ladybug!</i>

06:22.960 --> 06:25.720
<i>You and I,</i>
<i>we're made for each other!</i>

06:25.720 --> 06:27.640
What? Rena Rouge
in love with Cat Noir?

06:27.640 --> 06:31.160
- That's totally ridiculous!
- Hey, Nino, It's a cartoon,

06:31.160 --> 06:33.720
a made-up story.
It's just to entertain people!

06:33.720 --> 06:35.840
Hmm! Well, I, for one,
am not entertained!

06:36.280 --> 06:37.480
<i>She's right, Cat Noir!</i>

06:38.520 --> 06:40.520
<i>You and Rena Rouge would</i>
<i>be so much better together!</i>

06:42.920 --> 06:44.720
- Mademoiselle.
- (Chuckles)

06:49.040 --> 06:51.200
Should I take you home, or... ?

06:55.360 --> 06:58.000
That thing you were showing
Marinette seemed cool.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.280
- What was it? Can I see?
- Oh! A thing? What thing?

07:01.280 --> 07:04.360
It was nothing! Besides,
I'm running out of battery!

07:05.600 --> 07:09.080
Hey, look! Andre's over there!
How about some ice cream?

07:10.280 --> 07:11.520
Merci, André!

07:11.760 --> 07:14.160
Alya and Nino!
My favourite lovebirds!

07:14.160 --> 07:16.640
What shall I serve you today?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.680
Uh... Nothing for me, thanks!

07:18.840 --> 07:21.560
I have homework to do!
And I'm not hungry anyway!

07:21.560 --> 07:23.480
You can have my half!
See you later!

07:25.840 --> 07:29.160
Thanks, André, but it'll
have to wait till next time!

07:32.520 --> 07:36.320
Come on! Cat Noir's in love
with Ladybug! Not Rena Rouge!

07:36.320 --> 07:39.600
I don't care! I'm Cat Noir
and all the girls love me!

07:39.880 --> 07:41.400
- (Kids laugh)
- (Sighs)

07:44.680 --> 07:46.440
<i>There's a lot of talk</i>
<i>about Ladybug,</i>

07:46.760 --> 07:50.240
<i>but hardly any about Cat Noir,</i>
<i>and he's an amazing superhero!</i>

07:50.760 --> 07:54.200
<i>Brave, funny, handsome...</i>
<i>Coming right up, a montage</i>

07:54.200 --> 07:56.640
<i>of some of the most impressive</i>
<i>stunts of a superhero</i>

07:56.640 --> 07:59.960
<i>who's every bit as magnificent</i>
<i>as prince char-meowing!</i>

07:59.960 --> 08:02.720
<i>- Stay connected!</i>
- I knew it!

08:03.240 --> 08:05.040
She's in love with someone else!

08:05.040 --> 08:06.320
<i>You spend</i>
<i>every minute together!</i>

08:06.320 --> 08:07.960
<i>You're imagining things!</i>

08:07.960 --> 08:09.760
<i>Who'd she be</i>
<i>in love with anyway?</i>

08:09.920 --> 08:11.320
<i>Cat Noir!</i>

08:12.040 --> 08:13.920
<i>Ha, ha! Yeah, right.</i>

08:13.920 --> 08:16.320
<i>Why not</i>
<i>Jagged Stone's crocodile?</i>

08:16.480 --> 08:20.160
<i>- Did you see the video?</i>
<i>- That's just some video,</i>

08:20.160 --> 08:22.080
<i>- not proof!</i>
<i>- I'll find proof.</i>

08:22.080 --> 08:23.160
<i>Then you'll see I was right!</i>

08:23.680 --> 08:26.840
- There's no way!
- Oh, there's a way! Yes, way!

08:27.000 --> 08:30.080
My natural charisma has
probably just rubbed off on you!

08:30.320 --> 08:32.760
You think I've played
the charming kittycat

08:32.760 --> 08:34.880
and made her
fall in love with me?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.280
I have to be sure.
Plagg, claws out!

08:42.600 --> 08:45.400
<i>Who would want a tormented</i>
<i>turtle for a companion?</i>

08:46.240 --> 08:48.160
<i>No one could resist a kitten.</i>

08:49.520 --> 08:51.560
<i>And this one'd</i>
<i>just ripped my heart out,</i>

08:51.560 --> 08:54.520
<i>like a tragic sax solo</i>
<i>in a love song.</i>

08:54.680 --> 08:57.320
<i>There I was,</i>
<i>with my old buddies again.</i>

08:57.320 --> 09:01.000
<i>The city. The night.</i>
<i>The solitude.</i>

09:01.000 --> 09:02.600
<i>The rain, pouring down,</i>

09:02.840 --> 09:04.920
<i>not like the tears</i>
<i>that were stuck in my throat.</i>

09:05.760 --> 09:08.720
<i>It was time to end</i>
<i>all the lies and secrets.</i>

09:09.520 --> 09:11.800
I always wanted to have
a moustache anyway.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.240
- (Knock on window)
- Huh?

09:16.800 --> 09:17.760
Cat Noir?

09:21.120 --> 09:23.360
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, everything's fine.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.960
It's just that I saw you posted
a new video about me.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.480
I'm super flattered.
But it made me wonder.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.760
You've been following us
from the very start.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.120
You take photos, and videos, and
we even saved you a few times.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.240
I mean, we're starting
to know each other pretty well,

09:37.240 --> 09:39.400
and it's made me notice
a couple of small things.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.880
I hope I'm just under
the illusion that there's...

09:42.040 --> 09:44.640
Illusion? What illusion?
What small things?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.960
It's kind of hard to explain,
but... I wanted to make sure

09:47.960 --> 09:50.200
that in all this time
you've spent admiring me

09:50.360 --> 09:53.280
you haven't built up some kind
of, uh, feelings for me.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.760
I mean, I'd get it.
Hey, I am the cat's miaow!

09:56.040 --> 09:58.320
Huh? What feelings for you?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.840
Well, you know...

10:05.160 --> 10:09.080
(Laughter) Are you insane?
I already have a boyfriend!

10:09.320 --> 10:13.840
And, FYI, with him it's
not just... It's more like...

10:14.720 --> 10:17.960
Ha, ha, ha! Sorry!
That was so silly of me!

10:21.520 --> 10:24.280
Sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino
is a thousand times

10:24.280 --> 10:25.400
more irresistible than you.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.360
And I don't know
your real identity.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.640
I could never fall for someone
I didn't really know!

10:45.880 --> 10:48.200
Hey! Nino!
I gotta tell you something!

10:48.200 --> 10:50.600
No! I gotta tell you something!

10:55.480 --> 10:57.280
Sit down!

11:02.320 --> 11:04.120
Uh,
when did you set all this up?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.480
I'm the one asking questions.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.680
Remember what I told you
yesterday? I got proof now!

11:09.840 --> 11:11.600
What do you say to this?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.520
Come on, that doesn't make
any sense! You're wrong!

11:17.520 --> 11:20.240
That's not at all what happened!

11:20.560 --> 11:22.840
How do you know? You were
there? You're in on it too?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.760
No, no, of course not!
But it's impossible!

11:25.760 --> 11:27.960
I'm sure this is
just a misunderstanding!

11:27.960 --> 11:30.760
Alya and Cat Noir
barely know each other!

11:32.160 --> 11:33.440
Alya's just a superhero fan!

11:33.600 --> 11:36.120
She's been filming them,
that's all!

11:36.120 --> 11:37.560
They're close enough!

11:37.560 --> 11:40.240
But no one knows
their secret identities!

11:40.240 --> 11:43.040
Why would Alya fall in love
with someone she doesn't know?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.920
The girl
who wants to be a reporter?

11:44.920 --> 11:47.120
Who wants to know the truth,
no matter what?

11:47.120 --> 11:49.640
Who wants to share everything
with the boy she loves?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.880
They actually know each other
much better than you think!

11:55.440 --> 11:57.440
You can't assume that
from this video.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.960
Listen!
Here's what you don't know.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.320
I'm not talking about the video.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.040
I'm talking about something
I shouldn't be telling you.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.000
A mind-blowing secret.
Alya is a superhero.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.200
- She's Rena Rouge.
- What?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.080
Shh! I know what you're about
to say. "That's nonsense.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.920
And how would Nino
know that anyway?"

12:16.960 --> 12:18.480
I know because...

12:18.680 --> 12:21.520
I'm a superhero too.
I'm Carapace!

12:22.480 --> 12:26.000
Huh? You're... Carapace?

12:27.400 --> 12:30.200
But... the two of you know?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.680
You know
each other's identities?

12:33.920 --> 12:36.560
Of course. We've never
kept anything from each other.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.240
Until now, with all that
Cat Noir business!

12:39.400 --> 12:41.120
Wait a sec. I don't understand.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.120
I thought secret identities had
to be protected at all costs!

12:44.360 --> 12:47.200
If it were true, you'd never
just tell me like that.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.960
Ladybug'd never agree to that!

12:49.120 --> 12:52.560
Are you kidding? She gave us
our Miraculous at the same time!

12:52.920 --> 12:55.840
- No... that's impossible!
- What are you trying to say?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.080
- That I'm lying or something?
- No, no, what I meant was...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.880
OK! You're Carapace,
she's Rena Rouge

13:02.880 --> 13:04.120
and Ladybug is OK with this.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.320
But it still isn't like Alya
or Cat Noir to be, you know...

13:08.520 --> 13:10.840
You don't know what Cat Noir
really is. But I do!

13:10.840 --> 13:13.120
I'm part of the team! I see
how he acts in real life!

13:13.320 --> 13:14.800
Sure,
as soon as Ladybug shows up,

13:15.240 --> 13:18.120
he throws himself at her feet
with roses and declarations...

13:18.120 --> 13:19.160
(Kissing sounds)

13:19.520 --> 13:20.800
But he gets blown off
every time!

13:21.080 --> 13:22.920
'Cause she thinks
he's obnoxious and is right!

13:23.080 --> 13:26.680
Then, when Rena Rouge shows up,
it's like "Why, hello there,

13:26.680 --> 13:29.760
pretty lady! You look so fine!
You smell so good!"

13:29.760 --> 13:33.040
So, yeah, it's easy to figure
out that the first mission

13:33.040 --> 13:35.880
Carapace missed,
he made his move, and bam!

13:35.880 --> 13:39.840
This is what happened!
And now I'm all alone!

13:39.840 --> 13:42.400
I've lost the love of my life.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.320
If I could, I'd sew his sweet
talking mouth shut

13:45.320 --> 13:47.240
with his own whiskers!

13:54.040 --> 13:57.160
A spurned boyfriend who wants
vengeance on his rival!

13:57.320 --> 13:59.400
Now, that's a strong emotion.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.640
Fly my little akuma,
and help this young man

14:03.800 --> 14:06.320
destroy his enemy... my enemy!

14:10.440 --> 14:12.400
There's got to be
an explanation, Nino!

14:12.400 --> 14:13.440
We'll work it all out!

14:16.040 --> 14:18.760
Rocketear, I am Shadow Moth!

14:18.920 --> 14:21.520
Cat Noir has ripped
your heart out and left you

14:21.520 --> 14:23.320
in a weeping state of sorrow.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.720
So I'm giving your tears
the power to destroy everything.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.480
- All I ask for in return are...
- I know what you want.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.280
Don't worry,
the only thing left of them

14:32.280 --> 14:34.160
will be their Miraculous!

14:37.440 --> 14:39.840
Nino!
You have to fight off this ev...

14:40.000 --> 14:41.760
- Ugh!
- You're not my enemy, Adrien.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.200
Cat Noir is!

14:48.160 --> 14:51.080
I know what you're about to
do, but I'd advise you not to,

14:51.080 --> 14:53.480
considering what he's got
in store for Cat Noir.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.640
I can't leave Nino like that!
Plagg, claws out!

15:13.760 --> 15:15.520
And that's why he showed up.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.960
'Cause of this video I posted.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.720
He thought I was
in love with him!

15:19.720 --> 15:21.800
Oh! That Cat Noir!

15:22.080 --> 15:23.560
- (Screaming)
- What?

15:24.280 --> 15:26.960
Cat Noir!
You stole my Alya from me!

15:26.960 --> 15:29.560
I'm going to steal
your life from you!

15:39.880 --> 15:42.680
I didn't steal anyone!
Alya still loves you!

15:42.680 --> 15:44.600
Liar! I have proof!

15:47.160 --> 15:48.960
Oh, no! This can't be happening!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.200
Oh, Nino, no!

15:51.520 --> 15:54.040
We must stop them before
they hurt each other! Come!

15:59.640 --> 16:01.400
OK, we can transform
in peace in here.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.480
- Oh!
- Oh!

16:13.200 --> 16:14.800
Alya, don't tell me you...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.040
Of course not!
It's a misunderstanding!

16:19.400 --> 16:21.640
If you could hear
what we were saying,

16:21.640 --> 16:24.000
Nino would never believe
I love Cat Noir!

16:24.160 --> 16:26.000
OK, fine.
Let's not waste time!

16:26.320 --> 16:27.720
- Tikki!
- Trixx!

16:28.240 --> 16:29.800
- Spots on!
- Let's pounce!

16:31.960 --> 16:33.160
Lucky Charm!

16:38.760 --> 16:40.040
A video projector?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.600
What am I meant to do with this?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.320
Do like Nino and make up
imaginary movies in your head?

16:51.760 --> 16:54.040
You said that if Nino
could have heard you,

16:54.040 --> 16:56.200
- he wouldn't misunderstand?
- Absolutely!

16:56.360 --> 16:58.920
How well do you remember
what you said on the balcony?

16:59.080 --> 17:00.600
Every word!

17:00.960 --> 17:03.320
D'you think you could make
a sound illusion?

17:03.560 --> 17:04.520
Totally!

17:08.720 --> 17:10.480
- I don't want to fight you!
- Silence!

17:13.720 --> 17:15.120
Let me explain!

17:16.320 --> 17:19.600
- I don't wanna hear your lies!
- You wanted proof?

17:19.760 --> 17:20.840
Here's proof.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.040
That doesn't prove a thing!

17:30.120 --> 17:31.800
Ugh!

17:34.880 --> 17:38.480
See? I don't want to hurt you.
Can we talk now?

17:38.640 --> 17:42.760
Shut him up for good! But before
you do, seize his Miraculous.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.240
- It's over, Cat Noir.
- Don't do this...

17:50.040 --> 17:51.240
Nino! Stop!

17:52.040 --> 17:55.240
Look, my lucky charm gave me
a super-advanced projector

17:55.240 --> 17:59.560
that will allow you to hear
the sound of the video you shot.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.280
I don't know what Cat Noir
said to your girlfriend,

18:02.280 --> 18:03.880
- but I trust him.
- Mirage!

18:06.200 --> 18:09.280
Now look and listen carefully.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.400
- Well, you know...
- Well, you know...

18:15.560 --> 18:19.440
(Laughter) Are you insane?

18:19.440 --> 18:23.840
I already have a boyfriend! And,
FYI, with him it's not just...

18:23.840 --> 18:26.360
It's more like...

18:26.520 --> 18:28.360
Sorry! That was so silly of me!

18:28.360 --> 18:31.640
Yeah! Sorry, Cat Noir,
but my Nino is a thousand times

18:31.640 --> 18:33.680
more irresistible than you.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.520
And I don't know your identity.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.040
And I could never fall for
someone I didn't really know!

18:41.440 --> 18:42.640
Let's rest.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.760
Nino!

18:47.080 --> 18:48.760
I can't believe
I ever doubted you.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.880
I can't believe
I ever chose to do anything

18:50.880 --> 18:52.480
over spending time with you.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.920
I'm so sorry!

18:56.960 --> 18:58.600
I was so scared for you!

19:03.080 --> 19:06.480
Shadow Moth! You can have
your lame powers back!

19:13.960 --> 19:16.200
No more evildoing for you,
little akuma.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.480
Time to de-evilise!

19:25.320 --> 19:27.160
Gotcha!

19:27.520 --> 19:29.240
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

19:29.920 --> 19:31.360
Miraculous Ladybug!

19:40.480 --> 19:42.920
Love and secrets don't mix,
Ladybug.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.120
And I'm sure
you have many secrets too.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.280
(Evil laugh)

19:55.120 --> 19:58.840
Nino, take this magical charm.
Always carry it with you.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.000
That way, Shadow Moth
can't get to you any more.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.880
I won't need to use it, Ladybug.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.240
I'll never let Shadow Moth use
my love to manipulate me again.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.000
I guess I was wrong about you,
my dude. I'm sorry.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.360
Everyone has doubts
now and then... even me.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.160
- Is everything OK, Cat Noir?
- Yeah, yeah...

20:19.200 --> 20:20.800
- Pound it!
- Pound it!

20:26.720 --> 20:28.480
I still can't believe

20:28.640 --> 20:30.440
Ladybug entrusted Alya and Nino
with those Miraculous.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.600
Of course she did,
she's the guardian!

20:32.800 --> 20:35.480
But they know
each other's identities!

20:35.640 --> 20:37.560
- So?
- So why does she make it a rule

20:37.560 --> 20:40.560
we can't know the other's
identity, but it's OK for them?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.760
She's the guardian,
the Grand Master Cheese Ripener.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.040
And you and I
are just cheese on the platter.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.080
She decides what's on the menu.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.280
I'm really sorry.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.280
I didn't mean to cause trouble
between you and Nino.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.120
Don't worry. I've got this.
Do you trust me?

20:56.600 --> 20:57.800
I trust you.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.080
Nino, there's something
I have to tell you.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.640
Again? You sure you don't wanna
just play Super Penguino?

21:07.920 --> 21:11.320
I'm still Rena Rouge.
But now, I'm in hiding.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.640
That's why she asked me
not to tell anyone.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.960
But why are you telling me
if no one's supposed to know?

21:16.960 --> 21:19.960
- Is Ladybug cool with this?
- I can't hide it from you.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.240
Because I love you, Nino.
And we share everything!
