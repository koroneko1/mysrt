1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,300
Be my boyfriend, my spoiled prince.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,280
Be my boyfriend, Cantaloupe.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't understand how he can be your friend.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,460
Tin likes me.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,380
He just feels sorry for you.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,420
Can and I…

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,280
We are…

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,340
Spill your secrets to me right now!

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,460
You want to know, right?

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,600
Watch this.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,320
Do you know now who his boyfriend is?

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,280
You…

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,800
Can…

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,420
And Tin.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
You guys are boyfriends?

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,240
Wow.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,320
I don’t know if I should call you crazy

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,920
or call you brave.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,220
Congratulations.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,560
Wow.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,280
Can.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
You’re awesome.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,640
My friend is the best.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,720
Kissing in the middle of the field.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,420
Pond will hear about this.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,460
That's right.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,100
Tin and I are boyfriends.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Is that clear?

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,560
Let’s go.

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,200
What just happened?

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,600
Can.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,060
Can.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,480
Tin and Can are boyfriends?

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,100

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,420
What have I done?

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,240
I'm glad that you like me so much that you'd do such a thing.

58
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,240
Hey!

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,860
I don’t like you.

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,240
I just ran out of patience.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,300
You’re my boyfriend.

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,700
Lay can’t ship you with someone else.

63
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,980
Why are you smiling?

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,320
If you don’t like me a lot,

65
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,440
then you won’t be this jealous.

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,700
I’m not.

67
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,360
Why are you laughing?

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,560
You should comfort me.

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,460
I told you to comfort me.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,440
There, there. It's okay.

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
My sugar baby.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
I’m still amazed.

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,960
Not just you.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,020
I’m still in shock.

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Can is so brave.

76
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,640
We should give him a round of applause.

77
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,300
They must really love each other.

78
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,140
That’s why he dared to do that.

79
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,700
I want to laugh when I think about it.

80
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,020
Dude.

81
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,360
Is it that nice to have a boyfriend?

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,720
Are you saying that…

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,940
No! It’s nothing!

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
You’re overthinking.

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
I’ll go then.

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
What the hell?

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,900
I was going to ask if he envies them.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,820
Why is he acting suspiciously?

89
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,180
Why am I thinking about him?

90
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,960
Maybe I’m just lonely.

91
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,980
I don’t think so.

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,440
Shit! I just called him!

93
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,420
Hello, Techno.

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,960
I dialed the wrong number. I have to go. Bye.

95
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,540
Damn it.

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,220
What’s wrong with myself?

97
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,460
Damn it.

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,320
Sorry, there is no acknowlegement from your requested number.

99
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Pond.

100
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,040
Do you know what happened at the field that day?

101
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,020
I don’t know.

102
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
How come the nosiest person like you doesn’t know about this?

103
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,640
Exactly.

104
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,800
The nosiest person like me doesn’t know about this.

105
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
That’s why I’m so angry with myself.

106
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,940
It's about Can and that guy from the English program.

107
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,780
How can I not know about this?

108
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,220
Is my gossiping skill declining?

109
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,680
I know now that's why you're so grumpy today.

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,740
How about him?

111
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Ae!

112
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you know what just happened?

113
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,040
He knows everything but he never tells me.

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,140
I had to ask every member in the football team instead.

115
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,200
I know that Can pulled Tin for a kiss.

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,520
Everyone in the university already knows that.

117
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,620
My friends from the English program said all the girls are heartbroken.

118
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,260
Including me.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,900
The students from the English program know about this too?

120
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,660
Everyone in the university knows.

121
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,700
Where have you been?

122
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I missed the chance to be the first one to spread the gossip.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,220
You’re too slow.

124
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,800
Ae.

125
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,180
What are you doing?

126
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,180
You’re choosing a photo again?

127
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,060
Yes.

128
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,780
How long are you going to do this?

129
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,380
I’ll keep doing it.

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,000
There’re 365 days in one year.

131
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,400
Will you post 365 photos?

132
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,680
If he’s not here for a year, then I’ll post 365 photos.

133
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,040
If he’s not here for two years, then I’ll post 730 photos.

134
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,120
I’ll keep posting it.

135
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,480
I want him to know that I’ll never stop loving him.

136
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,720
You guys are so serious.

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
I’ll go to the next class first.

138
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Take care of him.

139
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
Make sure that he’s okay.

140
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,820
Noon and Jane are waiting for me.

141
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,720
I’m Bow. My name is Bow and I’m going to find Noon and Jane.

142
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,780
Wait for me, my friends!

143
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,600
Since when did she have new friends?

144
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,180
Hello, Ae.

145
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,500
Can I talk to you?

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,340
How do you know me?

147
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,280
Before I answer your question,

148
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,460
let me introduce myself first.

149
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,040
My name is Keen. I’m a student from the Faculty of Music.

150
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,700
Are you Tharn and Type’s friend?

151
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,740
Well, yes.

152
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I know Tharn. We’re in the same faculty,
but we chose a different major.

153
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,360
What do you want from me?

154
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,960
I’ll get straight to the point.

155
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,980
I wonder why you always post a photo every day?

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,820
Some photos seem to have no meaning.

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,180
Some photos have a short caption.

158
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,640
I know that it’s rude to ask about your private life.

159
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,520
But I’ve been following you for a while now.

160
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,440
I’m very interested in what you post.

161
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,320
I feel like you’re telling it to someone.

162
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,800
It's none of your business.

163
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,240
As I told you that I’m a music student.

164
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,820
I got inspiration from your posts.

165
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,560
I want to tell your story through a song.

166
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,580
I’m not interested. You should find someone else.

167
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,160
Wait.

168
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,320
Listen to me first.

169
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,560
I can do it in my own way. I don’t need help.

170
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,760
Don’t you want to tell that person more than just a few words?

171
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,540
A song can say things more than words.

172
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,700
This song can express your feelings for that person.

173
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,040
Anyway.

174
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,860
I just want you think about it.

175
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,040
I’ve got to go.

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,240
Are you okay about this?

177
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,300
You don’t like to deal with a lot of people.

178
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,260
Apart from Keen, you have to talk with his bandmates as well.

179
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,240
You’re right.

180
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,520
Then why are you still…

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,240
You know why.

182
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,440
I can do everything for Pete.

183
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,000
Ae...

184
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,740
I want him to know.

185
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
Since the day that we broke up,

186
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,920
there's not a day that goes by that I don't miss him.

187
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,260
If there’s anything that I can do

188
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,520
even if I don’t like it, I will do it.

189
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Techno.

190
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,120
What happened to you?

191
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,040
You look like you haven’t slept for ages.

192
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,040
Because of your friend, Can.

193
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,920
He’s been playing with Technic at my house.

194
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,800
He's there for about four days already.

195
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,880
They usually stop playing at around 2 or 3 a.m.

196
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,980
He wouldn’t leave no matter how many times I told him to go.

197
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,080
That’s why I look like this.

198
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Why does he have to stay at your place?

199
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,720
I don’t know.

200
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,720
He wouldn’t tell me anything when I asked.

201
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,780
They will meet up again tonight.

202
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,800
I want to run away from home.

203
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
What the hell?

204
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,220
Shit!

205
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,860
Lay!

206
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,880
What are you doing here this late at night?

207
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,200
You scared me.

208
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,320
I should be the one who asks you.

209
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,700
Why are you sneaking around?

210
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,220
How many days already that you come back home at this time?

211
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,940
Well…

212
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh right!

213
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,760
I was planning the strategy with Tehcno.

214
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,000
I also went to sleep over at Job’s house.

215
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,080
I’m so sleepy.

216
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,060
I’m going to bed now.

217
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,000
Let’s talk tomorrow.

218
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,420
Ouch! That hurts!

219
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,660
I mean to hurt you.

220
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
How long do you think you can avoid me?

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,560
Well…

222
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,560
Many days.

223
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,580
So, you and Tin are boyfriends, right?

224
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,880
Tell me.

225
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,700
If you lie to me,

226
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,200
I’ll stab you.

227
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,240
Fine.

228
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,940
I’m sorry

229
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,080
that I disappoint you.

230
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,040
Why do I have to feel disappointed?

231
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,400
You said that you want Tin to be with a handsome and rich guy.

232
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,940
The one who's perfect for him.

233
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,420
But I never said that I’d be against your relationship.

234
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
Also, you are my brother.

235
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,780
If Tin already chose you,

236
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,340
then there's nothing I can do.

237
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,580
Are you actually on my side?

238
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,220
Of course.

239
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,880
If dad and mom are not on your side,

240
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,460
I'll be the one who supports you.

241
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,400
Also,

242
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
your boyfriend is Tin.

243
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,560
Don’t let him slip through your fingers!

244
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay.

245
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,240
I feel at ease now.

246
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,320
I’m going to bed.

247
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,620
Also,

248
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,120
don’t try to avoid me ever again.

249
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,420
Someone like you can’t hide away from me.

250
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,540
Don’t let that knife slip through your fingers.

251
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,560
Shit!

252
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
Lay!

253
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,140
It’s you again?

254
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,480
It should be me who said that.

255
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
What are you doing down here? I'm going upstairs now.

256
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,160
You can go first. I’m hungry. I’ll find something to eat.

257
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:15,740
Wait.

258
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,760
Stop.

259
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,200
I’ve got this.

260
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,120
Don’t eat snacks.

261
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,140
Here.

262
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,100
This will improve your skin health.

263
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
Your skin will become more resilient.

264
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,300
You'll also get plump skin.

265
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,560
Why do I need to care?

266
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,140
I’m hungry.

267
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,100
I want to feel full.

268
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,980
This will make you full, and it won’t make you fat.

269
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,460
Your boyfriend is Tin.

270
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,640
You should make yourself look better too.

271
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Don't eat snacks.

272
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,720
I know.

273
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,060
This is yummy.

274
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,040
It'll be great if my skin is bouncy

275
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,760
because Tin likes to kiss my cheeks.

276
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,840
I don't want my cheeks to be damaged.

277
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,040
Is it bouncy now?

278
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,820
Tin.

279
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,640
Lay didn’t kill me.

280
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
I was really stressed out.

281
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,840
I was avoiding her.

282
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,040
But she wasn’t angry at me at all.

283
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,840
If I know this, I won't waste my time finding a place to sleep.

284
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,180
Whose house did you go to?

285
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,480
Come on.

286
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Don’t be mad.

287
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,580
I was hanging out at Techno’s place

288
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,200
and playing games at Job’s house.

289
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,580
I went back home after Lay went to bed.

290
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,580
Come to my place next time.

291
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,020
I don’t want to.

292
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,760
Your house is too far.

293
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,740
You'll have to drop me off late at night

294
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,180
because there’s no bus around there.

295
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,300
I can't go back home if I go to your house.

296
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,360
But I’m okay now because my sister won’t kill me.

297
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,920
Fine.

298
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,280
I think I'll buy a room.

299
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,900
Why do you have to buy it?

300
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,380
You already have a house and a car.

301
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,760
Why do you need to buy it?

302
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,500
So, we can do something more convenient.

303
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,080
Are you talking about dirty stuff?

304
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,220
That’s right.

305
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,260
It’s not convenient at home.

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,940
Why not?

307
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,140
My mom is okay that I sleep over at your place.

308
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,060
If you’re bored, you can come to my house instead.

309
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,040
My mom doesn't mind.

310
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,540
If I go,

311
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,300
do you think that they won’t know

312
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,060
that we…

313
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
You’re right.

314
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,200
If my mom hears me making sound…

315
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,500
That's creepy!

316
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,840
She'll barge through the door.

317
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,820
But Tin,

318
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,560
are you going to buy a room just because of that reason?

319
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,020
Prince Tin is extraordinary.

320
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,240
Not just that.

321
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,180
I also want to have freedom.

322
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,720
Then...

323
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,360
Why do you want to buy it after we’re together?

324
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,680
I wanted to exist in that house before.

325
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,640
Don’t worry.

326
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,380
Don’t mind them.

327
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,360
You have me now.

328
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,160
If I meet your brother,

329
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,260
I’ll punch him in the face.

330
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,300
Don't go back on your words.

331
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,860
Trust me.

332
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,060
I’m a man of my word.

333
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,820
(Personal Information)

334
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,500
It’s time for your brother to meet him.

335
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,460
What’s the matter?

336
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,500
About the internship.

337
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,160
I already told your brother that you can’t do it.

338
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,980
Let’s talk about this when the university tells you to do it.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,640
Then why that asshole…

340
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,620
Why my brother can do it but I can’t?

341
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,880
You and your brother are not the same.

342
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,160
What’s the difference?

343
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,860
We’re both a Medthanan family.

344
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,140
Your brother will be responsible for everything after me.

345
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,740
Not you.

346
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,740
Why are you saying like I’m not your son?

347
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
I never said that.

348
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,500
What if I ask to live somewhere else.

349
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,020
It’s up to you.

350
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,200
I can see from your face that you didn’t get what you want.

351
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,560
I told you before. You can't do it.

352
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,580
You told dad, right?

353
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,560
Why do you say that?

354
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,620
There's nothing I can do if dad already made the decision.

355
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,060
There’s something that you can’t do?

356
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,340
There’re many things that I can’t do.

357
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,620
Like…

358
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,200
Bringing back my little brother.

359
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,340
That will never happen.

360
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,800
Don’t forget to introduce me to your friend.

361
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,300
Damn it.

362
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,660
That little brother is gone.

363
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,180
That stupid brother

364
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,080
does no longer exist.

365
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,360
Tul.

366
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,760
You have to believe me.

367
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,180
I didn’t use those drugs.

368
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,220
Everyone thought I’m a bad person now.

369
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,740
But I didn’t do it.

370
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,080
I don't care if others don't believe me,

371
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,740
but you have to.

372
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,120
You have to believe me.

373
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,900
Dad and mom hate me now.

374
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,660
But I don’t care.

375
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,780
As long as you believe me.

376
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,080
Of course, I believe you.

377
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,380
Because I’m the one who made you like this.

378
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
What do you mean?

379
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,580
This is not funny.

380
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,100
Do you think I’m joking?

381
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,560
I’m the one who put you in that party.

382
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,460
I’m the one who told the news reporters to go there.

383
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,480
I’m the one who put you on the front page.

384
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,140
I’m the one who ruined your life.

385
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,740
I don’t believe it.

386
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,340
You’re kidding me, right?

387
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,860
You’re drunk, right?

388
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,440
I told you not to drink.

389
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,060
It’s not good for you!

390
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,260
How long are you going to be this stupid?

391
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,540
I never loved you.

392
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,960
I want you dead since the day you’re born.

393
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,620
If there’s no you, your mom, and your grandmother,

394
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,940
then I won’t have to live in this shithole.

395
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,480
Now I ruined your life too.

396
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,100
I hate you!

397
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,820
You can hurt anyone

398
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,880
but not the one that is important to me.

399
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,700
You can’t hurt Can.

400
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,780
Hello.

401
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,180
I want to know your master’s weakness.

402
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,740
We made a deal already.

403
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,380
Tell me what you know.

404
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,160
I can’t tell you that.

405
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't you remember what I told you?

406
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
When you came to see me last year,

407
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,200
I promised you that I would help you every way I can.

408
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,440
I will do everything that you tell me.

409
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,860
But there’s one thing that I ask of you.

410
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,140
I will never do anything that causes harm to Tul.

411
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,400
I will never betray Tul.

412
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,260
Even he chased you away from home?

413
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,000
That's right.

414
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,080
He’s not as bad as you think.

415
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,700
You’re the only family he has.

416
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,180
Do you think I believe that?

417
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,680
He didn't chase me away.

418
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,060
I was the one who walked away from him.

419
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,800
Calm down, Vadee.

420
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,240
What am I going to do?

421
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,100
What should I do?

422
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,920
I have something to tell you.

423
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,820
I’m pregnant.

424
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,060
I’m pregnant, Tul.

425
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
You already have a family that you wish for.

426
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Thank you for keeping your promise.

427
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,820
Thank you for not finding me.

428
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,160
I want you to be happy.

429
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,860
That's all I ask.

430
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,920
You’re the world to me.

431
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,980
Tul.

432
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,360
Hello, Can.

433
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,700
Are you awake?

434
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,020
I’m going to pick you up.

435
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,800
I just woke up.

436
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,780
Where are we going today?

437
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,740
Where do you want to go?

438
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,720
I can take you anywhere you want.

439
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,800
I want to go to your house.

440
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
I miss your chef’s cooking.

441
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,600
Also, I want to do a movie marathon.

442
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,280
I’m not sure if my brother will be at home or not.

443
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,900
It'll be great if he is. I'll deal with him myself.

444
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,860
Do you think you can do that?

445
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,900
You’re underestimating me.

446
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,260
Come and pick me up now.

447
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,440
I don’t want to fight with you over the phone.

448
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Okay. You should take a shower then.

449
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,360
I’ll finish in three minutes. Bye.

450
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,400
Tin.

451
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,720
The car is ready.

452
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,860
Okay.

453
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,420
Where is he going?

454
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,800
You mean Tul?

455
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,680
He goes to Vadee’s house.

456
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,600
He will stay there tonight.

457
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,740
He told me not to wait for him.

458
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,480
Can!

459
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,040
Go grocery shopping for me when you're coming back.

460
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,360
Mom…

461
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,720
Can I not buy them today?

462
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,400
I can’t remember what to buy.

463
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,060
Also, I don’t know what time I’ll be back.

464
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,680
Why don’t you ask Lay to do it?

465
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,660
She said she had to study for her exams.

466
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,720
I have to study too.

467
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,480
But you’re going to hang out right now.

468
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,500
How do you know that?

469
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,220
Maybe I’m going out to study.

470
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,100
You don’t have any fever.

471
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,740
Mom…

472
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:27,260
How can my sweet Cantaloupe know how to study?

473
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,600
You always fall asleep when you're studying for exams.

474
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,480
Mom.

475
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,100
You should look at your son in a positive way.

476
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,700
This is called accepting the truth.

477
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,120
You'll never find any mom who is as kind as me.

478
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,600
I can still smile when you fail the exam.

479
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
Anyway,

480
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,640
don’t forget to buy me all of this.

481
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
Here’s the list.

482
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,100
You can go now.

483
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,960
Tin is here to pick you up.

484
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,080
I wish that I can have a handsome son like you.

485
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,040
Hello.

486
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,620
This is for you.

487
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,340
Thank you, son.

488
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,080
You’re handsome and kind.

489
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,300
And look at my son...

490
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,220
He won't stop complaining just because
I ask him to go grocery shopping.

491
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,720
Let’s go.

492
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,920
I have to come back early to buy these groceries
for my beloved mother.

493
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,940
It's a lot.

494
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,360
Can he come to sleep over at my place tonight?

495
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,440
Huh?

496
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,260
About this.

497
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,200
Don't worry.

498
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,240
I’ll ask someone to buy it for you.

499
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,100
How can you do that?

500
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,780
My mom asked me to buy it. I have to go by myself.

501
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,500
It’s okay.

502
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,740
Calm down.

503
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,960
If Can goes with you, then I'm not worried.

504
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,560
I trust that you will keep him on the right track.

505
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,140
You guys can go now. Don't waste your time here.

506
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,800
Good bye.

507
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,200
Good bye.

508
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,860
Don’t make that grumpy face.

509
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,660
Alright!

510
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,600
I wish that I can have another son like Tin.

511
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,420
Maybe you already have him for a while.

512
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,380
Oh, my Buddha!

513
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,640
You scared me.

514
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
Why are you sneaking up on me like that?

515
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,920
Do you know that my mom is always talking about you?

516
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,480
She never gives me what I want.

517
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,260
Isn’t that great?

518
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,980
It can be useful.

519
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,720
I’ll let you ask my mom for me instead.

520
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
You said that we won’t come here.

521
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,940
Or do you want to do something with me?

522
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,820
Can!

523
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,620
Stop acting like you don't want to.

524
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,640
I can see it in your eyes.

525
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,980
It’s a good idea.

526
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,060
Because I also miss…

527
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,460
Ouch! That hurts.

528
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,420
If you already know that, then don’t run away.

529
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,400
Someone like me never runs away.

530
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,320
Fine.

531
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,140
Let’s go inside.

532
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,440
Who’s coming?

533
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,120
Let’s go inside.

534
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Tin.

535
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,100
Who’s that?

536
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,260
That’s your asshole brother.

537
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,380
You’re Tin’s friend, right?

538
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,340
My name is Tul.

539
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,680
I’m his brother.

540
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,940
Nice to meet you.

541
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,400
What’s up?

542
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,120
I’m glad that I finally get to meet
my brother’s important person.

543
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,680
You’re such a douchebag.

544
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,640
Tin!

545
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Don’t mess with him.

546
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,020
Tin, I haven’t…

547
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,540
Get inside.

548
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,620
Tin.

549
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,680
Get inside.

550
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,480
Please.

551
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,360
Wait for me inside.

552
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,060
He’s so naïve.

553
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,900
Don’t mess with him.

554
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,840
I'm warning you.

555
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,580
Is he home?

556
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,420
He said he would kill someone at your house.

557
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,740
Excuse me.

558
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,400
Tin!

559
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,660
Should we talk?

560
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,100
Tin told you that I framed him about using drugs, right?

561
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,100
This is...

562
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,260
Where did you get these photos?

563
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,580
I talked to your brother.

564
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,740
Then there's nothing left to talk.

565
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,740
Tin!

566
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,920
Can you stop being silly?

567
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,340
You believe him, right?

568
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,740
You hate me now, right?
