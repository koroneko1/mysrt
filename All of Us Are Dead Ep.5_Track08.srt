327
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,843
What do we do?
On-jo and Cheong-san are really close.

328
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,137
[Ji-min] They're going out.

329
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,098
But On-jo told me they're not.

330
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,475
I'm telling you they are.

331
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,727
[Ji-min] They're always together.

332
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,147
[Hyo-ryeong] Really?

334
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,734
Poor On-jo.

I'm sure Cheong-san is fine.

340
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,338
You know how fast he is.

341
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,092
I don't know why he never listens.

342
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,679
Ever since we were kids,
he's just never listened to me.

343
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,685
I told him not to go,
but, of course, he did.

344
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,979
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,607
I should've brought him back here.

[sighs]

347
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,948
Where do you think…

348
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,202
he is now?

349
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,915
I'm pretty sure
he's in a safe hiding spot.

352
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,639
Joon-yeong. Didn't you mention
that your science club made a drone?

353
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,143
Yeah. You want to look
for Cheong-san with it?

354
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,605
-Could we?
-Well, yeah. But it's in the science lab.

355
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,898
We can go get it.

356
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,401
How would we get it?
It's crawling with zombies out there.

357
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,404
That.

358
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,157
[foreboding tense music]

359
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,910
[Joon-yeong] You want me
to climb up on that?

360
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,204
But there are zombies
in the science lab too.

361
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,749
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

362
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,042
That's true, but…

363
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,130
We have to find Cheong-san.

364
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,759
There's no one else besides us
to start looking

365
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,302
and rescue people.

366
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
[sighs]

367
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,559
Yeah.

368
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,478
It would be good if we had the drone.

369
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,689
We can find Cheong-san and then
we can see how things are outside.

370
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,735
[Nam-ra] We might even be able to send
an emergency message and ask for help.

371
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,780
Sure, that would be really great.

372
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,575
But who's gonna go?

373
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,785
I wanna go.

374
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,330
I took a fire rescue class,
and I've climbed ropes before.

375
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,707
No, I'll go.

376
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,336
You already went out there.

377
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,089
[On-jo] You can't keep
putting yourself in danger.

378
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,383
The drone isn't finished yet,

379
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,218
we need to find
a few more parts to run it.

380
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,553
Do you know what to get?

381
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,391
[ominous music]

382
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,308
[Joon-yeong sighs]

383
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,060
Then I have to go anyway, I guess.

384
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,980
I'll go with On-jo.

385
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,106
No way.

386
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,987
I'm actually going this time
so stand back.

387
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
But you can't.

388
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,365
He can't.
[chuckles]

389
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,075
The rope won't hold you.

390
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,288
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

391
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,832
-Yeah. Right.
-[Dae-su] Yeah. It'll snap.

392
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,292
[Wu-jin] Right. Good boy.

393
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,752
Joon-yeong, come with me.

394
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,130
Mm.

395
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,967
It's too dangerous.

396
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,885
I'll go.

397
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,637
[Joon-yeong groans]

398
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,479
Thank you.

399
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,356
But I don't want you…

400
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,943
to be put in danger anymore.

401
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,530
[Joon-yeong] I'm going.

402

[groans]

403
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm going.

[Ji-min] Be careful, On-jo.

407
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,315
Be safe. We'll be watching, okay?

[Hyo-ryeong] Do you think…

412
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,215
it's really safe out there?

413
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,383
I'm sure it is.

414
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,888
Like you said,
there are soldiers and cops, right?

415
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,312
I wanna go to my dad's factory
and my mom's <i>sundae </i>place.

[snorts]
Whatever.

00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,567
You hate the smell
of leather and <i>sundae</i> anyway.

[sniffles]
Yeah, I do.

419
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,781
I just want my mom's <i>sundae </i>soup.

[scoffs]

So you finally grew up?
You should have said that earlier.

[Jae-ik] Hey. Hey, look.

427
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,804
I bet there's a key in there, right?

428
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
[sighs]
I don't think so.

429
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,021
Shouldn't we just hide somewhere safe
and wait to be rescued?

430
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,189
Hey.

431

is on his laptop at the school.

We have to hurry and notify
Fire and Disasters HQ.

433
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,656
The people who have important information
need to survive, am I right?

434
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
So doesn't our survival come first?

435
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,618
Why do you keep acting
better than everyone

Why don't you go check the fridge
for some milk or something?

00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,747
Why? Are you thirsty?

497
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,666
It's for the baby.

498
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,962
We need to feed this baby somehow.
It's very dehydrated.

499
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,924
What if there's no milk?

500
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,551
Can you just check first?

501
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,678
Check the fridge,
and if there's no milk, come back,

502
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,097
and we cross that bridge
when we come to it, okay?

00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,891
Uh, yeah. You're right. Yeah.

504

What?

529
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,313
If eventually everyone in the world
but us ends up turning in too?

530
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,150
No way.

Nah.

No.

00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,807
The archery center has an emergency phone.

655
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,017
It automatically connects
to emergency services.

656
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,269
-Really?
-Yeah.

657
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,729
We got a hotline installed a while ago
because of some injuries.

658
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,858
And if it doesn't connect?
All the phones and internet are dead.

659
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,025
It doesn't matter.

660
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,404
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

661
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,656
I have less than 20 left.

662
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,033
We'll need more
if we wanna leave the school alive.

663
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,119
-I think, uh--
-Okay, let's go.

664
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,997
Go to the archery center
so we can get your arrows.

665
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,250
Then we should probably go home
or maybe go to a supermarket.

666
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
You know. In most zombie movies,

667
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,672
the ones that go to supermarkets
always manage to survive in the end.

668
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,133
And they have cigs.

669
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,342
I think that we--

670
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,469
[Min-jae] The dumpsters
are right under these windows.

671
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,639
I think it's better to jump
than use the stairs.

672
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,226
[sighs]
Yeah. Let's jump.

673
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,104
Falling from the third floor is way better
than falling your exams, right?

674
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,940
Hey, let me get a word in!

675
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,941
Hey, Min-jae.

676
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,235
Go down first and shoot any
that come running.

677
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,653
[Min-jae] Okay.

678
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,947
Then you two go down
and help him out as much as you can.

679
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,782
I'll cover you out in the hallway
and bring up the rear.

00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,783
Mm.

682
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,121
Uh, I think we should just stay here.

683
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,041
The adults will rescue us.

684
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,335
If you wanna stay, be my guest.

685
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,046
But I don't trust adults.

and the safety of those around you.</i>

816
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,098
<i>We appreciate your continuous cooperation.</i>

EXAMINATION ROOM

818
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,562
Thank you for your service.
Where's the control room?

819
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,193
As per Martial Law,

820
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,987
you have to quarantine
until you are examined.

821
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,448
Why in the world
would she have to quarantine now?

822
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,825
She just came back from a battlefield--

823
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,827
-It's okay. That's enough.
-Unbelievable.

824
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,538
So, where is the control room?

825
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,665
[soldier 1] You have to be examined first.

826
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,917
I'm not refusing to be examined.

827
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
[soldier 1] Please follow the protocols.

828
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,339
Hyosan Fire Station.
Rescue Team One, Captain Nam So-ju.

829
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,633
I was responsible for them
from mobilization until rescue.

830
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,717
[soldier 1] Enough!

831
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,053
Does it sound like
I'm asking your opinion?

832
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,765
-[soldier 1] Take them to the exam room.
-[soldier 2] Yes, sir.

833
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,892
[dramatic music]

834
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,489
[Eun-hee] What is this place?

835
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,492
This isn't an examination room.

836
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
[soldier 2] There are lots
of people in line for exams,

837
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,121
you have to wait your turn.

838
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,291
Then you should've explained the situation
and asked her to wait somewhere else

839
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,584
and then escorted her.

840
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,377
What the hell is wrong with you?

841
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,337
[soldier 2] There are plenty
of other people outside

842
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,090
who are sitting on mats
on a concrete floor.

843
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,759
We're trying to make you
as comfortable as possible

844
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,136
because you're an assemblywoman.

845
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,099
The wait time
for an examination is 12 to 72 hours.

846
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,059
Wait a minute.

847
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,979
My daughter is at her school right now.

848
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,523
It may be too late if we keep waiting.

849
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,984
Please request a rescue.

850
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,820
[soldier 2] We're doing the best we can.

851
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,198
Wait here for now.

852
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,743

Oh, shit.

862
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,592
Did I die?

863
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,805
Am I dead?

864
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,764

-[Gwi-nam whimpers]

874
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,552
{\an8}I gave them serotonin injections
for a week,

875
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,596
{\an8}but it had no effect whatsoever.

876
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,765
The moment an antivirus enters the body,

877
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,602
the virus mutates
and stops attacking its target.

878
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,439
[Mr. Lee] <i>The only explanation
is that the cells learn and evolve.</i>

879
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,110
If this virus…

880
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,947
manages to learn human consciousness…

Cheong-san, you son of a bitch!

00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,308
I'll kill you.

That means…
