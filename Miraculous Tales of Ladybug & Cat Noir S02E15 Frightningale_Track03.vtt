00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.900
&lrm;What are you giving Miss Bustier
&lrm;for her birthday?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.980
&lrm;I made her a scrapbook!

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.540
&lrm;Hey, what did you get her?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.820
&lrm;-Hey!
&lrm;-Let me guess.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.540
&lrm;-You just finished your gift.
&lrm;-I hope Miss Bustier likes it.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.460
&lrm;I painted her as a superhero
&lrm;because she's always here for us.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.620
&lrm;That's better. And now, hug each other.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.060
&lrm;I'll give her a braid of hair
&lrm;to thank her for her breathing class.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.780
&lrm;It helps me to be less afraid of akumas.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.740
&lrm;Breathe deeply. Think of your emotions
&lrm;like the surface of a quiet lake.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.660
&lrm;[all gasp]
&lrm;-Not that quiet, Kim.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.020
&lrm;I got my inspiration from the exercise she
&lrm;has us do at the beginning of every class.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.380
&lrm;Morning, Chloé!
&lrm;Your hair is really pretty today!

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.420
&lrm;What do you mean "today"?
&lrm;My hair is always pretty!

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.180
&lrm;Ugh! Yeah, well, today, Rose,
&lrm;you seem less... annoying!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.740
&lrm;Isn't it great to start the day
&lrm;by sharing kind words with each other?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.460
&lrm;Compared to those other gifts,
&lrm;mine's going to be super lame!

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.900
&lrm;Don't worry, Marinette!
&lrm;There's no pressure!

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.780
&lrm;How about you, Marinette? I'm sure
&lrm;you've come up with something awesome!

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.420
&lrm;Oh, me? Uh... It's nearly roughing it all!

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.500
&lrm;Uh, I mean, it's really nothing at all!

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.100
&lrm;[all gasp]

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.620
&lrm;"If we wish to change the world,
&lrm;we must all learn to love each other."

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.940
&lrm;That's one of the first things
&lrm;she taught us when we first met her.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.500
&lrm;-I always keep it in mind.
&lrm;-Aw!

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
&lrm;I also added this tube of lip balm.
&lrm;Her favourite colour!

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.860
&lrm;Come to think of it, she's probably
&lrm;the reason we get along so awesomely!

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.500
&lrm;I'm so lucky to get a teacher like her.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.780
&lrm;How about you, Chloé, what's your present?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.620
&lrm;Nothing. Just like every year
&lrm;since kindergarten.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380
&lrm;It's not her fault!
&lrm;Chloé just doesn't like birthdays.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.820
&lrm;She never remembers them,
&lrm;just like her mom.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.540
&lrm;Yeah, well, you don't have
&lrm;to tell her my life story.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.500
&lrm;Anyway, all that stuff about compliments
&lrm;and love? Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
&lrm;-This girl's got no heart.
&lrm;-Of course I have a heart!

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.220
&lrm;Daddy will even buy me a second one
&lrm;if I want!

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
&lrm;[school bell rings]

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.940
&lrm;-What's our next lesson again?
&lrm;-Physical science.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.020
&lrm;We'll be late for Mrs Mendeleiev's
&lrm;Physics class, Chloé!

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.740
&lrm;Permanent marker.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140
&lrm;Cap off!

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.500
&lrm;I do have a present for you,
&lrm;Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.820
&lrm;[camera shutter clicks]

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.420
&lrm;At last, this is Miss Bustier's class!
&lrm;This year will be her best birthday ever!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.380
&lrm;[school bell rings]

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.660
&lrm;-This is for you!
&lrm;-Happy Birthday, Miss Bustier!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.300
&lrm;Oh, thank you!

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100
&lrm;-Happy Birthday, Miss Bustier!
&lrm;-Oh, you're all so sweet!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.020
&lrm;Marinette made that one!

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.660
&lrm;[gasps]

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.260
&lrm;What?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.420
&lrm;I know you did this, Chloé Bourgeois!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.700
&lrm;-A 99.56% certainty!
&lrm;-So uncool, Chloé!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.940
&lrm;-Seriously lame!
&lrm;-Calm down.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.220
&lrm;We don't want to get upset on my birthday.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.460
&lrm;Well, I think this present's wonderful!
&lrm;It'll be my new cosmetics bag.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.340
&lrm;I'll be able to think of both of you
&lrm;every time I use it!

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.180
&lrm;What? You're not going to let her
&lrm;get away with this?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.700
&lrm;She's worse than Hawk Moth!

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.860
&lrm;At least half the city
&lrm;has gotten akumatised because of her!

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.100
&lrm;Students, please! Calm down now!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.300
&lrm;The classroom is not a place for insults
&lrm;and defamation!

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.740
&lrm;Marinette! Would you come with me, please?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.660
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-Alya, I'm relying on you

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.180
&lrm;to make sure things don't get out of hand.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.700
&lrm;OK, Miss.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.180
&lrm;That feeling of injustice.
&lrm;What could be worse than being punished

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.260
&lrm;for someone else's wrong-doings?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.980
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her!

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.740
&lrm;But Miss Bustier, it's so not fair!

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.820
&lrm;It was Chloé pulling another... Chloé!

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.940
&lrm;And I'm the one who's getting in trouble?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.100
&lrm;Ha, ha! Of course you're not in trouble.
&lrm;don't worry!

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.340
&lrm;As the class representative, I want you
&lrm;to set a good example for your classmates.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.220
&lrm;Don't give in to feelings of anger.
&lrm;Try to forgive Chloé instead.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.020
&lrm;Argh! The emotions have weakened!
&lrm;Get closer, Akuma!

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.700
&lrm;I don't get it. Chloé
&lrm;is the meanest person I've ever known.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.860
&lrm;Come on. There are much worse people
&lrm;in Paris right now than Chloé Bourgeois!

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.900
&lrm;I'm sure people like Chloé
&lrm;are capable of great things.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.260
&lrm;The problem is
&lrm;they only think of themselves.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.180
&lrm;They don't understand the meaning of love.
&lrm;And we can't force them to change,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.780
&lrm;but perhaps we can set a good example.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.380
&lrm;That's why Marinettes are so important.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.940
&lrm;Because they have a lot of love to give.
&lrm;I'm counting on you.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.460
&lrm;Yes, Miss Bustier.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.060
&lrm;An akuma! Oh, no!

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.700
&lrm;Go away! I won't let you evilise
&lrm;one of my students!

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.580
&lrm;There! The mere fear that harm
&lrm;might come to her little protégée!

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.220
&lrm;Fly, my little evil one,
&lrm;and akumatise her!

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.700
&lrm;Oh! No! No!

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.500
&lrm;Don't give up!
&lrm;Think only positive thoughts!

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.180
&lrm;<i>Hello, Miss. I am Hawk Moth.</i>

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.180
&lrm;I'm not going to listen to you!
&lrm;You can't force me to do evil!

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.100
&lrm;Who said anything about evil?
&lrm;There's already so much hate in the world.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.060
&lrm;I want to help you unite
&lrm;everyone together with love, at last!

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.860
&lrm;-Isn't that your greatest wish?
&lrm;-Miss Bustier, please! Breathe deeply

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.380
&lrm;-and focus!
&lrm;-Ah!

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.620
&lrm;Zombizoo, I'm giving you the power
&lrm;to spread love and compassion.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.500
&lrm;Thanks to you,
&lrm;the whole world will be one big embrace!

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.540
&lrm;In return, bring me Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.220
&lrm;I won't stop
&lrm;until everyone on Earth feels the love!

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.060
&lrm;Starting with Chloé Bourgeois!

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.220
&lrm;I will not let Hawk Moth do this
&lrm;to the best teacher in the world!

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.620
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.340
&lrm;Ha!

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.020
&lrm;Whoa!

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.620
&lrm;I have got some great news for you,
&lrm;students!

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.340
&lrm;From now on, everyone's going to
&lrm;hug and kiss and feel the love.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.100
&lrm;-Even you, Chloé!
&lrm;-Me?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.100
&lrm;Yuck! Ew!

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.860
&lrm;What is that thing?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.220
&lrm;Please, Miss Bustier!
&lrm;You've gotta snap out of it!

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.020
&lrm;I'm not Miss Bustier any more!

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.180
&lrm;I am Zombizoo!

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.900
&lrm;Get out, quick!

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.140
&lrm;It's suddenly gotten very warm in here!

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.220
&lrm;I don't know what's happening. I...

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.300
&lrm;-What is wrong with you?
&lrm;-Chloé!

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.580
&lrm;Get away from me!

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.740
&lrm;-Look out!
&lrm;-Kissoo!

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.820
&lrm;Mylène!

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.540
&lrm;-Are you OK?
&lrm;-I feel feverish. I can't...

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.980
&lrm;Kissoo!

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.660
&lrm;They're contagious!
&lrm;Don't let yourselves get kissed!

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.340
&lrm;Run! I'll hold them back!

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.220
&lrm;Aaah! Stop it! No, you're tickling me!

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.580
&lrm;Kissoo!

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.780
&lrm;I'll leave her in your hands, my lovelies!

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.140
&lrm;-Is Chloé in here?
&lrm;-How dare you interrupt my class?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.380
&lrm;-Who are you?
&lrm;-No? Oh, well!

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.220
&lrm;Smoochies, my poochies!

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.220
&lrm;Chloé Bourgeois? Not in here either?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.300
&lrm;Kisses, my lovelies!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.780
&lrm;-Chloé!
&lrm;-Excuse me!

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.780
&lrm;-Didn't anyone teach you to knock?
&lrm;-I don't like knocking.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.620
&lrm;I prefer a gentle touch! Mwah! Kissy-boo!

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.460
&lrm;Chloé! I'll find you sooner or later!

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.460
&lrm;There! That should hold you for a while!

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.940
&lrm;-Kissoo! Kissoo!
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.100
&lrm;-Anybody here?
&lrm;-Kissoo!

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.780
&lrm;-Anybody here?
&lrm;-Kissoo!

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.820
&lrm;OK, not here either!

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.860
&lrm;Anybody here?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.460
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.500
&lrm;-Oops! Sorry! Uh... Reflex!
&lrm;-Ladybug?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.020
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-We're saved!

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.180
&lrm;Are you all OK?

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.700
&lrm;-Looks like it.
&lrm;-Uh... Adrien?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.660
&lrm;He still hasn't come out of his locker.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.820
&lrm;-Adrien?
&lrm;-Kissy-boo!

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.940
&lrm;[screaming and sobbing]

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.860
&lrm;-Kissy, kissy!
&lrm;-Oh, man!

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.420
&lrm;He must have gotten kissed on the stairs
&lrm;when he was saving Chloé!

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.780
&lrm;We need to head to the roof.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.860
&lrm;Kissoo! Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.020
&lrm;Kissy! Kissy-boo!

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.020
&lrm;Admit it! That was all just a ploy
&lrm;to try and get a kiss out of Ladybug!

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.460
&lrm;Come on, don't be ridiculous!
&lrm;How else will we work under the radar?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.340
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.860
&lrm;Sorry, guys. No autographs this time!

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.780
&lrm;Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.340
&lrm;Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.460
&lrm;[Nadia Chamack] &lrm;<i>Yet </i>&lrm;<i>again,</i>
&lrm;<i>citizens of Paris are in danger.</i>

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.300
&lrm;<i>-A strange disease is spreading.</i>
&lrm;-Hey, guys,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.500
&lrm;I'm all for our French greetings,
&lrm;but let's not kiss for now.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.020
&lrm;I'm glad you're here, Cat Noir.
&lrm;Check this out.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.220
&lrm;<i>Hordes of zombies are spreading</i>
&lrm;<i>throughout Paris!</i>

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.220
&lrm;<i>Let's go over to our mayor,</i>
&lrm;<i>live from City Hall.</i>

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.060
&lrm;<i>We advise all Parisians</i>
&lrm;<i>to remain inside at this time.</i>

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.860
&lrm;<i>-Kissy-boo!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Aaah!</i>

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.100
&lrm;<i>-Mr Mayor? Mr Mayor?</i>
&lrm;-Daddy?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.140
&lrm;<i>It looks like we're having</i>
&lrm;<i>a slight technical issue.</i>

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.460
&lrm;<i>I took care of your father, Chloé!</i>
&lrm;<i>Show yourself!</i>

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.500
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;<i>-Then, Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.500
&lrm;<i>I'm coming for you! Mwah!</i>

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.180
&lrm;<i>Unless my sweethearts</i>
&lrm;<i>get hold of you first!</i>

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.780
&lrm;<i>Because very soon,</i>
&lrm;<i>the whole city will be hot on your heels!</i>

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.340
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.500
&lrm;Chloé! Huh! Always Chloé!
&lrm;You only think about yourself!

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.260
&lrm;-Why don't we give 'em what they want?
&lrm;-Hey, yeah! Good idea!

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.860
&lrm;Is it my fault if I'm better
&lrm;than all of you?

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.420
&lrm;Sorry to disappoint you guys,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.940
&lrm;but she doesn't deserve this
&lrm;any more than you.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.620
&lrm;And we need her as bait
&lrm;when the time is right.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.900
&lrm;Uh... thanks?

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.060
&lrm;They're coming!

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.940
&lrm;We've gotta evacuate! Over there!

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.540
&lrm;-Cat Noir, do you know how to drive?
&lrm;-You should know the answer to that.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.020
&lrm;-I can do anything!
&lrm;-Kitties first, then!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.740
&lrm;Woohoo!

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.340
&lrm;Max and Kim, you go first!

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.620
&lrm;[shrieks]

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.660
&lrm;Stop!

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.500
&lrm;Hurry up!

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.660
&lrm;Kissoo! Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.060
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;-Max!

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.940
&lrm;-Kissoo!
&lrm;-Come on, Chloé!

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.140
&lrm;Kissoo!

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.940
&lrm;Play the hero as much as you like,
&lrm;but you won't be getting a kiss out of me!

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.580
&lrm;-Just go, before I change my mind!
&lrm;-Kissoo! Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.220
&lrm;Aaah! Aaah!

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.140
&lrm;-Slow down, Chloé!
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.540
&lrm;-Oh!
&lrm;-Kissoo!

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.940
&lrm;Hello? Who's going to come and save me?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.060
&lrm;Yoo-hoo! Kissy-kissy-kissy!

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.060
&lrm;-No!
&lrm;-I can't just leave her by herself!

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.140
&lrm;Oh, great! Now I've twisted my ankle,
&lrm;because you weren't fast enough!

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.460
&lrm;Take care of Chloé.
&lrm;Besides, you'll save all of us, right?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.700
&lrm;Yeah, that's a promise!

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.500
&lrm;-You want a kissy?
&lrm;-Kissy.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.740
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;-Rose!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.580
&lrm;Aaah!

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.340
&lrm;Na-na-nana-na! Kissy-kissy-kissy!

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.820
&lrm;Hurry Up. We gotta go now!

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.220
&lrm;Kissoo!

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.860
&lrm;I thought you said you knew how to drive!

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.260
&lrm;I've mastered every car
&lrm;in&lrm;<i> Extreme Racing 3,</i>

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.340
&lrm;-but there are no buses in that game!
&lrm;-Kissy-kissy-kissy!

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.180
&lrm;-Are you OK?
&lrm;-Yeah. Just a close call, that's all.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.580
&lrm;-So what now?
&lrm;-Let's take Chloé to the Eiffel Tower.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.740
&lrm;There'll be fewer places
&lrm;for Zombizoo's disciples to run to.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.180
&lrm;-Less places for us to hide!
&lrm;-It's the only way,

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.700
&lrm;-if we want Zombizoo to turn up in person!
&lrm;-Argh!

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.820
&lrm;-I totally trust you, Ladybug!
&lrm;-People must stop invading my space!

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.140
&lrm;Don't forget our agreement, Zombizoo!

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.140
&lrm;No one can escape my kiss!

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.060
&lrm;Ha!

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.300
&lrm;Stay together and follow me!

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.380
&lrm;Nino! The vending machine! Quick!
&lrm;Everybody inside the elevator!

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.060
&lrm;Faster! Faster!

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.220
&lrm;Alya!

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.140
&lrm;-Oh, no!
&lrm;-There's nothing we can do for her!

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.860
&lrm;Come on!

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.620
&lrm;He's right. Just go, and save us all.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.300
&lrm;Nino? Nino!

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.860
&lrm;It doesn't matter
&lrm;we're the only ones left,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.660
&lrm;since you'll fix it all in the end.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.300
&lrm;Only the best remain!

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.460
&lrm;This isn't the first time
&lrm;we've been in trouble together.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.220
&lrm;Kissoo!

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.740
&lrm;Straight ahead! Eiffel's office!

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.420
&lrm;Kissoo! Kissoo! Kissoo!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.660
&lrm;Ladybug! Catch!

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.500
&lrm;Aaah!

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.740
&lrm;Aaah!

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.100
&lrm;Phew!

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.340
&lrm;-Kissoo! Kissoo!
&lrm;-Cat Noir!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.940
&lrm;I'll just stay here and chill.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.740
&lrm;If we're going to end up kissing,
&lrm;I'd rather we do it after you save us, OK?

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.980
&lrm;You're the only one
&lrm;who can fix this for us. No arguing now!

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.780
&lrm;It's down to you and me! Chloé?

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.260
&lrm;At least I won't get in your way now.
&lrm;Good luck!

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.540
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.900
&lrm;Hand over Chloé and your Miraculous,
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.780
&lrm;Then I might just let you witness
&lrm;the final triumph of love!

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.020
&lrm;Victory has never been so close!

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.420
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.380
&lrm;Make-up remover?
&lrm;How will you save my life with that?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.660
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.420
&lrm;-Cat Noir!
&lrm;-Kissoo!

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.460
&lrm;Don't worry, Kitty,
&lrm;you'll get your kisses.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.060
&lrm;But first,
&lrm;I have a lucky charm I need to use!

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.020
&lrm;-I'm sorry!
&lrm;-What?

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.020
&lrm;-This is all my fault!
&lrm;-Awesome.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.620
&lrm;But now's not a good time.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.100
&lrm;Save us all, Ladybug!

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.260
&lrm;You're all alone, Ladybug! Accept
&lrm;my love and give me your Miraculous!

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.700
&lrm;This is not true love!

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.020
&lrm;No!

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.740
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.580
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.940
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.140
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.020
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.380
&lrm;Aaah!

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.980
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir, if Zombizoo is right,
&lrm;if love does always conquer,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.700
&lrm;then, some day, my most cherished wish
&lrm;will come true, for sure.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.620
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Pound it!

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.340
&lrm;Ladybug? Cat Noir? What on Earth... ?
&lrm;Oh! Ah! The akuma overtook me!

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.140
&lrm;Oh, no! I... I let my negative emotions
&lrm;get the upper hand. How terrible!

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.540
&lrm;-I'm terrible.
&lrm;-That's not true!

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.020
&lrm;It wasn't your fault.
&lrm;Hawk Moth is the one to blame.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.220
&lrm;-But I hurt a lot of people.
&lrm;-No.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.700
&lrm;I did! I forgot your birthday, once again.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.420
&lrm;And when I saw everyone had prepared
&lrm;a gift for you, I totally lost it,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.780
&lrm;because I too would have liked to offer
&lrm;you something. I'm sorry, Miss Bustier.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.260
&lrm;Thank you, Chloé.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.140
&lrm;Those words are the best
&lrm;possible gift you could ever give me!

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.820
&lrm;Uh, yeah. OK, then, we're all good.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.940
&lrm;Woohoo!

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.860
&lrm;Me? You want me to apologise
&lrm;to the entire class?

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.980
&lrm;Ridiculous! They should be thanking me
&lrm;for saving everybody!

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.740
&lrm;I happen to have several accounts
&lrm;of what went down, including my own,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.580
&lrm;and they don't exactly match your version.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.180
&lrm;I heard you helped Ladybug
&lrm;and saved Miss Bustier. Awesome!

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.580
&lrm;There is a heart beating in there,
&lrm;after all.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.140
&lrm;Sorry I said there wasn't... and thanks.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.140
&lrm;Marinette!
&lrm;Girl, are you still zombizoofied or what?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.140
&lrm;I've realised Chloé has a heart too.
&lrm;She just doesn't know how to use it.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.700
&lrm;Hopefully, she'll learn if we continue
&lrm;setting a positive example.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.700
&lrm;-Morning, everyone!
&lrm;-Morning, Miss Bustier!
