(Welcome New Students)

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,831
I'm Beau, a third-year student.

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:21,741
I'll be your supervisor.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,955
I'd love to be supervised by her.

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,079
No talking.

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,119
Everyone here is under the SOTUS system.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,359
The name SOTUS is an English acronym.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,210
Does anyone know
what the first letter stands for?

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,039
The guy talking earlier.

12
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,880
What does the first S stand for?

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,679
S...

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,516
stands for seniority.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,119
It means to respect your seniors.

16
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,679
That's correct.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,159
Now, the other guy.

18
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,079
What does the letter O stand for?

19
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:12,058
Um...

20
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:14,355
O stands for...

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,359
O...

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,836
O...

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh my god, I don't know.

24
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:24,623
Did you come here
without knowing what SOTUS was?

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,596
Everyone,

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,959
get on your knees.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,879
Come on.

28
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm sorry, guys.

29
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,570
Hold on.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm just kidding.

31
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,635
We don't welcome new faces
with that outdated ritual anymore.

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,359
You can't keep ordering people
to get on their knees, right?

33
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,725
Our faculty welcomes new students
by urging them to do...

34
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,955
community service.

35
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,370
But first, come and get your name tag.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,479
Be right back.

Thank you.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,530
Sure. What's your name?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,006

Do you know who that is?

64
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,519
I don't know. Someone else gave it to me.

65
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,315
Nine-five-zero?

66
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,439
Who could it be?

67
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Hey.

68
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,639
Do you remember me?

69
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
The guy who got the room number wrong...

70
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,040
when we were studying
for admission exams.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,279
You said I was insincere too.

72
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,839
Did I do that?

73
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,959
I don't remember.

74
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
I remember everything.

75
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,079
Well...

76
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,959
Don't you...

77
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
wear glasses anymore?

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
Are you wearing contact lenses?

79
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,555
No.

80
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,879
I got LASIK.

81
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,199
You were cute when you wore glasses.

82
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,079
But without them,

83
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,480
you're even cuter.

84
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm Folk. I'm studying dentistry.

85
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,399
Are you Pai?

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,879
You have a cute name.

87
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
Not really.

88
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,120
It's ordinary.

89
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
When you like someone,

90
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
everything about them will be cute to you.

91
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,879
Oh!

92
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,720

00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,199
What are you talking about?

94
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,675
Well.

95
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,039
But the other day...

96
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,614
I saw you go to a hotel with someone.

97
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,210
-Why are you saying that?
-Well...

98
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,240
Pai, your friend gets riled easily.

99
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:49,943
What?

100
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,240
Do you know each other?

101
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,330
We don't just know each other.

102
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,039
The two of us...

103
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,759
are very close.

104
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,799
Are you jealous?

105
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,835
Come on, man.

106
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,276
I'm just teasing you.

107
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,159
Pai and I are friends.

108
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
There's still lhope.

109
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,039
That's a relief.

110
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,679

111
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,126
Folk.

112
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,961
Hurry. The seniors are calling us over.

113
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,198
-I'll go now.
-Alright.

114
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,195
Pai, well...

115
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,567
I have to go now.

116
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,360
See you later.

117
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,450
Wow.

118
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,679
He was very forward.

119
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,600
Did he make your heart stir?

120
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,399
That's nonsense.

121
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,799
Man.

122
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,879
Actually...

123
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,639
I think he's cute.

124
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,279
Like a golden retriever,

125
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,919
he looks docile and easy.

126
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,360
But I'm not a dog person.

127
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,240
By the way,

128
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,639
how are you?

129
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm doing well.

130
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,450
What about...

131
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,240
Itt is also doing well,

132
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,960
in case you wanted to know.

133
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,840
He got into the faculty of his dreams.

134
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,450
Everything is good.

135
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,039
Well.

136
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,879
Chiang Mai is nice.

137
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,401
It suits him.

138
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,519
Right.

139
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,916

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,039

00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,600
(Folk)

189
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,720
(Pai)

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,759
I'll help entertain everyone.

191
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,919
Whoa!

192
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Come on.

193
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,279
(Folk and Pai)

194
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,279
(Folk and Pai)

195
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,840
(Welcome New Students)

196
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,759
(Itt)

197
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,039
Itt!

198
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,639
Itt!

199
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,399
Why did you call out my name?

200
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,759
I just felt like it.

201
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,039
Do you have a problem with that?

202
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,919
I know that you don't like me.

203
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,279
But can you just leave me alone?

204
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:58,543
Who are you to boss me around?

205
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,919
Who are you to boss me around?

206
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,679
What I do is my business.

207
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
Waan, can I talk to you?

208
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,639
Sure. I'm single.

209
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,960
I didn't ask you that.

210
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,440
I just wanted to let you know.

211
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,679
Anyway, what do you want
to talk to me about?

212
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,475
I have nothing to say to you.

213
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,679
I just wanted to talk to Pai.

214
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,480
Do you know where he is?

215
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,679
Oh...

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,399
I want you to be the faculty's King.

217
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,480
-Me?
-Can you do that?

218
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,960
I don't think...

219
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,396
that I fit the role.

220
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
You should find someone else.

221
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,720
Hey. Look over there.

222
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,440
Oh.

223
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,356
That's Phai, Queen of Engineering.

224
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,799
Itt is King of Engineering.

225
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,799
You see, other faculties
have their kings and queens, unlike ours.

226
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,235
Pai.

227
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
Come on. Do it for me.

228
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,171
No, it's better not to.

229
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,919
Extracurricular activities aren't for me.

230
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,756
Even if I entered the Star Contest,

231
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,879
I wouldn't win anyway.
It would be a waste of your time.

232
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,375
Excuse me. I'm going to get my lunch.

233
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
(King of Wonton Noodles)

234
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you like wonton noodle soup?

235
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,385
Yes.

236
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,360
If I didn't,
I wouldn't be waiting in line.

237
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,919
Right.

238
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
If you didn't like it,

239
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,140
you wouldn't be standing here.

240
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
What would you like?

241
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,960
-I'd like a bowl of dry wonton noodles.
-Sure.

242
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,200
-Actually, two.
-Okay.

243
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:04,879
Oh.

244
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,235
Well...

245
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,559
Beau's friends
couldn't find a place to sit.

246
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,359
So I moved over here.

247
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,039
You can sit here too, right?

248
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,559
Sure.

249
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,119
I don't have a problem with anyone.

250
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,720
I made a mess.

251
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,680
Yummy.

252
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:33,422
Pai.

253
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,599
Can I sit here?

254
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,759
Yes.

255
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,410
You don't need to ask me next time.

256
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,156
It's a public table.

257
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,410
Feel free to sit.

258
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:45,985
Pai,

259
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,435
he's the one...

260
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,440
who danced to the Hippo Song
with you, isn't he?

261
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,836
Since when have you known each other?

262
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,079
You didn't tell me.

263
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,440
Just today.

264
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,200
I'd love to get to know him more.

265
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,000
Itt.

266
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,806
Itt,

267
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,890
don't eat that.

268
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:13,310
It's high in carbs.

269
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,039
You'll get bloated before the contest.

270
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,519
Stop eating that.
I'll get some salad for you.

271
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,599
Good.

272
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,519
Wow.

273
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,279
How nice is that.

274
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
She takes care of you.

275
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,359
You're legit, dude.

276
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,200
Pai,

277
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,720
take him as an example.

278
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,876
If you participate in the contest,

279
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,960
you'll be taken care of
by our faculty's Queen.

280
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:39,255
Wouldn't that be good?

281
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:42,319
Don't try to talk me into it.

282
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:43,849
He knows what I'm up to.

283
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,839
I'm one of the contestants.

284
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:49,960
It seems fun.

285
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,719
Why don't you give it a go?

286
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,410
See? Listen to him.

287
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,720
Even he said that it seems fun.

288
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,680
Please do this for me...

289
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,650
so that I can have an excuse
to talk to Beau.

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,960
You forced me to be the club president
in grade 12.

291
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,410
Now you're forcing me
to be the faculty's King?

292
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,039
I won't fall for that again.

293
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:12,521
No way.

294
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,028
You know everything.

295
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,514
He was the club president because of you?

296
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,015
Yes.

297
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,275
It's Folk.

298
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,955
(It's Folk.)

299
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,319
How did you get my Line ID?

300
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,839
It's not hard to get.

301
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,852
Lots of my friends
are studying medicine.

302
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:46,513
Watch your step.

303
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,319
I have something to talk to you about.

304
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,359
Hop on.

305
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,279
What?

306
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,356
Is your butt made of gold?

307
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,035
Can't you sit on a bike?

308
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,170
Hop on.

309
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,839
Folk,

310
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,170
have you seen Cher,

311
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
your senior?

312
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,559
Do you like her?

313
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,519
I can help you.

314
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,319
Then help and tell me...

315
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,119
where she is.

316
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,799
Let's trade.

317
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,920
I'll help you with her,

318
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,799
and you help me with Pai.

319
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,759
You want me to pimp him out?

320
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,079
I don't think so.

321
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,480
If you can't get him yourself,

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,279
then you lose your chance.

323
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,410
Then find Cher yourself.

324
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,279
Even if you find her,

325
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,440
you'll never get your chance...

326
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,359
because she's a lesbian.

327
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,799
Don't know how to use the brakes?

328
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,359
We're here.

329
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,240
Get off.

330
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,039
Say it.

331
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,359
Have you forgotten your promise?

332
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:37,172
You know that...

333
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,480
I can't do that for you.

334
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,759
If it's something else,

335
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
I can do it.

336
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,680
Just tell me what you want.

337
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,240
I'll do anything for you.

338
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,039
I promise.

339
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,839
I didn't forget.

340
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,039
Tell me what you want.

341
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,440
If you want your earring back,

342
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,039
participate in the contest.

343
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,279
Is that what you want?

344
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,759
It's nonsense.

345
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,920
If you can't keep your promise,

346
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,359
you shouldn't have made it.

347
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,640
Is that all you want?

348
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,799
Yes,

349
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,640
that's all.

350
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:26,235
Because you've never done...

351
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,880
something like this, have you?

352
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Okay.

353
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,720
I'll do it.

354
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,755
I will make you see...

355
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,200
that someone like me...

356
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,079
can win the contest.

357
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,359
What?

358
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,755
You suddenly changed your mind
about the contest.

359
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,640
What has gotten into you?

360
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,119
It's absurd.

361
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:14,220
It's better that you don't know.

362
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,955
Look, just do whatever you can...

363
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,240
to make sure that I will win.

364
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:19,480
Anything?

365
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
Sure, Pai-Pai.

366
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,839
I'll ask for some advice from an expert.

367
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,680
You needed an appointment
to talk to me about Pai?

368
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,440
What's the deal between you two?

369
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,079
Well,

370
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,160
we're just friends.

371
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,955
He is...

372
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:51,435
an introvert.

373
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,799
He doesn't talk much.

374
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,876
I'm an extrovert,

375
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:59,799
so I'm here to talk on behalf of him.

376
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,160
Alright, you really are a smooth talker.

377
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,200
So what is it?

378
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,556
What is it?

379
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,799
Well,

380
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,839
do you have a boyfriend?

381
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,515
No, I don't.

382
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,755
You don't?

383
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,720
But how is this related
to Pai being a contestant?

384
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,795
How?

385
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,035
Well, it's relevant...

386
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,116
because...

387
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,316
if he participates in the contest
and wins,

388
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,916
I wonder...

389
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,640
if he will get a girlfriend.

390
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,200
I see.

391
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,116
Well,

392
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,316
many winners from the past contests
got dumped.

393
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,119
So it's not an indicator.

394
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,156
But one thing is for sure.

395
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,709
He cannot have a girlfriend now.
Otherwise, his popularity will drop.

396
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:49,279
I'm serious.

397
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,079
It's the nature of the contest.

398
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,039
He can't have a girlfriend,

399
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,519
but I can?

400
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,839
Of course.

401
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:01,995
I'm serious about Pai though.

402
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,613
Don't forget to tell him
to prepare for the photoshoot.

403
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,515
-Don't forget.
-Yes, and the photos must be perfect.

404
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,755
Because if they are perfect,

405
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,876
it's a sign that our faculty
is likely to win.

406
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,281
Tell him not to get too much sun.

407
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:13,606
Okay.

408
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,319
-I'll tell him.
-Okay.

409
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,680
That's a lot of information.

410
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,039
Is there anything else?

411
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:22,317
Anything?

412
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,156
How about this ice cream?
It's delicious.

413
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,880
Okay.

414
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,909
Mine is melting.

415
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,669
Where are you going?

416
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Why?

417
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Is that for Pai?

418
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
What?

419
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,319
What are you doing?

420
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Let me tell you this.

421
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,680
Stop trying.

422
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,960
No matter how persistent you are,

423
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,640
he's not interested
because he doesn't like dogs.

424
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,119
I'm telling you this for your own good.

425
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,559
Do you get it?

426
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,116
No, I don't.

427
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,599
Give it back to me.

428
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,160
I don't need your concern.

429
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,279
Good.

430
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,839
Nice.

431
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,000
He's cute.

432
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,559
The next one
is the Faculty of Dentistry's King.

433
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,195
He's a shoo-in.

434
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,515
His features are striking.

435
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,715
You're right.

436
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,675
There's no way he won't win.

437
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,279
He's gorgeous.

438
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,400
You're very handsome.

439
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,480
That's good.

440
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,160
The last one
is the Faculty of Medicine's King.

441
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,799
You can do it.

442
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,515
Oh my!

443
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,675
He looks like a stone.

444
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,035
Does he think
that he's taking a visa photo?

445
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,435
I can't believe my eyes.

446
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,556
I think that he needs some rest.

447
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,715
He looks stiff.

448
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,160
He does.

449
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,839
You can pose however you want.

450
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,359
He's a robot.

451
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,160
He is.

452
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,799
Stiff and robotic.

453
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,527
All done.

454
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,544
Finally.

455
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,596
Look at this.

456
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,156
What do you think of this one?

457
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,880
Don't worry, Pai.

458
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,680
It's just a photoshoot.

459
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,799
It doesn't necessarily indicate
the result of the contest.

460
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,119
But if I can't even do this,

461
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,680
how will I win?

462
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,799
I thought
that you were Mr. Know-It-All.

463
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,279
I never thought that...

464
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,319
you'd be dumb about dumb things.

465
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
Someone like you...

467
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,799
will never win.

468
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,480
I might have to throw the earring away.

469
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,156
Next time...

470
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,039
if you can't keep your promise,

471
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:18,814
don't even bother making one.

472
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,599
It was just a photoshoot.

473
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,440
I still have some tricks up my sleeve.

474
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,119
Just wait.

475
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,160
I will beat you.

476
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:17,539
(Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul)

477
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:19,469
Everyone put on your blindfold...

478
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,156
and hold the hand
of the person next to you.

479
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,556
We will slowly walk together.

480
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,440
Pai, hold my hand.

481
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:29,287
Pai.

482
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,079
I have something to ask you.

483
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,319
Would you be my boyfriend?

484
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,639
