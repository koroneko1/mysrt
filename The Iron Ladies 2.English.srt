That's all the big news in papers.

00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,625
So be it.

12
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,792
On today's front pages
of all sports news sections,

13
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,792
most of the headlines are quite the same.

IRON LADIES LOST

The first one says Iron Ladies insist that

16
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:58,542
Jung will leave if Nhong stays.

TEAM MANAGER OF THE YEAR

31
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,042
They are indeed.

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,957
Nhong is so hyped up.

33
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:33,875
He is going to beat Jung
in Thai League's match tomorrow.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,375
Nhong has recently undergone a surgery.

TIP O-SOD VS IRON LADIES
SEVEN TO ONE

37
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,707
Great. If they can play like this,
I'm going to give you bigger budget.

38
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,457
Wow. Thanks a lot.

39
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,000
IRON LADIES

40
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,750
We're definitely gonna win.

41
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,707
Three, four...

42
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,082
Hooray!

43
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,667
Look at him.

44
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:40,457
Jung is gonna cry like a baby again
because he has lost the game.

45
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,832
-You bitch.
-You idiot.

46
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,332
-You're such a troll.
-You're ugly as fuck.

47
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:52,457
MAIN TITLE

48
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:06,667
That's live from
Thai League championship match.

49
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:09,792
Our guest's just got the trophy.

50
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:13,207
He is really vivid today.

51
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,707
Mr. Nhong is right here.

52
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:17,207
Just call me Nhong.

53
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:20,042
Sounds great.
I'm gonna call you Nhong.

54
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:23,167
Now, you have become
the team leader

55
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,500
of new Tip O-Sod club...

56
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,082
-Right.
-...and won 21 matches.

57
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,957
How many times have you won
over Iron Ladies team?

58
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,457
I can't remember that.

59
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:37,207
People might think that
I hold a lot of grudge.

60
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,957
Only seven times.

61
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,957
Look at him.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,167
He might be bullied
by his nasty girl boss.

63
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,332
Hello.

64
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,375
-No makeup....
-This is her speaking, Mr. Governor.

65
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,917
-No food is better than no makeup.
-Yes, I'm watching it.

66
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,542
-I'm so confused.
-Yes.

67
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:04,250
I had nowhere else to go,

68
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,417
and my friends don't love me anymore.

69
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,917
Lucky me that I have April,

70
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,167
May and June who understand
and will always be with me.

71
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:17,333
Now I realize who's my true friend.

72
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,416
I won't look back

73
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:26,916
and I will do my best for Tip O-Sod
that gives me a bright future.

74
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,166
I will make our team great
and won't let Pan, Nong,

75
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,333
and Mr. Prasert, our manager down.

76
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:40,208
Sounds like these six people
are really important to you.

77
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,166
So, we'd like to invite
these six people

78
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,208
to join us with Nhong.

79
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,333
Please welcome April, May

80
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,208
June, Pan, Nong and Mr. Prasert.

81
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,166
-They're coming?
-Yes.

82
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,291
-Welcome.
-What a surprise!

83
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,458
Greetings to everybody. Welcome.

84
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,333
-You guys.
-It's a surprise.

85
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,708
Please have a seat.
There's a lot of people

86
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,125
to give you moral supports.

87
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,041
Let's start with Mr. Prasert.

88
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,041
What makes you want Nhong
to be in your team?

89
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,125
-Here.
-This too.

90
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,583
-No!
-He acts like a damsel in distress.

91
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,791
Mon.
When will Nhong stop dissing me?

92
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,583
And when will you stop
listening to him?

93
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,833
You always keep up with him

94
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,333
and then you're pissed off.

95
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,458
"Now I realize who is my...

96
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,291
true friend."

97
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,833
My ass.

98
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,458
Let me tell you something.
When he did his job,

99
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:54,541
he found a hunk and went crazy
so he's got fired.

100
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,333
We invested our money
to open this restaurant for him.

101
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,166
He took the money

102
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,333
and gave it to his partner
so the restaurant was down.

103
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,958
You can't really blame him.
He has no job.

104
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,833
This new club offered him both money
and a job. Who's gonna say no to this?

105
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,833
They even gave scholarships
to the triplets.

106
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:28,208
If Pia didn't break up with her ex,
I would tell her to beat them all.

107
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,583
-Kick their ass.
-Yeah?

108
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:37,208
You would let Pia to tell Nhong
to stop bickering at you?

109
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,458
or tell Nhong to come back
and play volleyball with you?

110
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,208
You know what?

111
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,666
Even you bring Brad Pitt
to convince me,

112
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,041
I'm not gonna be
in the same team with that bitch.

113
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,250
Yeah?

114
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,166
Look. Should we visit Pia?

115
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,208
We might get some ideas
to handle this problem.

116
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,208
Should we?

117
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,916
Go to Xishuangbanna?

118
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,875
Are you crazy?

119
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,541
I'll get fired if I go there.

120
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,291
You're nuts.

121
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,458
Where are you going? Muk?

122
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,291
-To my mom's place.
-I'll drive you after doing laundry.

123
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,333
Muk. Wait!

124
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,541
Muk. Wait a second.

125
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Hello.

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,875
Jung. Is that you?

127
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,833
Yes.

128
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,458
Chai, my dear.

129
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,958
Why you are so jumpy?
You've never been with me before?

130
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,708
You're late, as usual.

131
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,333
If it wasn't for coach...

132
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,833
Nothing. Let's go.
Hurry up. The ferry is leaving.

133
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,458
Why you're in such a hurry, Chai?
You have to take it easy.

134
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,208
Where's your wife?
She didn't come to see you off?

135
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,708
He's so hot but he prefers guys.
Such a shame.

136
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:36,707
"Jung, should I be glad or sad
that you're coming to me?

137
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:38,042
The city where I live,

138
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,582
there's no direct flights there
from Thailand.

139
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:42,667
You should take a cargo ferry
from Chiang Saen,

140
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:46,582
cruising along Mekong River
like cruising on the Elizabeth II ferry

141
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:50,207
to Dongguan Port,
and then take a bus to my place.

142
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:53,082
That's the perfect way
for a salaryman like you.

143
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,582
Send me a letter before you leave.

144
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,417
I'll be waiting for you."

145
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:13,832
Dripping water hollows out stones

146
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,457
through persistence.

147
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:17,332
Muk, my dear.

148
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,082
We don't mess up with our friends.

149
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:24,375
Muk heard people gossiping about me.

150
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,542
They think that I'm gay

151
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,582
or... a gay's partner.

152
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,125
She has heard it quite a lot.

153
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,417
So, she left me to stay
at her mom's place for a week.

154
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:41,832
When I saw the news in the papers,

155
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,667
I wonder if you guys are all gay?

156
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:47,042
No, sis.

157
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,792
Look, Chai.

158
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,082
Listen to me.

159
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:53,332
We'll figure this out
when we're back from Xishuangbanna.

160
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,082
Love or hate,

161
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,582
girls like us can't really tell.

162
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,332
Just like the way
you're still pissed off by Nhong.

163
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:06,457
No, Chai. That troll...

164
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,500
can be called
a disgrace of all pink boys.

165
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,125
You know what, Chai.

166
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:14,082
He leaves us for a new team
and keeps talking shit about me.

167
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:18,707
I am not just saying that.
I've got some proofs.

168
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,167
NHONG UPSET WITH HIS EX-TEAM

169
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,125
See?

170
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,000
He said that?

171
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,207
NHONG SAYS NO TO JUNG

172
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:29,082
You haven't seen everything yet.
This is only part of it.

173
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,957
I have clips of news on TV
to show how bad mouth he is.

174
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:43,457
He's definitely a gay.
I just know it.

175
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,332
GRADUATION CEREMONY, 1995

176
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,082
Holy Moly!

177
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,832
There's an old hag
in our town of Lampang.

178
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:52,332
Damn you, Jung.

179
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,042
Old hag, my ass.

180
00:11:56,457 --> 00:12:00,207
Sis, can't you tell
that I'm just kidding?

181
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:02,417
It's just for fun.

182
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,042
My ass is for another kind of fun.

183
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,207
What kind of fun?

184
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:12,042
Having fun on a bike.
I gotta go. Bye.

185
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,042
Why it's so itchy?

186
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,417
My whole face feels so tight.

187
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,832
Stop nagging, will you?

188
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,582
Look. It's messed up.

189
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,207
If the mask works on you,

190
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,457
I'll apply it on Jung's face
when he's back.

191
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,957
Talking about Jung, honey...

192
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,332
-Should I take him to a therapist?
-What's for?

193
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,332
Look at him.
Can't tell what his gender is.

194
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,167
Dad!

195
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,792
See?

196
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,707
Look what you've done.

197
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:45,207
Stop! Enough!

198
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,457
Damn you, Kiang!

199
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,792
Come on!

200
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,832
Kiang! I said enough!

201
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,417
-Honey!
-You judge my son!

202
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,542
Shit!

203
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:02,457
-Honey, stop it!
-You judge my son.

204
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,457
Kiang! Go home!

205
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:07,667
Kiang, you go home!
Honey, stop it!

206
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,417
Ouch! That hurts.

207
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,167
If you didn't stop me,

208
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,707
I was going to knock him down.

209
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:20,457
You're not Dump Matsumoto.

210
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,457
I'm going to check on Kiang.

211
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,292
I hit him quite hard.

212
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:29,707
No, you're not going anywhere.
He's a neighbor from hell.

213
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:32,832
How could he judge my Jung?

214
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:36,292
Congratulate me
for getting a son-in-law, huh?

215
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,832
Damn him.

216
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,167
Taking a photo for what?

217
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,332
Never seen a happy family?

218
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,332
Just you wait.

219
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,917
My son will make our country proud.

220
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,332
Right. Someone like him

221
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,167
-will never knock up a girl.
-Right.

222
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,707
Bro, do you ever
want to sleep with your friend?

223
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,417
How dare you.

224
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,457
Shit.

225
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,457
Just you can cause much troubles.

226
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,957
I can't imagine what you
and your gang in college could do.

227
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:44,000
We had so much fun.
It's quite hard to gather them up now.

228
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:47,250
We were so bomb
like in the movie of Seven Samurai.

229
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:49,207
-It's really hard, Chai.
-Jung.

230
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,457
Can you tell me that story and...

231
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,082
your boyfriend is so gorgeous.

232
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,417
Don't bring it out of the room.

233
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:06,707
Don't bring any papers
or electronic devices

234
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,792
into the test rooms.

235
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:13,582
Welcome, everyone.
Fill in the application forms here.

236
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,207
This is the volleyball club.

237
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,125
Welcome, everyone
to our volleyball club.

238
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,082
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

239
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,082
Don't be. It's my fault.

240
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:34,625
I knocked you down.

241
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,832
Are you hurt? You screamed so loud.

242
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,917
Not really.

243
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,792
You guys alright?

244
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:44,207
Yeah.

245
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,042
If so, please have a seat
in our volleyball club's tent.

246
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,457
Alright?

247
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,375
Hey!

248
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,582
Are you gonna sit here
till your graduation?

249
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:00,582
-Follow me.
-My leg hurts.

250
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,542
Hurry up.

251
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,208
Hurry up, Wit.

252
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,416
Jung, don't mess around.

253
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,666
Keep up with them.

254
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,166
Jung, damn you!

255
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,583
That hurts, sis.

256
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,375
Wit, my dear.
You don't have to be this tough.

257
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,333
It may harm
our chances for reproduction.

258
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,666
You're insane!

259
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,166
What?

260
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,458
Julapong and Wit
practice the setting for 500.

261
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,166
Kamon, Kiat
you guys take 300 each.

262
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,583
Don't mess around.

263
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,416
I'm fucked because of the newbies.

264
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,500
You too, Wit.

265
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,208
Fuck you, Kiat.

266
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,458
Coach Surapol
gives you a hard time every day.

267
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,583
Shut up.

268
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,625
Look what you've done.

269
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,958
Keep hitting the ball.

270
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,041
Go. Go.

271
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,291
Damn you! Faster!

272
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,708
It's volleyball, not playing chess.

273
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,041
I said faster!

274
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,916
It's just volleyball.

275
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,166
You can't be this lousy.

276
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,458
I'm so tired. It's too hot.

277
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,458
Sis, we practice it like crazy.

278
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,583
You still can't be
one of the main players?

279
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,166
Coach Surapol
picks only the best.

280
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,458
You've just been in the team for two weeks
and think of being a main player?

281
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,416
No, I just do it for fun.

282
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,208
I love Jung Koshika.
Want to be cute and good like her.

283
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,916
Really? I thought you're in
because you like Wit.

284
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,291
Sis, are you dissing me?

285
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,666
-I'm not your servant.
-You know that Ann

286
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,333
is so ambitious.

287
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,875
She wants to be a team manager
like in a movie.

288
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Jung, I think...

289
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,458
you can call me Mon.

290
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,083
I'm just one year older than you.
We might graduate the same year.

291
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,083
Let's be friends.

292
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,458
Even your face looks much older,
but I'm alright with that.

293
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,916
Bitch.

294
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,083
Ann, you can go home now.

295
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,416
No, I don't want to.
My parents meet a matchmaker today.

296
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,541
I want to walk May home.

297
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,833
Give it back.

298
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,833
Why you let your teammates
be like this?

299
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,708
Playing around with makeup?

300
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,500
You should be tougher
so they might get stronger.

301
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,458
Our match is coming soon.
Why are not thinking about that?

302
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,208
Here, sis.

303
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,750
It's a new lipstick.

304
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,541
Mister Donut. Can I help you?
We've got a special offer.

305
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,625
POSTCODE 10240

306
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,708
Please hurry.

307
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,791
Very pretty, huh?

308
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,041
What!

309
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,291
My son wants to be a daughter.

310
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,666
He wants to be pretty.

311
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,791
Damn you!

312
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,833
NEON MAGAZINE

313
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,458
You're damn annoying!

314
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,750
Hey, your hair is getting long.

315
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,083
Why don't you tie it up?

316
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,583
SEMINAR AT CHA-AM BEACH

317
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,666
All students are welcomed

318
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,541
to participate
in Cha-Am beach's beauty pageant.

319
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,708
Hello, handsome.

320
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,083
How about me?

321
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,333
Can I join the pageant?

322
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,666
For someone like you,

323
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,833
how about die and rebirth as a girl?

324
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,125
But it's alright for Ann.

325
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,500
If you allow me to poke you.

326
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,458
Honey, your zipper!

327
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,875
You dickhead,

328
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,833
I don't need your poking.

329
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,916
Why don't you just go home

330
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,333
and poke your sister.

331
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,083
I heard that she is quite horny.

332
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,708
Hey!

333
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,208
-Kanchit
-What?

334
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,708
Take it easy.

335
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,500
I think we should stop talking.

336
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,708
Let's do something manly.

337
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,291
How about that?

338
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,958
This is it. It's fun time.

339
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,166
This pussy team lost the game.

340
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,333
What should we tell them to do?

341
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,166
Say what?

342
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,208
Alright. Listen up.

343
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,291
I know what to do.

344
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,666
Make them dance.

345
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,083
-How about that?
-Yes!

346
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,333
Make the monkey sound

347
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,833
and wave for the crowd.

348
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,958
Party Time!

349
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,333
Ladies! Go hard tonight.
Ann will pay for you.

350
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,291
I've got some gold.

351
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,291
You stole something
from your dad again?

352
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,458
They play really cool music.

353
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:01,583
-And I can see a lot of hot guys too.
-Look.

354
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,041
They're all hunks.

355
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,958
That's great.
I don't have to look for a gigolo.

356
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,333
I just come here and pick one.
They're so hot.

357
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,458
At nine o'clock, girls.

358
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,541
Look over there.

359
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:46,916
Look.

360
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,833
How are you? Hungry?

361
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,416
Cutie.

362
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,458
What's up, Nhong?

363
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:17,333
Do you know
why we're here in your room?

364
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,833
-Can you guess?
-Yes, I can.

365
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,708
You guys come here to be kicked out
because of breaking into my room.

366
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,916
You're still acting macho.

367
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,958
Don't you know
it's not our nature to do that?

368
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,333
May I ask you one more thing?

369
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:39,583
How can a straight guy
have these posters

370
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:43,833
like a picture of a pop idol
on the wall over your headboard.

371
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,833
Is it right, Nhong?

372
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,375
What're you talking about?

373
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,083
I have no idea what you mean by that.

374
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,708
And he's got ABBA,
the Carpenters, Gloria Gaynor

375
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,458
Barbra Streisand and Pu Anchalee,
the full collection.

376
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,166
Well, that's not weird really.

377
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,208
But these photos
of close encounter are.

378
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,833
Too many, though.

379
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,833
You damn lesbian!
I will kill you.

380
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,333
-Sis, help me!
-Stop it!

381
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:16,583
You homo!

382
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,250
Lesbian! Homo!

383
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,333
Just leave me alone.

384
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,791
Damn you, Nhong!
Fuck off!

385
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,333
-Where're you going?
-No!

386
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm not.

387
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:57,708
I'm not a homo.

388
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,208
Everybody does that, right?

389
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,375
Oh dear.

390
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,458
Nhong, but you were doing the same things

391
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:09,208
as homo does.

392
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:15,291
Kanchit and I, we're best mates

393
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:22,208
But he doesn't think the same way
about you as you think of him for sure.

394
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,166
That's a guy
who couldn't make up his mind

395
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,208
that he wants to get a wife
or be someone's wife.

396
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,041
Do you have something to say, Jung?

397
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,916
In this case,

398
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,583
I think our Nhong

399
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,208
might not belong to
"that" group of friends.

400
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:08,958
Nhong...

401
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:14,708
just be what you want to be, okay?

402
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,833
Coming through.

403
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,291
Please make way
for a just-out-of-the-closet gay.

404
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,083
Move. It's dangerous.

405
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,625
Thank you. Thanks.

406
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,125
This is Nhong.

407
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,083
Oh my god.

408
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,583
So cute. Can I borrow this?

409
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,166
Hi there. I'm Nhong.
What's your name?

410
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,875
Who the hell is this guy?
Look at his makeup, so shabby.

411
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,875
Looks like something out of a freak show.
So ugly but wanna be a queer.

412
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:47,916
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't get it. Take it back.

413
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,833
Gotta run. Take care. Bye.

414
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,958
No!

415
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,333
DOMON

416
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,500
Hey! Kanchit.

417
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,291
That's your girlfriend. Go.

418
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,416
Go to him.

419
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,541
Kanchit.

420
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,708
Where are you going? Wait up.

421
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,625
FOLK MERCHANDISE FAIRS
AROUND THE POOL 1-6 OCTOBER

422
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,708
We can solve the world's
over-population problem, you know?

423
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,166
Make it quick, Jung.

424
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,708
Right. You troll.

425
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,833
-I'm starving.
-You're broke from too much shopping.

426
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,708
Then you have to beg me for food.

427
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,541
You don't want me
to be prettier than you.

428
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,833
As if. I should be jealous of Ann.

429
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,291
There will be a war outside.

430
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,208
Sis, let's take a look.

431
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,958
-Fine. Go to hell.
-Yes, I will.

432
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,083
If I didn't want something new,
I wouldn't have sex with you.

433
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,458
Son of a bitch.

434
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,208
Just two months.

435
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,583
Only two months.

436
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,958
He just left me.

437
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:05,291
Making friends with gays
is always trendy, sis.

438
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:09,291
If he's that horrible, I think...

439
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:13,041
you should let him go.
Say goodbye to him for good.

440
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,708
We've heard you fighting with him
all the time.

441
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,291
I thought it's just a chaos
of a pregnant woman.

442
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,958
So, I ignored it.

443
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,833
I didn't know you go
to the same college with us.

444
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,250
If you can't come to class tomorrow,

445
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,708
you can stay with us.

446
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,708
Just let me know
if you need anything.

447
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,708
You said for two months.

448
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,333
What's about that?

449
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,458
I've got some money.

450
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,333
So, I can get a boob job
to make him happy.

451
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,416
What's wrong with these perverts?
Why they're so obsessed with boobs?

452
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,708
Do you want mine?
Just take them away.

453
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,208
Damn. They're really annoying.

454
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,916
Now I can pee like a man.

455
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,833
Good god.

456
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,208
How dare you?

457
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,041
Are you alright, sis?

458
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,250
When people gave me a hard time,

459
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,458
these guys took care of me.

460
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,666
So, I could make it through.

461
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,333
Well, it's hard to believe that

462
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,916
you can be a grateful person.
So cute.

463
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,958
He's not that stupid. Look.

464
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,833
Ann, give him a hand.
Excuse me.

465
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:32,083
There's something in your mouth.
Let me fix your bad mouth.

466
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,041
Asshole!

467
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,666
Ann, what that means?

468
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:46,333
He says I'm pretty, right?
No need to give me a compliment.

469
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,958
I know that I'm prettier than you.
That's a fact.

470
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,166
Cheers. See?

471
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,708
I gotta go back to work.

472
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,583
Alright, Mon.
We need more doughnuts.

473
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:57,833
It's on me.

474
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,541
There. He's over there.

475
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,666
-I can't see anything.
-Quiet!

476
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,333
He might have heard us.

477
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,416
Wow. What a hunk!

478
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:10,916
Let me see him.

479
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,458
What is a hunk?

480
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,458
-A girl like you know nothing.
-I think he's gay.

481
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:21,541
Julapong!

482
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:28,125
You come to practice for a few days,
as our substitute players.

483
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,208
If you can't make it,
so be it.

484
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,208
My god.

485
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,333
What? You lesbian.

486
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,916
My hands are total mess.
What? Wait.

487
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,416
Jung.

488
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,958
Hey, Wit.

489
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,833
-Have a seat.
-Sit here, my dear Wit.

490
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,083
Are you tired?

491
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,708
Wow. Really expensive dishes.
Who will pay for these?

492
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,416
And what's the occasion?

493
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:45,333
Ann will. Well, today...

494
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,791
she came out and told her parents.

495
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,083
-Listen to me, Wit.
-Damn.

496
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,875
Nhong, you ugly bitch.

497
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,208
What a clumsy homo.

498
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,583
Ugly but sassy.

499
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,208
The matchmaker brought a guy
to see Ann again.

500
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,708
Again?

501
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,833
But she is...

502
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,083
That's right.

503
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,708
That's why Ann is so upset.

504
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,208
I told my dad,

505
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:24,833
my mom, my aunt
and that guy named Hong

506
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:29,208
that I can't be anyone's wife
because I'm a lesbian.

507
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:34,083
My mom choked on shark's fin soup.

508
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,583
That guy and the matchmaker
just walked out.

509
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,708
I was waiting...

510
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,708
for my dad to kick me out.

511
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,041
It didn't happen.

512
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,416
Mom came and give me a hug.

513
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,333
Dad didn't say a word.

514
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,458
He ordered to take the food home.

515
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,583
On the way back, he even said to me

516
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,708
that he hasn't seen
you guys for ages.

517
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:22,166
I think your mom and dad

518
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:25,583
are gonna hate that soup for life.

519
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,125
Shut up.

520
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,291
Hey.

521
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:50,958
Is that our Pia?

522
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,041
I'm a showgirl

523
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,541
and I'm fabulous.

524
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,833
You're itching or what?

525
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,041
Want to be slapped?

526
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:39,583
-Why do you keep hitting me?
-Take a look.

527
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,291
That bitch, Ann.

528
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:42,875
I'm so pissed.

529
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,833
I flirt with him all the time

530
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:50,208
but he's never touched me.

531
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,708
But with Ann...

532
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:55,791
Ann.

533
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,333
You have a lot of guts to do that.
You do indeed.

534
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,833
You guys have lots of guts as well.

535
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,166
Come in.

536
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,416
What's up, funny?

537
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,833
Pussy. Pussy. Pussy.

538
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,416
Bitch.

539
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,416
You keep pressing that damn button.

540
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:31,458
Want to have a pussy that much?

541
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:36,958
Pia

542
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,458
Look. We're going to die.

543
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,833
Shut up. You won't die
even if you're poisoned.

544
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,958
It's just a blackout.
It happens quite a lot here.

545
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,250
It's because of you.

546
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,833
Talking about death is a bad omen.

547
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:00,583
I haven't got a cute boyfriend yet.

548
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,541
I don't wanna die.

549
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,541
Help me.

550
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,291
Save me.

551
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:10,458
Nhong, Your voice is so loud.

552
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:12,041
You're not helping.

553
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,791
Angels like us

554
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:18,166
-are not going to die in here.
-Hey.

555
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,375
I don't think it's a blackout.

556
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,958
If not...

557
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,791
-What is it, Wit?
-Don't tell me that...

558
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,208
It's fire!

559
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:37,583
I'm going to die for sure.
Mom, dad please help me.

560
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,791
I haven't been a grateful child.
I can't die right now.

561
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:43,541
Oh my god.

562
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,333
Shit. Our bodies
are going to look terrible in here.

563
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,083
What should we do, Nhong?

564
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,708
Get a grip, Jung.

565
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:53,208
I've just come out of the closet
and never been with anyone.

566
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,833
I can't believe
I'm going to die in the fire.

567
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:58,958
Calm down, all of you.

568
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:02,083
If we can block out the smoke,
we might have enough air to breath.

569
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,000
-Let's do it.
-Make it quick, Nhong.

570
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,208
I wanna say thank you
to all of you

571
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,208
for everything.

572
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,208
Thank you... for helping me

573
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:29,666
to make it through.

574
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,583
Thanks to you guys

575
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,333
especially you, Jung.

576
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:40,833
You make me enjoy volleyball a lot.

577
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,791
You too, Nhong.

578
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,208
I'm so happy to have friends
like you and everyone.

579
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,208
Don't cry.

580
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,583
Wit.

581
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,416
I love you.

582
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,166
Bitch!

583
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:10,666
That's impossible.

584
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:13,833
I'm gay.

585
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,208
I'm gay!

586
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,458
Save me.
Nhong, I like you.

587
00:46:17,255 --> 00:46:18,166
Wow!

588
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,333
Exotic!

589
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:22,708
It's beautiful.

590
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:24,833
One.

591
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,083
-One room.
-Chai.

592
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,208
We are together.

593
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,583
Please come in.
Make yourselves at home.

594
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,958
Wow!

595
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:49,166
Chai, I'm so tired.

596
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,291
Chai, it's me. Jung.

597
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:11,666
Not Nhong.
Why are you so jumpy?

598
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,333
You scared me.
Make a sound before coming in.

599
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,083
Chai, my man.

600
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:24,083
Don't you call me
to put you to sleep later.

601
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,833
Honey. Don't play with the phone.

602
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:12,333
Somebody might want to call us.

603
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:16,416
Someone may not reach us
if the line is busy.

604
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,083
I want to call daddy.

605
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,250
I want daddy.

606
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,833
Let's play with your toys.

607
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,791
-No.
-I want daddy.

608
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:32,291
Easy, Nong. That hurts.

609
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,958
Hold on.
It will help your muscles.

610
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:37,666
Be gentle. Ouch!

611
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,458
He's not getting better, Coach.

612
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,083
I think he's okay.

613
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:47,833
Are you, Nhong?

614
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,416
I've almost gone back
to my normal state.

615
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,333
Shit.

616
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,208
For you, Mr. Prasert

617
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,583
we will give it all.

618
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:02,208
Bullshit. You three idiots.

619
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,666
For Tip O-Sod team,

620
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,916
I'll give it all I've got, Mr. Prasert.

621
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,333
And we all will be dead.

622
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:17,791
We have a big project to do.

623
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:23,708
Chiang Mai's governor wants us
to play for his team in Group 5.

624
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:26,958
That's great.

625
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:30,916
If we win,
we could be in the national league.

626
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,541
If we played for Chiang Mai team,

627
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,291
-we have to play against Lampang.
-That's right.

628
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:44,833
That's why
I have no confidence in our team.

629
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:49,083
Our three-step plan
for being the national team,

630
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,208
will be... impossible to realize.

631
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:57,583
If we couldn't find
some really good players

632
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:01,458
to join our team,
we would definitely loose.

633
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,000
Look at our team. Disaster.

634
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,666
You're right, sir.

635
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,583
But there're no more gay people

636
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,416
who can play well
and also who are good looking like me.

637
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:17,708
We've got Nong,
who is such a godsend.

638
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,291
He looks just like me.
Like we're brothers.

639
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:27,208
We don't need only gay players.

640
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,291
Look at Iron Ladies team.

641
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,333
They've got Chai.

642
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,458
You have a point.

643
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:36,083
Right. Straight guys will do.

644
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,500
Right?

645
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,416
How about Meungman?

646
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,208
Mon.

647
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:51,375
Nong...

648
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,916
Nong is a fake homo.

649
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,833
Mr. Prasert tricked me.

650
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,958
He told Nong to act like a homo

651
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,583
so our team will be famous
like Iron Ladies team.

652
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,833
Then he kicked me out.

653
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,583
What should I do, Mon?

654
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,208
IRON LADIES

655
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:36,166
-Should I ask him?
-Do it.

656
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,583
Pan Loe.

657
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:40,958
Pan Loe?

658
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,458
Chai, Pan Loe.

659
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:50,666
Pan Loe.

660
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,208
Chai, don't rub with your shirt.
It's dirty.

661
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:08,083
Your eyes will get irritated.
Use a handkerchief.

662
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,541
Why not?

663
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,333
Still don't trust me, huh?

664
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,208
Don't rub them with your shirt.

665
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:16,958
Sorry, Jung.
I understand it.

666
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,333
I understand it.

667
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:22,583
But my instinct really doesn't.

668
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:29,458
That's why
Wit loves to hang out with us.

669
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,958
Straight guys won't do that.

670
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,458
Damn you, Wit.

671
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,833
I've flirted with him for ages.

672
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,833
How about that girl, Ann?

673
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,916
You guys don't talk about her anymore.

674
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,916
Democracy belongs to us!

675
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:51,416
Resign!

676
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:05,416
After Ann's been rejected by Wit,
she's totally changed.

677
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:09,833
in 1992,
she had a mental breakdown.

678
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:14,083
She went abroad
and rarely contacted us.

679
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:19,791
I miss her a lot.

680
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:36,791
The jacket that you mom did
is so multi-purpose.

681
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:49,458
Don't come closer!

682
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,333
Go away. Just go.

683
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:57,791
Your jacket should be destroyed.

684
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:05,708
No, don't. Trust me.

685
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:09,416
Bitch! That's my jacket.

686
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,333
-Go to hell!
-Come on, Jung!

687
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,208
Stop. Stop it.

688
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,625
Nhong.

689
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:39,833
I've heard that Kitti
supports Mr. Praset's team.

690
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,958
He's the one
who always causes us troubles.

691
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,416
I'm not sure
that they're real nice.

692
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,083
You care about me?

693
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:55,666
I think
you only care about yourself.

694
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,708
Bitch. Shut up.

695
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:05,833
I'm so worried about you
just like everyone else.

696
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:10,666
-Because we're in the same team.
-That's right.

697
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,791
We are in the same team.

698
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:18,041
I really want that.
It's not your team.

699
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,291
It's not my team.

700
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,958
We work together as one team.

701
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,916
Let me know if you need anything.

702
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,416
I'm not a bad guy.

703
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,541
I'm the team manager.

704
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,541
I have money.

705
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,833
-I've got a budget.
-Budget?

706
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,208
You hear that, Nhong?

707
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,583
That's all he needs.

708
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:42,666
You are just something he can buy.

709
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,041
I'm not gay

710
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:50,208
but there's one thing that
makes me different and special.

711
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:51,833
We're friends.

712
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,333
Nhong.

713
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:00,458
We warn you
because you're our friend.

714
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:08,458
You guys

715
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:13,041
get your opportunities
and then leave me behind.

716
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,958
This time I've got mine.

717
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,458
Why can't I do it for myself?

718
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,375
Do you think

719
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,416
that stupid restaurant

720
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,291
is the best thing for me?

721
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,208
I won't let it happen again
like on that day.

722
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,416
It's not gonna happen again, Jung.

723
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:36,333
What day?

724
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:40,083
The day we left the army on a bus.

725
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:43,041
Students ask for your autograph

726
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:44,958
but not for mine.

727
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,333
You laughed at me.

728
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,208
Excuse me. Are you Thai?

729
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,416
Hello handsome.
Can I take a ride with you?

730
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,208
What?

731
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:13,291
Chai.

732
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,458
We are so lucky to meet you here.

733
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,583
We had to hire this van.

734
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,958
I'm not so sure that it's a luck.

735
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:13,541
LADYBOY PERFORMANCE

736
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,541
Hello, Coach Bi.

737
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,333
Hello.

738
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:49,708
Hi, Mon.

739
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:57,541
Nhong, take a seat.

740
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:01,416
We gave you a call when we left
but nobody answered.

741
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,833
Someone prepared the trip for me.
I've just arrived this afternoon.

742
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:12,833
What? Pia told me that
there's no flight.

743
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,791
There's a non-commercial flight.

744
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,500
I know one flight attendant
so I tag along.

745
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,083
You followed him around, right?

746
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,583
How about Coach and Wit?
On a vacation?

747
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,666
Not really.

748
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,541
You can ask Chai.

749
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:36,333
I have no idea.
You should ask Pia about that.

750
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,291
Greetings, everyone.

751
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:50,583
At first, I was afraid

752
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:55,791
I was petrified

753
00:59:57,041 --> 01:00:01,000
Kept thinking I could never
live without you

754
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,333
by my si-si-si-si-side

755
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:10,333
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

756
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:17,458
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

757
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:22,583
a-a-a-a-a-a-aloooong

758
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,833
And so, you're back
From outer space

759
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:33,208
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

760
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,583
Hello, Coach Bi.

761
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:36,833
How have you been?

762
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:39,958
-You're like Kylie Minogue.
-Sis.

763
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:44,291
Who is the guy
that's waiting for you every night?

764
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:46,666
Right.

765
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,875
At ten o'clock.

766
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,208
Can't be.

767
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:56,833
Sis, is this guy
the best one you've got?

768
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,791
It's a big no.

769
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,458
Bitch. He's the nicest one.

770
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:04,583
I've dated a lot of good looking guys.

771
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:09,208
Why can't I see someone
who's ugly as hell but nice?

772
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,333
Sis, about your ex-boyfriends,

773
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:16,333
what's wrong with them?

774
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:18,041
They're asshole.

775
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:21,583
Just leave me alone, will you?

776
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,583
I'm so happy right now,
more than I used to be.

777
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,583
Coach, you've made up your mind?

778
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,625
-Have you?
-Well.

779
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,625
I've talked with these guys

780
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,041
but haven't finished it yet.

781
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:39,208
Nhong has left for karaoke.

782
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,458
Jung, that's enough.

783
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:48,041
Nhong has learned his lesson.
He regrets it.

784
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,208
Look, Chai.

785
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,583
When victory, fame and money
come through one door,

786
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,958
friendship
will leave through one as well.

787
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:59,416
Nhong...

788
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,291
has changed.

789
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,583
Go on now, go

790
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:08,916
Walk out the door
Just turn around now

791
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:13,291
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

792
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:51,583
Is it the time to get to know
your new boyfriend, sis?

793
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,708
Please introduce him
to our big mama.

794
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:59,708
-Nonsense.
-None of your business.

795
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,708
Coach, this is Doi.

796
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,916
-Hello.
-Hello.

797
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:07,583
Is he top or bottom?

798
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,041
Shut up, bitch.

799
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:16,291
He's the president of
national sports association here

800
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,208
and he wants our Iron Ladies team

801
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,458
to play against his team.

802
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:24,458
Good. We can practice it
before the match held in Lampang.

803
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:31,833
Iron Ladies are awesome.

804
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,166
God, Chai.
Help me.

805
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,958
Pia. Save me.

806
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,541
Where's the comb?

807
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,166
Are you hurt?

808
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:36,208
Can't believe that Iron Ladies team
can play in an international match.

809
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,666
This is what you want, isn't it?

810
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,333
It's time, ladies.

811
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:53,250
There are lots of people out there.

812
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:55,083
I should have sold tickets.

813
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,458
I can make some money.

814
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,291
Let's see if you guys deserve
to play for Lampang team.

815
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:05,958
Let's go.

816
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,375
Ladies.

817
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,958
Go Iron Ladies!

818
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,458
Coach Bi.

819
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:11,583
Have you finalized the list
of players for Lampang team?

820
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,542
I don't know if it's alright

821
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:23,292
but I've already asked Jung's mom
to make these.

822
01:08:23,832 --> 01:08:25,582
Chai, help me out.

823
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:28,957
These are for everyone.

824
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:31,957
Orange is my color.

825
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:43,082
Absolutely fa-bu.

826
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:51,707
I need to pee.

827
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:45,792
I'm always jealous of you.

828
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:49,457
You always have confidence

829
01:09:50,957 --> 01:09:52,207
in everything you do.

830
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:55,625
Unlike me,

831
01:09:56,957 --> 01:10:01,457
I always need your advice
before doing things.

832
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,207
Even about my life.

833
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:11,792
My parents don't care about me
as much as you do.

834
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,625
Since I've known you...

835
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:20,582
you are always in a spotlight.

836
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:23,832
Sometimes I think

837
01:10:25,832 --> 01:10:27,457
it would be great if I were you.

838
01:10:29,582 --> 01:10:30,707
It must be awesome.

839
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:40,875
I've...

840
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:44,292
just realized...

841
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,667
that you didn't mean
to steal my spotlight.

842
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:53,207
You're just worried about me.

843
01:10:57,207 --> 01:10:58,707
Why I'm so stupid?

844
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:04,332
Even Coach

845
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,792
and everyone else,

846
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,832
they're all concerned about me.

847
01:11:13,582 --> 01:11:15,292
I thought they're...

848
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,042
jealous of me

849
01:11:20,707 --> 01:11:22,667
like I was of you.

850
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:27,207
You hear that, Jung?

851
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:32,957
Can you hear me, Jung?

852
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,332
Can you hear me, Jung?

853
01:11:35,957 --> 01:11:38,832
You hear that, Jung?

854
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:41,707
-Jung.
-Bitch.

855
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:44,417
Can I poop in peace?

856
01:11:52,082 --> 01:11:53,125
Fine.

857
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:54,832
I will forgive you

858
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:58,707
when you accept the fact that
I'm prettier than you, dumbass.

859
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:06,542
Alright, but...

860
01:12:07,207 --> 01:12:10,457
It's between you and me, alright?

861
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:30,582
-Pervert.
-Get a room, will you?

862
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:34,042
It's raining, come in.

863
01:12:39,457 --> 01:12:40,500
LIVE

864
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,292
The championship match
for Group 5's leading title

865
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,167
kicks off today.

866
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,250
Lampang team versus
Chiang Mai team.

867
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,000
Players of Chiang Mai team...

868
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:54,292
are all from Tip O-Sod club,
the latest Thailand League' s champion.

869
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,207
They might not let their fans down

870
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:58,792
because they win every match
through the finals.

871
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,082
That's a true champion.

872
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:04,042
While the previous year's champion,
Iron Ladies of Lampang team

873
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:06,000
are struggling to make it...

874
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,832
to the finals.

875
01:13:08,082 --> 01:13:10,667
However,
what makes people interested

876
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:14,292
is the similarity of these two teams.

877
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,417
Not just their looks,

878
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,082
the ways they are and their behaviors...

879
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,667
are quite the same.

880
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:26,750
CHIANGMAI TEAM

881
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:37,500
You have to keep an eye
on today's match

882
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,000
on every ball, every second,

883
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,250
see who will win the title
of Group 5, Lampang or Chiang Mai

884
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,832
to play in the upcoming
national tournament.

885
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:52,707
VERSUS

886
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:35,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
a miracle happens just once.

887
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:40,750
Chiang Mai score over Lampang
two to zero set.

888
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:45,207
I'm dying here.

889
01:14:45,332 --> 01:14:47,042
We've played for too many sets.

890
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,250
My throat is dry like a desert.

891
01:14:51,832 --> 01:14:52,957
Don't be too nervous.

892
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:56,125
Don't be scared to lose.

893
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:00,457
Remember this,
we've made it through the finals

894
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,707
Right. Just two sets.

895
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:07,750
Listen, they will use three blocks
in the next set.

896
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,417
Nhong, I'm begging you
to be in the game.

897
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,042
-Can you?
-Please.

898
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,917
-I will.
-Yeah.

899
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:21,957
So, you and Chai have to do
the back attack to break the block.

900
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,832
Yeah.

901
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:26,292
How do you know
that they will use the three blocks?

902
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,667
I have my supporters as well.

903
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:32,167
Our team have a lot of supporters.

904
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,500
Hooray!

905
01:16:07,832 --> 01:16:10,750
Sorry, that's awesome.

906
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:13,957
Now Iron Ladies are on fire.

907
01:16:14,082 --> 01:16:16,832
Lampang team will serve the ball.

908
01:16:17,207 --> 01:16:20,457
Let's see
if they can get their first score.

909
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,375
Go away from me, homo.

910
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,000
My dear man.

911
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,500
Don't fuss.

912
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,250
I'm straight just like you.

913
01:17:12,542 --> 01:17:14,957
-So mean.
-It's really exciting.

914
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,082
The scores
keep changing on set three.

915
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,792
We'll see who is gonna be the winner

916
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,500
the original team or the dupes?

917
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,082
If you guys're messed up like this,

918
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:28,832
our sponsors will leave us.

919
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:33,832
I've invested a lot into this team
and I don't want to lose.

920
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,667
I want you guys
to have a better quality of life.

921
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,457
If it's bad like this,

922
01:17:39,832 --> 01:17:43,000
your dreams will be over.

923
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,625
Focus, please.

924
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:36,500
Time out.

925
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:42,750
Dear god,
please make Lampang win

926
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:46,667
then I will get promoted to be a mayor.

927
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:50,542
You have to make a prayer,
Mr. Governor?

928
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:55,750
Iron ladies like us
are already the miracle.

929
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,875
Is that right, Mr. Governor?

930
01:18:58,042 --> 01:18:59,167
Mon.

931
01:18:59,292 --> 01:19:01,707
You in the front, Chai in the back.

932
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,750
April in the middle.

933
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,500
For Nhong,

934
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:09,207
You attack from the back
and then Jung...

935
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:12,417
do the B-quick ball.
Pia will do the double block.

936
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,750
May and June defend,
understand?

937
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:18,292
Mon, you have to help Pia
with the block.

938
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:20,167
-Chai, stay on the left.
-Yes.

939
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:22,625
How many of us now?

940
01:19:23,332 --> 01:19:25,375
Let's do this.

941
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:28,792
Attack them first, got it?

942
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,375
I think you should take some rest.

943
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:33,207
Got it?

944
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,500
-Jung.
-Yes.

945
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:41,292
Hold the ball when they serve it.
Don't ever lose it.

946
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:44,042
If you can do it,
we might still have a chance.

947
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:47,375
Chai, I'm just worried about him.

948
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,125
He jumps, attacks
and sets the ball.

949
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,832
His leg can't hold it much longer.

950
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,792
You look so pale.

951
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:57,000
Give me some bronzer real quick.

952
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:01,417
On your nose too.

953
01:20:03,707 --> 01:20:04,750
Look at him.

954
01:20:20,792 --> 01:20:22,375
That hurts like hell.

955
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:41,707
Coach, take a time out.

956
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,082
Time out, please.

957
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:48,250
What's happening?

958
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,292
How are you gonna handle this?

959
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,125
If it's not because
your team is so unlucky,

960
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:58,667
those homos won't get any chances.

961
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,250
This trick doesn't work.

962
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,417
We'd better attack over the net.

963
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:07,832
If that doesn't work as well,

964
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:10,957
you guys can give up.
Let them win.

965
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,457
This is a technical timeout
for our staff to clean up

966
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:34,000
the broken bulb.

967
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:43,457
What're you doing here?

968
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:48,957
-Where's mommy?
-Mommy.

969
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:54,042
Go Pia!

970
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:57,832
What are you looking at?

971
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:02,750
Go Pia!

972
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:06,957
Chai, I'm so sorry.

973
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:12,125
I should be the one
who really trust you

974
01:22:13,417 --> 01:22:14,667
but I...

975
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:19,750
-did that to you.
-It's okay. I get it.

976
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,125
But you have to handle it though.

977
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:28,082
People keep questioning my sexuality

978
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,625
but I've got it under control.
Don't worry.

979
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:37,042
I've been upset a lot lately.

980
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:39,542
It might be because...

981
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,457
What I'm having, honey?

982
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,167
I'm having a baby.

983
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,917
Both teams have to keep

984
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,667
their rally points
as long as they can to win.

985
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:06,417
Every match
between these two in the past

986
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:08,917
was like a war.
They won't let the other win easily

987
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:12,000
-especially the championship set.
-Right.

988
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:25,707
You fake homo.

989
01:23:30,082 --> 01:23:32,500
How dare you to imitate me?
You're so lame.

990
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,500
You drag queen.

991
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,250
Watch me.

992
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:56,167
Ouch.

993
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:32,917
Time out.

994
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:44,332
People go crazy.
Today's game is unbelievable.

995
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:45,625
They're so great.

996
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,042
That's right. A sponsor should
give the injured players extra money.

997
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:53,875
All you need to win this game

998
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:56,832
is not my advice

999
01:24:58,332 --> 01:24:59,917
but your true spirit.

1000
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:03,417
Our opponents are right there.

1001
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,375
It doesn't matter
who's the real gay.

1002
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:08,332
It's the last set.

1003
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:10,000
Go get them!

1004
01:25:10,582 --> 01:25:12,417
Nhong, you have to finish this.

1005
01:25:12,582 --> 01:25:14,332
Make them pay for it.

1006
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,667
Let Mr. Prasert see
what Iron Ladies are made of.

1007
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:22,250
What do you say?

1008
01:25:23,542 --> 01:25:24,582
Can you do it?

1009
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,292
Alright.

1010
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:32,292
-All pretty girls have a hard life.
-Yes.

1011
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,000
You all are pretty girls.
You must have a hard life.

1012
01:25:37,082 --> 01:25:39,500
Let's do it, my pretty girls.

1013
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,250
Go Iron Ladies!

1014
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:40,707
It's okay, you guys.

1015
01:28:42,457 --> 01:28:44,707
Come here. It's alright.

1016
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:58,375
If Nhong didn't touch the net
before the ball hitting the ground,

1017
01:28:58,457 --> 01:29:01,957
Iron Ladies would serve
and have a second chance.

1018
01:29:02,457 --> 01:29:03,875
What a pity.

1019
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:08,917
Their destiny has totally...

1020
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,917
turned upside down.

1021
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,917
If Nhong didn't hurt his leg...

1022
01:29:15,457 --> 01:29:16,792
but it's okay.

1023
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:19,750
Today is another day

1024
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:23,042
that Iron Ladies
gave it all they've got.

1025
01:29:25,832 --> 01:29:29,375
Iron Ladies are the best.
They are the best.

1026
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,375
They might've lost the game

1027
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,707
but they always
win people's hearts.

1028
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,292
Right, everyone?
Mr. Governor?

1029
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:49,417
-That's right.
-Iron Ladies.

1030
01:29:49,707 --> 01:29:51,457
Iron Ladies.

1031
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,625
Iron Ladies.

1032
01:29:54,707 --> 01:29:56,167
Iron Ladies.

1033
01:29:56,292 --> 01:30:00,582
Iron Ladies.

1034
01:30:00,707 --> 01:30:04,957
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1035
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:09,167
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1036
01:30:09,332 --> 01:30:15,207
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1037
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:19,500
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1038
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:24,667
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1039
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:29,917
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1040
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,250
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1041
01:30:33,332 --> 01:30:36,042
Iron Ladies. Iron Ladies.

1042
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:41,125
Mr. Prasert, how do you feel
about today's victory?

1043
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:45,042
Winning and loosing
are quite normal in sports.

1044
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,792
Actually, I really want to know

1045
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:50,375
if I could be the manager
of Iron Ladies team.

1046
01:31:50,457 --> 01:31:51,625
Can you do it?

1047
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:54,167
I'm happy
to work with talented people.

1048
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:58,457
This is a letter from Ann
sent to my dad's address.

1049
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:00,625
They all will be thrilled.

1050
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:02,417
That bitch!

1051
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,082
Jung, look at her.

1052
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:07,000
A man and a baby!

1053
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:11,917
They've just told us
to call them Iron Ladies 2.

1054
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:13,375
What do you say?

1055
01:32:13,582 --> 01:32:15,207
Do you agree with that?

1056
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,457
If they see us as a role model,

1057
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:20,582
that would be a big compliment.

1058
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:22,332
We're honored.

1059
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:25,250
They want to make a movie
about Iron Ladies team. Is it true?

1060
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,417
Let's hope for it.

1061
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,707
I don't think it will be a big hit.

1062
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:36,375
-We gotta go. We're in a hurry.
-Wait. Please stay.

1063
01:32:36,582 --> 01:32:39,125
Where are you going?
Finding somewhere to get over it?

1064
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:41,417
We have a promise to keep.

1065
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,750
-What promise?
-But you guys lost the game.

1066
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:49,500
-Right.
-I didn't make a promise to win.

1067
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:52,082
If we won,
we could have another downfall.

1068
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:56,832
-You guys don't look upset.
-Excuse us.

1069
01:32:56,957 --> 01:32:58,042
May I?

1070
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:00,207
Gotta go. Bye.

1071
01:33:06,042 --> 01:33:08,000
Ladies, ready?

1072
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,250
