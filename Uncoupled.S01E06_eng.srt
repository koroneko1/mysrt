so I thought I'd get one to keep here.

312
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,534
They actually make a great wedding gift

313
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,163
with a set of Bodum
double-walled glass mugs.

314
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,457
Why are we talking about wedding gifts?

315
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,043
Oh, I saw the invite
to your friends' wedding.

316
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,505
Oh. They've been together for 12 years.

317
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,883
-I don't think they're expecting gifts.
-Why get married if not for the gifts?

318
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,260
-That's a good point. Screw the sentiment.
-[chuckles]

319
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,430
So, what would you think
about going to the theater tonight?

320
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,184
I just read a review of a play at
the Public that is supposed to be great.

321
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,355
I would love to, but I have
a standing poker game with some friends.

322
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,314
Huh.

323
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,275
I thought that you would
welcome a night off.

324
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,860
From you? [chuckles]

325
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,278
Nah, I'm good.

326
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,824
But, you know,
if you need one, by all means, I get it.

327
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,368
-[laughs]
-Uh… Hmm…

328
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,998
I'm doing that thing in my head again.
It's stupid. You should come tonight.

329
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,042
Oh. Yeah. Uh, great.

330
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:48,090
I'd love to meet your friends.
But to be honest, I don't even play poker.

331
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:53,846
But I do make some pretty amazing low-carb
snacks, though, if people are into that.

332
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,848
It's a table full of gay men.

333
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,017
Even the poker chips are carb-free.

334
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,102
[both laugh]

335
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,229
♪ Let's go, baby ♪

336
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,650
All I'm saying is,
I find it hard to believe

337
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,987
that this whole Stanley-Jerry dating thing
really isn't about me.

338
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,406
Because everything's all about you, Billy.

339
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,533
-Finally, you understand.
-[laughs]

340
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,161
I see you, and I raise two dollars.

341
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,412
Oh! [chuckles]

342
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,415
-Oh my God, Luke. These are not low-carb.
-They totally are.

343
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,043
The breading is crushed almond,
so go crazy.

344
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,547
I think, in general,
we worry too much about what we eat.

345
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,134
I've had a Clark Bar
every day for 35 years.

346
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,222
I see you and raise you 20.

347
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
Twenty? What the hell do you have, Jack?

348
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,060
You should fold.

349
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:41,977
[laughs]

350
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,605
I used to be the dresser
for Ms. Judith Light,

351
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,358
who you may not be aware,
is quite the Broadway presence,

352
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,278
despite her well-known TV work.

353
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,032
She could bluff like nobody's business.

354
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,409
Me, I never bluff.

355
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,536
-[both] Mm.
-I hear she's really nice.

356
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,704
-Loves the gays.
-The best.

357
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,666
Yeah. I mean, these are great,
but, uh, what's the sweetness from?

358
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,379
Apple juice. And then I cook them
in my trusty air fryer, with minimal oil.

359
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,716
We love our air fryer. Last night,
I made pork chops. They were to die for.

360
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,675
Don't tell my mother.

361
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,302
-She thinks we're kosher.
-[all laugh]

362
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,181
I should get one for you, babe. They are
essential for the low-carb lifestyle.

363
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,099
[mouths]

364
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,058
That's new.

365
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,768
Still mulling?

366
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,437
-I… call.
-Babe…

367
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,440
-Uh, can I get anybody anything?
-Nope.

368
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,858
Perhaps a Clark Bar.

369
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,735
-[all laugh]
-I will check.

370
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,532
He's real, right? I could not have
concocted a more perfect guy for you.

371
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,368
Such an improvement over Colin.

372
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,621
Finance versus teaching says it all.

373
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,708
The warmest thing Colin ever said to me
was, "Buy Apple,"

374
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,836
which I'd done 30 years ago.

375
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,338
How do you think I paid for the apartment?

376
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,301
My point is.
maybe Luke is your next great love.

00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,845
I… I…

378
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,388
What about you, Jack?

379
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,849
You could still find someone.
Maybe in Miami?

380
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,519
Maybe. But I had it all.
I know the difference.

381
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,731
I'd rather be alone than be
in a relationship just to be in one.

382
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,066
[Jonathan 1] Mm-hmm. Hear, hear.

-Billy.
-Mm?

384
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,485
It's on you.

385
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,863
I call. What do you have?

386
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,947
Full house.

387
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,865
[all gasp] No!

388
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,702
Or, as Judith would say, "Who's the boss?"

[all laughing]

390

This is Stanley's fault.

-How?
-I'm distracted.

392
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,379
Wondering what Stanley's saying
about me to Jerry.

393
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,007
What makes you think
they're even talking about you?

394
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,387
[laughs] The bruise on his face
he said he got from a windstorm?

395
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,556
A spider fell in his lap
in the dressing room,

396
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,642
and he jumped up and he ran into a wall!

397
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,603
Oh my God!

398
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:52,024
He said he almost died
in service to the people.

399
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,026
I can't wait to tell everyone.

400
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,153
Oh, you didn't hear it from me.

401
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,116
And thanks for coming to dinner.

402
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,873
Thank you for such amazing conversation.
Your knowledge of art is… impressive.

403
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,667
Well, my mom taught me everything.

404
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,086
She loves art.

405
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,632
Every weekend,
we went to museums, galleries.

406
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,549
Me too.

407
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,221
It was a way to get lost
in beauty that was so personal,

408
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,473
like looking into an artist's soul.

-Check, please.

It's to you, "babe."

Aah.

All right, I'll see your ten,
and I will raise you 16.

I never thought I'd say this,
but we've gotta go and relieve the nanny.

No. You're so cute.

She used to be an accountant,

456
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,018
but after a pretty serious stroke,
her world flooded with color.

-Yeah.

00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,055
-I'd be happy to.

Oh…

Oh my God!

474
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,371
Oh my God.

475
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,831
Mm.

476
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm.

477
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,838
Mm. I--

478
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,464
I-- I can't. I can't.

479
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,592
I can't meet your mother. I'm sorry.

480
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,010
W-- Why? What happened?

481
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,054
Her paintings are…

482
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,434
The composition is unbalanced.
The scale doesn't go with the subject.

483
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,188
The color combinations are amateurish.
And the whole painting says nothing.

484
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,649
Except maybe, "I can't paint."

485
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,943
I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.

486
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,529
Well, if we're being honest,
I'm not feeling this.

487
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,826
Intellectually, there was an attraction,
but my dick is saying otherwise.

488
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,162
Of course.

489
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,708
You know, we never stood a chance, really.

490
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:24,963
Me being a super successful art dealer
and you a mere telepromptress.

491
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:30,427
But since you're so willing to barter
your rapidly aging boyish good looks,

492
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,596
why don't you try your luck at Gagosian?

493
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,308
Maybe you could blow a dealer there
into thinking your mother has talent.

494
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,102
Oh God!

495
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,319
[Luke] I love your friends.

496
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,945
They're so welcoming.

497
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,947
Especially the Jonathans. Mm!

498
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,450
And Billy seemed very down-to-earth
for a celebrity.

499
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,828
Celebrity might be a reach.

500
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:02,209
More like budding narcissist who's on TV
for five minutes twice a night.

501
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,003
You seem a little tense, babe.
Everything okay?

502
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,130
[sighs heavily]

503
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,966
I don't know. Hmm.
Maybe I'm stuck in my head again.

504
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,721
Well, I will give you a massage
when we're done.

505
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,306
-Mm.
-Get you relaxed.

506
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:17,807
Thank you.

507
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,773
There's something sad about Jack.
I mean, besides losing his partner.

508
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,527
It's like he almost doesn't wanna try
for another relationship.

509
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,613
-[farts]
-Aah.

510
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,531
Anyway,

511
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,284
we should really schedule
a Housewives viewing party.

512
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,953
Not even an "excuse me"?

513
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,665
-What do you mean?
-You just farted,

514
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,250
and you didn't even say "Excuse me."

515
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,753
Is that where we are already,
five days in? Just let 'em rip?

516
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,422
Well, I'm sorry.

517
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,258
Excuse me.

518
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,884
And it's been a week.

519
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,179
-It's not like I don't have a terrace.
-What's the big deal?

520
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,516
The big deal is
that once you fart around each other,

521
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,227
you can see the end of the relationship
around the corner.

522
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,355
Well, I think that's a little repressed.

523
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,567
It just means
you're getting comfortable with someone.

524
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,444
You're a great guy, Luke,

525
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,781
but I don't think I'm ready
to get that comfortable with someone yet.

526
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,450
Okay, what-- what's goin' on here?

527
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,747
I think I rushed into this
because I hate eating dinner alone.

528
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:27,294
And then the frother, and the "babes,"
and the plus-one started stacking up,

529
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,005
and I could feel myself
getting more and more freaked out.

530
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,174
And I tried to convince myself,
mm, that it was just in my head,

531
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,136
but I think that this is all
just happening way too soon.

532
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,765
I can't will myself into a relationship
just because I miss being in one.

533
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,602
Are you breaking up with me?

534
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,105
How can we break up after a week?
We barely know each other.

535
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,982
[clang]

536
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,235
Fine, if you wanna throw all this away,
go ahead.

537
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,323
But you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning
all alone and realize I'm a fucking catch.

538
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,741
You are a catch.

539
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,284
But, Luke…

540
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,869
[sighs] …you're early.

541
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,290
And I think I probably need
to wake up alone for a while longer.

542
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,250
[scoffs] Wow!

543
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,170
Would have been nice
to have known this a little sooner.

544
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,966
But how much time would that have saved?
It's been a week.

545
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,721
I'm taking the frother!

I just bought
the penthouse in your building.

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,649
It's not even on the market.

554
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,152
I told you, Michael,
everything's for sale.

555
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:20,073
Now, do you keep champagne,
or do we have to order in?
