I'm not scared. I can do this.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.520
I'm not scared. I can do this.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.120
(Takes a deep breath)

00:38.680 --> 00:41.120
I'm not scared. I can do this.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.200
- Sorry it took me so long.
- No worries!

00:44.440 --> 00:47.120
You were quicker than ever.
You're getting better at it.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.760
I love you, Little Mouse!

00:49.760 --> 00:51.520
(Loud roadworks)

00:55.520 --> 00:56.840
(Drilling)

00:57.400 --> 01:00.560
<i>Some time ago, during</i>
<i>our Space Dumpster Program,</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:03.080
<i>I promised Parisians</i>
<i>the end of pollution,</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:07.080
<i>and now I'm keeping that</i>
<i>promise with Project Oxygen!</i>

01:09.840 --> 01:13.080
Stop Project Oxygen!
Stop Project Oxygen!

01:13.080 --> 01:15.240
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- Officer Roger,

01:15.240 --> 01:17.240
please deal
with those protesters!

01:17.240 --> 01:20.240
- But they're just kids.
- They're protesters.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.560
- Just do your job.
- Stop Project Oxygen!

01:23.560 --> 01:25.720
Kids, uh, you need to leave now.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.880
We can't, Officer!
This is too important!

01:27.880 --> 01:29.880
They're planning to cut
the trees down!

01:29.880 --> 01:32.840
Yeah, but, ultimately,
there'll be less pollution.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.240
No, that's just
what they want you to think!

01:35.240 --> 01:38.960
Roger! Your job is not to
chit-chat but to maintain order!

01:38.960 --> 01:41.520
Come on, kids,
let's be reasonable.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.960
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- Stop Project Oxygen!

01:46.600 --> 01:48.520
Sorry, kids,
I don't have a choice!

01:48.520 --> 01:50.440
I'm escorting you
home to your parents!

01:51.200 --> 01:53.760
Tikki, what do I do?
Should I transform?

01:53.760 --> 01:56.840
I don't know, Marinette. Usually
the police deal with bad guys,

01:56.840 --> 01:58.920
but Mylène and Ivan
are good guys, right?

01:58.920 --> 02:01.040
- TOM: Marinette!
- I'm going be let again!

02:01.280 --> 02:02.160
Quick, Tikki!

02:04.560 --> 02:07.480
- Marinette Dupain-Cheng?
- Aaah! Present.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.600
Mylène Haprèle?

02:10.320 --> 02:12.280
- Mylène?
- She's not here.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.160
Officer Roger
took her and Ivan home

02:14.160 --> 02:16.200
because they were
holding a sit-in

02:16.200 --> 02:18.160
- and blocking a bulldozer.
- What?

02:18.160 --> 02:20.080
- Huh?
- They must have been protesting

02:20.080 --> 02:22.760
the city's plan to rehabilitate
Place des Vosges.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.840
What does "rehabilitate" mean?

02:24.840 --> 02:28.320
It says Project Oxygen will be
a breath of fresh air for Paris.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.640
A breath of fresh air?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.160
It's weird that Mylène and Ivan

02:31.160 --> 02:32.200
would be against it.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.640
Regardless, Officer Roger

02:33.640 --> 02:35.480
has made a huge mistake!

02:36.240 --> 02:39.000
Miss Bustier?
Is there a problem with Sabrina?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.360
No, your daughter is fine.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.680
But there is a problem
with Ivan and Mylène.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.680
They didn't do anything wrong,
did they?

02:44.680 --> 02:48.000
Well, it's complicated.
I'm escorting them home.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.280
- Just following orders.
<i>- </i>I'm ordering you

02:50.280 --> 02:52.880
to bring them back.
I'm coming to get them.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.520
Follow me. Today's class will be
dedicated to civics education

02:56.520 --> 02:58.320
with real-life experience.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.880
<i>Just because there aren't</i>

02:59.880 --> 03:01.520
<i>any supervillains</i>
<i>attacking Paris</i>

03:01.520 --> 03:03.440
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>nothing super's going on!</i>

03:03.440 --> 03:05.280
<i>We've never seen Miss Bustier</i>
<i>so worked up, so</i>

03:05.280 --> 03:07.520
<i>get ready to see some action.</i>
<i>Stay connected!</i>

03:07.880 --> 03:11.080
The chainsaw will be operated
only by an adult

03:11.320 --> 03:13.560
who's read the manual.
Everything's in order.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.640
- You may proceed!
- Mr Mayor, what are you doing?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.600
I'm rehabilitating
the Place des Vosges.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.040
- By cutting down a tree?
- Yes, but I...

03:23.040 --> 03:24.360
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- Shh!

03:24.360 --> 03:26.600
Uh, Miss Bustier
told me to do it!

03:26.960 --> 03:29.760
- Who pays your salary, Roger?
- You do, Mr Mayor.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.200
- I mean, Paris City Hall does!
- Then you obey me!

03:32.200 --> 03:34.160
Take those troublemakers
back home!

03:34.440 --> 03:37.800
- Roger, don't do this!
- Whose orders should I follow?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.400
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- You see?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.680
I can't rehabilitate in peace!
They're disrupting my ceremony!

03:43.680 --> 03:47.160
That's because your project is
unethical and un-eco-friendly!

03:47.160 --> 03:50.120
- Nonsense! Look here.
- Huh?

03:53.080 --> 03:56.760
<i>Because air is life,</i>
<i>the city is teaming up</i>

03:56.760 --> 03:59.880
<i>with Paris'</i>
<i>most significant investors</i>

04:01.160 --> 04:04.400
<i>to transform pollution</i>
<i>into pure fresh air</i>

04:04.400 --> 04:06.160
<i>that will be sold</i>
<i>in a unique container</i>

04:06.160 --> 04:09.120
<i>designed by fashion mogul</i>
<i>Gabriel Agreste.</i>

04:10.360 --> 04:12.720
<i>Oxygen isn't just</i>
<i>a breath of fresh air.</i>

04:12.960 --> 04:14.480
<i>It's life itself.</i>

04:14.480 --> 04:17.480
WOMAN:
<i>Oxygen. Get a whiff of life.</i>

04:17.480 --> 04:20.040
He is so beautiful...

04:20.440 --> 04:22.640
Uh, I meant,
<i>it </i>is so beautiful!

04:22.640 --> 04:24.720
Your commitment
to save the planet!

04:24.720 --> 04:26.920
Father told me
it was an ad for a new cologne.

04:26.920 --> 04:30.080
So that's rehabilitating?
It actually looks kind of cool!

04:30.080 --> 04:32.680
Yeah! What's not ecological
about it, Mylène?

04:32.680 --> 04:34.120
It's super eco-friendly!

04:34.360 --> 04:37.000
It'll de-pollute the air
in Paris and make it fresh!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
(Sighs) You're being fooled
by pretty pictures!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.360
Shown like that,
Project Oxygen seems great,

04:42.360 --> 04:45.240
but when you look closer at
the details, it doesn't hold up!

04:45.240 --> 04:48.720
In reality, they're cutting down
our best natural filters, trees,

04:48.720 --> 04:50.920
and replacing them
with artificial filters,

04:50.920 --> 04:53.560
their tower,
and making us pay for all of it!

04:53.560 --> 04:56.360
Mr Mayor, instead of destroying
all these trees,

04:56.360 --> 04:59.120
wouldn't it be better
to build more parks?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.240
- Well...
- Who cares about a lame tree

05:01.240 --> 05:03.200
when you can have
a gorgeous container

05:03.200 --> 05:06.000
from Adrikins' Daddy,
Gabriel Agreste, instead?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.960
Besides, there'll be
a tree on the label,

05:07.960 --> 05:09.800
much prettier
than the real thing!

05:09.800 --> 05:12.200
And the floor
will be built with recycled wood

05:12.200 --> 05:14.600
from the trees we cut down.
Very eco-friendly!

05:14.600 --> 05:16.400
And real trees
have to be watered!

05:16.400 --> 05:18.440
Talk about wasting water!

05:19.920 --> 05:23.320
Mayor, perhaps Mylène and Ivan
have misunderstood your project.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.240
Do you really want
to remove the trees,

05:25.240 --> 05:28.000
a cost-free air filter,
and replace them with a tower

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
that will absorb polluted air?
So you can clean the air

05:31.000 --> 05:34.240
and sell it back in plastic
bottles which will become trash

05:34.240 --> 05:36.640
- and pollute our oceans?
- Yes, that's it.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.000
- CLASS: What?
- I mean, no, of course not!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.640
It's not that simple!
Ecology is complicated,

05:41.640 --> 05:43.360
especially
for children your age.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.840
Leave things to the adults!

05:45.120 --> 05:47.640
So, your project is all about
cutting down our trees

05:47.640 --> 05:50.080
- and closing our park!
- And if Mylène and Ivan

05:50.080 --> 05:52.400
are trying to stop this,
we're on their side!

05:52.400 --> 05:55.880
It's true. His solution for
fighting pollution is misguided.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.000
Like so many
so-called miracle solutions

05:58.000 --> 06:00.840
that are supposed to deal with
ecological problems.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.880
But there's never one solution
that can fix everything.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.840
What we need are lots of small
solutions at the same time.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.280
That's why there has to be a lot
of us, all working together.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.600
Good thing you and Ivan
got involved to stop this.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.440
But why didn't you
tell us about it?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.480
The whole class
would've come with you!

06:18.960 --> 06:20.640
We did, Marinette.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.920
We've been demonstrating against
Project Oxygen for six months

06:24.120 --> 06:26.600
and we did everything we
could to get your attention.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.560
We're so sorry!
We were just so busy doing...

06:29.560 --> 06:31.480
I don't know
what it was we were doing.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.560
- We were so lame.
- This is all very touching,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.160
but I've got a project
to launch!

06:36.160 --> 06:43.080
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- Stop Project Oxygen!

06:43.080 --> 06:45.280
<i>Will you let me</i>
<i>rehabilitate in peace?</i>

06:45.280 --> 06:47.160
Tom,
isn't that Marinette, there?

06:47.760 --> 06:49.600
- Mylène?
- What's this clown up to?

06:49.600 --> 06:50.760
Hang on. I'm coming down!

06:51.040 --> 06:52.840
Roger, do something, will you?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.480
To tell you the truth, Mr Mayor,
I've been thinking,

06:55.480 --> 06:57.360
and these kids
are onto something.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.360
You are not paid to think Roger,
but to obey!

06:59.360 --> 07:02.600
Have you lost your mind,
Mr Mayor? These are just kids!

07:02.600 --> 07:04.960
I support my daughter 100%!

07:04.960 --> 07:06.920
No one's messing
with trees on my watch!

07:06.920 --> 07:11.120
I'm trying to help you people!
You're all being ridiculous!

07:11.120 --> 07:14.560
Sorry, Mayor,
but we can't let you do this.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.600
If Adrien wants to save
the trees, we'll save the trees!

07:18.600 --> 07:21.520
<i>Mayor, it seems everyone</i>
<i>is opposed to this project,</i>

07:21.520 --> 07:24.480
<i>including Adrien Agreste, even</i>
<i>though his father is involved!</i>

07:24.480 --> 07:25.760
<i>Are you going to resign?</i>

07:25.760 --> 07:27.480
<i>Yes! I mean, no! I don't know!</i>

07:27.800 --> 07:31.640
<i>- Stop Project Oxygen!</i>
<i>- Stop Project Oxygen!</i>

07:31.880 --> 07:34.200
<i>Gabriel? It's André.</i>
<i>I'm a bit overwhelmed here</i>

07:34.200 --> 07:36.000
<i>with our project.</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

07:36.000 --> 07:38.080
Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll find a way

07:38.080 --> 07:39.560
to change people's minds.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.000
When one fights
for a good cause,

07:41.280 --> 07:44.560
- one always finds a solution.
- (Hangs up)

07:45.520 --> 07:47.800
And if you don't find
a solution, my friend,

07:47.800 --> 07:49.480
destiny will come to your aid.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.080
It's just been confirmed
that citizens

07:57.400 --> 07:59.440
are now banding together
all over Paris

07:59.440 --> 08:02.200
to protect the trees.
What do you have to say?

08:05.080 --> 08:07.120
A powerful man
rendered powerless,

08:07.520 --> 08:09.840
his plans disappear
into thin air!

08:09.840 --> 08:12.200
This calls
for the strongest of actions!

08:18.920 --> 08:24.080
Amok, akuma, go forth
and evilise our dear Mayor!

08:33.440 --> 08:36.320
Malediktator, I am Shadow Moth.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.240
They're challenging
your authority?

08:38.240 --> 08:40.080
Why bother
trying to convince them

08:40.080 --> 08:42.640
when you can make them
change their minds?

08:42.640 --> 08:45.120
I'd like to, Shadow Moth,
but I can't be everywhere

08:45.120 --> 08:47.440
and control
all my fellow citizens at once!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.320
You can't do this alone.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.920
But it's only because
you're lacking a good deputy.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.800
I'm giving you the power to
create your own Sentimonster

08:54.800 --> 08:57.880
to assist you. This will allow
you to be everywhere at once,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.960
and force everyone
to agree with you.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.600
All I ask in return are Ladybug
and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.640
Excellent political strategy,
Shadow Moth!

09:09.040 --> 09:09.880
(Gasp)

09:11.840 --> 09:14.320
Greetings, my fellow citizens!

09:15.920 --> 09:19.520
- By the power vested in me...
- (Screaming)

09:19.520 --> 09:22.240
-...Mega Leech, clone me!

09:25.400 --> 09:28.360
Here I am, my fellow citizens!

09:29.680 --> 09:31.120
Huh?

09:33.200 --> 09:36.280
Ahem! Now, fellow citizens...

09:36.280 --> 09:40.760
- I will be everywhere!
- Everywhere!

09:40.760 --> 09:43.040
Oh! So that's rehabilitating?

09:43.880 --> 09:46.600
En route for clean air,
my fellow citizen!

09:47.840 --> 09:49.720
You've got it,
my fellow citizen!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.680
No!

10:03.800 --> 10:08.000
And, I might add, long live
Project Oxygen, fellow citizens!

10:10.320 --> 10:12.280
Come on! Plagg, claws out!

10:30.640 --> 10:33.040
Oh, I forbid you to touch me,
my fellow citizen!

10:33.040 --> 10:36.720
And I forbid you to forbid me,
Mr Mini-Mayor!

10:37.680 --> 10:39.760
Get Cat Noir,
my fellow citizens!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.480
Malediktators,
seize his Miraculous!

10:42.480 --> 10:44.520
(Battle cries)

10:50.160 --> 10:51.760
I don't know where you are,

10:51.760 --> 10:54.120
but I could sure use
a helping paw, Milady!

10:57.320 --> 10:59.520
- Come on!
- Marinette! We can't stay here!

10:59.520 --> 11:00.560
Follow me!

11:02.520 --> 11:04.000
Come on! We can hide down there!

11:04.280 --> 11:07.760
Oh, yeah, but I... I can't!
I... I'm afraid of sewers!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.080
There's no shame
in being afraid.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.600
I'm scared, too. Of the dark,
of humidity, of germs,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.440
and even mice! I was really
frightened about protesting

11:15.440 --> 11:18.520
this morning,
but I managed to do it anyway.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.680
We've got to escape and find
a way to help the others!

11:21.680 --> 11:23.840
If you ever get too scared,
hold this

11:23.840 --> 11:27.600
and remember fear is a natural
reflex, but you can overcome it.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.120
How am I gonna do this?
Oh! I know!

11:33.120 --> 11:37.120
Oh, no! A Mini-Malediktator!
Get away, Mylène, run!

11:37.120 --> 11:40.960
I mean, help us to de-pollute
Paris, my fellow citizen!

11:43.000 --> 11:45.760
I know. That wasn't very cool,
but I had no choice.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.720
Come on, Tikki. We need Ladybug.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.920
Spots on!

12:03.760 --> 12:05.720
Milady! Thanks for dropping by!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.280
- That was a close one!
- Let me go!

12:08.520 --> 12:10.440
Lucky Charm!

12:15.720 --> 12:17.200
- An ice skate?
- Release me!

12:17.400 --> 12:19.640
You must respect my authority,
my fellow citizen!

12:19.640 --> 12:21.160
I demand that you stop!

12:24.880 --> 12:27.120
You make it look so simple,
Milady!

12:27.760 --> 12:29.760
No more evildoing for you,
little akuma.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.520
Time to de-evilise!

12:39.040 --> 12:41.360
Gotcha!

12:41.360 --> 12:43.120
Bye-bye!

12:43.560 --> 12:46.360
- Miraculous...
- Ladybug, look. It didn't work!

12:48.400 --> 12:51.240
Take their Miraculous,
my fellow citizens!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.880
The akumas and amoks
must've multiplied

12:53.880 --> 12:57.640
at the same time. Capturing just
one doesn't solve the problem!

12:57.640 --> 13:00.920
- There are millions of them!
- So what's the solution?

13:00.920 --> 13:03.040
The thing is,
there's no one miracle solution.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.920
What we need
are lots of small solutions

13:05.120 --> 13:07.560
that can tackle the problem
at the same time.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.640
That's why there has to be
a lot of us, working together.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.920
And I know who can help us.
Buy us some time, kitty-cat!

13:13.920 --> 13:16.920
How come I'm always the one
who has to "buy some time"?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.840
Catch you later! Woohoo!

13:21.520 --> 13:23.880
So, you want my Miraculous,
fellow citizens?

13:23.880 --> 13:26.320
Then come and get it!

13:30.320 --> 13:32.080
(Sobbing)

13:32.680 --> 13:35.600
- Mylène?
- Don't waste your time on me.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.720
This is all my fault!
I wanted to save the trees

13:37.720 --> 13:40.600
and everyone's uprooting them!
If I hadn't gotten involved,

13:40.840 --> 13:43.160
- this wouldn't have happened!
- You're wrong.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.240
You're not the problem.
You're the solution.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.520
You've got great ideas!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.120
Mylène Haprèle,
here is the Miraculous of...

13:49.120 --> 13:52.120
No! I can't be a superhero!
I'm scared of everything!

13:52.360 --> 13:54.320
Look! I have a badge
for my fear of water,

13:54.320 --> 13:58.280
one for my fear of bees, a
necklace for my fear of badges!

13:58.280 --> 14:01.080
Do you realise how many fears
you've managed to overcome?

14:01.080 --> 14:04.520
These objects
are just like the Miraculous.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.480
And you fight every day
to defend a cause

14:06.480 --> 14:07.960
without anyone noticing.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.920
It's like having
a secret identity.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.680
Truth is, you already are
a superheroine.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.120
You just need one last badge.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.560
Mylène Haprèle,
I am proud to entrust you

14:21.560 --> 14:23.160
with the Miraculous
of the Mouse.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.560
You will use it
for the greater good.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.440
- Boo!
- Aaah!

14:35.440 --> 14:38.080
- (Laughs)
- Mullo, that's not nice.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.920
True courage
is not the absence of fear,

14:40.920 --> 14:43.440
it's persevering
even though you're scared.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.240
You only have to say one thing.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.160
Mullo, get squeaky!

15:10.200 --> 15:11.400
Wow!

15:11.760 --> 15:13.560
With you here,
I know that we can do this!

15:13.560 --> 15:16.520
This'll help you tear
the Mini-Malediktators' sashes!

15:16.520 --> 15:19.240
You'll release the amok
and akuma from all of them

15:19.240 --> 15:21.800
by calling upon your power
of multiplication!

15:21.800 --> 15:24.280
But what about the Sentimonster?
It'll just clone more!

15:24.280 --> 15:26.960
Free them,
I'll deal with the Sentimonster!

15:26.960 --> 15:29.080
- How will you do that?
- We need a lot of people

15:29.080 --> 15:32.920
- to take on the problem!
- That's what I always say!

15:33.160 --> 15:35.320
I told you,
you have great ideas!

15:41.720 --> 15:44.120
It's the only way
to spread your powers around!

15:44.120 --> 15:47.080
- You're scared, but you can --
- Overcome my fear

15:47.080 --> 15:48.640
and go on despite it. I know.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.840
I'm not scared. I can do this.
I'm not scared. I can do this.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.160
I'm not scared. I can do this!

15:56.160 --> 15:58.400
Multitude!

16:12.440 --> 16:14.880
- Stop Project Oxygen!
- Nothing will stop it!

16:21.560 --> 16:22.600
Where is my... ?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.680
Aaah!

16:36.920 --> 16:39.240
What am I doing here?
Who are you?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.040
Why are we all so little?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.120
It's all good,
we've got some back-up now.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.960
I've got her,
my fellow citizens!

16:47.200 --> 16:50.320
Bravo, Malediktator!
Take her Miraculous!

16:51.200 --> 16:52.440
Yoohoo!

16:53.960 --> 16:54.840
Aaah!

16:59.680 --> 17:01.480
Milady? What just happened?

17:01.480 --> 17:04.040
You were under the control
of a mini Malediktator!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
And you really need to work
on your jokes.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.000
Aaah!

17:09.080 --> 17:12.200
- I gotta buy some more time?
- I must gather the team up.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.920
Hey, guys, wait up! Group pose!

17:32.440 --> 17:34.960
Pegasus, teleport Vesperia!

17:34.960 --> 17:35.840
Voyage!

17:39.600 --> 17:40.480
Venom!

17:49.160 --> 17:50.240
You're up, Ryuko.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.000
Wind Dragon!

18:02.760 --> 18:04.520
Carapace!

18:04.520 --> 18:06.040
Shell-ter!

18:08.720 --> 18:10.680
Time... to...

18:12.240 --> 18:14.480
de-evilise!

18:18.120 --> 18:19.280
Bye-bye!

18:25.640 --> 18:27.640
Thank you, Ladybug.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.120
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:36.480 --> 18:39.000
- Ugh!
- Pound it!

18:47.640 --> 18:49.840
Mr. Mayor,
this is a magical charm.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.800
It'll protect you from becoming
Shadow Moth's victim again.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.520
Thank you, Ladybug.
I really am so sorry.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.120
It's a good thing
you were here to protect Paris.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.960
I'm still worried
about something.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.080
- What about Project Oxygen?
- Well... uh...

19:03.080 --> 19:06.240
It'll have to be re-examined by
a commission of experts, but...

19:06.240 --> 19:08.240
We are counting on you
to do the right thing!

19:19.080 --> 19:21.280
You've been incredibly
courageous today.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.680
You should be proud of yourself!
Bug out!

19:26.080 --> 19:29.880
Thanks to your allies, you stole
my victory from me today.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.800
But I'm already marching
towards the next battle,

19:32.800 --> 19:35.960
and, this time,
I'll be the victorious one.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.400
(Evil laugh)

19:39.400 --> 19:42.520
Parisians, I have heard
the voices of our young people.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.840
They are our future!

19:44.120 --> 19:46.280
A future where
the Place des Vosges will remain

19:46.280 --> 19:48.680
and the trees
will continue to clean our air!

19:48.680 --> 19:49.840
(Cheering)

19:50.200 --> 19:53.360
This shovel will be operated
only by an adult

19:53.360 --> 19:55.720
who's read the manual.
You may proceed.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.760
On behalf of your constituents,
I'd like to thank you

19:58.760 --> 20:00.720
for the wise decision
you've just made.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.360
I only did what was right,
Miss Bustier!

20:03.680 --> 20:05.920
Congrats, Mylène.
You and Ivan won the battle!

20:06.160 --> 20:07.720
We all won together, Marinette.

20:08.080 --> 20:12.160
(Groans) Goodness, it really is
quite difficult to plant a tree.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.720
We'll help you, Mr Mayor.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.720
It's good
we finally opened our eyes,

20:15.720 --> 20:18.200
though you looked<i> gorgeous</i>
in that commercial.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.000
- What was that?
- Nothing!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.880
I just said it was great
we all opened our eyes

20:22.880 --> 20:25.120
to the complex problems
hiding behind that...

20:25.120 --> 20:27.240
gorgeous commercial!
That's what I meant.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.920
Not at all what I said before!
(Nervous laugh)

20:34.400 --> 20:36.880
Adrien! You took a stand
against me today.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.480
I didn't take a stand
against you, Father.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.560
I took a stand against
a project that was bad for Paris

20:42.560 --> 20:45.040
- and for the planet.
- Adrien, go to your room.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.960
Yes, Father.
