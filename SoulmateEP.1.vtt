00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.539
Hello mom, what are you doing?

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.257
I’m working, what’s up?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.395
I will go to stay at our old house on next week, can I?

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:13.312
Sure

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.205
Are you going alone or with someone?

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.963
No mom, I will go with my friend

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.524
Friend or girlfriend?

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:24.526
No mom!

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:25.612
So can I ?

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:29.367
Yes of course, I’ll tell the housekeeping to clean up

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.004
Awww, who's mom? The cutest in the world

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:39.297
Stop sweet talking, I’ll go back to work now

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.914
Okay mom, bye

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:52.593
P’James

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:53.118
Yes

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:54.377
You used to live in this house before?

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.501
Yeah

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.285
Oh, at that time I was...

00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:00.477
Hey! Stop talking here, it’s really hot

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:03.522
Go go, let’s talk inside

00:01:25.363 --> 00:01:26.730
Is it your old house?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.342
Yes

00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.468
Oh, when do you live here? What year?

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.221
I stayed here since I was a kid

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.137
Until finished high school

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.749
Are you serious?

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:43.799
I moved to this village when I was in a high school, my house is at the end of the alley

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.811
Hey, stop joke with me

00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:49.311
I am telling you the truth

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:50.946
I’m still surprised, can't believe it.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.588
Why we haven’t met?

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:56.481
Ummm, what is your high school name?

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:57.891
I studied at R.M.

00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.952
I see, different schools

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:03.170
But why we haven’t met each other

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:06.368
I think so, why?

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.889
But I’m not a friendly person

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:12.325
After finishing the classes

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:15.031
I don’t like to hangout with friends

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:19.264
Maybe we have met before

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.574
But I can’t remember

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:49.469
You just think that because of the destiny made us meet

00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:57.120
Are you blushing?

00:03:57.847 --> 00:03:58.877
What?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.583
You’re blushing

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:03.091
What are you saying?

00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:05.339
You are blushing

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.426
See, you have a red face

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:08.780
Stop saying that

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:10.059
Ok

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:14.314
You’re blushing

00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:16.455
I’m not!

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:19.227
You’re blushing right now

00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.143
Nope

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:21.609
See see see, blushing

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.140
 Stop teasing me

00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:26.886
And hurry up, how can I where your room is

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.926
Because you’re blushing then walk so fast as always

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.806
You keep being like that when blushing

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:34.916
Blushing so much, you have a red face now

00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:37.527
P’James

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.027
Yes

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:38.777
Do we have any plans today?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.773
You didn’t tell me where we gonna go?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.451
Don’t wanna go today

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.091
I

00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:47.014
just want to stay with you

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:53.345
But stay together, just two of us

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:56.238
What we should do?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.164
Do

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.093
The cooking

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:03.399
I’m hungry, it’ll be evening soon

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:08.170
But I know what are you thinking

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.654
Stop it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.077
What am I thinking?

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.100
How can you know?

00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:18.597
I may not think like you say

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:22.196
Good for that

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:24.349
So what we gonna eat?

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.219
Ummm

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:28.007
 What should we eat?

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:31.616
Did you ordered food?

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:35.876
No, I will take you to the market

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:37.205
Really?

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:37.952
Yes

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.046
Let me check who’s coming

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:51.380
Mom! How come?

00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:58.324
Mom, why didn’t you tell me

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.267
So I can’t come here?

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:01.646
For surprise!

00:06:02.252 --> 00:06:05.253
So, where is your girlfriend?

00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:08.816
Oh no no, your friend

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:11.801
Let’s see, I bought many things for her

00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:15.425
The smell of the perfume is really perfect!

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:19.730
Body lotion for a good skin and moisturizer

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.370
Banana, I bought this for you, it’s your favorite

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.526
Of course you can’t live without, pineapple from Nong fruit shop

00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:37.894
Drink easily, tasty? I can confirm, drink this to have a smooth skin

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.680
Yes mom

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.613
Why did you bought so much?

00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:47.102
How can you know those things are important for a girl

00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:50.840
I afraid that your girlfriend has forgotten to bring them
103
00:06:50,840 --&gt; 00:06:52,912
So I bought them for her

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:53.756
So where?

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:57.247
Where is your girlfriend?

00:06:57.247 --> 00:06:58.500
I want to see her

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.475
Mom

00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:01.411
Mom, Hello

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:03.913
Oh, hello Sky

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:06.759
Didn’t come with girlfriend?

00:07:07.244 --> 00:07:11.690
No mom, no girlfriend I just took Sky with me

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.853
I see

00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:13.590
That’s it

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.525
So have you eaten yet guys?

00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:20.091

00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:20.846

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:22.564
Sure mom, let me help you

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.410
Sky, how was your college?

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:41.909
It’s good auntie

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.663
I have P’James to help me when I don’t understand something.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.504
You’re look cute like your mom, don't have a girlfriend yet?

00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:57.198
Mom, you don’t have to ask him

00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.287
I’m so handsome but I still don’t have.

00:08:00.554 --> 00:08:04.270
So How can Sky have, look at his face you asked the wrong person

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:06.722
I just wanted to know

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:12.647
So I’ve been waiting for James to graduate

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:17.440
I want to have grandchild

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.513
Mom, why are you in a hurry

00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:24.755
I just finished my internship

00:08:25.022 --> 00:08:28.152
When I have or who is that person you'll gonna know

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:32.731
I just asked for 10 20 years more

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:36.809
If something happens, I won’t be able to see my grandchild

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.019
Right, Sky?!

00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:39.215
Yes auntie

00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:40.420
What are you talking about?

00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:43.463
Let’s eat

00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:46.399
This is your favorite vegetable, morning glory

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.807
Take it, more and more

00:08:49.146 --> 00:08:50.182
Here you are

00:08:50.182 --> 00:08:53.919
You should eat, not me

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.485

00:08:54.485 --> 00:08:55.983
Eat this one

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.992
This vegetable, for you

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.751
Mom

00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:02.303

00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:03.811
It’s yummy right?

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.396
Sure

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:05.392
Where you bought it?

00:09:05.392 --> 00:09:06.809
The same restaurant

00:09:08.918 --> 00:09:10.026
Joo’s restaurant

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.439
Auntie Joo bad cooking for vegetable

00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:12.925
Sky, eat lots of food son

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.027
Yes auntie

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.478
Your mom really wants to have a grandchild

00:10:13.187 --> 00:10:14.422
Don’t think too much

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:20.883
If I have a chance I’ll tell mom about us

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.880
But I understand your mother

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:38.543
 But I’m lucky that my mom understands me

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:46.607
You’re so lucky that your mom can understand you

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.775
Don’t be stressed, I believe that your mom will understand you

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.000
Damn, you’re so cool

00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:15.032
It’s normal

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:36.673
Enough

00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:37.203
What?

00:11:37.203 --> 00:11:38.373
Go and take a bath

00:11:38.373 --> 00:11:40.013
Just a second more

00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:42.156
Go to take a shower now

00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:43.258
Hurry up

00:11:43.622 --> 00:11:44.412
Okay

00:12:08.462 --> 00:12:09.604
Hello

00:12:11.058 --> 00:12:11.962
Hello

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.525
Hello, one moment please, there is no signal

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:39.629
Sky, why is it too fit?

00:12:40.332 --> 00:12:42.354
The last time wasn’t fit like this

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:03.220
Sky

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.401
Sky

00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:07.250
What?

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:10.168
You wanna lay down here?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.383
See, it’s really soft

00:14:17.225 --> 00:14:18.549
Here’s so soft too

00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:22.092
Where, let me check

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.139
Ummm

00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:29.602
It’s not bad

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.400
But your cheeks are softer
185
00:14:40,885 --&gt; 00:14:43,948
Always taking advantage huh

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:53.127
Sky, your cheeks are soft

00:14:53.878 --> 00:14:56.361
But I have something that gets hard

00:15:02.397 --> 00:15:05.952
Here, my muscles

00:15:05.952 --> 00:15:08.785
So hard and strong

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:11.185
Ahhhh

00:15:11.185 --> 00:15:16.209
Oh, shaggy armpit hair, how can you live like this?

00:15:19.506 --> 00:15:22.249
I thought you're going to like my muscles

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.503
When we get back to Bangkok I’ll take you to do something

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.460
Do what? I don’t want it

00:15:26.848 --> 00:15:30.085
Do laser your armpit, I used to do it, it didn’t hurt

00:15:30.085 --> 00:15:32.224
It hurts for sure

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:33.825
Do not be a childish thinking.

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:38.209
Why? Are you so gross?

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.758
Only this

00:15:41.503 --> 00:15:42.488
Grossl of what?

00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:45.127
My son, James

00:15:48.521 --> 00:15:49.533
What’s this?

00:15:50.187 --> 00:15:50.808
No

00:15:52.626 --> 00:15:53.308
James

00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:55.524
Get out
