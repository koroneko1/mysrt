<i>‎Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.860
<i>‎But there's something about me</i>

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.460
<i>‎Because I have a secret.</i>

‎♪<i>‎ Miraculous! Simply the best! </i>‎♪

‎ <i>‎Alya's on the line</i>
<i>‎I rise and shine</i>

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540
<i>‎When I pick up the mic</i>
<i>‎like this game is mine</i>

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.540
<i>‎Fake MC's can't test my flow, 'cause I</i>
<i>‎whip up their beat with each word I throw!</i>

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.220
<i>‎Uh... The name's Marinette.</i>
<i>‎I bake chouquettes.</i>

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020
<i>‎I love drawing and... sewing blankets?</i>

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.980
‎Er... heh, heh, heh!

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.660
‎-Come on! Come on!
‎-Uh...

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.180
<i>‎</i><i>‎50 Words! Your flow's</i>
<i>‎so low you'd need a shovel to dig it!</i>

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.500
‎-Shoot! I'm so bad at this game!
‎-Humph!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
‎-You don't want to play with my sisters?
‎-I'm not a baby anymore!

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.740
‎Can I play<i>‎ Freestyle Clash 2</i>‎ with you?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.220
‎Come on, Chris, it's a game for big kids.
‎You know that.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.940
‎That's what you always say!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.660
‎Ugh! Again? Alya,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.460
‎can you handle these three
‎on your own?

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.580
‎I just remembered I promised my dad
‎I'd try out his new macaroon recipe!

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.420
‎Mmm! Sounds yummy!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.540
‎Maybe we could all come over,
‎if that's OK.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.180
‎Oh, yeah! I mean, no!

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.220
‎Dad's always super shy
‎when he tries out a new recipe,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.540
‎like "Oh! What if it doesn't taste good?"

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.580
‎OK, catch you later,
‎best BFF in the world!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.220
‎That macaroon recipe excuse wasn't
‎exactly your best one yet, Marinette.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.820
‎I know, but I'm running out of excuses!
‎I've needed so many this week.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.780
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.380
‎ Ladybug! Cat Noir!
‎If you don't give me your Miraculous,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.420
‎this "pigeon iron"
‎will crash down on the Louvre pyramid

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.780
‎and give all the tourists inside it
‎perfectly flat socks!

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.980
‎Pigeons have a right to culture too!
‎Rooh, rooh, rooh, rooh, rooh!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.940
‎Hey there, Milady! No need
‎to brief you on this one, right?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.500
‎ Nope. Let's just end this fast,
‎like the last 23 other times!

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.260
‎Lucky charm.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.300
‎Cataclysm.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.060
‎ No!

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.300
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.580
‎Please don't tell me it happened again!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.220
‎It's OK, Mr Ramier. We'll always be
‎here to bring you back to the good side.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.540
‎Hmm. Oh!

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.060
‎Can I buy you both ice cream
‎to make up for it?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.420
‎Since we keep getting better at this,
‎we have a few minutes before we transform.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.700
‎Why not?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.020
‎I'm really sorry. I just can't help it.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.620
‎Whenever something happens to my pigeons,
‎it breaks my heart and--

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820
‎And Hawk Moth akumatizes you again.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.940
‎There must be some way to make sure
‎this doesn't keep happening!

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.940
‎-We gotta get going.
‎-Thanks for the ice cream!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.860
‎This man is hopeless.
‎I've akumatized him 24 times

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.060
‎and not once has he come close
‎to succeeding.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.460
‎Nooroo, dark wings fall.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.580
‎Oh! What is this?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.620
‎A powerful negative emotion!
‎I've never felt this before!

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.020
‎Where could such energy be coming from?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.100
‎Pound it!

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.060
‎Yo, yo!

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.300
‎ <i>‎I'm Timetagger</i>
<i>‎from the future, man!</i>

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.180
<i>‎I crisscross time</i>
<i>‎with a spray-paint can!</i>

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.180
<i>‎Looks like your time's up at last!</i>

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.020
<i>‎'Cause I'm gonna send you</i>
<i>‎way back into the past!</i>

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.020
‎"Lord Ramier Featherbottom,
‎knight of the King,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.380
‎founder
‎of the Order of the Great Pigeon?"

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.020
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha! Whoo!

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.580
‎-Only one minute left!
‎-No time to lose!

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.100
‎ <i>‎Ladybug and Cat Noir, now you're</i>
<i>‎stuck! If you wanna catch me, good luck!</i>

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.300
<i>‎All I have to do is go back in time</i>

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.380
<i>‎to escape</i>
<i>‎with a laugh and a rappin' rhyme!</i>

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.260
‎-He's travelling through time!
‎-And therefore in space!

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.900
‎I just love his style!

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.060
‎I'm not surprised you like it, Hawk Moth.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.780
‎I come from the future, a future
‎where Ladybug and Cat Noir are adults.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.620
‎It was future Hawk Moth's slick idea
‎to send me into the past,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.580
‎to seize their Miraculous
‎before they got adult powers.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.460
‎I can only approve of my future decision!

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.580
‎I won't wait for Ladybug and Cat Noir
‎to become adults!

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.380
‎I'm counting on you to change the future,
‎Timetagger!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.900
‎If you don't give me your Miraculous,
‎I'll send everyone into the past.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.620
‎-Unlike him, we're running out of time!
‎-Then we'd better try to gain some back!

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.820
‎Ha, ha, ha!
‎Superhero babies need a little rest?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.860
‎Well, take your time!
‎I have eternity ahead of me.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.220
‎If we can't defeat Timetagger
‎in the future when we're adults,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.700
‎how are we supposed to defeat him now,
‎when we're younger and less experienced?

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.740
‎There's a time for everything, Marinette.
‎Every problem has a solution.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.060
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.140
‎Yeah!

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.180
‎Look on the bright side, Adrien.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.860
‎In the future,
‎you and Ladybug still know each other!

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.780
‎Yeah, but if I want to see that future,
‎we'll have to defeat Timetagger today.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.100
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.220
‎-Crazy! So the message was for real!
‎-What message?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.060
‎This watch has been in my family since
‎forever. It's never chimed until today!

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.980
‎-And there was a message for you, Ladybug.
‎-Huh?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.300
<i>‎Nice work, Minibug. You're right on time.</i>

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.300
<i>‎Now, dig as deep as you can into the past</i>
<i>‎and you will find the rabbit's burrow.</i>

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.500
‎Dig deep into the past?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.500
‎Did you also inherit a shovel
‎to go with your watch, by any chance?

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.420
‎A shovel, you know?
‎For all this deep digging.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.260
‎Of course!
‎What's the oldest exhibit in the museum?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.820
‎The Egyptian collection!

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.460
‎My old man says it dates back
‎more than 5,000 years.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.860
‎There! It sounds hollow!
‎Do your thing, kitty!

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.700
‎Cataclysm!

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.860
‎Minibug! Kitty!
‎I knew you'd solve my riddle!

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.140
‎A security measure,
‎in case the watch is stolen!

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.540
‎But now, I need to do
‎something very important.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.780
‎My name's Bunnyx. In the future, I'm a
‎member of Ladybug and Cat Noir's team.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.220
‎Well,
‎the Ladybug and Cat Noir you'll become.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.780
‎Right now, you two
‎are more like Minibug and Kitty Noir!

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.260
‎Within the team,
‎I am the hero of "the last chance."

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.820
‎I'm called upon when everyone else
‎has failed. That includes you two.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.220
‎Hey! We just got you out of the stone,
‎didn't we?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.020
‎You must have failed too!

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.700
‎Yes. Well, no. It was actually your fault.
‎Or, more precisely, it will be.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.620
‎In the future,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.580
‎one of your cataclysms
‎will accidentally damage my Miraculous.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.300
‎So Timetagger will be able to send me
‎to Egypt and get me stuck in stone.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.140
‎Wait. Then how are we gonna do that
‎without the Rabbit Miraculous?

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.300
‎-Do you have the watch?
‎-My watch?

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.860
‎Yes. My watch. Our watch.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.980
‎-So this was a Miraculous?
‎-In camouflage mode!

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.380
‎Fluff, counter clockwise!

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.980
‎-But... you are...
‎-So, mini-me, you get it now?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.460
‎You're me and I'm you. Well, more
‎precisely, I'm you when you grow up.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.820
‎Wow! I can't believe how cool
‎I'm gonna be when I'm older.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.780
‎But, wait, it doesn't make sense!
‎I never gave you... I mean, her...

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.940
‎I mean, I never gave
‎either of you the Miraculous!

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.660
‎You haven't given it to us yet, Minibug,
‎because you haven't yet realised

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.300
‎just how awesome I really am.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.860
‎But don't worry, you will, one day.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.300
‎I'm gonna get a Miraculous. So cool!

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.140
‎Fluff, snack time!
‎You have to recharge your batteries!

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.020
‎Mm. Was that breakfast or dinner?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.420
‎What time will it be yesterday?
‎Is it tomorrow?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.980
‎The day after tomorrow,
‎it'll be yesterday again!

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.380
‎That Miraculous is so powerful!
‎Why don't we use it more often?

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.580
‎Travelling through time
‎is very dangerous.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.780
‎Interfering with events
‎can have serious consequences.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.220
‎Oops! Time to feed my kwami too!

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.460
‎I don't understand.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.220
‎If you're from the future,
‎you must know how this ends!

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.460
‎Your younger self has seen it, so you
‎obviously know how to defeat Timetagger!

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.460
‎Actually, I've spent so much time in stone
‎I can barely remember!

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.180
‎But the logical thing to do would be
‎to take Timetagger back to the future,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.260
‎so he can be defeated by heroes
‎his own size! I'll take care of this.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.300
‎Awesome!

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.220
‎One thing I remember for sure is...

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.740
‎Mini-me has to be there
‎when I defeat him!

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.580
‎If she's still in my memory,
‎she must play a vital role!

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.460
‎Good! I wasn't planning
‎on sitting on the bench!

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.700
‎Fluff, clockwise!

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.780
‎Huh? Guys,
‎you should take a look at this now!

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.740
‎Timetagger's sent Jagged Stone
‎into the past! Oh!

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.700
‎That's Nadia Chamack!

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.140
‎ André Glacier!
‎ Mayor Bourgeois!

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.500
‎He's destroying our present
‎by rewriting the past!

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.420
‎Bunnyx,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.140
‎since the future me wasn't able to stop
‎Timetagger, I must not be that powerful.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.900
‎Are you kidding? You're... I mean,
‎you will be an awesome team leader,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.660
‎the greatest superhero ever!

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.740
‎-How do you explain Timetagger then?
‎-I told you earlier.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.380
‎If Cat Noir hadn't cataclysmed my
‎Miraculous, Timetagger wouldn't be here!

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.660
‎In the future, you've defeated
‎Doctor Sadness, the Invaders,

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.260
‎Pain and Tears,
‎the Twin Queens of the Inner Dimension,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.860
‎Ignoblia the evil sister of Majestia,
‎so believe me,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.540
‎you won't be intimidated by Timetagger!
‎Oh, I even forgot Monsieur Rat!

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.020
‎Monsieur Rat?

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.100
‎You can always count on Ladybug.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.500
‎With her around,
‎every problem has a solution.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.500
‎-How will I ever get to be like that?
‎-By growing up, Minibug.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.340
‎Tell me, Bunnyx, in the future,
‎are Ladybug and I, like...

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.900
‎Cat!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.100
‎Oh! You and her, it's always more like...

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.660
‎Hey! The future isn't set in stone!

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.860
‎OK, let's go!

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.700
‎We've taken too long. He's had time
‎to weave a giant time web around us.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.540
‎Surrounded by just one guy?

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.460
‎Does that mean
‎he can attack from anywhere?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.100
‎More like from any time.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.540
‎ <i>‎Give me your Miraculous, don't</i>
<i>‎make me ask! You're not up to the task!</i>

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.340
<i>‎When I bring them to Hawk Moth's door,</i>
<i>‎Ladybug and Cat Noir will be no more!</i>

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.980
‎Stay where you are! I'll deal with him
‎and take him back to the future you!

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.500
‎It means nothing must happen to you
‎in the meantime. But first...

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.100
‎Stay right there. Then it'll be exactly
‎like it was in my memory. And now...

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.220
‎burrow!

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.140
‎Yes! Heeya!

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.340
‎Missed me!

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.740
‎-She doesn't need to transform back?
‎-No, because she's an adult!

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.660
‎Awesome!, I can't wait to grow up!

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.580
‎I don't think we're quite
‎up for the job yet, Cat Noir.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.100
‎ <i>‎You're lame, you don't get the game!</i>
<i>‎Now you have to start all over again!</i>

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.180
‎My victory is close at hand.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.100
‎How brilliant of me to send myself
‎such a powerful ally from the future!

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.780
‎Where's your sass gone, now, Fluffytail?

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.140
‎I can't stand watching him
‎play cat and mouse.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.060
‎Cataclysm!

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.940
‎Cat Noir, no!

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.860
‎Aaah!

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.380
‎See? In the future, that's exactly
‎how you damaged my Miraculous!

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.620
‎I knew it! I knew you'd do that!
‎Who's the best now, huh?

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.420
‎That... that's impossible...

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.820
‎Thanks for your involuntary help.
‎Now, Bunnyx is going home!

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.660
‎Bye, Bunnyx!

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.460
‎Wait a second!
‎This is not the exact right moment!

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.100
‎Enjoy your trip to the Ice Age,
‎Fluffytail!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.260
‎We've wasted enough time!
‎Gimme your Miraculous now!

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.380
‎So, the Ice Age
‎wasn't good enough for you?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.540
‎Back to the Cretaceous, then!

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.380
‎-Down, Denver!
‎-Wanna keep playing, Fluffytail?

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.220
‎Don't call me Fluffytail!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.740
‎To the future! Seventh interstellar war!

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.820
‎ <i>‎Disintegrate! Disintegrate!</i>

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.260
‎Maybe we should give her a hand
‎after all.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.660
‎You heard her. She's the only one who can
‎solve this time problem! Go Bunnyx!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.580
‎The heat is on!

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.420
‎Sorry, Minibug... I just can't.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.380
‎Looks like this time
‎I don't have a solution after all.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.820
‎What if today's the day we grow up?

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.420
‎Lucky charm!

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.500
‎-A block of paper?
‎- Ha, ha, ha!

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.140
‎What are you gonna do with that?
‎Sign a defeat treaty?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.260
‎Now give me your Miraculous, or I send
‎your friend back to the Big Bang!

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.740
‎All right! You win!
‎We'll give you our Miraculous!

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.740
‎All I ask is that you give me
‎a little bit of time to write a letter

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.020
‎to apologise to my future self!

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.860
‎No! Think of something!
‎You always think of something!

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.380
‎Fair enough, Ladybug. Wish granted!

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.100
‎Be careful. It could be a trap!

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.740
‎If she thinks she can trick me,
‎she's wasting her time! Pun intended.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.660
‎Ha, ha, ha!

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.700
‎I don't have a pen.
‎Could anyone lend me one, please?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.380
‎Time's up.
‎My moment of victory has arrived!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.300
‎I can't find the words.
‎It's pointless anyway.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.340
‎I won't even be a Ladybug in the future

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.460
‎after we give up our Miraculous.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.140
‎Please don't do this, Minibug!

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.580
‎Some problems don't have a solution.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.340
‎Go back to your timestream.
‎Make the most of your remaining time.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.620
‎No! I refuse, I...

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.300
‎Who's the team leader in the future?

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.380
‎Trust me.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.460
‎OK, Ladybug.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.940
‎Burrow!

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.940
‎Come on, Cat Noir.
‎We'd better give him our Miraculous.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.820
‎I'm sorry, Ladybug. I didn't deliver.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.180
‎Not true, Bunnyx. You didn't fail.
‎Every problem has a solution.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.660
‎The future bird catches the worm.
‎This time, the Miraculous are mine!

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.740
‎You're right on the first count,

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.420
‎but not on the second,
‎the Miraculous are not for you.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.700
‎What?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.300
‎Ha, ha, ha! I said I was sent

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.420
‎by the Hawk Moth of the future,
‎but I never said it was you.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.900
‎Your earrings are mine, Babybug.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.540
‎And you, Kitty Noir, cataclysm this

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.340
‎so I can take you ring safely

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.060
‎after I'm finished with her.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.220
‎Good boy!

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.740
‎ No!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.420
‎Cat Noir!

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.620
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.620
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.660
‎Gotcha!

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.100
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.940
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir?
‎You're so young! Where am I?

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.460
‎The question should be
‎more like when are you?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.660
‎Come on, Chris. Let's go home.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.500
‎Chris?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.300
‎See, girl? We did it! We always will!

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.420
‎Hey, Future Ladybug!
‎When am I gonna get my Miraculous?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.860
‎As soon as you're as cool as I am,
‎Mini-me.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.100
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.220
‎Why doesn't anyone tell me
‎how awesome I am?

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.100
‎Because you already know you're the best,
‎Kitty Noir!

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.420
‎ I think
‎we're gonna have to hurry, Bugaboo.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.740
‎-Are we gonna see each other again soon?
‎-No doubt about that!

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.900
‎ Pound it!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.580
‎Nooroo, dark wings fall.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.220
‎-Master, I....
‎-Quiet, Nooroo.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.820
‎If I'm not Hawk Moth in the future,
‎then that means I've failed.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.500
‎Or that you've succeeded.
‎The future is not set in stone, Gabriel.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.020
<i>‎-</i><i>‎ </i><i>‎Hey, there!</i>
‎-Alya, it's Marinette.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.420
‎I'm sorry I can't help you
‎look after Chris and your sisters.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.940
‎I haven't finished my presentation

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.180
<i>‎for Monday.</i>
<i>‎I hope you're not mad at me!</i>

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.420
‎No biggie.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.140
‎A friend said she'd do it.
‎Nino and I are going to a movie!

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.620
‎-A friend?
<i>‎-Yeah. Don't worry.</i>

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.940
<i>‎-She'll take care of everything.</i>
‎-Perfect! Enjoy your movie!

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.380
‎See you later!

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.900
‎-OK! We're going!
‎-Thanks again, Lila!

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.980
‎Do I know how to play Freestyle Clash?
‎Please. I invented Freestyle Cash!

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.540
‎-Whoa! For real?
‎-Of course, for real! I never lie!

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.020
‎You're so cool!

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.700
‎ I'm so sorry.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.100
‎Don't worry. Every problem has a solution!

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.700
‎We didn't discover it today,
‎but we will next time!

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.940
‎Pigeons in Paris have it too hard here.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.300
‎Maybe you should move to the suburbs

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.100
‎or try to make friends
‎with some other type of animal.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.260
‎A goldfish, for example.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.700
‎Another type of animal?

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.180
‎That might be a good idea, Cat Noir!
‎I'll think about it.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.220
‎OK, we have to get going.
‎Thanks for the ice cream, Mr Ramier!

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.380
‎Everything Bunnyx told us seems crazy.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.780
‎All those supervillains with weird names,
‎like Dr what's-his-name and Monsieur Rat!

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.660
‎Monsieur Rat.
‎What kind of a codename is that?

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.020
‎Maybe, in the future, you might even
‎agree to go see a movie with me.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.460
‎Hey, what if it was

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.460
‎in the very near future, huh?
‎Like the next showing?

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.820
‎Oh! What are you? Hello, cutie!

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.460
‎You're even cuter than a pigeon!
