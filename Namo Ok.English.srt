1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,625
Think of it as a symbol of good faith.

2
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:41,333
Now I'm here to contribute
to the enlightenment

3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,750
of the Buddhist sermons,

4
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,458
which are both questions and answers

5
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,666
that complement each other.

6
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,416
-What was it?
-I don't know.

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,166
What the...?

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,541
Oh!
A monk! I thought you're a man.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,125
Are you crazy, granny?

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,916
A monk is a man.

11
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,125
What is a monk doing around here?

12
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,208
Are you a real monk?

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,833
Yes, I'm a monk.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,083
I swear.

15
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,291
Sis, who was struck by lightning?

16
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,708
A foreigner or a monk?

17
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,000
A foreign monk, I guess.

18
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,083
Three times in a row?

19
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,541
Bang. Bang. Bang. Seven times!

20
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:01,708
You're exaggerating.

21
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,791
Save your breath if you're clueless, Tu.

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,708
Where's the monk
who got struck by lightning?

23
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,708
Didn't he get burned to ashes?

24
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,250
PETCHARAT HOSPITAL

25
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:15,541
Alas, he's lying dead
in front of the room.

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,333
Father, there you are.

27
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,833
It's good you're here.
I'm at my wit's end.

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,125
What's the matter?

29
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,916
I've got a patient here. He's a monk.

30
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,208
He was struck by lightning.

31
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,250
Seems like he doesn't remember anything.

32
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,958
I've diagnosed him.
I think he's got amnesia, Father.

33
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,541
Is he able to communicate with you?

34
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,208
Please go talk to him, Father.

35
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,208
Come this way.

36
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
How are you? What's your name?

37
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,541
Can you speak Thai?

38
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,375
You can speak Thai.

39
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,875
This way, Father.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,166
You two are getting along well.

41
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,375
Do you remember anything?

42
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,541
Can you remember your own name?

43
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,833
No?

44
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,333
It's all right
if you don't remember anything.

45
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,791
Come stay with me at the temple.

46
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,666
Father?

47
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,125
Be kind. Be kind.

48
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,833
Great. I'll leave him with you.

49
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,625
You look better, Steve.

50
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,750
Are you calling me Steve?

51
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,875
I saw "Steve" tattooed on your arm.

52
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,708
The patient in the VIP room
needs extra care.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,541
I'm leaving now.

54
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,916
I'll see you out, Father.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,416
-Bless you.
-Good bye.

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,875
Thank you for taking care of me.

57
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,708
Thank you. My pleasure.

58
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,666
Thank you so much.

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,291
Oh god!

60
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,375
We're in trouble.

61
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,666
We're here.

62
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,041
Welcome to our temple.

63
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,666
Please.

64
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,666
This place is so nice.

65
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,666
I like it so much.

66
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,125
What kind of monk is he?
I don't trust him.

67
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,916
He doesn't have any monk identification.

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,416
What if he's a fiend?

69
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,166
Perhaps it's true like you said.

70
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,041
So you understand what I mean.

71
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:47,833
So Vinai, I'll let you mentor Monk Steve.

72
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's see if he's a real monk or a devil.

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,458
Athai, come here.

74
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,541
Is that the foreign monk
that was struck by lightning?

75
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,083
It's him.

76
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,458
He's got amnesia.

77
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,333
But I don't know if he's faking it.

78
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,750
I don't trust him.

79
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,750
From now on, your job is

80
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,875
To keep an eye on Monk Steve.

81
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,000
If you see anything suspicious,
report it to me.

82
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,083
You've got it. Right on.

83
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,250
Are you seeing it?

84
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,208
Almost.

85
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,541
Dear Lord,

86
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,791
-I'm seeing it.
-What are you doing?

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,666
My Buddha!

88
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,333
All right. What can I do for you?

89
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,458
I bid you farewell. There's nothing.

90
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,041
Why did you scream, Athai?

91
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,083
Brother, you scared me.

92
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,000
Is that the foreign monk
that was struck by lightning?

93
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,333
Yes.

94
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,958
What are you doing, Steve?

95
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,041
Helping the villagers scratch this tree.

96
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,583
People here must love trees,
so they put a powder on them.

97
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,416
Only at the beginning
or middle of the month.

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,958
The tree is called
the beginning-middle of the month?

99
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,791
No, it isn't.

100
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,375
Forget it.

101
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,916
So how are you doing?

102
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,958
Do you remember anything?

103
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,958
That's all right, at least

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,333
you know that you're a monk.

105
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,375
By the way, what's like being a monk?

106
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,791
What is it like to be a monk?

107
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,583
What is it like to be a monk?

108
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,541
How to become a monk?

109
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,166
You did wrong from the first day.

110
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,125
Did I do something wrong?

111
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,625
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,916
It's good
that you acknowledge your offence.

113
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,750
Come. Confess your misdemeanors.

114
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,250
OK.

115
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,875
But who's Miss Demeanor?

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,833
Monk Steve, confessing one's misdemeanor‚

117
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,041
is when a monk did wrong and admits it.

118
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,000
He'll confess his guilt to a senior monk

119
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,708
and promise not to do it again.

120
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,208
I've got it.

121
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,416
But what did I do wrong?

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
You hugged the nurse tightly.

123
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,500
Listen to me. According to the Tripitaka

124
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,291
which collects 84,000 Bhuddhist sermons,

125
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,958
It is clearly stated that

126
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,250
a monk that touches
even a finger of a woman,

127
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,958
is committing an offense.

128
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,000
But that nurse wasn't a woman.

129
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
He's a ladyboy.

130
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,750
Although not a woman physically,
her heart is.

131
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,791
You're wrong anyway.

132
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,583
So can I hug a tomboy?

133
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,125
That's wrong too. A tomboy is a girl.

134
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,583
Although she's a woman physically,

135
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,916
her heart isn't. So I can hug her.

136
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,083
Am I staying here?

137
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,083
Yes.

138
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,583
Where's the refrigerator?

139
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,875
Where can I take a shower?

140
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,583
Any water heater here?

141
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,125
Brother.

142
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
Would you like to get
some breakfast coupons too?

143
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,708
It'd be great.

144
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,333
What time do I have to check out?

145
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,750
Stop acting funny.

146
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,500
This is a temple, not a hotel.

147
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,458
By the way, watch out for tonight.

148
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,125
What?

149
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,083
Father Mitr,
the former owner of this room.

150
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:56,666
I think he's pretty possessive.

151
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,166
Where's Father Mitr?

152
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,291
He's dead.

153
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,416
Dead?

154
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,708
Dead.

155
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,000
Where are you going?

156
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,000
You are‚

157
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,708
I'm Monk Noi, Monk Steve.

158
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,458
Will you go asking for alms?

159
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,708
What's asking for alms?

160
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:07,791
It is giving Buddhists a chance
to make a merit.

161
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,625
Saving mankind from sin.

162
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,333
Can you keep it short?

163
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,333
Ah, it's when we have breakfast.

164
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,083
I'll go with you. I'm hungry.

165
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,458
What is it like to be a monk?

166
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,833
How can we become a monk, Monk Steve?

167
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,833
Are you asking me?

168
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,333
I think being a monk is to have no hair.

169
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,750
No hair?

170
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:38,000
You have no hair.
Neither I nor Father has hair.

171
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,708
Monks have no hair. Right?

172
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,708
No hair. No him.

173
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,375
No us.

174
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
It means we let ourselves on.

175
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:57,333
Vinai, the villagers were here yesterday
scratching trees to get a lottery hint.

176
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,458
I've warned them many times,
but they never listen.

177
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,291
Why are they so stubborn?

178
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,958
You'd better be strict with them.

179
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,791
Come on.

180
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,916
You. You. You!

181
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,791
Can I change my room tonight?

182
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,833
I saw a ghost last night.

183
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,833
What ghost?

184
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,875
The ghost of Father Mitr. So scary.

185
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,000
Steve, ghosts do exist.

186
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,708
But they only exist in your imagination.

187
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,208
Get back in the line. Go on. Hurry up.

188
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,458
Father Mitr isn't dead yet.

189
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,500
He left and got married
in Japan two months ago.

190
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:27,458
Ayu Wanno Sukkhang Palang.

191
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,208
If you can't give a blessing, just mumble.

192
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,250
OK.

193
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,208
Mumble.

194
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,541
Mumble.

195
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,041
Ayu Wanno Sukkhang Palang.

196
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,166
Good grief! The monk's eating a banana!

197
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,166
Shut your mouth!

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,416
You can't eat with an alms bowl in hand.

199
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,916
What did I do wrong? I don't get it.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,375
It isn't proper.

201
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,041
Monks can only eat in the temple.

202
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,625
We must have self control.

203
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
Why are monks
forbidden from doing many things?

204
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,625
I don't understand.

205
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,666
To restrain themselves from desire.

206
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
Desire is a temptation.

207
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,250
Steve, do you see that?

208
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,000
That muzzle on the dog's mouth

209
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,083
is for quenching the dog's desire.

210
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,583
Desire is hard to quench.

211
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,666
A muzzle's on that dog's mouth

212
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,166
because that dog bites.

213
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,666
Other dogs are without muzzles.

214
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,958
They bite no one,
so they need not be restrained.

215
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,416
But I don't wanna bite anyone.

216
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,875
Hello, Kat. How are you, gorgeous?

217
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,208
When will you come to Petchburi?

218
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,125
Could you afford to look after me?

219
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,750
You'll never guess how much I eat.

220
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,750
My dad is calling me. Bye bye.

221
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,541
You lie to her that you're rich.

222
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,083
If she was, what would you do, Jack?

223
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,875
I will...

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,333
ask my mom for money.

225
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,291
Fat chance.
She's as fierce as a rottweiler.

226
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,791
Look.

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,333
I've got an idea.

228
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,708
Jack would like to be ordained.
I take him to your care.

229
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,958
If he has a strong will,

230
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,375
I can't object to his intention.

231
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,541
It's a good thing that Jack
wants to be ordained for his mother.

232
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,541
What about you, Toh?

233
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,708
I want to get married in a group.

234
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,458
I mean I want to be ordained in a group.

235
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,000
Hurry up, Father.

236
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,666
The host has called us many times.

237
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,708
Who's inviting us in, Mr.Pang?

238
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,166
All of a sudden.

239
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,083
It's Mr.Tang. I don't dare to refuse him.

240
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,041
Brother, hurry up.

241
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,708
You don't need to come.

242
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,666
You can't pray even a single chapter.

243
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,791
What did I do wrong?

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,083
Why can't I hang out with you guys?

245
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,333
Hang out?

246
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,875
The invitation
is to be out visiting laymen.

247
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,125
Let's go, Father.

248
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,041
Monk Steve,
stay here and watch over the temple.

249
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,916
When I'm back
I'll tell you about the invitation.

250
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,125
OK.

251
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,083
Brother. Father. Aren't we going now?

252
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,666
We'll be late.

253
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,166
That's right. To keep the host waiting is

254
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,333
Not a good idea!

255
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,958
Stay here and clean up the toilets.

256
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,625
They invited monks, not novices.

257
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,916
Here come the monks. I'd better go now.

258
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,000
Kluay!

259
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,708
Father, seeing you here

260
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,958
makes me so glad.

261
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,125
What drama are you trying to start? Hmm?

262
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,458
I'm dying.

263
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,666
Now that I'm dying,

264
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,083
I'd better die with these three monks.

265
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,666
Always think of death.

266
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,291
Careless people
are those who are already dead.

267
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,708
Here you are, Father.

268
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,958
I'm just a Brother.

269
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,541
Please pass it to him.

270
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,666
You don't need to give us
the money right now.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,541
You can give it to us
after we finished preaching.

272
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,625
It isn't money.
I think you should read it.

273
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,208
Bad guys' lives don't end nicely.

274
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,041
Stop running on the treadmill
and your life will be torn.

275
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,666
Don't tell me...

276
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,750
That's right. A bomb.

277
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,166
If he stops running, he'll die.

278
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,916
Now that I'm dying,

279
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to cling onto your yellow robes
and go to Heaven with you.

280
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,375
Mr.Tang,
where did you get this belief from?

281
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,125
Do you really need three robes
to cling to?

282
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,125
One isn't enough.

283
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,041
I have a lot of bad karma.

284
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,333
Why didn't you stop to think of them?
Now you’re scared.

285
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,875
I don't think it's a monk's business.

286
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,000
Nor is it mine.

287
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,833
Father!

288
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,583
I give up.

289
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,291
Now that I'm dying,

290
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,583
I'd better die with these three monks.

291
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
Calm down, mister.

292
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,125
Nice guys finish last. Bad guys win.

293
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,625
Think of good deeds that you did.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,416
Thinking of them will give you energy.

295
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,791
I tried, but I can't think of any.

296
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,583
Think of something simple.

297
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,416
Such as stopping
for old people crossing the street.

298
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,333
I hit and killed them.
They blocked my way.

299
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,291
Have you ever
given your leftovers to dogs?

300
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,916
I don't even give them bones.
I chewed them down.

301
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,875
He's so blackhearted.

302
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,958
A bad guy like this should be dead.

303
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,541
Kluay!

304
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,291
Are you nagging me?

305
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,708
Boss!

306
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,666
What are you yelling for?

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,333
I can hear you from the outside.

308
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,291
-Father, Good morning.
-Wow, you're being so polite.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,750
A bomb...

310
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,416
Bomb? Are you nuts?

311
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,625
You worry so much that
you've become paranoid.

312
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,583
Why did you involve monks
in your nonsense?

313
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
You'll go to hell.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,291
Why are you leaving this on?

315
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,250
-When you...
-No!

316
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,583
How many times have I told you

317
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,958
If you finish using it,
you need to pull the plug.

318
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,791
You're wasting energy. Got it?

319
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,458
-Got it?
-All right.

320
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:03,166
Now that there's nothing else here,
We're leaving.

321
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,625
Or we'll run late for the meal time.

322
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
Goodbye.

323
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,750
Hurry up.

324
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,875
Just a threatening letter.
What are you so scared of?

325
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,958
Why shouldn't I?

326
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,458
It said there's a bomb
under my treadmill.

327
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,625
This is another letter.

328
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,583
What's this?

329
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,666
If you stop moving, it'll go ka-boom!

330
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,333
Your very bad deeds will break you down.

331
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,083
Sometimes, being close to death

332
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,333
is a good mental practice,
don't you think?

333
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,500
But I think it's too exciting.

334
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,500
It's not a good idea.

335
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,833
Father!

336
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,916
Father!

337
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,208
Father! Wait for me.

338
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,750
Why are you following us, Mr.Tang?

339
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,250
How could I not?
The bomb is under my shoe.

340
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,750
A bomb!

341
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,000
Pang, drive faster. Faster.

342
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,416
Brother Vinai and Brother Noi,
you're impatient.

343
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
I guess they're afraid
they'll be late for the meal time.

344
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,541
Damn you, Tang!

345
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,166
-Father?
-I'll have to confess my misdemeanors.

346
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,833
Please give me your yellow robe,
so I can cling onto it and go to heaven.

347
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,083
Pick up the yellow robe.

348
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
Step on it. Don't be slow.

349
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,791
Father, this is the fastest I can drive.

350
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,166
It's your order, Father.

351
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,666
Do you have any good spell
you can perform?

352
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,333
-Spell.
-Spell?

353
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,250
All right, Mr. Tang.
Put your palms together.

354
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,416
Raise your hands.

355
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,416
All right. All right.

356
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,833
Share loving kindness.

357
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,666
Pang, drive faster.
There's a bomb with him.

358
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,083
Mr.Tang's got a bomb?

359
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,500
Brother! Brother!

360
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,375
So long.

361
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,291
It's beeping again.

362
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,833
-Father!
-That's great.

363
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,083
Stop the truck!

364
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:52,791
There's an example.

365
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
Is that Tang?

366
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,000
Is he being chased by a dog?

367
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,291
-Hurry up, Pang.
-Father!

368
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,416
Those are monks.

369
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,291
Is that the charity run?

370
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,875
What happened?

371
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,041
Wait for me.

372
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,166
Why don't you stop?
I'm calling you right now.

373
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,375
That's Mr.Tang.
What happened? Why is he running?

374
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,625
Brother!

375
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,166
Let us go.

376
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:28,208
Keep running!

377
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,166
Here, some water.

378
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,416
Who said people here hate me?

379
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,750
I have a bomb tied to my shoe
and they're running after me.

380
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,625
Stop. Stop. Stop.

381
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,083
There's a bomb in his shoe.

382
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,958
Where are we going now?

383
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,041
Bye for now.

384
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,166
Brother, I have to excuse myself.

385
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,125
Bye bye, sir.

386
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,583
Did you have fun hanging out?

387
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,000
Not at all. We barely survived.

388
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,166
The world is ruled by Karma.

389
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,583
Father!

390
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,708
Karma is following us. Monk Vinai! Father!

391
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,750
Father!

392
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,958
Father, please be merciful.

393
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:47,916
I think

394
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:52,291
We should stay apart for a while, Mr.Tang.

395
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,541
How could you say so?

396
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,625
You're a monk. Why are you so heartless?

397
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,041
Nice shoes.

398
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,458
I like them. They have lights too.

399
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes, lights. I like them too.

400
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,083
How did you take my shoes off?

401
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,625
Perhaps they're running out of batteries.

402
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,916
Let me change the battery for you.

403
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,583
No!

404
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,750
You can leave them right there.

405
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,333
It's just a fake bomb.

406
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,416
Bastard! Who played this trick on me?

407
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,875
If I knew who you were, I'd kill you.

408
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,708
Mr.Tang, you should improve yourself.

409
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,916
Avoid things that are not good.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,916
Yeah? Stop talking!

411
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,500
Are you afraid of dying, sir?

412
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,000
Kluay, why are you saying that?

413
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,416
Who isn't afraid of dying?

414
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,416
I've got a solution.

415
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,750
What solution?

416
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,791
If you're scared
that someone will kill you,

417
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,583
you have to kill yourself first.

418
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,833
Bastard!

419
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,750
You're advising me to kill myself?
Are you nuts?

420
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,041
Well,

421
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,791
I mean you should kill your old self.

422
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,458
And act as a new person.

423
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,791
Well said.

424
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,625
But I can't do it
because I'm not an actor.

425
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,208
I used to be an actor.

426
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,833
What proof do you have?

427
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,041
Do you remember last Chinese New Year?

428
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,458
Last Chinese New Year?

429
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,625
The ghost of your father.

430
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,541
The day that my papa's ghost
possessed you?

431
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:24,458
He didn't just pay a visit.
He ate all of my food offering.

432
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,666
Kluay, what's wrong with you?

433
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,375
Bastard!

434
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,916
You ungrateful child.

435
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Papa?

436
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,541
Yeah. You snaggle-tooth.

437
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,583
Yes, it's Papa.

438
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,666
You never make any merit for me.

439
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,875
It's not that I never do. I have no time.

440
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,125
How much have you got?

441
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,666
Well... well...

442
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,333
This is all I've got.

443
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,166
Five grand?

444
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,041
I'll take this money
to make merit for myself.

445
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,250
But it's not enough to go to Heaven.

446
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,083
Not enough? Here you are.

447
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,250
Petchaboon ring. Sweet.

448
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,208
Watch.

449
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,125
Here's my watch.

450
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,166
There are seven levels of heaven.
Your necklace.

451
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,375
Are you making merit or buying a car?

452
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,041
Here.

453
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:11,541
Hey?

454
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,583
You fooled me.

455
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,458
That's awesome.

456
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,458
You're a genius.

457
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,541
-I'm a genius, right?
-Yes.

458
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,500
-I'm so awesome, right?
-Yes.

459
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,125
I want you to pay attention to my acting.

460
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,083
That isn't important.

461
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,291
Give me back my money.

462
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,000
It's for showing respect to your teacher.

463
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,416
Waste no more time.
We should get started now.

464
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,833
Madame.

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,916
I'm hungry.
I haven't eaten anything yet, Madame.

466
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,250
Please have mercy on me.

467
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,083
Think of it as merit making, madame.

468
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,125
Please.

469
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,583
Wait for me right here.

470
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,625
I wish your next life
will be full of happiness.

471
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:04,125
Eat it quickly.
My husband is coming home.

472
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,000
My husband is heartless.
He only has bad karma.

473
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,375
I always make merit whenever I can,

474
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,750
hoping that my merit will go to him.

475
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,958
Hurry up and eat.

476
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,416
It isn't that easy.

477
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,291
If you're really hungry,
you will eat it like this.

478
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,375
Kluay, why did you do that?

479
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:33,541
Master taught me to do this.

480
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,666
You know that he doesn't like beggars.

481
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,041
He hates them like poison.

482
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,875
He said beggars weren't really hungry.

483
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,958
If he's really hungry,
he will eat it off the floor.

484
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,291
Both of you are psychos.

485
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,125
Look at him.
How could you? It's so filthy.

486
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,416
Dogs walk in and out here.

487
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,000
Not to mention shoes.

488
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,333
Master taught me to do this.

489
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,708
Do you wanna have a problem with him?

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,666
Will you give it to me or not?

491
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,416
I'm asking you nicely. Don't irritate me.

492
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,833
Mr.Tang.

493
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:24,666
I can't give the thing you asked.

494
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,625
No, it isn't true.
Why can't you give it to me?

495
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,625
Why don't you come here
to talk with me yourself?

496
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,750
Father, don't change the subject.

497
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,166
Everything in the temple
was made with my money.

498
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,625
That's mine.

499
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,833
This is mine.

500
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,166
This is mine too.

501
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,708
That's a septic tank.

502
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,791
I'm claiming it too!

503
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,541
Mr.Tang,
if you make merit just to show off,

504
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,916
That isn't real merit.

505
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:58,125
If you do bad deeds
but try to conceal them,

506
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,416
that's real sin.

507
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,916
I know that you have a lot of good stuff.

508
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,375
The only good stuff that I have

509
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,333
is dharma.

510
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:11,625
Dharma is what will protect you.

511
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,083
Not amulets.

512
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,041
Can you stop barking?

513
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,541
Mister. Mister.

514
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,500
Shut up!

515
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,958
Damn you! I will take you down.

516
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,583
Mister. Mister.

517
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,541
I'm sorry, Father.

518
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,291
This isn't our business.

519
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,500
I have to excuse myself. Bless you.

520
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,166
Bless you is for monks to say.

521
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,000
Right, Father.

522
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,791
Bless you.

523
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,333
Do you have an M-16?

524
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,291
I'll shoot them all.

525
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,125
Are you shooting monks, sir?

526
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,375
I'll shoot these dogs.

527
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,166
They barked too much. It's annoying.

528
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,375
Let's go.

529
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:07,375
The two-digit prize. The numbers are

530
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,625
One-Four

531
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,416
I lost again.

532
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,250
It's 14. Right on.

533
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,166
It isn't a big deal that I didn't buy it.

534
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,166
But why didn't you buy it?

535
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,083
That banana fell on your palm.

536
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,833
Who said I didn't?

537
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,791
So you won the lottery?

538
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,916
I did, but I didn't reverse the numbers.

539
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,916
I bought 41.

540
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,083
Monk Steve, please eat a lot.

541
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,666
Yes, eat a lot. Lots of good food.

542
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,625
It's from KFC.

543
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,833
I have to thank you, Monk Steve,

544
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:21,208
for making me win the lottery.

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,833
Thank you so much.

546
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,625
Monk Steve.

547
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,208
Eat a bit of everything,

548
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,833
so that everyone's faith
is equally recognized.

549
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,000
Satu.

550
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,916
He enjoys spicy food.

551
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,625
Eating in Laman style,

552
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,708
Not holding onto sight, taste, or smell.

553
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:45,791
It's delicious.

554
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:09,416
Dharma tastes like the food you ate.

555
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,208
It isn't good
to eat food that's too spicy.

556
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,833
It isn't good
to eat food that's too sweet.

557
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,750
Whether it's sour or salty,
it needs to be put just right.

558
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,750
That's the taste of dharma.

559
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,000
It's called the middle path.

560
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,041
The path of dharma

561
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,583
makes me feel nauseated.

562
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,875
Damn. How did he do that?

563
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,125
What's the matter with you, Athai?

564
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,041
Yeah, yeah, Monk Steve...

565
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,708
-He threw me on the floor!
-Brother Steve.

566
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,041
I scolded him, but he didn't listen.

567
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,500
What's more amazing is that
I dropped the plates

568
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,916
And Monk Steve caught them like this.

569
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,750
A moment ago, I threw a rock at him.

570
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,833
And he caught it.

571
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,125
Is it true?

572
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,666
Yes.

573
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,666
Are you sure?

574
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,333
See it for yourself.

575
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,458
Athai, you said he could catch it.

576
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,833
I have no idea.

577
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,000
That hurts. Are you trying to kill a monk?

578
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,583
Monk Vinai, Monk Noi.

579
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,250
I remember now.

580
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,875
Is your memory back?

581
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,083
I remember that I'm a foreigner.

582
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,666
He just remembered it now?

583
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,791
And he even called himself "I".

584
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,500
Boss, how many times did I tell you

585
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,708
that you shouldn't eat carelessly?

586
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,666
Why?

587
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,250
You know that someone wants to kill you.

588
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,041
This is dangerous.

589
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,000
You won't know if it's poisoned.

590
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:56,041
Damn it. You're rational.

591
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,125
Where would I be, if you died?

592
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,625
Let me die first.

593
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,166
You're so awesome.

594
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,458
I've hired the right man.

595
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,000
Don't be courteous with me, sir.

596
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,375
We should start with this thigh.

597
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,250
How is it?

598
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,208
It's a left thigh.

599
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,083
It's surely safe.

600
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,291
If it's deadly,
you'll be the first one to die.

601
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,666
Definitely, sir.

602
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,708
I love you like a father.

603
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:31,041
This is a bone.
You can have it. It's calcium.

604
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,625
I'm eating bones.

605
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,791
You're pleasing me.

606
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,833
Once in a while,
we have a meal together. We're all happy.

607
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,208
Do you normally eat chicken's ass, Master?

608
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,000
Chicken's ass? No.

609
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,875
It's full of shit.

610
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,000
Neither do I. Here you are.

611
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:48,833
-Meat?
-Ass.

612
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,291
You can keep it for yourself.

613
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,291
If it comes through,
my stomach will be so light.

614
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,791
Awesome.

615
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:03,583
Boss, have I ever failed you?

616
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,958
You know that I've closed many hard deals.

617
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,500
Give me more time.

618
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,541
I won't let Tang go.

619
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,291
I've been following him for so long.

620
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,500
Don't make me stop now.

621
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,958
I'm getting close to him.

622
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,375
I promise

623
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,750
I'll close the deal as fast as I can.

624
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,500
Are you trying to take me down?

625
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,208
No way. I'm not stupid.

626
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,000
Did you see that killer?

627
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,458
Damn it.

628
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,333
This is what I wanna see
from my bodyguards.

629
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,333
You all lay down quickly.

630
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,666
Get up.

631
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm asking you
if you saw that bold killer.

632
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,666
No, sir.

633
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:03,250
There's no fan in the toilet?
You're sweating.

634
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:05,500
I eavesdropped on him.

635
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:09,000
Damn it. I heard it with my own ears.

636
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,916
He said he wouldn't miss this time.

637
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,291
Soon...

638
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,791
He'll kill me.

639
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,875
Mhuay?

640
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,250
You've been on a school break
quite a while now.

641
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,583
You said you're coming home.
Why aren't you here yet?

642
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:21,791
I've been back a while.

643
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,166
But I don't wanna go home.
I'm fed up with you.

644
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,291
You're back but you're fed up with me?

645
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,083
Where are you now? Who are you with?

646
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,250
I'm at the temple, practicing dharma.

647
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,416
You're at the temple?
What are you doing there?

648
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,750
Mhuay. Mhuay!

649
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,916
Mhuay, come here.

650
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,958
Papa, what's wrong with you?

651
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,333
I should be asking you that.

652
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,500
You said you'd come home
during the school break.

653
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,708
I won't.

654
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,958
I said go home. It's dangerous outside.

655
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,333
How can I be safe staying at home?

656
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,583
Papa, look at yourself.

657
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I think you need to come
to the temple sometimes.

658
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,208
I said go home.

659
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,166
I won't.

660
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,833
Mhuay,
this is your dad ordering you to go home.

661
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,000
-I won't.
-you have to.

662
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,041
-I won't.
-You‚

663
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,000
All right, I will.

664
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,166
What's the matter
with this father-daughter pair?

665
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,708
I just want him to come to the temple.

666
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,916
So that he'll get close to dharma.

667
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,416
Look at how he behaves lately.

668
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,541
He's gone too far. He disguises himself.
We barely recognize him.

669
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Hurry up. It's getting dark.
I'm going home.

670
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,333
-My mom must be waiting for me.
-Come.

671
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,625
Here.

672
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,125
So what's your plan?

673
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,500
I haven't chatted with Kat for many days.

674
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,458
To make her believe that you're rich,

675
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:58,000
At least you'll need
a cool phone to show her.

676
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,250
Where do you think
I can get the money?

677
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,583
We've become novices
but haven't gotten any money.

678
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:05,833
I asked my mom,
but she just bawled me out.

679
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,125
What's up, novices?

680
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,541
How much is it?

681
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,083
Five baht each. It's pork.

682
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,666
Well‚

683
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,250
I'm very hungry.

684
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:30,958
Oh.

685
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,166
Ayu Wanno Suphan.

686
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,375
Thank you.

687
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,416
Well,

688
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,208
did you see what I saw?

689
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:42,791
How are you doing, Monk Steve?

690
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:45,750
What rule did you break today?

691
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,958
No. Nothing.

692
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,291
Want some?

693
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,916
One stick has five balls.
One-five, five-one.

694
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,000
Did he eat them all at once?

695
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,625
No. He ate three balls in one bite.

696
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,708
Are you sure? My wife will kill me.

697
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,458
Three balls in one bite.
two more sticks. Ten Baht.

698
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,375
You're nuts!

699
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,416
I have to confess again?

700
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,958
You did wrong. You have to.

701
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,875
What did I do wrong?

702
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,750
I ate inside the temple,

703
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,333
not outside.

704
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,500
You just ate meat balls, didn't you?

705
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,708
The mealtime is over.

706
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,458
Water is the only thing you can drink.

707
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,041
I didn't know that.

708
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,708
How could you not know?

709
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,000
You never told me.

710
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,625
I got it.

711
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,125
I was wrong because I didn't know.

712
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,291
People who do not know
are certainly not wrong.

713
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,916
Who said?

714
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,583
Monks here.

715
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,750
So did I do wrong?

716
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,875
Mr. Jobs,

717
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,250
If it's possible,
I'd like to have an iPhone.

718
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:04,625
If I get an iPhone, I will

719
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:06,625
run naked around the temple.

720
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,166
Amen.

721
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,666
The last three digits... Fourth round.

722
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,125
The numbers are

723
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,416
Three-Five-One.

724
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,791
The numbers from Monk Steve's hint.

725
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,250
I won the lottery!

726
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,458
I won the lottery!

727
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,708
-Did my wife win it?
-I don't know.

728
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,583
I think there will be only us
going out for alms.

729
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,666
Because Father Tee's a bit ill.

730
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,500
Ill? What?

731
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,333
He's caught a cold. He's sick.

732
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,375
Monk Steve, lead the way.

733
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,041
Am I leading you?

734
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,250
Go.

735
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,125
Monk Noi, stay behind.

736
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Is that a good idea?

737
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,791
At least I can watch
and save him from misbehaving.

738
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:55,583
Wait.

739
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,083
I know that you want it.

740
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:02,791
Here's your new mobile phone.

741
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:09,375
Damn it.

742
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:10,875
Ifong?

743
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:17,041
Ayu Wanno Sukkhang Palang.

744
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,250
Ayu Wan--

745
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:45,041
Wanno

746
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,708
Sukkhang

747
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Palang!

748
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,250
-Brother, please be invited.
-Brother.

749
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,583
Please give us a blessing too.

750
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,875
Ayu Wanno Sukkhang Palang.

751
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,041
Sappei Sapta Avera Honetu.

752
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:16,916
May you find happiness. Don't commit sin.

753
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,208
Sappei Sapta.

754
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,708
Brother, please be invited.

755
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,291
Oh god!

756
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,916
I'll miss you everyday.

757
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,083
I'd ask you to miss me every night.

758
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,375
I'll miss you every moment I'm awake.

759
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:35,000
I'll miss you every single night.

760
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:39,208
Continue your rhyme later at the temple.

761
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,916
Brother, won't you bless us?

762
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:44,916
Hello, Kat.

763
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,500
I'm on my private beach right now.

764
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,500
You said you would come here
for a vacation.

765
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,583
The sea here is beautiful.

766
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,291
You can wear a bikini and swim here.

767
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,416
Really? Pick me up tomorrow.

768
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,375
What?

769
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,000
Tomorrow?

770
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,750
I'm kidding.

771
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,833
Maybe next month.

772
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,666
Jack, I don't like liars.

773
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,125
Well...

774
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,208
Toh, you chose the background
near the chapel?

775
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,291
Me?

776
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,666
I...I...I...

777
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,583
I had to be ordained for my mom.

778
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,125
But I didn't mean to lie to you.

779
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:42,000
I have always dreamed of
a good guy who's into dharma.

780
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,250
And you are a grateful child.

781
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,458
See you later.

782
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:53,291
Mercy. Do a merit with this blind man.

783
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,500
I'm not here to plead to you.

784
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,708
Here we go.

785
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:02,166
I haven't eaten anything.
I've gone hungry.

786
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,208
Oops. Oops. Oops.

787
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,625
Aoi, are you bullying me?

788
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,958
If you wanna pretend to be a blind man,

789
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,458
you need to bump around
to make it look real.

790
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,458
Mama, are you playing along with him?

791
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,916
It's your dad's idea.

792
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,083
Don't talk so loud.

793
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,083
Mhuay, I don't know who wants to kill me.

794
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,666
But I do.
People collected money to kill you.

795
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,625
They all hate you. Don't you realize?

796
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,708
Mhuay, what did you say?

797
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,666
Ask them if you don't believe me.

798
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,625
Why do you have to come here?

799
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm here to find out
if they hate me so much.

800
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:53,875
I don't think you should risk it.

801
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,875
Stand still and you won't get hurt.

802
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,416
Are you guys Papa's henchmen?

803
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
That's right, Miss.

804
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:01,958
Please come home with us.

805
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,000
Get off me!

806
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,875
Miss, don't struggle. Go!

807
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,125
I'm pregnant.

808
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,041
Huh? You're pregnant?

809
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,208
Yes. If I miscarry, it'll be your fault.

810
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,041
Uncle, is that Mr. Tang?

811
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:22,666
Yes. It's that damn Tang!

812
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:25,333
Uncle, why did you say his name like that?

813
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,750
He always says that.

814
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,375
Uncle, he's my boss.

815
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:30,666
Cover for me.

816
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,875
-How could you call him so?
-Good job.

817
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,916
He's like my second dad.

818
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's right.

819
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,750
Kluay, you've been working with Tang.

820
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,541
Don't you know how fake he is?

821
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,541
He's only good to the people
he can benefit from.

822
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,250
Cheats in the rice-pledging scheme.

823
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,208
He's a loan shark.

824
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,791
He cheats dogs.

825
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,333
He cheats beggars.

826
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,583
Bastard!

827
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,166
I've heard many people
wanna take Tang down.

828
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,375
Huh? She's pregnant while in the temple?

829
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:02,916
What did you say?

830
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,541
Miad called me and said

831
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,291
A girl that's practicing dharma
at the temple

832
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,666
announced that she's pregnant.

833
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,208
Who got her pregnant?

834
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:12,000
Don't tell me it's some monk!

835
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,416
Bastard!

836
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Girls these days are liars.

837
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,041
-Spoiled.
-Right.

838
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,708
They don't care to study.

839
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,916
Their parents must be bad‚

840
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and don't teach them.

841
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,041
The whole family are bastards.

842
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,458
What?

843
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:28,791
Hello?

844
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,541
I can't hear you.

845
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,041
Huh?!

846
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,250
Mhuay's pregnant?

847
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:54,208
What's this?

848
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,083
-Papa!
-Yeah. Go!

849
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,250
Where are we going?

850
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,041
Where, Papa?

851
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,041
Stop talking.

852
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,458
Mhuay.

853
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,666
For goodness sake, my child.

854
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,708
You've just come here and you're pregnant?

855
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,250
Never mind, Papa.

856
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:14,958
Who is the baby's father?

857
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,291
Some temple boy?

858
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,041
No.

859
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,250
Don't tell me that...

860
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,041
it's a caretaker.

861
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,291
Papa, it's nobody. I was just kidding.

862
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:29,750
Kidding?

863
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,708
I kidded with your mom and got you.

864
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:38,375
Watch me. I'll drag him out,
the father of your baby.

865
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,041
Is it you, Monk Vinai?

866
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,875
I used to have faith in you.

867
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,208
I'm so disappointed with you.

868
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:54,375
It isn't Monk Vinai.

869
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,583
What proof do you have?

870
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,208
It's definitely not Monk Vinai.

871
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:06,208
Recently he was bitten by ants.

872
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,708
What?

873
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,333
They are swollen.

874
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,583
What are swollen?

875
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,875
Testicles.

876
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,083
Swollen testicles.

877
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:16,875
Father,

878
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,125
I think you'd better see a doctor now.

879
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,166
You can't make anyone pregnant.

880
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,666
Using the toilet is hard enough for you.

881
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,541
Is it that bad, Monk Vinai?

882
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,291
Do you have any evidence
to defend yourself?

883
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:37,958
No.

884
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,375
No for what?

885
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,791
No, I don't like girls.

886
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:42,875
What?

887
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,833
I understand.

888
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:48,416
Is it you, novice?

889
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,958
Can a wet dream make someone pregnant?

890
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,291
Is it you, novice?

891
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,125
I'm still a virgin.

892
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,333
What about you, officiator?

893
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:58,416
I'm infertile.

894
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:00,500
I've slept with my wife many years,

895
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:01,583
but we still don't have a baby.

896
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,625
Or‚

897
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,291
He's too young. No.

898
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,708
What the hell is happening?

899
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,916
Who's my daughter's guy?

900
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,208
What are you guys doing?

901
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,125
Is it you, Monk Steve,

902
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,291
who got Mhuay pregnant?

903
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,541
Pregnant?

904
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,416
Yes, she is pregnant with me.

905
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:26,208
Papa, no! Stop it!

906
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,291
-Mhuay!
-Then‚

907
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:33,083
It's Monk Steve's responsibility.

908
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,250
OK.

909
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,208
Oh, he said OK.

910
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:40,000
I only practice Balinese with Mhuay.

911
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:44,541
Why is Tang so angry? I don't understand.

912
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,375
Practice?

913
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,375
Not pregnant?

914
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,958
The truth is the truth.

915
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,125
It will reveal itself.

916
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,625
Don't you worry.

917
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,666
So Monk Noi, are you really gay?

918
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:03,250
Even you have a problem.

919
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,583
I had no choice.

920
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,833
Are you ready to confess your guilt?

921
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:21,958
Mhuay!

922
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,916
Child, you're stubborn.

923
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,916
Is the door locked?

924
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yes.

925
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,625
She didn't open it for you?

926
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,333
Why did you ask me so?

927
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,583
If this scene was in a movie,

928
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:40,083
It would mean Mhuay is committing suicide.

929
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,708
Mhuay, no!

930
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,083
Panic time.

931
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,250
Why are you still here? Go.

932
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,208
This is my daughter's room. I'll go in.

933
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,958
Wait for me downstairs. Go!

934
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,625
Mhuay? Mhuay! My baby!

935
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,833
Mhuay!

936
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:01,833
-Papa, What are you doing?
-Open the door.

937
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,166
I said open the door. Mhu--

938
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,791
Why are you bashing in?

939
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,500
The bath tub is filled with blood!

940
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,958
Mhuay, are you all right?

941
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,291
Come here. Sit here.

942
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,250
I'm fine.

943
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,166
How? There's a razor here.

944
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,291
Where's the wound? Tell me.

945
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,875
This is dangerous. You're blood-soaked.

946
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,458
Tang, what are you doing?

947
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,291
She was committing suicide.

948
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,958
Are you nuts?

949
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,666
Do you see this razor?

950
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,583
It's good I was there in time.

951
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:37,041
If I hadn't found her,
think how it would have been.

952
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,333
Mhuay's got her period.

953
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:42,416
What?

954
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,625
She's got her period!

955
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,583
I told you that our girl's now a woman.

956
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,083
I'm bawling you out. Why are you laughing?

957
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:55,666
I'm so happy.
You can blast me for anything.

958
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,916
What are you so happy about?

959
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:03,250
Remember when you were pregnant with me...

960
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,500
No! With my baby.

961
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,541
You didn't have a period.
Then Mhuay was born.

962
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:16,791
What are you talking about?
It's embarrassing.

963
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:23,541
I have to ask you for forgiveness,
Father. I caused a scene here.

964
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,500
The one you need to apologize to isn't me.

965
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:30,208
I owe you an apology, Brothers.

966
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,125
I owe you an apology too, Brother Steve.

967
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,333
It's good that you're OK.

968
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,000
I heard that you were committing suicide.

969
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:43,208
No. It was just a misunderstanding.

970
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:46,333
If it became true,

971
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:49,916
Your parents would be the most devastated.

972
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,041
Sappitiyo Wiwach Chantu.

973
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,750
Sappitiyo Wiwach Chantu.

974
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:13,916
Sapparoko Winas Satu.

975
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,833
Sapparoko Winas Satu.

976
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,250
Good work.

977
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,083
Father, here's your medicine.

978
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,500
Thank you, Vinai.

979
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:26,000
Father.

980
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,583
Heart disease is dangerous.

981
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,041
You're running out of medicine too.

982
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,833
I think you should go to see a doctor.

983
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,250
That's all right. I'm getting better.

984
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:42,291
I'm getting better, right?

985
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,125
How's Steve, Vinai?

986
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:47,958
Is he doing better?

987
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,583
He's acting up. Unpredictable.

988
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:55,500
Steve is like a baby.

989
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,708
He's growing up.

990
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:00,416
He'll become something with your guidance.

991
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,000
I'll leave him in your care.

992
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,583
Yes, sir.

993
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,583
Father.

994
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,833
For the robe offering ceremony this year,

995
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,291
we should gather the villagers' faith

996
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:15,500
and renovate our chapel to be beautiful,

997
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,125
so people will come here to make merit.

998
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,166
Being in the temple physically

999
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,666
is useless, Monk Vinai.

1000
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,833
If their heart is far from dharma,

1001
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:28,333
even if they're all living in the temple,

1002
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,666
I don't see any use.

1003
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,083
Father.

1004
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,875
Why do we need to meditate?

1005
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:56,833
Mediatation is to become aware
of your mind.

1006
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,958
Our minds move too fast.

1007
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:02,458
If we're aware of our minds,

1008
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,375
We can control them.

1009
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,333
Sadness is in our minds.

1010
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:09,083
So is happiness.

1011
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,458
Oh, I don't want to be sad.

1012
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,250
Then you have to know
what causes suffering.

1013
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:29,916
I have no idea. I've got amnesia.

1014
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,208
Why don't you start thinking?

1015
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,166
Do you have any suffering?

1016
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,083
Monk Steve.

1017
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,500
We're born with two ears,

1018
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,583
but only one mouth.

1019
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,125
It means listen more and talk less.

1020
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,583
Then why do you talk a lot?

1021
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,708
I see you preach to everyone all the time.

1022
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,458
I'm old.

1023
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,416
I've listened a lot.

1024
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,291
So I need to speak more,

1025
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,208
to teach the young like you.

1026
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:24,541
Itipi So Pakawa

1027
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:28,125
Arahang Samma Sumbhudtho

1028
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,958
Why are we walking?

1029
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,750
We're digging a pond here.

1030
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:39,583
For the three-digit prize, the numbers are

1031
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:44,416
two-five-one.

1032
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:08,916
BUILT FOR THE TEMPLE BY MR.TANG

1033
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:24,000
Are you here to make merit?

1034
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,708
I'm here to expiate my sins.

1035
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,083
I'm rescuing these animals.

1036
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:33,333
What are you releasing to the river?
I see no fish.

1037
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,541
I'm sinful.

1038
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,708
A few fish
won't be enough to redeem my sin.

1039
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,333
I'm releasing mosquito larvae.

1040
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,583
Won't there be more mosquitos?

1041
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:57,333
Have you seen any visions
or flashbacks recently?

1042
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:00,291
Yes, that's what I have.

1043
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:02,250
Will I be all right?

1044
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:08,750
I think you're retrieving your memory.

1045
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,416
Then it's good news, Monk Steve.

1046
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:16,750
About your pilgrimage
to Myanmar this year‚

1047
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,666
it's not allowed.

1048
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:23,416
Let me perform a check-up on you,
to see if you can travel.

1049
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:28,166
My nurse said
you left this at the hospital.

1050
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:34,125
Perhaps it holds a clue to who you were

1051
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,166
before you got amnesia.

1052
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:06,416
Then I'll never know who I was.

1053
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,833
The self doesn't exist.

1054
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,250
There's only the image
we're trying to make.

1055
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,791
Who do you think you were in the past?

1056
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:20,041
The real happiness
isn't having your hopes fulfilled.

1057
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:26,291
It's learning how to let it go
when you fail.

1058
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,708
Do you still want to know your past?

1059
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,333
Neither past nor future is real.

1060
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:34,083
What's real is the present.

1061
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,875
But I think you'd better have some ideas.

1062
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,750
I know where we should start.

1063
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:53,208
This is the only mall
that has these price tags.

1064
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:58,750
Does it look familiar?

1065
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,208
It's no use.

1066
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:05,833
M-100 drink might be an alm.

1067
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,166
An alm?

1068
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,833
Good evening, everyone.

1069
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:15,875
Welcome to the temple fair,
our annual merit day.

1070
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:19,750
Now that you're here,
please pay homage to the sacred

1071
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,625
Buddha image inside the chapel.

1072
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:27,166
Then come to the facilitator office
to donate money.

1073
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,208
Tonight is the night.

1074
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:34,833
We are all glad
to see so many of you here.

1075
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,833
We have some entertainment

1076
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,750
to light up your hearts.

1077
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,791
What are we having tonight, Mr.Pang?

1078
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,541
-There's a dance.
-Having an annual fair,

1079
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,333
the temple is so lively.

1080
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,125
Shoot it, Toh. One in the middle.

1081
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,208
The one in the middle?

1082
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,500
Brother, hold this.

1083
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,916
I'll show you what accuracy means.

1084
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,375
Give me more bullets.

1085
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:49,625
Gun fight?

1086
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,958
Are you stealing my girl? I'll shoot you.

1087
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,458
Brother, no!

1088
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:01,250
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1089
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,708
You might hit the monk.

1090
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,208
Stand back.

1091
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,833
Stand back. I don't wanna commit a sin.

1092
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:10,208
You're in trouble.

1093
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:14,375
Shooting a monk or a man are equal sins.

1094
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,708
If you don't want to commit a sin,

1095
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:17,916
Shoot no one.

1096
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,791
You'd better stand back.

1097
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:23,041
If you don't comply, I'll shoot you.

1098
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,750
Brother!

1099
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,291
Holy shit!

1100
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,000
It's a darn bullet!

1101
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:51,791
He's so sacred.

1102
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:58,125
Kothang Katawa Sukhang Seti.

1103
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,916
Kill anger and you'll find happiness.

1104
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,250
Oh!

1105
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,458
I have an idea how to make money.

1106
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,750
The truth of life is emptiness.

1107
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:21,083
We're all born from emptiness.

1108
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
The world was also born from emptiness.

1109
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,666
Is it right, everyone?

1110
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,750
-Yes, Father.
-All sensations

1111
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,833
are not real.

1112
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,125
Light is born from darkness.

1113
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:36,166
Without darkness, there's no light.

1114
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:41,041
Therefore,
neither light nor darkness is real.

1115
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,083
How do we know what's right or wrong?

1116
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:54,458
Monk Steve, imagine that you have a stick.

1117
01:07:55,208 --> 01:08:01,666
How long should it be to be just right?

1118
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:03,708
I'm not so sure.

1119
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,416
Monk Steve.

1120
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:10,458
The stick that's long enough
to be a walking cane

1121
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,208
might not be used to pick fruit.

1122
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:18,625
Right or wrong depends on the intent.

1123
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:21,833
And what's karma?

1124
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,916
What if I don't know my karma?

1125
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,666
I'm not scared of what I don't know.

1126
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:32,583
What scares me is what I know.

1127
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,625
We know what's right or wrong.

1128
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:37,000
We know what isn't good.

1129
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:40,833
If it's wrong and we still do it,
that's scary.

1130
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,125
Isn't it true?

1131
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,125
Yes, it is.

1132
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,083
Monk Vinai.

1133
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,041
Yes, Father?

1134
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:19,291
You've taught Monk Steve a lot.

1135
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:20,625
Yes, sir.

1136
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:22,458
I barely recognize

1137
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:28,541
that this is the monk
that hugged a nurse at the hospital.

1138
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:29,500
Yes, sir.

1139
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,125
Am I right, Monk Noi?

1140
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,375
Yes, sir.

1141
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:38,791
Father!

1142
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:47,291
I think he has overworked himself.

1143
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:50,458
I'd like to put him on observation.

1144
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,500
Oh, Father.

1145
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,916
Monk Vinai, I think you need to replace
Father to take care of the temple.

1146
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:13,083
Jack, do you think it's cool?

1147
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:16,125
Cool. Monk Steve's a foreigner.

1148
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:19,291
OK is his signature.

1149
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,333
-OK?
-Yeah.

1150
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,583
What's a signature?

1151
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,458
A name signing, I guess.

1152
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:29,708
Novices, what are you doing?

1153
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,916
Making coins of Monk Steve
to give to people who have faith.

1154
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:35,458
Yes.

1155
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:37,916
Let me see.

1156
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,000
Here it is.

1157
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,541
Put them all in the bag.
I'll throw them away.

1158
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:57,500
-You'll throw them away?
-Yeah.

1159
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,541
Father doesn't like amulets.

1160
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:09,875
You said you didn't believe it.

1161
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,291
How could I not believe it?

1162
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,375
He put his finger
in the gun to stop the bullet.

1163
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:15,708
It was awesome.

1164
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,250
I saw it with my own eyes.

1165
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:23,958
And all of a sudden,
coins came up under the bodhi tree.

1166
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:28,500
Luckily, I went to the temple.
There's one more coin.

1167
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,208
Really? I want it too.

1168
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:33,625
It is still possible,

1169
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,375
But good things comes at a high price.

1170
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,625
There aren't many coins left.

1171
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,958
I'll pay any price.

1172
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,250
What's the matter, Pang?

1173
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,333
You're all here.

1174
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:51,166
They are here to buy Monk Steve coins.

1175
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,125
But I don't have any coins.

1176
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,458
We aren't allowed to carry money.

1177
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:57,875
It's against the monk's rules.

1178
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:59,875
It's a different kind of coin.

1179
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,958
Someone wanted to buy it from me.

1180
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,375
He gave me ten grand,
but I didn't sell it.

1181
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,583
It's awesome.

1182
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,125
Wait, wait, wait.

1183
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,375
I'm the one who threw away these coins.

1184
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:14,000
Father is against the idea of amulets.

1185
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:17,458
But he's ill at the moment.

1186
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,458
Brother, look. They're all here.

1187
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,250
Don't spoil their faith.

1188
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:27,333
Please let Monk Steve make coins for them.

1189
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:28,458
That's right.

1190
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,000
Believe what he said.

1191
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:34,666
Anything that Brother Vinai wants,

1192
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,416
I'll make it happen.

1193
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:38,833
How did you come here?

1194
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:43,166
Just make Monk Steve coins.

1195
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,125
Right, guys?

1196
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,166
Yeah, that's right.

1197
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,750
Okay, I'll give it a try.

1198
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,500
Dhammae Katana Paro-oka.

1199
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,333
You can't deny people's faith.

1200
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,458
The date that the charms go on sale

1201
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,125
will be announced later.

1202
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:05,291
No need to wait.

1203
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,708
People's faith can't wait.

1204
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,083
So holy.

1205
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,333
Can I use these coins to buy things?

1206
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,250
Calm down.

1207
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,958
Calm down. Calm down.

1208
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,666
Here you are.

1209
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,333
You didn't get one? Here you are.

1210
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:28,833
-Athai.
-Yes, sir?

1211
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,041
We've got a lot or merit-making money.

1212
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:34,916
Next year, we'll have
the most beautiful chapel in the province.

1213
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,500
Calm down.

1214
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:38,541
Be patient, sir.

1215
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:44,000
Why did the villagers want those coins?

1216
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,250
Because you're famous.

1217
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,375
I'm famous?

1218
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,583
Father named me randomly.

1219
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:58,000
I don't know if I'm a real monk.

1220
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:02,708
There are many of us.
How could you let Monk Steve disappear?

1221
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:05,541
Go on, Kluay. Find him.

1222
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,958
Don't come back until you find him.

1223
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,000
Go away!

1224
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:14,166
You nag me every day.

1225
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,875
If I get out of here...

1226
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,416
This is the reason I hired you!

1227
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,208
You've got some nerve.

1228
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:39,416
Can you tell me who sent you here?

1229
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,875
It doesn't matter.

1230
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:46,166
Don't forget,

1231
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,250
we're in a temple.

1232
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:52,666
At least you need to respect
the yellow robes.

1233
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:58,166
A professional doesn't mind the place.

1234
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:02,458
Wait.

1235
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:05,291
How much did they give you?
I'll double it.

1236
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,625
There's no need, sir.

1237
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:07,791
Three times more.

1238
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,208
I'm professional enough.

1239
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,208
-Four times more.
-If only I could close a deal on you,

1240
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:13,791
then I could rest in peace.

1241
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,458
I'm not gonna make it.

1242
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,083
Accidental discharge. Sorry.

1243
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,791
It's a new mosquito repellent machine,
MTX, from Germany.

1244
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,208
2,999 Baht.

1245
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:27,583
Order ten machines and pay
just 2,550 Baht each.

1246
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:30,541
30 machines,
and I'll give you a lot of freebies.

1247
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,916
Can you hold it?

1248
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,500
If you don't like my machine,

1249
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,541
I can offer you facial cream instead.

1250
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:41,375
Your face will be so white.

1251
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,916
If you don't like it,

1252
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,750
I have glasses. Try them on.

1253
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,375
Help me out, I haven't met my sales goal.

1254
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,125
You prick!

1255
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:52,000
You're so dead!

1256
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,875
Oh shit!

1257
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:56,750
Somebody help me!

1258
01:15:56,833 --> 01:16:00,208
What have I done to you
to mess up my face?

1259
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:08,875
-What about our share?
-Yeah.

1260
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:10,583
What share?

1261
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:12,208
We started the coins.

1262
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:13,875
We deserve to get a share.

1263
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:17,666
The villagers' merit-making money?

1264
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,666
If you used it,
Hell would come down on you.

1265
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,166
You'd better attend to your duties.

1266
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,625
Your duty is over there.
Sweep up those leaves.

1267
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:28,583
What? This isn't fair.

1268
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:31,291
He didn't respect our initiative.

1269
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,333
Shit!

1270
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:38,625
Kat will be here tomorrow.

1271
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:40,625
What are you going to do?

1272
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:42,875
What should I do?

1273
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:47,458
It's a sin.

1274
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,708
What's a sin? I'm stealing my own money.

1275
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,541
Can I ask you something?

1276
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,875
Do you really love Kat?

1277
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,375
I love her the most.

1278
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,333
Hi Jack! Hi Toh!

1279
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,958
My dad's car is broken down.

1280
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,625
How lucky that you drove here.

1281
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:19,583
Sorry.

1282
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:24,375
No problem.
Buy me meals and take me out, Jack.

1283
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,916
My dad bought this place.

1284
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:33,625
Next year, he will build a resort here.

1285
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,041
I really hope you'll come back again.

1286
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:39,708
I'll open a suite for you.

1287
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,041
Wait.

1288
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:46,666
Toh.

1289
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,166
Can't you think of
going somewhere far away?

1290
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,833
That's what I'm thinking.

1291
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,541
I'll be right back.

1292
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,958
Shall we continue?

1293
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,666
Wanna have some snacks?

1294
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:21,000
I don’t want any snack.

1295
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,500
I bought them for you.

1296
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:24,958
What else would you like to eat?

1297
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:28,416
I wanna eat cat.

1298
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:36,416
You horny brat.

1299
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,125
I thought you're rich.
Is this all you've got?

1300
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:55,166
Are you worth my gas expense?

1301
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,125
Your phone is just a fake iphone.

1302
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,958
Damn you!

1303
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:19,333
Jack!

1304
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,666
Did we sandwich Kat?

1305
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,708
Sandwich, my ass.

1306
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,916
It's your Kat. She ripped us off.

1307
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:39,958
It isn't true.
Kat isn't that kind of girl.

1308
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,541
You can wait for your darling here.
I'm out of here.

1309
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,750
Toh!

1310
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,750
Toh! Wait up!

1311
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:53,291
I don't understand.
Why did she do this to me?

1312
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:03,291
If you're broke, don't brag.

1313
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:04,958
From Kat

1314
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,291
No!!

1315
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:35,833
Thank you so much.

1316
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,791
You're my true friend.

1317
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,041
For better or worse,

1318
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,458
you're always with me.

1319
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,000
I'm always with you

1320
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,083
because...

1321
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:53,000
because I love you.

1322
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,083
What the hell is with you?

1323
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:09,291
Don't kid me like this.

1324
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,708
We've been friends since we were young.

1325
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:17,708
I've loved you since we were little.

1326
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,291
Damn!

1327
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,875
What a hell of a day!

1328
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,250
Where are you going?

1329
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,833
Far away from you, freak.

1330
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,291
Don't follow me or I'll punch you.

1331
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:43,375
Where have you been, novice?
It's late at night.

1332
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:53,333
Toh, my friend, turned out to be gay.

1333
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:55,958
He just confessed his love to me.

1334
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,416
Then why are you sad?

1335
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,541
Will you love him back?

1336
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,958
No, Brother. I'm not gay.

1337
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:10,500
The one who should be sad is Toh.

1338
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,875
Toh loves you, but you don't love him.

1339
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:16,750
Why are you sad?

1340
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,625
Just think that I kidded you.

1341
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:49,833
I love you too, but I'm not gay.

1342
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,250
Got it?

1343
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:54,583
Yeah.

1344
01:22:56,958 --> 01:23:01,208
You shocked me more
than getting ripped off by Kat.

1345
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,458
When did you find out?

1346
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,916
As long as I can remember.

1347
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,791
Since I was little.

1348
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,875
You and I often showered
in front of the mirror.

1349
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,666
Enough. Enough.

1350
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:19,208
Forget it.

1351
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,666
You understand me. Right?

1352
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:24,791
Yes.

1353
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,791
I won't be scared of what I don't know.

1354
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:06,583
What scares me is what I know.

1355
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:10,708
We know what's right or wrong.

1356
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:16,375
If it's wrong and we still do it,
that's scary, isn't it?

1357
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,250
Monk Noi.

1358
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:28,291
I think I know
who I used to be in the past.

1359
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:32,500
I think I used to be a killer.

1360
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:36,166
I already know.

1361
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:41,625
I always see your killer instinct.

1362
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:45,583
Even today, I still see it.

1363
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:49,875
You're the most determined killer
that I've ever seen.

1364
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:17,416
Are you talking to me?

1365
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,125
Who are you?

1366
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,333
Don't get too close to me.

1367
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,583
Monks can't be close to women.

1368
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,958
I think I should go now.

1369
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,666
Monk Steve.

1370
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,833
Why are you in a hurry to see me?

1371
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:15,708
I've now realized

1372
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:18,916
I was a killer.

1373
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,291
My duty was

1374
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,916
to kill you, Father.

1375
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:33,250
No killer warns his victim in advance.

1376
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:36,625
And killing an old monk

1377
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,333
isn't a hard job, is it?

1378
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:44,458
Bad guys don't call themselves bad.

1379
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:48,000
If your heart knows what is wrong,

1380
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,291
you can say you have a good heart.

1381
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:57,666
Remember
that I told you everything's empty?

1382
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,625
Thank you, Father.

1383
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:09,708
Can I ask you for a favor?

1384
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:12,083
Take me back to the temple.

1385
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,541
It's very dangerous.

1386
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:24,666
If I don't get killed,
I'll die of old age.

1387
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:33,958
GRAND SACRED AMULET SALES
ONE DAY ONLY

1388
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,875
Here they are.

1389
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:38,875
In sacks.

1390
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,875
So admirable.

1391
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:45,958
Father put an incantation
on the Monk Steve coins himself.

1392
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:50,416
Pang, you're close to him, right?

1393
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,750
Can you get me a few coins, pal?

1394
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:55,958
You're all here

1395
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:58,000
because you want

1396
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,708
to have a sacred amulet.

1397
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:02,583
-Yes.
-Yes, Father.

1398
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:06,375
I won't ask much of your time.

1399
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:09,791
If you want to get good things,

1400
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,958
pay attention to what I say.

1401
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,375
Pay attention.

1402
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:18,833
I'm glad to see you visiting the temple.

1403
01:31:19,416 --> 01:31:21,166
But you know what?

1404
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:25,666
Your hearts are so far away from dharma.

1405
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:30,958
Dharma isn't an object or a building.

1406
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:33,416
Isn't it true, Monk Vinai?

1407
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:34,833
Yes, Father.

1408
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:36,291
Isn't it true, Monk Noi?

1409
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,250
Yes, Father.

1410
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,000
Don't let these things

1411
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,791
mislead us.

1412
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,291
What are you doing?

1413
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:54,125
Monk Steve asked me to do this.

1414
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:58,083
What we are burning
is worth a lot of money.

1415
01:31:58,166 --> 01:32:00,833
What I want to sell you

1416
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,625
is this old chapel.

1417
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:08,166
It is useless.

1418
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:10,666
Does anyone want to buy it?

1419
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,833
No. You can't sell it.

1420
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,083
We won't let you sell it.

1421
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:22,791
It's no use to have a chapel made of gold,

1422
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,041
if it pulls our hearts away from dharma.

1423
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:29,708
The Buddhist sermon is the only amulet

1424
01:32:30,041 --> 01:32:34,666
that I want you to keep
within your hearts.

1425
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:38,708
Whether you are happy or sad,

1426
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:41,333
always think of it.

1427
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,583
You want us to burn it.
I'll burn it now.

1428
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:58,083
Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.

1429
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,750
See? I told you guys

1430
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,541
Monk Steve was really an assassin.

1431
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:36,708
Do you think we have to tell the police?

1432
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,291
If he'd been a bad guy,

1433
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,958
I would have been dead.

1434
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:48,000
Being good or bad
isn't about the past or future.

1435
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:50,416
It's up to the present.

1436
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,125
It's on us to choose what to be.

1437
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,625
Mister Tang!

1438
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,208
They're scared of us.

1439
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:24,666
The mask is removed by the heart.

1440
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:26,916
If a bad heart is lost,

1441
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,833
Nobody will feel sorry.

1442
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:35,666
It's you.

1443
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,625
All right. You can kill me now.

1444
01:36:40,416 --> 01:36:41,750
I can't get away from you.

1445
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:45,833
Bang! Bang!

1446
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:51,875
Mhuay?

1447
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:54,333
Yes, it's me.

1448
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:59,208
Papa, were you happy

1449
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:02,500
when those children ran up and hugged you?

1450
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:04,791
I was.

1451
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:10,375
If you're nice, if you're a good guy,

1452
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:12,333
everyone would love you.

1453
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:15,416
Just like I did when I was little.

1454
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:19,791
I felt that I loved you.
Your hug felt warm.

1455
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:26,833
Me too.

1456
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,208
I want the old Tang back.

1457
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:34,416
I have a lot more threatening letters.

1458
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:37,625
My daughter and I wrote them.

1459
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:40,458
You acted ridiculous
with your crazy disguises.

1460
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:44,250
Remember when you wanted to eat something,

1461
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,583
and you had to eat
your henchmen's leftovers.

1462
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:49,416
Because you're afraid to die!

1463
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:54,125
Are you really happy?

1464
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,083
Papa.

1465
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:03,458
How rich is enough for you?

1466
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:09,333
Do you know how much I wanna hug you?

1467
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:15,458
There's no father
that doesn't love his child.

1468
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:18,125
Why don't you hug me, kid?

1469
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:23,250
Only if you're the same person
you used to be.

1470
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,791
I love you.

1471
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,500
I do everything

1472
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:36,083
for my daughter and my wife.

1473
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:08,000
Looking at ants? They're so natural.

1474
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:11,500
Brother.

1475
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:13,583
I want to become a monk.

1476
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,875
TODAY,

1477
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:53,208
THERE ARE ABOUT 700 MILLION
BUDDHISTS AROUND THE WORLD

1478
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:58,208
MAKING BUDDHISM
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RELIGIONS.

1479
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:24,000
You think he's faking it?

1480
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,083
I don't think so.

1481
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:30,041
I think he's enlightened.

1482
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:31,125
No.

1483
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:32,208
You don't believe me?

1484
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,416
Let me show you.

1485
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,541
I can do anything, and he won't get angry.

1486
01:40:35,625 --> 01:40:37,583
-Really?
-I'll show you.

1487
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:39,625
He has changed.

1488
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:41,000
What a good guy.

1489
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:42,958
He's really reached dharma.

1490
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:46,083
I envy him so much.

1491
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:51,333
We should leave him in peace.

1492
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:55,583
My fingers are stuck.
