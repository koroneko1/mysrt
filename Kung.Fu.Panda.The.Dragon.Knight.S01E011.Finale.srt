365
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,365
[Blade] You let them get away.

00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,283
[sighs]

367
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,077
-I had to. I couldn't let them--

[soft music plays]

371
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,467
Thank you.

372
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,888
You would have done the same for me.

373
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,141
No. For being my friend.

374
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,018
My first friend.

375
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,648
And I shouldn't have lied to you.

376
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,860
You're making water come out of my eyes.

377
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,407
[sighs]

378
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,746
We don't know where they're headed,
and we have no weapon that can match them.

379
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,082
[Rukhmini] Uh, not quite true!

[chuckles]

382
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,672
How did you--

383
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,424
If you have the whip, what do they have?

384
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,093
Always good to have a fake.

385
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,053
-[gasps]
-You switched it out?

386
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,266
[laughs] So what, you want to help us now?

387
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,725
I didn't say that.

388
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,144
But, we are after the same things.

389
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,899
The whip was supposed to be the first
on my hunt for all four Tianshang Weapons.

390
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,442
-But now--
-Uh, no, no, no.

391
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,071
If you wanna say something to my son,
you say it to me first,

392
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,241
and then maybe I'll tell him.

393
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,742
Same goes for you, still.

394
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,369
We aren't done.

395
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,455
Dad, it's okay.

396
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,208
You know how to find the other weapons?

397
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,919
It may cost more
than you're willing to pay.

398
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,754
Hm, sounds promising.

399
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,508
Uh, too bad we're heading home.
We're late for the dinner rush.

400
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,510
[Po] I have to go, Dad.

401
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
You heard Klaus and Veruca.

402
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,722
If we don't stop them,

403
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,599
they're gonna resurrect the evil army
and take over the world.

404

[soft music plays]

405
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,603
So if that means
I have to trust a fake knight…

406
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,646
Seems a bit harsh.

407
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,692
-And a con artist slash thief…
-Master con artist slash thief.

408
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,903
Then that's what I have to do.

409
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,994
Then I'm coming with you.

410
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,078
I'm sorry, what?

411
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,456
Stay out of this, Meandering Knife.

412
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,376
I'm not gonna let you do this alone,
with the two of them. [laughs]

413
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,005
You clearly need someone to protect you,

414
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,424
and that's always been my job.

415
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,509
[stirring music plays]

416
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,305
Then we're off on a treasure hunt.

[dramatic music plays]

418
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,687
And that means we're leaving China.

419
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,777
Wait, what?
