1
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,239
I never get how they can stand it.

2
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
Wake up before dawn,
get stuck in horrendous traffic,

3
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
only to arrive and toil away
in cramped cubicles all day.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,239
Vacations?

5
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,920
Only on long weekends

6
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,319
when the whole country is overrun
by holiday-hungry mobs.

7
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,400
If they've had enough,
they can't just jump ship.

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
Why? They have bills to pay.

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
Their fate is sealed
until the day they retire.

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
Well,

11
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,120
the only consolation along the way

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,760
is the year-end bonus.

13
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,799
Today's stock market report.

14
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,719
Dow Jones is going through a little bump…

PAN: MARKETING DIRECTOR

…and investors eyeing
the American stock market

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,079
are advised against
making any decisions for now.

JUE: TEMP
11,500 BAHT

21
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,840
The 7:00 p.m. screening is better.

22
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,039
Firstly because we'll get there at 7:20
just as the movie starts,

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,719
and secondly because when we leave,
the rush hour will be over.

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,719
Oh, and I've booked a hotel
for our long weekend trip next year.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,240
It's green.

26
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,960
We have time.

-It's green!

29
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,280
Sorry!

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,479
Did you make an offering to the Buddha?

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Well, you do that at the shrine,
not at the temple!

32
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,199
Why did I even bother
sending you to college?

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,240
You're as dumb as your dad!

34
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,919
Stop right there!

35
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't throw them away!
We can use the other side, see?

8,250 BAHT

37
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,039
Mom, I'm not sure if I can make it.

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,439
I may have to go abroad for a meeting.

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes.

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,599
Mom, I have to hang up.
My driver is already here.

41
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,360
Look, a 70% discount on Botox injections!

42
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,680
Should I buy it?

43
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,400
That's dirt cheap, go for it!

44
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,599
-I'll buy one too!
-You can save it for later!

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,039
Hey, Pan's here.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,360
Hi, Pan.

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,560
Play the petroleum short,
dump it this afternoon.

48
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,319
Hold on to the coal stocks
and wait for the dividends.

THREE MONTHS LEFT

53
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
Success…

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
comes from teamwork and unity.

55
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,199
If your hearts

56
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,279
beat as one…

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,079
we can overcome every obstacle in our way!

58
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,759
Are we all here?

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Mr. Anan, please.

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,319
CHAI: HR ASSISTANT MANAGER
38,700 BAHT

61
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,000
I've called a meeting today.

62
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,160
It's really nothing urgent.

63
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,319
Our executive board in Korea…

64
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,800
MR. ANAN: MANAGING DIRECTOR
312,000 BAHT

65
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,399
…wants us to launch a new product.

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,519
They want

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,439
it to come out by
the beginning of next year.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,639
Is that too soon?

69
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,800
Of course!

70
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,759
Usually, it takes us a whole year

71
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,040
to come up with a new product.

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,759
And we have so many public holidays
coming up. We won't make it.

73
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,800
If you guys can't make it,

74
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,680
the board probably won't approve
your year-end bonuses.

75
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,680
Shall I tell them now

76
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,879
that we can't make it?

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Can we?

78
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,879
Or can we not?

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
What do you think?

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,439
I think

81
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,720
a super-tight deadline

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,879
can push us to try harder
to achieve our goal.

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,600
We can go through our old projects
and develop some of them.

84
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,759
Excellent,

85
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,759
that's exactly what I'm thinking!

86
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,399
Right, I'll let you set up a team
and head the project.

87
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,439
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,519
If you trust me.

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course…

90
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,199
I do.

91
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,920
I know I can count on you, Pan.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,319
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,759
Pan, I've got you that assistant
you've been asking for.

94
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,920
Where are they?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,279
Right there.

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,480
Mr. Anan approved her himself.

97
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,319
Ready to work?

98
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,360
Sure!

99
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you have a thumb drive?

100
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,120
I'll transfer some files
for you to work on.

101
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
Ta-da!

102
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't worry, it works.

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
Where's the cap?

104
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,399
It doesn't need a cap.

105
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,920
The data isn't in the cap, right?

106
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,919
FAKE EYELASHES 800

107

MONTHLY CONDO INSTALLMENT 12,000

109
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,799
All that? It's only
the beginning of the month!

110
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,840
Squeezing yourself dry so soon!

111
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,519
Believe me, you need a side gig.

112
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,960
-Come with me to an MLM seminar.
-No MLM for me!

113
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,039
He didn't get the printer fixed
and didn't reimburse your cab fare,

114
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,639
but he got himself a new home theater set?

115
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,240
You've got to be kidding.

116
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm not!

117
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,840
Yesterday I went in to have
him sign a document

118
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,320
and he was coming in carrying
a brand new home theater set.

119
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,639
I saw it with my own eyes…

120
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,720
-Then what?
-Go on!

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,919
Well, if it's necessary,
then he's got to have it.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
Necessary? An expensive home theater set?

123
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,759
You said it best,

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
that old fart only spends
money on himself.

125
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,200
Right!

126
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,240
You're insane! Where did you hear that?

127
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,840
I never said anything
like that in my life.

128
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,919
I, Nantapond, never said that.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,960
You did!

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,639
You said it yourself that our company
would be much better off

131
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,759
without that asshole as the manager.

132
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,919
Blasphemy! How ungrateful you girls are!

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,919
Whose corner are you in, anyway?

134
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,679
It doesn't matter.

135
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,399
What matters is
that he's in your corner now.

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
No way!

137
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Believe me,

138
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,639
he really is in your corner right now.

139
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,080
-What?
-I don't get it.

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
Press it!

141
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,320
What? We're stuck!

142
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,879
Bee, call building maintenance!

143
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,360
-Well?
-It's working!

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,559
Bee, why are you calling me?

145
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,559
Calling you?

146
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,480
Help! Please!

147
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,360
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

148
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,440
Please don't reschedule.
It took me two months to book you!

149
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,840
Okay,

150
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,879
I'll try later then.

151
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,840
Sorry,

152
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
can you get off here?
I'm not going any further.

153
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,519
Get off!

154
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,799
OCTOBER 15

155
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,480
Function Drink,
a vitamin and mineral beverage.

156
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,080
Of our old projects,

157
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,279
that has the highest potential
for development.

158
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,480
We already have the market trend
and consumer study.

159
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
And here's what I want you to do.

160
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,799
Nan, Eiw, get me the cost analysis.

161
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,480
Arm, Chanop, follow up on the formula.

162
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,720
Oat, find 10 references on packaging.

163
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,279
Kae, Bee, work on the marketing plan.
Where to push this, and who on.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,600
I want all of this done by Friday.

165
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Look!

166
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,720
No! Gross! When was it taken?

167
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,000
Delete it now!

168
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
And I forget to tell you one thing.

169
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,840
No one can take leave
before the project's concluded.

170
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,240
If anybody can't do it,
I'll have you replaced.

171
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,000
Jue, did you get the pen I sent you?

172
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,919
Yes, but why did you send me this?

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,679
You need a good pen to sign your checks.

174
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,159
I got you the best one in the province!

175
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,879
Do you like it?

176
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,360
Yes,

177
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,480
but please don't send
things like this to me again.

178
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,600
I can buy them myself.

179
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,440
You like it but don't want me to send it?

180
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,480
Mom, I have to go now.

181
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,240
Good luck, son!

182
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,519
-Thanks. How much?
-100.

183
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't think they'll give out
any bonuses this year.

184
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,879
Drinks, sir.

185
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,120
Okay.

186
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,240
Jue, I ordered two iced teas.
Where's the other one?

187
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,279
Are you daft or what?

188
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,919
Sorry, you can take this one.

189
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,759
Why are you three sitting
on the same side?

190
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,960
So, what you do think about the Red Army?

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
The front line is nothing special…

192
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,759
but the formation is magnificent.

193
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,799
And what about the White Witch?

194
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,320
The front is fine,

195
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,600
the middle is toned,

196
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,559
and the rear is firm.

197
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,919
But she's devoured by the Red Devil.

198
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,919
Dammit, I hate the Red Devil!

199
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,960
You guys are so funny!

200
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,720
Jue, are you a Red Devil fan?

201
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,440
I have no idea! Whatever you say, sir.

202
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Jue…

203
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,159
were you late again this morning?

204
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Don't tell me your apartment
was on fire again.

205
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,000
I know it's hard to believe,

206
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,039
but it was really on fire again!

207
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,679
-Three times already, right?
-Yes.

208
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,559
Three times you didn't pass the probation.

209
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't think you can hide it from me.

210
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,200
It's year-end,

211
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,039
and if you keep at it like this

212
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,360
it's time for you to find a new team.

213
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,639
Excuse me!

214
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
No.

215
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,519
The Red Devil fan has to keep himself fit.

216
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,320
Show us you have the energy
to be part of the team.

217
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,720
Be there in time for the meeting.

218
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,839
NO SMOKING

219
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,279
You can smoke.

220
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,279
You can smoke.

221
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,160
Wai!

222
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,319
Turn it up.

223
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,039
Let's rock!

224
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,640
FROM: WAI

225
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,839
USE YOUR FULL NAME

226
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,160
…TEENY BIT…

227
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
LITTLE BIT

228
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,440
You gave me two Timeline files.

229
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,279
"Timeline Latest" and "Timeline Final."

230
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,160
Use "Latest," it's the final one.

231
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,400
What about "Final"?

232
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,839
Final means finished,

233
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,440
but Latest means final.

234
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,559
The winning number is:

235
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,720
seven…

236
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,839
five…

237
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,839
three.

238
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,519
So I'll use "Timeline Latest"?

239
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Wait! There's also
Timeline Latest-Latest, use that one.

240
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,119
Ready? Go!

241
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,640
Can't you make it simpler?

242
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,359
It's simple enough.

243
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,640
If it's too complicated for you, just ask.

244
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,839
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION
ME (WHO ELSE?)

245
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,480
DO NOT APPROVE

246
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,920
MR. PANITHAN JANEKARNKIT

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,160
I know someone who knows the winning
numbers before the announcement!

248
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,519
Why can't we fire her?

249
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
Wai is my friend's daughter.

250
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,839
What?

251
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,160
She's my friend's daughter.

252
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,319
So she has connections.

253
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,039
Correct.

254
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,599
Just bear with her.
She'll only be here for three months.

255
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Gotcha!

256
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,759
You're a fast learner.
Just correct this for me.

257
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,680
Sure.

258
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,200
Go look at the format on my table.

259
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,119
Okay, let me put this in the fridge first.

260
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,079
You have to put your name
on your food here?

261
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,559
Even with the labels,
some cheapskate still steals the food.

262
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,319
-Really?
-But I have a trick.

263
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,640
I put the names of the bosses.

264
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,440
So I write Boss Pan, and no one will dare…

265
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
Where is it?

266
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,839
Is this yours?

267
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,880
BOSS PAN DOESN'T LIKE SWEETS

268
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,440
Just wait till I catch you!

269
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,759
Bee!

270
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,079
NOV 1ST

271
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,119
Our beverage comes from the core concept

272
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,559
that men and women have different needs,

273
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
so we've designed two variations.

274
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,759
We should make the pattern less
complicated to show the details.

275
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,200
I agree.

276
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,359
What about the formula?

277
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,400
All done, we're just waiting
for the grape juice.

278
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,000
Wai, what're you doing?

279
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,200
Get the results of the flavor test for me.

280
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,079
-I want them tomorrow.
-Yes.

281
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,200
Everyone…

282
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,319
I have an announcement!

283
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,960
Bee! Taste, don't gulp.

284
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,200
Our company has won…

285
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,359
-No!
-Don't say that!

286
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
Listen up, everybody!

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,480
Ying is pregnant again!

288
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,880
She just came back
from maternity leave, and now

289
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,480
she's the perfect human resource manager.

290
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,240
She's good at making humans!

291
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,079
Stop it!

292
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,319
I'm here to tell you that

293
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,680
I'll leave the company to raise my kids.

294
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,680
But let's go to my farewell party tonight!

295
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Let's have one final blast!

296
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,440
Karaoke party!

297
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,920
Yes!

298
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,160
Ying…

299
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,279
Don't worry about the company.

300
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,319
I'm worried about him.

301
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Jit!

302
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,559
Mr. Chai!

303
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,559
What're you copying?

304
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,839
My son's homework.

305
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,279
Just a couple of sheets.

306
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,079
Please…

307
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
A couple of sheets?

308
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,440
Come back here!

309
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,319
Where are you going?

310
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,359
Please, spare me!
It's only for my son's studies!

311
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,599
Don't turn on the light!

312
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,039
-Please, I'm begging you!
-Electricity's expensive!

313
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,759
Stop!

314
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,160
It's great, where did you get it?

315
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,720
A friend in Japan sent it.

316
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,559
Let me have one!

317
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,720
Wait! We have to hand in
an assignment tomorrow.

318
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
Let's work really hard!

319
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,000
With your degree,

320
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,119
you won't be promoted to management.

321
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
And if you're not, the salary is capped.

322
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,799
You need a master's, at least.

323
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,079
Really? What about my years of experience?

324
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,839
It doesn't count at all?

325
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,799
It does, but not here.

326
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,359
You have to move to another company,

327
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
then you can earn more money.

328
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,480
Quit! I'll quit to protest

329
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,000
Against my stingy boss!

330
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,200
Easy, or your baby will come out now!

331
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,960
Quit! I'll quit! Let's get it over with!

332
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,240
FROM NAN: GET BOSS ANAN TO SIGN.
WE NEED IT TOMORROW.

333
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
Hey, beautiful. What're you doing here?

334
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,880
Get up!

335
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,200
Turn around.

336
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,640
Go on, turn around.

337
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Fine and firm body…

338
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,960
Just need bigger boobs,
and the customers will line up for you!

339
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,319
Go fill out the application form
and we'll give you an appraisal later.

340
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,039
I'm not here for a job.

341
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,079
Mr. Anan!

342
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,119
Excuse me!

343
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,359
Boss, please sign this.

344
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,359
Goodbye.

345
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,559
Hey!

346
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,079
-We're off at the same time!
-Let's go.

347
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,079
Right, "we're off at the same time."

348
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,640
You can still change your mind.

349
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,480
Done!

350
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,160
It's great!

351
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,519
Thanks!

352
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,559
That's it!

353
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,519
-Nuch!
-Boss.

354
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,519
For the new project,

355
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,400
Pan would like you to help
book appointments

356
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,319
with agents around the country.

357
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,160
But your appointments alone already
fill up my notebooks…

358
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,920
Right, Mr. Suraksa is out of town,
he'll be back on the 13th…

359
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,039
Mr. Surachai…

360
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,079
What? A wedding?

361
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,559
Mr. Surachet is available every day.

362
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
From 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.?

363
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Okay, let me check what time other people
sleep first. I'll get back to you.

364
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,759
PRESENT FOR TOB

365
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,200
BOSS' TEA-TIME AT 2

366
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,759
Mr. Surasak is back but
leaving for Hong Kong…

367
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,960
Traveling all the time…

368
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,400
All right, I'll call you at 10:00 p.m.

369
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,119
Wednesday, Mr. Surachai
has a wedding to go to…

370
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,240
What? Who are you?

371
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,359
10:00 A.M. PICK UP A NEW SUIT

372
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,039
CALL MR. SURACHAI AGAIN

373
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,559
Okay, I'm fine.

374
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,599
YOU'RE MY ANGEL.

375
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,480
A Romeo, huh?

376
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,599
She's only been here a few weeks.

377
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,640
How come her Thai is so good?

378
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,200
GO SCREW YOURSELF

379
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,759
Enjoy it!

380
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,440
Let me know if it's good!

381
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
"Go screw yourself."

382
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,279
Send it back to him.

383
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,640
-"Go screw yourself."
-Go screw yourself.

384
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,920
-"Go screw yourself."
-Yes!

385
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,920
Function Drink Product Evaluation

386
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
VERY SATISFIED
SATISFIED

387
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,720
INDIFFERENT

388
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,519
UNSATISFIED
VERY UNSATISFIED

389
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,640
Why didn't you put it into tables
like in the example?

390
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,119
It works this way too.

391
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
Numbers are boring.

392
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,240
Do it again, just put the numbers in.

393
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,720
Okay, I'll add the numbers.

394
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,559
I want only numbers.

395
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,759
Yes, sir. I will comply with your order.

396
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,680
-Bee.
-Yes.

397
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,240
Summarize the test results for me.

398
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,559
No, I'll do it.

399
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,200
I want them tomorrow by 8:00 a.m.

400
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,079
I told you I'll do it.

401
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,559
Listen, we're working as a team.

402
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,319
If we succeed, we succeed together.

403
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
I won't let one person who only
wants to play around wreck our work.

404
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,480
Just change everything
into numbers, right?

405
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,960
If you don't want her to do it,

406
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,839
I'll do it.

407
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,480
Hi, Wai.

408
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,640
Hi, Mark.

409
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,759
Still hitting on my mom?

410
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,079
You've hit the bull's eye!

411
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,519
Your mom is a very charming lady,

412
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,440
a flower among the bees.

413
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,559
Men circle her like vultures circle a…

414
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,440
Where did you learn all of this?

415
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,880
I think he's just pretending
to be a foreigner.

416
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,559
Take off your disguise, now!

417
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,799
That hurts, darling!

418
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,840
I'd better not be a nuisance
and leave the two of you alone.

419
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,199
Farewell my darling,
my heart remains with you though.

420
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,840
Kisses.

421
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:24,960
Mom,

422
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,599
I think I'll quit.

423
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,760
It's exactly what I thought it'd be,
a load of nonsense.

424
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,800
Come on, think of it as a
break from your routine.

425
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,039
You ran around a lot,
now you're learning to stay in one place.

426
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,199
You ran around a lot too,

427
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,159
and you're doing fine now.

428
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,199
I'm just like you.

429
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't like living in a box.

430
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,280
Before leaving a box,

431
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,840
you have to know what a box looks like.

432
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,440
Don't you want to at least get to know it?

433
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,760
Maybe you'll like it.

434
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,880
All work, no play makes Wai a dull girl.

435
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,039
You're a piece of work!

436
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:28,199
I tried a new formula today
and got a lot of orders from the office.

437
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,719
What do you think if

438
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,920
I quit and open a bakery?

439
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,360
Opening a shop is good,
but quitting your job is too risky.

440
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,880
You should keep doing both for now.

441
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,239
If the bakery thing really works,
you can quit your job then.

442
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,920
But if I do both I won't have
time to focus on the bakery.

443
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,480
And what if the shop fails?

444
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,480
You should have some security.

445
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,719
At least you'll have the money
to buy your materials.

446
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,280
Do you really have to go back to work?

447
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,719
Yes, there're some problems.

448
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,840
HAVE MERCY!

449
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,159
NOT APPROVED

450
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,960
This tastes good.

451
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,480
NOVEMBER 21ST
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE PRESENTATION

452
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,639
Here you are, take your envelope, please.

453
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,840
-This is yours.
-What's this?

454
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,159
Boss Anan's daughter is getting married.

455
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,320
His daughter's wedding?

456
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,559
And we're expected to give
him goodwill money?

457
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,800
But can we just not give him any money?

458
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,719
No! That'll badly affect your
performance evaluation.

459
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,920
How much should we give him?

460
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
500?

461
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,360
Are you loaded?

462
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,239
20?

463
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,559
Crazy! I give more to beggars!

464
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,400
-Let's put in 30.
-You're joking!

465
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,920
We don't have to decide now!

466
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,280
It says here they'll take credit card!

467
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
That's so cool!

468
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,039
It's a good idea.

469
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,519
What? Mine's already maxed out!

470
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
Let's take a break.

471
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,199
JOB OPENING: FINANCIAL MANAGER

472
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,199
Looking at dating sites?

473
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Life Insurance. Are you getting it?

474
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,159
Of course.

475
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,039
Badminton is a dangerous sport.
What if I broke my leg?

476
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:07,119
You should get one for yourselves too.

477
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,840
That doesn't sound like you at all!

478
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,440
Well, I think of my future too.

479
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,760
You're applying for
the financial manager position?

480
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,679
Yes.

481
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,920
-You call this handwriting?
-12 years of experience…

482
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,960
Hang on, I have to take this.

483
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,920
You're prettier than in the photo.

484
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,679
Tell me, why should we hire you?

485
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,679
Just a sec… Hello…

486
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,320
Hobby, singing karaoke.

487
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,599
Can you sing one for me now?

488
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,559
What are your weaknesses?

489
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,320
Why do you want to quit your present job?

490
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,760
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

491
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,639
Get off at Phayathai Station
and take the left exit.

492
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,840
You're coming for a job interview?

493
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,400
Not in the mood to sing?

494
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,320
Then you can dance for me!

495
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,079
I'll get back to you.

496
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,400
Don't call us.

497
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
I'll call you.

498
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,559
That's right!

499
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,440
Thank you.

500
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,880
JUE, WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAVE TO SPEND
THE NIGHT WORKING AT THE OFFICE.

501
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,320
It's so loud, can you talk?

502
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,719
I'm entertaining a client in Hong Kong,

503
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Just speak up!

504
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,000
Hong Kong?

505
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,639
Well, remember Aunt Wan?

506
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,199
Aunt Wan, Bo's mother?

507
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,599
I can't, which Wan?

508
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,000
Just tell me what you want.

509
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,559
Bo's just graduated.

510
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,400
She wants to find work in Bangkok.

511
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,360
Can you help her?

512
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,360
Will you come home for New Year's?

513
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,480
I don't know, can I tell you later?

514
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,440
I have to get back to my client now. Bye!

515
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,320
I've saved up money to be with my honey.

516
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,159
But I have to work all night,
isn't it crazy?

517
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,360
Boss always keeps us busy,
that's my life story.

518
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,199
Boss wants us to work like buffaloes.

519
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,480
That doesn't rhyme!

520
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,039
Boss and buffaloes, they don't rhyme?

521
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,320
No playing, no sleeping, no Facebook.

522
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,599
Can't take leave,
can't get sick, can't do nothin'!

523
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,159
Can't leave early, can't be sneaky,
can't show I'm sleepy.

524
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,119
I want to be buried…

525
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,440
No, that's too much…

526
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,679
I just need more coffee!

527
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,199
It seems you still have lots of energy!

528
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Is this a night of poetry?

529
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,559
Now that rhymes.

530
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,480
What about our grape supply?
Is it confirmed?

531
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,239
Let me check.

532
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,519
Just a sec, I'll check and let you know.

533
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,599
Jue, pick it up!

534
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,440
Jue, come here.

535
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,079
What's the matter?

536
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,880
Did you call to confirm
our order of grapes?

537
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,320
Did I have to call them?

538
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,239
Of course!

539
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,360
They didn't hear from us,

540
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,639
so they've already sold all the grapes!

541
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,039
We can't get any now!

542
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,639
I'm sorry… Last night, I…

543
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,880
-I came down with appendicitis.
-Cut the crap!

544
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,519
Last month you had that too.

545
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,800
How many appendices do you have, huh?

546
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,280
Get me some grapes now!

547
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,440
-Grow it, rob it, steal it, I don't care!
-Calm down.

548
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,320
Do we have any other suppliers?

549
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,840
No. They must've sold their supply by now.

550
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,159
We just lost our last one.

551
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,039
Still got some?

552
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,760
So I'll see you there, okay?

553
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,920
Well, I know a supplier.

554
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,239
If you still want it.

555
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:07,599
DECEMBER 7TH

556
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,039
2 WEEKS BEFORE PRESENTATION

557
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:12,199
We're going to a vineyard,
not going sailing.

558
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,920
Sure, this is my vineyard costume.

559
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,639
If you want me to help you drive,
just say, okay?

560
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,480
Full tank.

561
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,280
I'll get some snacks,
do you want anything?

562
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,519
Iced coffee.

563
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,800
Sorry, I can't go with you.

564
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,760
This trip is very critical to my project.

565
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,159
Are you at the wedding?

566
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,360
Yes. Look, it's so beautiful!

567
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,719
A gazebo by the sea, just like in a movie!

568
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,079
Everything is so casual and cool.
Let's do it like this!

569
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,800
But it's so far from Bangkok.
Not many people would want to show up.

570
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,119
We'd get little goodwill money.

571
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,400
But a wedding is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

572
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,280
Who's that?

573
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:42,559
Just my staff.

574
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,840
I'll go back this evening, see you soon.

575
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,360
Okay. Bye.

576
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,880
This is yummy, want some?

577
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,800
I don't eat junk food.

578
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,360
Where's my iced coffee?

579
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,920
You already got it.

580
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,719
No, I didn't.

581
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,119
Really?

582
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,760
I bought it! Where is it?

583
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,320
It can't have just vanished!

584
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,480
The market price at this moment…

585
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,480
We can make a higher offer than--

586
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,840
Yes, the Full Moon Party is so wild!

587
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,800
Sex on the beach, huh?

588
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
Not that wild!

589
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,960
I also went to sell postcards
in Chiang Khan, there!

590
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:47,000
Lots of sexy young things.

591
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,760
It's cold up there
so they're all wrapped up,

592
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,000
not to my taste.

593
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,840
Then you have to go to Phuket.

594
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,800
I took a Japanese group there.

595
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,920
The girls were super-hot!

596
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,960
That hot? If they sweat with me
I wouldn't mind at all!

597
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,280
You have to stay the night
so we can party!

598
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,679
Sure thing!

599
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,440
Joy, I can't go back tonight.

600
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,039
Let's get sloshed!

601
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,280
Yippie! Get sloshed!

602
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,880
So will you sell me your grapes?

603
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,719
I will, but don't talk about it now
or I'll change my mind!

604
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,840
No more ice? How can we party without ice?

605
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,840
-No ice, no deal!
-No ice, no deal!

606
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:40,719
What is it with women and snacks?

607
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,559
You're drunk and you still want to snack.

608
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,199
Snacks these days suck,

609
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,360
they don't give you free goodies
in the bag anymore.

610
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,599
So you like snacks
or you like the goodies?

611
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,599
It's not like those Japanese snacks
that come with cartoon stickers.

612
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:57,559
You know that too!
I thought you didn't eat junk food.

613
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,599
I never ate it,
I just bought it to get the stickers.

614
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,280
Really? Me too!

615
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,559
My friends at school threw away
the snacks and kept only the stickers!

616
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:10,760
Right! What were the popular ones?

617
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,280
Dragon Ball!

618
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,840
And the animal set!

619
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,119
The World Cup stickers too!

620
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,360
And there was this one
that was so hard to find.

621
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,800
I had to trade so many stickers to get it.

622
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Then you know what?

623
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,559
It turned out to be a fake!

624
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,880
Did you ever get that?

625
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,000
Wai?

626
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,840
Come on, you just bragged about
your epic boozing in Pai!

627
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Sissy.

628
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,239
A hangover?

629
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,679
No, but my stomach feels weird.

630
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,840
Who painted this?

631
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,800
It's very quirky.

632
00:50:58,119 --> 00:50:59,719
That little drunk did.

633
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,440
She's always dreamt of being a cartoonist.

634
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,280
She talks about it all the time.

635
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,079
But this picture is an image
from my own dream.

636
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,320
In that shallow grave is my wife!

637
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,320
Keep dreaming, old bugger!

638
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,639
The third row? I'll follow you there.

639
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,239
HIS NOSE IS RED 'CAUSE
HE DIPPED IT INTO THE PAINT.

640
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,239
I'M BOILING…

641
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,719
Here, your dream.

642
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,280
Tell me, why did you come
to work at the office?

643
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Mom made me.

644
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,480
But I'll quit soon.

645
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,679
Just bear with me for a while.

646
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,400
Do you write down
everything you want to do?

647
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,320
Yes.

648
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,719
Don't you get tired of doing
everything like clockwork?

649
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,280
And don't you get tired of being
so random and unorganized?

650
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:14,519
No. Your way is more boring.

651
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,320
"10 Things to Do Next Year."

652
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:19,480
You plan ahead into next year?

653
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,320
Do you already have a plan
for where to die?

654
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,599
You should try.

655
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,360
Maybe you can realize your
dream of being a cartoonist.

656
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,280
You don't know a thing.

657
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,119
If it were that easy I'd be famous by now.

658
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:38,800
What I need is some inspiration.

659
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,960
Whoa! That's deep!

660
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,119
And don't you have a dream?

661
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,559
You're obsessed with making money.

662
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,280
It's called "security."

663
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,000
Security? There's no such thing.

664
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,000
A truck might ram into this car
and kill us at the next curve.

665
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,599
The more things are insecure,
the more carefully we have to prepare.

666
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,360
Wai.

667
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
Wai?

668
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,880
Wai?

669
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,000
What's wrong?

670
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:25,719
What?

671
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:33,239
So this is what an appendix looks like.

672
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,440
First time I've ever seen one.

673
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:37,199
-Look.
-Disgusting!

674
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,639
You have one in you too!

675
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,719
Bee, that's for the patient!

676
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,840
Next, you'll be eating the hamper!

677
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,239
No way!

678
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,559
Hello, Pan.

679
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,519
So, is this part of your "insecurity"?

680
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm sure you didn't plan
to have your appendix removed.

681
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:57,000
It's not funny,
why don't you pay this month's salary now?

682
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:59,760
Payday is weeks away!

683
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,679
-Shouldn't you take care of your staff?
-I can lend you some.

684
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,239
SINCE WHEN ARE THEY BEST BUDDIES?

685
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,320
I thought the company
had welfare benefits.

686
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,599
HE MUST'VE ALREADY STORMED HER BARN!

687
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,840
You just joined us, you're not covered.

688
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,960
WAI!

689
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,400
I'll lend it to you first.
You can pay me back in installments.

690
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
You want to charge interest!

691
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,440
CUT OFF HER OXYGEN

692
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,760
Not in the first six months, okay?

693
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,760
SHE'S NOT ON OXYGEN

694
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,000
My mom will come tomorrow.

695
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,159
PUT HER APPENDIX BACK

696
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:26,440
They already did it!

697
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:28,280
THEY ALREADY DID IT!

698
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,519
Who did what?

699
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,360
The numbers for the project.

700
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,800
We just did the calculation together.

701
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,199
It's late, I should get going.

702
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,320
-It's just 7:00!
-I go to bed early.

703
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,280
I'm going too, take care.

704
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,480
Thank you. Bye!

705
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,239
You'll have time to read these.

706
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,880
GET RICH QUICK

707
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,280
Are you insane?

708
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,320
Who'd want to read these in a hospital?

709
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,840
I like this one.

710
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,000
And you should read this too.

711
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,960
"10 Things You Should Do Next Year."

712
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,079
Read it.

713
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:23,320
If I were you,

714
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,639
I'd plan ahead what to do
and what not to do next year.

715
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:32,960
Why?

716
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:37,199
We have freedom,
we can do anything or go anywhere

717
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,079
as long as we don't burden others,

718
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:40,360
isn't that enough?

719
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,880
Do you really think your life
belongs only to you?

720
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,039
Now, you can go backpacking
anywhere you want.

721
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,920
You have freedom, you're happy.

722
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,400
But what about 5 years from now?

723
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,320
What about in 10 years or 20?

724
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,800
Don't you want to be more
and do more for other people?

725
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:01,719
Take them back.

726
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:12,039
Excuse me, bath time.

727
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,480
DECEMBER 20TH

728
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,800
1 DAY BEFORE PRESENTATION

729
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,280
Boss Pan!

730
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,800
We sent the wrong file to the printer.

731
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,840
What's this?

732
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,400
A label for fabric softener.

733
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:34,840
This company sells beverages.

734
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,599
Haven't I told you not to do freelance
work in the office?

735
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,320
You know it's tomorrow, right?

736
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,079
Can we present the project
without the label?

737
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,400
I told you we'd need it!

738
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,000
No, I'll go!

739
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,920
-I'll come with you!
-Why?

740
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You're a drag!

741
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,559
So we'll use this copy:

742
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:16,320
"The beverage that enhances your health."

743
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,440
Okay.

744
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,000
We'll also sell skin benefits
to female consumers, right?

745
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,320
Yes, and how many kinds
of minerals do we have?

746
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,440
16.

747
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:26,039
Why does it say 13 here? Who wrote this?

748
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,360
At first, you said 13!
When did it become 16?

749
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,159
It was always 16! Ask her!

750
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:33,559
Power out! We still haven't printed it!

751
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,159
We still haven't printed it!

752
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,079
Wait!

753
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,159
We need you to print something.

754
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:45,199
We're closed for the New Year.

755
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,440
Hang on!

756
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,039
This is urgent, please!

757
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:52,239
No, we're closed.

758
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:55,159
Did you turn off the air-con?

759
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:59,719
So it's you! We're still working,
why did you cut the power?

760
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,400
It wasn't me! The whole building is out!

761
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,079
It's back!

762
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:09,079
-Damn, it's a mess.
-Shit!

763
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:13,519
The power outage must've
knocked out the hard drive!

764
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,079
What's in there?

765
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:17,440
Every file we need for tomorrow.

766
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,880
Please!

767
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,280
Just pop in this CD and press print,
it'll only take a few minutes!

768
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,039
-Please, I beg you!
-No.

769
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,400
I'm in deep shit, please help me!
Have some mercy!

770
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,400
No.

771
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,039
Can't you say something else, huh?

772
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,599
Are you dumb? All you can say is "No"?

773
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,639
I apologize on behalf of my trainee.

774
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,840
What?

775
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,639
I'm the son of the managing director.

776
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,320
Huh?

777
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:51,280
Was the UPS on?

778
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,079
-It's broken.
-Why didn't you send it to the center?

779
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,599
I've requested a new one,
but the order hasn't been approved.

780
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:00,360
My team never got anything approved,
unlike their team!

781
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,280
-It's not true!
-How could you say that?

782
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,760
-I even have to buy my own pens!
-No!

783
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,079
My company has been your client
for a long time.

784
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,400
My dad is very close to your boss,
Sornchai.

785
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,239
This project is worth a billion baht.

786
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,000
What would your boss say

787
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,639
if he knew you closed the door on us?

788
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,079
Yes, a billion baht!

789
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:35,519
SORNCHAI PRINTING

790
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,400
Stop it!

791
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,559
We've lost the files,
so we'll do it again!

792
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,519
All right? We still have time.

793
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,000
Not again!

794
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,159
What's that noise?

795
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,880
Your dad's close to Boss Sornchai?

796
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,199
SIRACHAI PRINTING

797
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,719
And what's my boss's name again?

798
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:21,239
Sirachai, yes, it's a tongue twister!

799
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,360
Right, he didn't say it clearly.

800
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,599
SIRICHAI PRINTING

801
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,639
That's it, Sirichai!
I respect him like my own uncle!

802
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:34,559
Sirichai, of course!

803
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:36,679
Let's not push it.

804
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,400
My room has an entire
stock of office supplies.

805
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,000
Papers, staples,
printers, ink, everything.

806
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,119
But we lost the files
that took us a whole month to finish.

807
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:48,800
I don't think we can do
it all again in one night.

808
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,280
Luckily, I backed up
everything two days ago.

809
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:00,039
-Bee!
-Sorry!

810
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:04,199
It's broken!
Listen, some screws are loose.

811
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,599
-It's gone.
-We're finished.

812
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:13,920
Luckily,

813
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,440
I have two more backup drives at home.

814
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:19,800
Two more…

815
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,480
Go now.

816
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,199
I don't want to miss my last bus home.

817
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,360
Please listen to us!

818
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,880
Okay, I'll pay you

819
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,480
5,000 baht extra.

820
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,159
City slickers…

821
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,960
You think money can buy everything?

822
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,639
You always have to get what you want!

823
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,119
You never think of other
people's feelings.

824
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,719
Please forgive my trainee.

825
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,719
See what you've done, huh?

826
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,239
Hey, bro…

827
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,800
I know how hard it is

828
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,480
for poor country people

829
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:14,719
who've come to work in Bangkok.

830
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:18,119
But the reason you keep working hard

831
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,440
is because

832
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,440
of those who're waiting for you at home.

833
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,840
I'm…

834
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,079
I'm exactly in your shoes.

835
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,280
Stop it.

836
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:37,039
Well…

837
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,480
I haven't gone home in 5 years.

838
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,639
Hurry up.

839
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:47,800
I still want to go see my mother.

840
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,719
So you'll do it for us?

841
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,239
Shut up and come in!

842
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,800
So you're not from Bangkok either?

843
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,599
I look like a city guy
but I'm from the South.

844
01:03:57,679 --> 01:03:59,800
Thank you so much!

845
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,480
Get the CD, the computer's in there.

846
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:03,639
Come in.

847
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,960
Power sockets are here and behind the TV.

848
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,079
Kitchen's here.

849
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:15,920
And the toilet.

850
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,280
Boss Pan,

851
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,360
I don't think we'll make it. We should
tell them to postpone the presentation.

852
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't think it's worth
putting so much time and effort into it.

853
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,679
Yesterday,

854
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,039
Bee had a bout of dyspepsia again.

855
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:45,159
We're employees,

856
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:46,360
not slaves.

857
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,679
They can't order us around.

858
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,840
And the spare change called "bonus"
that they use to seduce us…

859
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,519
we're not begging for it.

860
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:10,280
I know…

861
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,719
that the reason you all come to work

862
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,480
is not just to get paid every month.

863
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,239
Every time

864
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,719
we launch a new product

865
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,599
we're excited

866
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,800
to see if it'll become a hit.

867
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,159
You know that feeling, don't you?

868
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,840
Think about it.

869
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,360
Besides money,

870
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,239
what're we doing this for?

871
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,920
Tonight, we're doing it for that thing.

872
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,840
Not for the company.

873
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:07,119
Let's do it.

874
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,440
So we'll use,
"Everyday drink for your health"?

875
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,320
-Yes.
-I'll print it now.

876
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:27,920
Wai! When did you get out?

877
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,199
Just this evening.
I called Nan and we came straight here.

878
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,159
-You're sure you're okay?
-I'm super-fine, look!

879
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,280
Blood!

880
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,599
Wait, lie down first!

881
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:45,960
Should I call an ambulance?

882
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:49,880
Easy, easy!

883
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,000
We got it!

884
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,960
-Great! Let's get the mock-up done!
-Yes.

885
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,960
Oat, let's finish the mock-up.

886
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,800
And the bottles?

887
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,440
Bee!

888
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:07,360
That's work, you can't drink it!

889
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,360
I'm sorry, I'm thirsty!

890
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,480
Snacks, everyone!

891
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:26,800
We'd better do it like this.

892
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,800
We should tweak this a little too,
don't you think?

893
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,000
Have some water.

894
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:34,440
Jue…

895
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,119
Thanks.

896
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,239
I know you're working,
but it's already midnight.

897
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,480
No, it's 2:00 in the morning!

898
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:55,760
It's a racket in there!

899
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,440
-My son couldn't go to sleep!
-Your boy's so cute!

900
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,679
-What's his name?
-Poon.

901
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,039
Look!

902
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,079
Come on, kiddo.
Scare her with a ghost face.

903
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:09,760
-Nice one!
-Scary!

904
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,719
Look who's scarier!

905
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,239
You're popping your eyes out!

906
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,800
Do it again, son!

907
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:19,520
Can you do better than me?

908
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:22,359
Super scary!

909
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,199
Brilliant!

910
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,239
You dazzled me with your numbers and data!

911
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,399
What did the board think?

912
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,239
They seemed to like it.

913
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,720
But they've decided to shelve it for now.

914
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,239
They want to wait until the price
of grapes goes down first.

915
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:03,239
And what about…

916
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:06,479
the bonus?

917
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:09,960
With the project shelved

918
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,319
and the economy being as it is,

919
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,239
I don't think we'll get any bonus.

920
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,800
But maybe we will…

921
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,640
-Or maybe not.
-Mr. Anan…

922
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:24,159
Pan…

923
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:29,319
This is the reality of office life.

924
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,399
Mr. Anan!

925
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,399
Pan, what's up?

926
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:54,439
We've been working so hard the whole year.

927
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,079
I think the company should reward us.

928
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,359
And the right thing to do…

929
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:03,119
is for you to go

930
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,439
and convince them to approve the bonus.

931
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:13,399
Pan. All you think about is money, right?

932
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,000
You're right, I want money.

933
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:24,680
And I think it's the same for everybody.

934
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,520
What's wrong with wanting
to earn more money to improve our lives?

935
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,960
And most importantly,

936
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,319
it's the money we deserve.

937
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,560
Okay, I'll think about it.

938
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:41,560
Mr. Anan,

939
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:45,760
that's what I say
when I actually want to say, "No."

940
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:49,239
Correct.

941
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:26,680
It's all right.

942
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,199
DECEMBER 24TH

943
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,560
CHRISTMAS EVE

944
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:50,319
I got it, sir.

945
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,840
But I only got the 1-meter Christmas tree,
the 2-meter ones are sold out.

946
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,239
Only 1 meter?

947
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,520
My son's party won't be so grand then!

948
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,039
So…

949
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:02,960
Can you try again tomorrow?

950
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:04,600
Tomorrow?

951
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,159
Okay, Boss.

952
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:24,920
To Sai Noi.

953
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,960
-Sai Noi.
-No.

954
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:37,239
-At least take me to Kae Rai.
-I'm not going.

955
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:39,319
Take me to Mo Chit at least.

956
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:42,880
Okay, take me wherever you're going.

957
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,159
Not going?

958
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:56,279
Really?

959
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,439
PROJECT SHELVED. NO BONUS!

960
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,399
Taking a cab from Asoke to Sai Noi,

961
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,600
your job must be very well-paid.

962
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:50,720
I just got off late. No more buses,
I have to take a cab.

963
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,680
You're not turning here?
It's a detour if you go straight.

964
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,439
This is my job, I know what I'm doing!

965
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:08,640
YES! MY FIRST BOOK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED!

966
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:15,079
COME CHECK OUT THE NEW COLLECTION
AT MY SHOP!

967
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,760
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, I'M SO HAPPY!

968
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:25,479
COME TO THE NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY.

969
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,760
FROM MR. ANAN: BRING GIFT BASKETS
TO OUR AGENTS ON NYE.

970
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,880
Dumbass! Keep left if you're so damn slow!

971
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:57,520
Can't you let me pass! Rich asshole!

972
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:01,439
These office people work
in air-con rooms all day.

973
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,239
Done at 5:00 p.m., have weekends off.

974
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:07,279
Long holidays during
New Year and festivals.

975
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,479
More choices. Good pay.

976
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:11,960
Bonuses every year.

977
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:14,319
Move! I'm trying to make a living here!

978
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:15,520
Damn it!

979
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,960
Everyone's making a living, get it?

980
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:19,359
Does it look like I'm begging, huh?

981
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,520
Making a living?
You didn't even turn on the damn meter!

982
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,199
Go left, trust me!

983
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,760
Are you dumb? Just drive as I tell you to!

984
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,600
Do exactly as I say, get it?

985
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,880
How do you know office work is cozy, huh?

986
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,439
It's a pain in the freakin' ass!

987
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,560
You want to quit driving
and try the office?

988
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,359
Left, I said left, left, left!

989
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:44,399
You missed it!

990
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:47,680
Make a U-turn! Step on it!

991
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:49,119
Go!

992
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,920
You have to wait until the board
meeting this Friday.

993
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,119
I'll refer it back to you
and we'll go from there.

994
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,119
Yes.

995
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,960
When can you start?

996
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,960
After the New Year.

997
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:20,159
Don't you have to clear
your work at the office?

998
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,920
To hell with it…

999
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,079
I mean, I don't have to.

1000
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,119
-So you'll take me?
-Yes.

1001
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,000
Thank you! Thank you!

1002
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,319
Please don't change your mind!

1003
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:36,520
DECEMBER 28TH

1004
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,840
LAST WORK DAY OF THE YEAR

1005
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,720
This is your evaluation.

1006
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,239
I hope you understand.

1007
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:43,760
Sign here.

1008
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,880
JUE LAKSAMEEPONG, TRAINEE

1009
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:00,199
MANAGING DIRECTOR

1010
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,079
PLEASE APPROVE APPOINTMENT
OF NEW HR MANAGER

1011
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,560
Yes.

1012
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,960
Really?

1013
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:15,159
Joy! The Korean headquarters wants me
to move there next year!

1014
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,079
Come with me!

1015
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,680
How can I do that?

1016
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,199
We can move together.

1017
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,000
We sell the car
and rent out the apartment.

1018
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,279
And don't worry about work.

1019
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:27,199
They'll pay me four times more
than what I earn now!

1020
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:28,680
I can take care of you.

1021
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,520
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, right?

1022
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:50,000
It's time for the biggest prize!

1023
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,079
Which team will win
our fancy-dress competition?

1024
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:58,520
This is the "Uniform" category!

1025
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,640
And the winners are…

1026
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,560
Nan's team!

1027
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,840
Nan's team!

1028
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,520
It's a great dress.
Must've spent a lot of money on it!

1029
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,560
Mr. Anan will do the honor
of giving out the prize.

1030
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:24,920
The prize from our MD
must be something special!

1031
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,159
I think it's an iPad.

1032
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:36,479
No, it's a water filter!

1033
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,119
Nan, how do you feel?

1034
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,560
I'm overjoyed!

1035
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,600
A water filter is great.

1036
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,720
Maybe things will flow
more smoothly around here.

1037
01:22:50,359 --> 01:22:52,600
See, everything's stuck,

1038
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,840
especially the bonus!

1039
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,800
Am I right?

1040
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,720
Of course I am

1041
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,479
because the manager
has spent all the profit!

1042
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,039
Well, for our own safety

1043
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,159
-let's move on to the dance floor!
-Music!

1044
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,239
What's this uniform?

1045
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,039
EXACT CHANGE ONLY

1046
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,079
Look at this!

1047
01:23:57,159 --> 01:24:01,640
Easy, easy! Don't tear the plastic!

1048
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,680
Wait!

1049
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,159
Bee,

1050
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:09,600
we can't put this in Eiw's car anyway.

1051
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,520
-Just leave it here!
-No!

1052
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,720
I got this from the draw.
How could I just dump it?

1053
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,840
I'll go pee, come with me.

1054
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
This is nonsense!

1055
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:23,680
Why did they get a mattress as a prize?

1056
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,279
How can we bring it back?

1057
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:31,039
-Wai, you've been here three months.
-Yes.

1058
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:32,760
So you're leaving us.

1059
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:34,680
What's your plan next?

1060
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,479
I'll help my friend
run a resort on Kood Island.

1061
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,880
Sounds like a good life.

1062
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,159
Good luck!

1063
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:44,680
Thanks.

1064
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:48,880
You can't fall asleep here!

1065
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,479
One, two, three!

1066
01:24:57,039 --> 01:24:59,079
I can't do this!

1067
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:02,079
I told you to leave it but you insisted!

1068
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,560
Come on! One, two, three!

1069
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:46,880
I've never seen Boss Pan
this lively before.

1070
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,520
He must be so happy to be moving to Korea.

1071
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,920
Look at this move!

1072
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,520
Are you taking any trips
over the New Year?

1073
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:45,960
I don't know.

1074
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,199
Have you finished writing,
"10 Things I Have To Do Next Year?"

1075
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:04,560
I don't know what to write down.

1076
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:07,399
You? Don't know what to write?

1077
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:12,640
Because of this Korean job,
you have to change your plan…

1078
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:18,760
I'm not going anywhere.

1079
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:24,600
Why not?

1080
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,800
Let me ask you something.

1081
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,119
When people talk about their "dreams,"

1082
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,079
it's always about…

1083
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,720
opening a bakery…

1084
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:47,319
writing a book…

1085
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,319
writing songs,

1086
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:52,680
or making movies. Right?

1087
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,920
Me, I want to make a lot of money…

1088
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,399
so I can take good care
of the people I love.

1089
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:07,640
Doesn't that count as a dream too?

1090
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:24,600
DECEMBER 31ST

1091
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,800
NEW YEAR'S EVE

1092
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,239
HONG KONG TRIP

1093
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:59,119
JOY'S BIRTHDAY

1094
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,319
8TH ANNIVERSARY

1095
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:13,479
CHOOSE A RING

1096
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:52,159
Mom…

1097
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,520
Is it okay if I'm not coming home?

1098
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,319
I have some problems at work.

1099
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,000
I have to go to…

1100
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,960
It's all right, son.

1101
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:13,239
I'll tell Aunt Wan you're busy.

1102
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:15,319
You have to have some rest too.

1103
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:17,600
I know work is important,

1104
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,760
but don't get sick because of it.

1105
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,760
Mom.

1106
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,880
Actually…

1107
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:29,439
about my work…

1108
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,279
it's not as good as I told you.

1109
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,600
It's all right.

1110
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,319
I understand.

1111
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,439
Bangkok…

1112
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,760
is a tough place.

1113
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,680
It's never easy.

1114
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,199
Just do your best.

1115
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,520
Don't care how others look at you.

1116
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,119
Let them say what they want.

1117
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:08,000
I don't care if people think

1118
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:10,319
you're not as good as they are.

1119
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,079
I'm so happy that you've tried so hard.

1120
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:19,800
Look, I've made your favorite curries.

1121
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,239
Lots of them.

1122
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,359
If you can, come back to taste it.

1123
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,279
Going to a countdown party?

1124
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,159
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1125
01:31:55,239 --> 01:31:57,920
Mr. Surachet, it's me, Nuch.

1126
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,600
Boss Anan asked me
to bring you the presents.

1127
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,600
Here you are!

1128
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:06,560
I've heard you on the phone so many times!

1129
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,680
This is Surasak, Surachai, and Surachart.

1130
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,439
Nice to meet you all.

1131
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,399
I'd better go now.

1132
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:15,640
Wait!

1133
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,960
We were just saying

1134
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:20,520
that since you took over
from the previous secretary,

1135
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,359
everything has been running so smoothly.

1136
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:23,600
Thank you.

1137
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,840
Let me put it frankly…

1138
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,840
Come work with me.

1139
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,439
What? I was about to ask her!

1140
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,640
You didn't!

1141
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,359
I run a big business and
offer good benefits!

1142
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:41,359
-I asked her first!
-I'll double your salary!

1143
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:43,479
Plus a 4-month bonus

1144
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,720
No traffic here on New Year's Eve.

1145
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:00,960
But we'll get stuck on the highway.

1146
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:04,239
We'll be in the mountains by sunrise.

1147
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:06,359
-Stop the car!
-What?

1148
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,039
Someone left the light on in my office!

1149
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:11,039
So? Will you go and turn it off?

1150
01:33:12,279 --> 01:33:15,439
Tell me, all this saving you've
done over the years…

1151
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,239
Has someone ever said thank you?

1152
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,119
Stop! Stop!

1153
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,319
Are you out of your mind?

1154
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,119
I'm asking you, have they ever
thanked you for what you've done?

1155
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:29,640
I told you to stop!

1156
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:19,960
BEST ENERGY-SAVING COMPANY

1157
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,640
Who turned off the light?

1158
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:51,119
We're waiting for the fireworks!

1159
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:54,479
Let's eat.

1160
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,159
Go on, make it spicy.

1161
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:03,560
What?

1162
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,119
No, Mr. Chai!

1163
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:28,279
To watch the fireworks,

1164
01:35:29,079 --> 01:35:30,680
you have to turn off the light.

1165
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:33,319
They'll be even brighter.

1166
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,600
Mr. Chai, please join us.

1167
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,199
Have some grilled fish.

1168
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:43,840
-Your plate.
-Give him some.

1169
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,880
My husband.

1170
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,199
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1171
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:49,720
This is my daughter,
and this is my grandson.

1172
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,880
He's a young man now!

1173
01:35:55,159 --> 01:36:00,239
We should go to the expressway
to watch the fireworks!

1174
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,880
Shut up!

1175
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,199
Don't shout into my ears!

1176
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:09,359
Don't! Swallow it!

1177
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,039
This is your car, and you're wasted!

1178
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:18,720
You guys are hopeless.

1179
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,279
If I weren't here who'd be driving you?!

1180
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:33,920
Nan, from us.

1181
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,520
Lovely!

1182
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:40,119
Thank you!

1183
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,680
I crack up just seeing Bee's face!

1184
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,920
You can put it on your new desk.

1185
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:57,920
So you know?

1186
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,199
Yes.

1187
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:05,079
And we don't want you to leave!

1188
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:07,840
Please don't leave us!

1189
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,359
Help me convince her!

1190
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:14,359
It's for her own good!

1191
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,359
And don't do that, it's dangerous!

1192
01:37:19,399 --> 01:37:22,319
You will cause trouble.

1193
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:23,800
What's that light?

1194
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,119
Nan!

1195
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,960
Hang in there, I'll go get help.

1196
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:34,319
Sargent!

1197
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:36,000
Sargent.

1198
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:40,760
Let my friend out!
We haven't been drinking!

1199
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,960
Sargent, this thing is broken! Try it!

1200
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,560
I'm a captain, not a sergeant!

1201
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,720
If you won't let her out,
put us in there too!

1202
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:56,439
Come on, lock us all in there!

1203
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,439
We're coming, Nan, we won't leave you!

1204
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,239
Throw us in there!

1205
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,880
Do it now!

1206
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,680
"10 Things You Should Do Next Year."

1207
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,960
1. Name files in a way that
people can understand.

1208
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:18,680
2. Remove the virus in your thumb drive.

1209
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:22,319
3. Stop using slang in office documents.

1210
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,960
4. Sort out your social security.
It'll help if you get fired.

1211
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,520
5. Make a financial plan
in case of a family emergency.

1212
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:38,399
6. Join a writer's workshop.

1213
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,640
7. Don't go backpacking just

1214
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,439
because famous writers
make it seem glamorous!

1215
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,199
Bus to Trat is leaving now!

1216
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:52,640
8. Even artists need to plan.

1217
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,239
Draft your manuscript carefully.

1218
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,159
9. It's hard.

1219
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,079
But if you don't start,
you won't go anywhere.

1220
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,520
10. If you fail, start again.

1221
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,920
Don't lose heart,

1222
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,439
because at least you know you've
done something.

1223
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,399
Do it now.

1224
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,640
Hi! Looking for your friend?

1225
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:58,560
Yes.

1226
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,880
He's on the rooftop
waiting for the fireworks.

1227
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,520
Go on, my son's up there too.

1228
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,640
Thank you.

1229
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:03,239
You said you didn't know

1230
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:05,319
what your New Year's resolution was.

1231
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,840
So I wrote down some for you.

1232
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,079
First,

1233
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,720
be strict with yourself.

1234
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:35,079
But cut other people some slack.

1235
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,399
Do crazy things.

1236
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:45,119
Because it can make people smile.

1237
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,760
Snacking.

1238
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:53,600
It's not healthy for the body,

1239
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:55,479
but it is for the mind.

1240
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,560
Make your plan flexible.

1241
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,840
Because even when things go wrong,
it doesn't kill anybody.

1242
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,680
And forget your past mistakes.

1243
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,159
Because you've done your best.

1244
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:28,479
That's all

1245
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,159
I could think of.

1246
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:34,439
Maybe

1247
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,600
you want to try it.

1248
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:14,760
APRIL 1ST

1249
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,720
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE NEW YEAR

1250
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,800
I never get how they can stand it.

1251
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:25,840
Wake up before dawn,
get stuck in horrendous traffic,

1252
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,680
only to arrive and toil away
in cramped cubicles all day.

1253
01:45:29,479 --> 01:45:30,800
Vacations?

1254
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:33,239
Only on long weekends

1255
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,319
when the whole country is overrun
by holiday-hungry mobs.

1256
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,279
If they've had enough,

1257
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,239
they can't just jump ship.

1258
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:42,319
Why? They have bills to pay.

1259
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:45,359
Their fate is sealed until
the day they retire.

1260
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:46,520
SUPER SALARYMAN

1261
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,399
The only consolation along the way

1262
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,039
is the year-end bonus.

1263
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,479
-It's green.
-So soon?

1264
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,319
I mean your eyes, not the light!

1265
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,119
I see.

1266
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:03,039
INVESTED AMOUNT

1267
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,840
When will you begin your master's degree?

1268
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,960
Next year.

1269
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,920
Hi!

1270
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,840
SURACHET COMMERCE

1271
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,920
She bought it!

1272
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,199
Jit! I've told you not to dry
your salted meat here!

1273
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:49,039
It's not mine!

1274
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:52,239
Who else would do this? It's yours! Jit!

1275
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,159
Two iced teas,
two black coffees, and two coffees.

1276
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:04,359
Are you Jue?

1277
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,640
Bo, Aunt Wan's daughter!
Didn't you recognize me?

1278
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:12,960
I almost didn't!

1279
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:19,119
I never get how they can stand it.

1280
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,199
Maybe it's not just money

1281
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,760
that makes them get up
to go to work every day.

1282
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,800
STORY OUTLINE, CHARACTERS, SETTINGS

1283
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,319
A package for you!

1284
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,359
NO VIRUS, AND WITH A CAP!

1285
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,159
THE STORY IS INTERESTING

1286
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,399
THE DRAWING IS LOVELY AND UNIQUE

1287
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:04,840
THE GAGS ARE SPREAD OUT
AND WORK JUST FINE

1288
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,920
THE FIRST PART DRAGS A LITTLE,
BUT CAN BE PERFECT WITH SOME EDITING

1289
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,319
ALL IN ALL, AN IMPRESSIVE FIRST BOOK

1290
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:09,239
THINGS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER:

1291
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:10,279
1. DESIGN AN ATTRACTIVE COVER

1292
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:11,520
2. DON'T USE HIGH-QUALITY PAPER,
TOO EXPENSIVE

1293
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,800
3. 100 BAHT RETAIL PRICE IS THE BEST

1294
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,079
PERFECT TO PAY FOR WITH A 100-BAHT NOTE

1295
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,960
ARE YOU FREE OVER THE LONG WEEKEND?
