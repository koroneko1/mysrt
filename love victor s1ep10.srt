I totally understand wanting to give Mia

the perfect night before you come clean.

You can't control

That's a first.

Okay, uh...

514
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,960
Your mother and I,
we've been talking a lot,

515
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,839
uh, about the way things have been
between us lately.

used to be.

Roger...

519
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,021
It happened for a reason.

520
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,108
We've been off for a long time.

521
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:15,362
And after you called us out, mijo,
we were able to admit it,

522
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,282
and stop pretending that we're okay.

523
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:22,160
And it took so much weight off,
for, for the both of us.

We were so young when we met.

We were basically your age.

00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:33,213
Um, and over the years, we've changed.

527
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,548
So...

528
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,094
We just need to take a step back, and...

529
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:45,809
...figure out if after all this time,
we still make sense together.

530
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:50,564
‐ Yeah. And we think that
the best way to do that is...

531
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,321
...for us to spend some time apart.
