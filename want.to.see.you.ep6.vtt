00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.139
Such a halfway gossip woman!
 If I were her, I would follow him!

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.139
Stop being nosy!

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:44.748
They tell, and I just  listen! 

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:46.694
Do you want to go with them?

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:53.466
So? Do you want to say something?

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:58.441
You... Are you really blind?

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.494
Do you want to see the test result?

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:07.557
Maybe I don't need to.

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.614
If I had been able to see you,

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:13.642
it'd have been more than just a kiss earlier.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.378
Hello, sister!

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:46.378
Why haven't you left yet?

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.632
I don't want to be here either.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.628
Then leave?

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.863
The main gate is open. The backdoor is unlocked!

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.159
Can you help me take Thach's money?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.863
Do you have no sense of shame?

00:03:01.863 --> 00:03:03.863
Don't you feel ashamed when you say that?

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:05.864
You want to be beaten again, don't you?

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.428
Just think. Will anyone in this house protect you?

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:13.271
And you?

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.820
You think you can stay with Thach for the rest of your life?

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:17.801
What do you mean?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.188
You've done everything to stop every romance of Thach.

00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:25.520
Hey! Have you seen the photo I sent you?

00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:30.398
I think you'll need to try really hard to chase another one away.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.544
Thank for warning me.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.170
I know what I need to do.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.489
I like girls who take the initiative.

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:40.692
Good luck to you!

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:04.367
Sign the paper, and I'll leave right away.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.395
I don't want to waste my time anymore.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.355
Just think of giving me this restaurant as a payment for my youth.

00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:13.515
I treated you too well, and you became this? 

00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:16.496
I have this only way to live my life.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.007
Why did you leave me then?

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.865
You kicked me out first!

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:23.865
When did I do that?

00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:33.098
Whatever happened, I'm back.

00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:37.362
I only left when you were in the hospital.

00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.088
It was me who hired a helper for you!

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.509
You left and then came back.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.729
You asked me to give you my restaurant.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.101
I really pity your ego.

00:04:56.566 --> 00:04:58.209
Okay, fine.

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.209
I'll sign it.

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.418
Will you really do it?

00:05:06.327 --> 00:05:08.327
I'll give you one restaurant,

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:12.124
but it's not the one you want.

00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:15.122
Have a traveling to the West.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.606
You can't!

00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:18.606
Please.

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.649
From now on, just think that we're strangers.

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:25.609
Phuc.

00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:27.929
Bring me the files on the table.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:31.136
Yes.

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:49.504
Sign it.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.946
Such a shameless woman!

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:52.946
After getting rid of a toxic relationship,

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.946
his life will be less stressful.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.892
Get out of here! 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.333
Don't blame me if you're still here!

00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:05.525
You should be careful with your eyes.

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.525
Being angry too often is not good for you.

00:07:07.525 --> 00:07:09.218
I don't need your pity!

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.410
Leave!

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.680
I tear fish for you to eat

00:07:59.123 --> 00:08:01.123
Fish is nutritious, eating it will be good for the eyes

00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:05.690
Grandparents say eat a lot of fish, maybe your eyes will recover.

00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:23.216
What do you say wrong?

00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:26.861
You keep eating

00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:35.195
Why do you want to meet me here?

00:08:35.487 --> 00:08:37.487
Thach wants you to leave him.

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:41.063
What are you talking about?

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.237
Thach can't see anymore.

00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:46.237
He can't walk either.

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:48.667
It was all my fault.

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:51.394
If he hadn't come to the airport to pick me up...

00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:53.394
He wouldn't have had that accident. 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.498
You had been talking with him privately, hadn't you?

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:02.499
I had not!

00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:06.219
He can't just push me away like this!

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:07.396
I know.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:09.945
I know saying this will hurt you.

00:09:09.946 --> 00:09:11.589
It's what Thach wants.

00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:14.577
He is no different from a disabled person.

00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:17.118
He doesn't want you to suffer.

00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:18.965
No, no... I don't believe it!

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:20.965
- He can't do this to me...
- Don't come in!

00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:22.378
Just calm down.

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:24.313
He'll scold you if you come in there.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.780
Haven't you noticed that he's changed?

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:33.176
Take this money to care for yourself.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.770
You might not get any money in the future.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.537
Treating his illness will require lots of money.

00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:54.993
It was her who left my brother first.

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:57.981
Then she came back shamelessly demanding a restaurant.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.420
How could she do that?

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:01.779
Right.

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:04.053
It was her who left Thach.

00:10:04.053 --> 00:10:06.959
She didn't deserve his love.

00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:21.605
I bring you water.

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.349
Can I see the photo on your shelf?

00:10:37.943 --> 00:10:40.464
Uhm. Do what you like.

00:10:48.568 --> 00:10:50.568
Did you love her so much?

00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.458
I used to love her so much

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.579
and hate her so much.

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:09.645
You just let her leave like that?

00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:11.645
She's pregnant.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.810
I'm sterile.

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:18.941
How can she be pregnant?

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:26.268
How miserable I am.

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.917
I can't even have children.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.356
I let my girlfriend bear someone else's child

00:11:33.356 --> 00:11:35.356
and come back telling me that it was mine.

00:11:38.218 --> 00:11:40.218
So miserable!

00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:42.375
Thach.

00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:44.375
Don't advise me.

00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:47.160
Don't tell me "Don't be sad".

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
"It'll be alright."

00:11:51.013 --> 00:11:54.000
Those words... are useless. 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You're right. I'm not you.

00:11:56.001 --> 00:11:57.509
I can't understand you.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.262
You can leave.

00:11:59.262 --> 00:12:00.329
If you're tired, tonight...

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:02.329
I'll still make dinner.

00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:06.777
I don't want to make Nu sad.

00:12:06.777 --> 00:12:08.777
Okay.

00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:44.337
To see a famous chef do his work is my pleasure.

00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:47.145
What chef?

00:12:47.365 --> 00:12:49.365
I'm just a useless man now.

00:12:49.365 --> 00:12:50.425
You're not!

00:12:50.425 --> 00:12:54.620
Though you can't see, you still can recognize every spice.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.687
But...

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:07.185
Are you making pasta for Nu?

00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:09.872
Yes. She's a picky eater.

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.055
She's also strict about keeping her figure.

00:13:12.576 --> 00:13:14.713
That's why I must be careful with adding spices.

00:13:15.234 --> 00:13:18.469
Nu doesn't like pork, especially foods made from flour.

00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:21.567
You should wash the pasta carefully.

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:24.346
You know her really well.

00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:28.390
I mean...

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.557
Yes.

00:13:30.517 --> 00:13:32.517
We know each other.

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:35.312
Nu is my best friend.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.816
An important person.

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.722
She's really cute!

00:13:46.731 --> 00:13:49.911
Thinking that I can't see her smile anymore

00:13:50.752 --> 00:13:53.740
makes me feel a little bit sad.

00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:58.332
I still remember clearly the picture of her wearing Ao Dai.

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.268
I promised her that

00:14:01.268 --> 00:14:05.134
I would help her wear her cap in her graduation ceremony.

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:08.389
I can't keep that promise.

00:14:08.518 --> 00:14:11.588
Such a pity. She graduated one year ago.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
She didn't.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.015
She took a leave   of absence of two year due to her illness.

00:14:17.512 --> 00:14:20.143
I think, she'll graduate at the same time as you.

00:14:21.492 --> 00:14:23.492
I didn't know that!

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:26.932
Your ages are not much different.

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:30.432
Her birthday is on 28th of December, 1999.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.980
Her birthday is about to come.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.490
Oh.

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.549
It was so fun.

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:51.592
I remember us riding a bike on the river bank to fly kites.

00:14:51.592 --> 00:14:53.208
Back then, I was so little.

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.208
And you were a high school student.

00:14:55.598 --> 00:14:58.888
You were a middle school student. That wasn't so little!

00:14:59.302 --> 00:15:04.595
Back then, I used to hope to become your bride.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.691
The more we grow, the more different our intentions and decisions are.

00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:15.671
Therefore, our childhood dreams are also lost.

00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:21.208
But now it's still one of my dreams.

00:15:24.001 --> 00:15:26.001
I'm not the one for you,

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:30.066
but I still remember what we were,

00:15:30.692 --> 00:15:34.064
what you like to eat and do,

00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:36.000
the singers you love.

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:38.604
I even remember your fears!

00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:41.381
Do you remember when I was in Grade 6?

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.354
There was a fat boy drew a spider in my notebook.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:45.347
I do.

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:49.076
You were so afraid that you had an asthma attack and I was so worried.

00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:52.669
Your shoulder were small, not like now.

00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:54.861
I worked really hard in the gym.

00:15:55.802 --> 00:15:58.131
I know! You loved the gym more than me!

00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.131
You didn't even pick up my calls.

00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:02.636
Yes! I know I was wrong!

00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:04.677
I won't dare miss your calls anymore!

00:16:04.677 --> 00:16:07.830
Hmm! I'll remember this!

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:16.058
But, are you okay?

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.351
About Linh?

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.640
Who's Linh? I don't remember her.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.659
Oh! Where's been Phuc?

00:16:28.398 --> 00:16:33.142
When I was in the alley, I saw him talking to someone intimately.

00:16:37.624 --> 00:16:38.691
Male or female?

00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:40.993
Male.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.960
I think he had a scar.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.893
What would you like me to give you on your birthday this year?

00:16:56.607 --> 00:16:59.293
Being with the one I like on my birthday 

00:16:59.293 --> 00:17:01.293
is the happiest thing I want.

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:06.470
Here's your dinner!

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:12.308
Thank you!

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:16.449
I'll be in the kitchen. Call me if you need anything.

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:19.739
You should get inside.

00:17:20.768 --> 00:17:22.768
Yes.

00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:40.361
While I wasn't here, I missed your dishes so much!

00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:43.287
Then, you have to pig out!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.668
Phuc.

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:55.530
Phuc!

00:17:56.271 --> 00:17:57.565
Yes? You called me?

00:17:57.565 --> 00:17:59.565
Who allowed you to add salt to my pasta?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.387
I didn't do it!

00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:04.869
Did you do it and forget?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I am never careless like that.

00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:11.167
I'm your boss.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.167
At least listen to what I ask you to.

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:14.689
I didn't add salt to your pasta!

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.689
If it's not you, who could it be?

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.780
Do you need to add more salt?

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.928
No. Let me do it myself.

00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:35.324
Okay.

00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:40.041
It's okay. It's just a little salt.

00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:42.041
You two don't need to fight like this.

00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.432
I don't like anyone touching what I cook.

00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:48.000
Yes. I know you don't.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.878
But you can't ruin our night because of that!

00:18:52.658 --> 00:18:55.161
It's been so long since we had dinner together.

00:18:55.463 --> 00:18:58.835
Are you going to let your anger ruin our night?

00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:03.200
Get inside, Phuc. It's okay.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200
Yes.

00:19:12.413 --> 00:19:14.413
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.617
I think it's still good. Don't be angry.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.870
I don't know why that happened.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.407
Every time I hear his voice, I get so angry.

00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:27.314
Then, don't hear it.

00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:32.333
Every time he speaks, you don't hear anything. Not a single word.

00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:32.824
Nu went to bed. I'll go home now.

00:20:32.824 --> 00:20:34.448
Did she stop puking?

00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:36.448
She did.

00:20:37.525 --> 00:20:38.921
If there's nothing else...

00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:40.401
What time is it?

00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:43.499
It's 11 P.M.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.443
Have you eaten?

00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:50.849
Oh. I'll eat with my friend.

00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:53.081
Is he the man with a lovely scar?

00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.081
What?

00:20:55.081 --> 00:20:57.081
I didn't know you are gay.

00:20:57.622 --> 00:20:59.210
What do you mean?

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.210
Why were you so harsh?

00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:04.894
If you don't like it,

00:21:04.894 --> 00:21:06.566
I can quit.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:09.362
Don't you want to make money by taking care of me?

00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:11.362
Such a waste if you quit now, right?

00:21:11.786 --> 00:21:14.829
No one wants to work without getting paid!

00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:18.385
If you want to receive your pay without feeling guilty,

00:21:18.385 --> 00:21:20.193
be responsible with your work!

00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:23.255
I always fulfill my responsibility and duty.

00:21:23.255 --> 00:21:25.255
I know where I stand.

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:29.560
In everything I do, I put my work ethic at the top.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.591
Then, the one who texted his boyfriend during his work time wasn't you?

00:21:33.591 --> 00:21:35.591
What boyfriend?

00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:44.096
Just leave.

00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:45.575
Explain that for me!

00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:48.234
Or do you want me to have you escorted out?

00:21:51.537 --> 00:21:53.537
Goodbye!

00:21:57.643 --> 00:22:01.811
Your duty... Your duty, huh?

00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:08.895
It's all about your responsibility and duty?

00:22:18.577 --> 00:22:21.318
Did he have late puberty?

00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:24.306
At times, he's sweet. At other times, he treats me like nothing!

00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:25.967
When did I have a date?

00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:29.506
And Nu wasn't good either! 
 She asked me to carry those heavy boxes of apples!

00:22:29.506 --> 00:22:31.320
Hello, boy! 

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.840
Oh, Duy?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.840
Get on. I'll give you a ride home.

00:22:34.997 --> 00:22:36.565
My place is far from here.

00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:38.565
That's why you need a ride!

00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:40.906
It's 11 P.M!

00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:43.316
It's late so you need a ride!

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.468
Will you be scolded if you come home late?

00:22:45.468 --> 00:22:48.000
You're asking to much! Get on.

00:22:55.046 --> 00:22:57.046
You're settled?

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:13.781
Phuc!

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.073
Yes?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:16.780
What is it?

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.713
Can you go out there and help me carry my boxes of apples?

00:23:19.713 --> 00:23:21.384
Why didn't you tell them to deliver here?

00:23:21.384 --> 00:23:22.451
I wanted that,

00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:25.192
but our streets are being fixed. They couldn't pass.

00:23:25.192 --> 00:23:27.029
It's dinner time.

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:30.000
It's okay. Just go. I'll buy you some time!

00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:32.973
Please help me! They're from America. Really expensive!

00:23:32.973 --> 00:23:34.113
Yes.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.195
Bring this inside for me.

00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:37.042
Okay! Go now!

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.042
Yes.

00:23:53.394 --> 00:23:58.303
&lt;&lt; There are no apples in the carton... only rocks &gt;&gt;

00:24:08.704 --> 00:24:10.704
You're still awake?

00:24:15.744 --> 00:24:17.744
Go to your room and rest.

00:24:19.914 --> 00:24:21.200
What's wrong?

00:24:22.023 --> 00:24:24.023
Is it about Phuc?

00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:26.538
I'm not sure.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.950
I feel uneasy.

00:24:30.809 --> 00:24:33.605
Have you ever thought about it?

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.427
I have.

00:24:35.866 --> 00:24:39.760
So many things has happened lately. I didn't have time to think.

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:42.666
Then, what is it?

00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:48.761
Do you think I'm not normal?

00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:53.636
I mean... I've always liked girls.

00:24:53.636 --> 00:24:58.380
Now, I feel uneasy and want to be close to a boy.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.197
All the time, I want to know what he's doing and feeling.

00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:09.722
"He"?
- It's Phuc.

00:25:13.267 --> 00:25:14.746
I got jealous.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.746
Very much.

00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:19.321
But I don't know why.

00:25:21.163 --> 00:25:23.163
Because you like him.

00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:26.395
Maybe that's the case.

00:25:26.773 --> 00:25:28.773
"Maybe", huh?

00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:31.562
Is it that obvious?

00:25:33.511 --> 00:25:36.000
What is the problem between you two?

00:25:38.168 --> 00:25:40.168
I don't know. 

00:25:41.355 --> 00:25:46.813
Brother. Actually, I'm not sure if I'm 100% straight.

00:25:47.258 --> 00:25:49.258
When I care about someone,

00:25:49.258 --> 00:25:53.344
I always notice my emotions and feelings for them.

00:25:54.001 --> 00:25:56.907
I learned that their emotions and actions

00:25:56.907 --> 00:26:00.608
are what make me want to understand them more

00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:03.075
and what make me happy.

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:10.410
And, things like origin or sexuality, I don't care.

00:26:11.094 --> 00:26:12.737
Uhm.

00:26:12.929 --> 00:26:14.435
As long as you love them, right?

00:26:14.435 --> 00:26:15.557
Exactly!

00:26:16.133 --> 00:26:18.133
Did you do something to him?

00:26:19.798 --> 00:26:22.319
I got jealous with the man who has a scar.

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:26.256
You didn't know the whole story, but you got jealous!

00:26:29.494 --> 00:26:31.494
You're right. I were unreasonable.

00:26:31.494 --> 00:26:33.494
What should I do?

00:26:33.494 --> 00:26:35.494
"Attack" him directly!

00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:37.494
Ask if he had a boyfriend.

00:26:37.494 --> 00:26:40.180
I don't think it's good to be unclear.

00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:46.125
Okay.

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:49.385
So, good luck to you!

00:26:49.385 --> 00:26:51.385
I'll go to bed now.

00:26:51.385 --> 00:26:55.361
Uh... You're interested in someone, aren't you?
