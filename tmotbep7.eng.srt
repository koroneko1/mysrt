1
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,799
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,000
Mister.

3
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Song!

4
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,560
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

5
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,599
But you chose to get involved.

6
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,719
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

7
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,520
without affecting our work.

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Mrs. Na!

9
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,319
Are you happy, Nut?

10
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,719
Your lips…

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,439
are sweet and soft like jelly.

12
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,639
Why do you sound like…

13
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,479
Who the hell are you?

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Why are you doing this?

15
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,759
What do you want from me?

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
I don't believe you.

17
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,800
Who sent you to mess with me?

18
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,439
Tell me!

19
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
-Nut.
-Come here.

20
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,520
Please let go of me.

21
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,159
-Where are we going?
-What's wrong?

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Stay out of it, Mom.

23
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,280
-Come.
-Why? Where are you taking him?

24
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,319
This is between me and Tofu.
Stay out of it.

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,599
-What did Tofu do?
-Come.

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,719
-Come on.
-Nut. Where are you going?

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
-Mom, let go.
-Tofu.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Let go.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Nut.

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Get in.

31
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,759
Get in!

32
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,879
Don't you dare get out!

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Where are you taking Tofu?

34
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,479
Let go, Mom.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Where are you going? It's late.

36
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,479
-Please calm down, Nut.
-Nut.

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,759
Come out, Tofu.

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,319
-Mrs. Na.
-Come out, Tofu.

39
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,199
-Mrs. Na.
-Nut.

40
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,159
Nut!

41
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,400
Nut!

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
-Get out.
-No.

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,199
I said get out!

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,240
I won't.

45
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
You won't?

46
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,039
Come here!

47
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,199
Can I pick up the slipper first?

48
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,319
Stop stalling.

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,639
You'll run away.

50
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,639
Come here.

51
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,919
-Nut.
-Come on!

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,120
I won't run away.

53
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,959
That's your mom's slipper.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,839
-Come here.
-Nut.

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
Tofu.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,519
This is your last chance.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,839
Will you tell me the truth,

58
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,240
or should I get the police to make you?

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
I…

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I…

61
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,519
I am…

62
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,279
I am Tofu.

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,240
Fine.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's see how stubborn you really are.

65
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,839
Nut.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
-Come here.
-Nut.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,199
-Nut.
-Come up here.

68
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,120
Nut.

69
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,480
Officer.

70
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,800
Come here. Sit down!

71
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,040
Calm down, kid.

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,879
What's going on?

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,839
He's a stranger.

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
He's living in my house.

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are you living in this house, then?

76
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,000
He asked me to take care of his mother.

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,759
So you know each other?

78
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,279
-Yes.
-No.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,240
So what is it? Do you know each other?

80
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,680
Or not?

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,079
We do.

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,079
This is Nut. His first name is Peeranut.
He's 27 years old.

83
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,959
His mom is Matana. His dog is Kuenchai.

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,959
Tofu!

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
That's plenty of information.

86
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,560
You say you don't know him.

87
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
He just said

88
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,040
you invited him into your house.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,759
Listen to me.

90
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,040
I don't know who he is.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,040
My mom felt sorry for him,
so she brought him in.

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,079
And I let her.

93
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,279
But recently,

94
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,319
he has been acting strangely,

95
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,759
as if he's plotting something.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,399
Are you?

97
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm not plotting anything.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
I just…

99
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,839
want to be with Nut.

100
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,639
I don't know what happened.

101
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
Everything was fine…

102
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,560
until we kissed.

103
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,399
You kissed?

104
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,639
Wait a minute.

105
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,000
There's no way he's a stranger.

106
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,120
So what is it?

107
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,839
Will you report him?

108
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,519
How old are you anyway? You look so young.

109
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,519
I'm not sure.

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
If you report him,

111
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,560
you may be charged with child abduction

112
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,839
and false imprisonment.

113
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Those are two charges.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,360
So, are we filing the report?

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,360
-Yes.
-No.

116
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,279
All right.

117
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,720
What do you want to do?

118
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,319
You should discuss it.

119
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,639
Don't confuse the police.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,959
Stop following me.

121
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,199
Go away.

122
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Please don't send me away.

123
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,240
You know I have nowhere to go.

124
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry

125
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,399
if I offended you,

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
but I was telling the truth.

127
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,639
Do you really have amnesia?

128
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,720
What's really wrong with you?

129
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,879
If you're not going to tell me,
then get lost.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm your teddy bear.

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
I have no idea

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,159
how I turned into a human.

134
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,000
I never thought you would be such a liar.

135
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,000
Can I believe anything you've said?

136
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,840
Nut. I'm Tofu.

137
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,399
Nut.

138
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Nut

139
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't leave me, Nut.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
Nut.

141
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,879
I really am yours.

142
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,399
Nut.

143
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,519
Nut, open the door.

144
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,799
Nut.

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,759
I really am yours.

146
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,799
Nut, wait for me.

147
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,679
Nut, wait for me.

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Nut!

149
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Nut.

150
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
I really am yours.

151
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,120
Nut!

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm sorry

153
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,919
if I offended you,

154
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,840
but I was telling the truth.

155
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,639
Do you really have amnesia?

156
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,039
What's really wrong with you?

157
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,919
Your lips are sweet

158
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,879
and soft like jelly.

159
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
Your lips…

160
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,799
are sweet and soft like jelly.

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,519
Who the hell are you?

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,240
Why are you doing this?

163
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,200
What do you want from me?

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,759
Who sent you to mess with me?

165
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,720
Tell me!

166
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
Why did you have to lie?

168
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
What a coward.

169
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,240
Would it hurt
to get your phone out and call Nut?

170
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,240
Do you want him to leave you?

171
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,720
How could someone leave
a person they love?

172
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,559
Can't you see he has already left?

173
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,039
Do you think he'll come back
for you like in a Korean drama?

174
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,720
If you're not going to call Nut,

175
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,159
then get up and find my Little One.

176
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,120
Okay.

177
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,080
I remember she fell off around here.

178
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,080
Little One!

179
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
Little One!

180
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,320
Ms. Left Slipper.

181
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Ms. Left Slipper.

182
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,159
Walk around and look for her.

183
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,639
Little One!

184
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,399
Little One!

185
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,840
Little One!

186
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,879
Tofu is safe. He's with me.

187
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,320
He told me that Nut kicked him
out of the house.

188
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,159
I'll let him stay with me tonight.

189
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,440
Let's wait for Nut to calm down.

190
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,639
I'll talk to him.

191
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,159
Thank you.

192
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
You're welcome.

193
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Tofu.

194
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,000
What did you do to him?
Why is he so mad at you?

195
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,519
I didn't do anything.

196
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,960
I just kissed him.

197
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,720
You kissed him?

198
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,559
He kissed me back too.

199
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,679
Well…

200
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,240
We kissed each other.

201
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,039
That's enough.

202
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,839
I get it now.

203
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,920
They just kissed.

204
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Why would he get mad?

205
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,200
Wait, who's that with Gen?

206
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
Is it Song?

207
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,640
It looks like Song.

208
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,079
Is he finally telling us about it?

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,039
Hello.

210
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,960
Hello.

211
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,160
This is Tofu.

212
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,759
The kid from Nut's house
that I told you about.

213
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
They had a fight,

214
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,880
so I thought
I would let him stay here tonight.

215
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,960
I'll get the first aid kit.

216
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,759
Have you eaten anything?

217
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,400
Not yet.

218
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,599
Here's some hot porridge.
I made it myself.

219
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,519
Thank you.

220
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,440
Here.

221
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,839
Thank you.

222
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,319
Yours is over there.

223
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,559
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

224
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,440
What did you fight about this time?

225
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,680
I…

226
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,319
was just going to kiss…

227
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,039
-Tofu!
-What are you doing, Gen?

228
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,359
You spilled it everywhere.

229
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,359
He said something rude.

230
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,160
Something

231
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
that might cause adults to freak out.

232
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,599
It wasn't rude.

233
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,440
Well, maybe a little.

234
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,160
It was just a misunderstanding.

235
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,160
You see,
Nut has always been temperamental.

236
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
-You know him.
-That's right.

237
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,680
Do you know Nut well?

238
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,799
I used to see him when he was a kid.

239
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,359
He came to work with his dad.

240
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,960
We barely spoke though.

241
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,319
We only started speaking
when he became friends with Gen.

242
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,279
Did you know Nut's dad?

243
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,039
We were classmates
in the military academy.

244
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,359
What was his dad like?

245
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,839
I want Nut to apply to the academy.

246
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,599
What about your son?
Will he apply next year?

247
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,240
My son doesn't want to.

248
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,319
What?

249
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,559
He's a man and a soldier's son.

250
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,200
It would be a waste
if he doesn't join the military.

251
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,400
Nut has to join the military.

252
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,279
He was a determined, serious man.

253
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,319
He was also a strong leader.

254
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,000
We were just acquaintances though.

255
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,799
We weren't close friends.

256
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,279
It was a shame that he died young.

257
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,880
Nut's mom was very upset.

258
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,559
Sibmeun really loved his family though.

259
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
But from what Nut said,

260
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,440
his dad was really strict with him.

261
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,119
I see. That must be why
Nut never talks about his dad.

262
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,839
There aren't any photos
of him at home either.

263
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,279
He probably loved them in his own way.

264
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,599
He wanted a bright future for Nut

265
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
as a leader.

266
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,720
So he was trying
to lay a path for Nut in the military,

267
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,119
to follow in his footsteps.

268
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
I guess he forgot

269
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,160
that everyone
has to follow their own path.

270
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,440
Dad.

271
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,680
Did you ever want me to be a soldier?

272
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,839
No.

273
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,359
Actually,

274
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,480
I kind of wanted you to be a doctor.

275
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,480
I just thought that

276
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,119
if you wanted to follow in our footsteps,

277
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,200
we would be able to guide you
better than other career paths.

278
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,440
In the end, though, it's up to you.

279
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
You have to decide what you want to be.

280
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,519
Every job has its pros and cons.

281
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,440
If you do a job you enjoy,

282
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
at least, you will be happy.

283
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,519
Then you will do that job well.

284
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,559
Mom.

285
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,599
-What is it?
-What?

286
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,440
-What's going on?
-I'm touched.

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,839
-Touched?
-Gen.

288
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,359
I thought you wanted to wipe your mouth.

289
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,359
-Here.
-Come on.

290
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
Our little puppy.

291
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,079
Puppies come from dogs.

292
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,559
-That backfired.
-Look at him.

293
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,119
You're never like this.

294
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,400
-Come on.
-Okay, you're touched.

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I love you too.

296
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,160
-Can I hug you?
-Come here.

297
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,799
You little puppy.

298
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,880
Had Nut had a warm

299
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,000
and understanding family,

300
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,839
he would've grown up to be
a happy young man like Gen.

301
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,279
THE LITTLE PRINCE

302
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
You're home.

303
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,880
What's wrong?

304
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,440
Can you tell me?

305
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,599
SONG: SLEEPING ALONE
MUST BE LONELY, MISTER

306
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,119
I'M NOT LONELY

307
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,000
I HAVE SOMEONE TO SLEEP WITH

308
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,839
Gen.

309
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,599
What?

310
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,160
Will I get to live with Nut again?

311
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,200
I don't know.

312
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,079
You and Nut are the only ones who know.

313
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,759
It's up to your hearts

314
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,880
if you want to get back together.

315
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,759
I really want to.

316
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But…

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,359
Nut…

318
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
Stop sulking.

319
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,279
Nut is just confused.

320
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
It's hard for him to move on

321
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,519
and start over, you know?

322
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,559
He probably had high hopes,

323
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,960
and you must have disappointed him.

324
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,200
Give him time.

325
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,440
I'll talk to him.

326
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,480
SONG: WHO? WHO ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH?

327
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,759
ARE YOU CHEATING ON ME?

328
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:44,880
MISTER, DON'T

329
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,039
Nut.

330
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,480
I want to be back by your side.

331
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,079
I will not give up.

332
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,279
BE WITH YOU

333
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:06,880
Wait.

334
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,160
You're not Neung.

335
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,640
Isn't he your friend?

336
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,680
He fell from your balcony
yesterday morning.

337
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,759
Who gave you that pork recipe?

338
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
I just followed my gut.

339
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,519
I'm your teddy bear.

340
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm your teddy bear.

341
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,160
But…

342
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,480
I have no idea

343
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,200
how I turned into a human.

344
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,440
Do you really think Tofu is a teddy bear?

345
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,759
Who would be that crazy?

346
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,759
I just thought it might have
something to do with…

347
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,920
Is this about your ex again?

348
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,119
Do you think your ex revolves around you

349
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,599
like a planet orbiting around the sun?

350
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,599
I'm not just imagining it.

351
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,880
I have my reasons.

352
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,160
Tofu reminds me of him all the time.

353
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
Nut, there are tens of millions of people
in this country.

354
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,960
Don't you think
some of them talk and think alike?

355
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,799
Tofu could've watched the same movies,

356
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,680
read the same books,

357
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,480
and listened to the same songs as your ex.

358
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,319
That's why he said that.

359
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,079
But what he said was special.

360
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,279
He used the exact same words.

361
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,319
So what?

362
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,880
Did you think he sent Tofu here
to steal your teddy bear,

363
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,119
say those lines,

364
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,559
and love you in his place?

365
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,279
If you can't answer it,

366
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,079
why bother thinking about
impossible questions like that?

367
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,279
You should think about the question
that you can answer.

368
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,720
Do you still want Tofu in your life?

369
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,559
So it's you

370
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,359
who was with him.

371
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
Why do you need to borrow my laptop?

372
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,759
To get Nut back.

373
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,119
I'M NOT LONELY WITHOUT YOU

374
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,680
Why did you go to my house?

375
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
Where are you taking Tofu?

376
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,200
Here.

377
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,319
I guess that's love.

378
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,480
Even though he kicked you out,

379
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,279
you still look after his mom.

380
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,720
I promised Nut

381
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,119
that I would take care of her.

382
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,640
Even if he's still mad at me,

383
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,279
I need to keep my promise.

384
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,839
True love.

385
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm going now.

386
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,599
Okay.

387
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,160
-Look, Tofu is here.
-Tofu.

388
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
-Tofu is here.
-Tofu.

389
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,119
What a relief.

390
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,359
I was praying for your safety all night.

391
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,519
What about Ms. Left Slipper?

392
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,880
Why did you come back alone?

393
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Mr. Right Slipper,
where's your girlfriend?

394
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,240
I lost Ms. Left Slipper.

395
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:58,920
What?

396
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,640
My goodness.

397
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,519
Little One shouldn't have helped you.

398
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,480
You always call others ignorant.

399
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,720
Well, your girlfriend
can't ignore you now.

400
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,680
I promise you, Mr. Right Slipper,

401
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,480
I'll find Little One.

402
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,720
I would never lose Mrs. Na's belongings.

403
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
Where's Mrs. Na?

404
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,280
Oh…

405
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,039
Thank you.

406
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,360
Let me help.

407
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,400
It wouldn't be as pretty
had I done it myself.

408
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,400
Thank you for helping me.

409
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,800
You're welcome.

410
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,159
This area still seems a bit bare.

411
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,639
Shall we buy some more plants?

412
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,400
Are you free this Saturday?

413
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,880
Let's take a photo

414
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
as a memento of the three of us
arranging the garden together.

415
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,599
I'll put the chair away.

416
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,280
Let me help.

417
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,639
I need to research a lot
for the subject I teach,

418
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
in order to explain it to the children.

419
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,800
But the more I research,

420
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,800
the more questions I have.

421
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,360
Do you think

422
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,519
Thai people really did migrate
from the Altai Mountains?

423
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,320
And did the villagers of Bang Rachan

424
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,480
really die fighting to protect Ayutthaya?

425
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,800
So,

426
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,159
is it not true?

427
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,360
Well,

428
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,719
I don't know much about this stuff.

429
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,880
You might have to explain it to me
a bit more.

430
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Would you mind

431
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,599
if I asked you to come
and explain it to me every day?

432
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,719
Maybe Thais didn't migrate here

433
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
but have always been in this area.

434
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:56,639
As for Bang Rachan, they didn't fight
for anyone but themselves.

435
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
Is that what you think?

436
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,199
History isn't a record
of what actually happened.

437
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,159
It's just distorted recollections

438
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,760
that are retold in a way
that suits whoever is telling them.

439
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,679
Do you agree?

440
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
I didn't think…

441
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,480
you would be interested in history.

442
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,119
I like to read.

443
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,360
History, philosophy, and literature.

444
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,480
This one

445
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
is my favorite.

446
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
THE LITTLE PRINCE

447
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,280
"The Little Prince."

448
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,000
I really like
the illustrations in this book.

449
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,719
But when I was at school,

450
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,679
I didn't really understand it.

451
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
They say,

452
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,760
older people perceive
The Little Prince differently

453
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,199
than children.

454
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,559
You should read it again.

455
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,599
You might understand
and perceive it differently this time.

456
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,039
Okay.

457
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,079
Sib.

458
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,000
Mrs. Na.

459
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,840
When did you get here, Tofu?

460
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,920
Just now.

461
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,719
Do you remember Mr. Sibmeun now?

462
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,519
Do you want to tell me anything?

463
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,599
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

464
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,440
You all look happy in this picture.

465
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,920
Why don't you want to think about it?

466
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Sometimes you are happy

467
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,159
at the start of a nightmare, Tofu.

468
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,559
We can't have good dreams all the time.

469
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,639
I have a secret to tell you.

470
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,559
You're the first one to know.

471
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:45,519
I've just started dreaming recently.

472
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,320
Whenever I have a nightmare,

473
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,519
I would really be glad when I wake up,

474
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
because I know it's just a dream.

475
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,079
It has passed.

476
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,920
The monster in my dream
can't hurt me anymore.

477
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,880
Whenever I have a good dream,

478
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm happy all day long.

479
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Don't you want

480
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,079
to go back to sleep

481
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,280
to continue the good dream?

482
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,119
No.

483
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,760
In my real life, I have Nut,

484
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,239
you,

485
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,960
and many other friends.

486
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,159
Sometimes I'm happy. Sometimes I'm sad.

487
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,280
But it's reality.

488
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,519
I wouldn't trade it for a dream.

489
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,360
Mrs. Na.

490
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,840
Some nights you have good dreams.

491
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,800
Some nights you have bad dreams.

492
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,400
But in the end,

493
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,719
you have to wake up.

494
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,519
I've decided

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,280
to borrow some money
from Sakon to help Na.

496
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,280
Have you thought it through?

497
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,599
She's struggling.

498
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,000
She has to pay for her house
and her grandmother's medical bills.

499
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,000
What can I do?

500
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,519
It's pointless.

501
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,559
You won't hold her grandmother back.

502
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,079
It will just prolong her suffering.

503
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,719
In the end,
the person who will suffer the most is Na.

504
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Is it Na or you who will suffer?

505
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,960
Do you think I don't know
what you're trying to do?

506
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,320
Is it only a soldier with a bright future
like you who deserves Na?

507
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,679
When we were kids, I may not have been
as good as you at anything,

508
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,440
but I won't let you
walk all over me this time.

509
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,920
You know Na loves me.

510
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,599
I'm warning you with good intentions.

511
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,679
Think it through.
The money will cause you trouble.

512
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,239
I have thought it through.

513
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
I will show both you and Na

514
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,679
that I can make her happy too.

515
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,639
May I give him a sponge bath?

516
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:13,559
Go ahead.

517
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,239
The lab results are in.

518
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,280
We found a bloodstain
on the living room floor,

519
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,320
but it had been cleaned.

520
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,840
That means a fight occurred here.

521
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,440
I think Tatarn

522
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,360
could have been injured and moved.

523
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
So, it seems like
he was attacked and killed.

524
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,239
That means Saen lied to us.

525
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,800
Should we issue a warrant?

526
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,199
Not yet. Don't alert him.

527
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,960
He went this far to deceive us.
He and his wife must have a solid plan.

528
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,400
Find some solid evidence against him,

529
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,360
then we'll arrest him.

530
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,360
Lieutenant.

531
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,400
Have a look around.

532
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,119
There must be more evidence.

533
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:46,360
Yes, sir.

534
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,199
Do you remember what I told you?

535
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,480
About someone Tarn liked.

536
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,079
I do.

537
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,360
I would ask permission
to enter Tarn's house

538
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,280
to find clues about this person.

539
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,679
I want to create a miracle.

540
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,119
TO NUT, FROM TOFU

541
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,440
Excuse me, sir.

542
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:05,400
It's the commander.

543
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,800
Yes.

544
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,559
Roger that.

545
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,280
"Be with you."

546
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,320
BE WITH YOU

547
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,880
What are you doing?

548
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,280
I'm not doing anything.

549
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,239
I'm just arranging your books.

550
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:44,800
Why this book?

551
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,320
Well?

552
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:55,079
And this.

553
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:59,079
You hid the teddy's scarf
in my room, didn't you?

554
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,280
Didn't you?

555
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:04,800
I didn't.

556
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,440
It had fallen, so I put it away.

557
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,440
Don't lie!

558
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,760
You were going through my personal stuff!

559
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
What do you want?

560
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,639
Nut. You said you would talk about it.

561
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,239
Yes. Talk to him nicely.

562
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,599
Right. Calm down.

563
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,679
How can I calm down?

564
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,719
The scarf. The book.

565
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,760
Still think it's unrelated?

566
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,079
He sent you, didn't he?

567
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:36,559
Who did?

568
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,440
Don't act innocent.

569
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:41,519
Answer me!

570
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,760
If you think someone sent me,
why don't you ask them?

571
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,239
I want to know

572
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,360
who he is

573
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,519
and why he's so important to you.

574
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,039
Why do you keep insisting I know him?

575
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,039
I've told you everything.

576
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,400
If you still don't believe me,

577
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,239
then I don't know what to do.

578
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,039
I really don't know

579
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,119
how I got here.

580
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,840
It's not some plan.

581
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,239
I just want to stay here with you.

582
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,480
I want to take care of you.

583
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,880
Take care of your mom.

584
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,760
That's all.

585
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:19,039
If you don't want me anymore,

586
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,320
I'll leave.

587
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,679
You're with Tofu almost all the time.

588
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,519
Do you really not know
what kind of person he is?

589
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:32,559
So,

590
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,280
you no longer
want him in your life, do you?

591
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,400
Are you really leaving, Tofu?

592
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,639
Nut won't let me stay here.

593
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,639
I don't want you to leave.

594
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,280
If you miss me,

595
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,719
you can call.

596
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,480
Be a good boy, Kuenchai.

597
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,800
Take care of Mrs. Na for me.

598
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,119
Where are you going to stay?

599
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,199
He can stay with me.

600
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,039
I live alone. My dad won't mind.

601
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,519
Don't worry.

602
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,079
You can't stay with Song, can you?

603
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,800
He's Nut's friend after all.

604
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,679
My house would be the best option.

605
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,280
Thank you.

606
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,480
I'll go now.

607
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,159
Goodbye.

608
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,719
I'll sneak back sometime.

609
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,119
Let's go home.

610
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,119
Song.

611
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:03,360
I need to do something.

612
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,039
Can you help me?

613
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:12,000
A left slipper?

614
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,639
Yes.

615
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,840
It's pink and fluffy.

616
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:18,639
I remember I dropped it here.

617
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,719
Can you help me find it?

618
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,519
I'll look over there, then.

619
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,199
You might not know who Tofu is
or where he came from,

620
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,880
but he has never hurt you, has he?

621
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,320
He's a nice kid.

622
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,440
Will you really let him go like that?

623
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,519
Think it through.

624
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,199
If you really don't want him in your life,

625
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,480
I'll take him somewhere else.

626
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,719
But an amnesiac

627
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,039
with no family background like him,

628
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,119
where could he go

629
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,480
but a foster home?

630
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,840
That's what you were going to do before.

631
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,039
I guess it's fine.

632
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,320
Good.

633
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,880
You won't have to see him anymore.

634
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,559
You won't have to worry
when he does something wrong,

635
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,760
or get paranoid about your ex.

636
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,360
Just go back to your old life.

637
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,360
The life you lived before he came along.

638
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:20,880
Are you okay with that?

639
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:23,880
Are you?

640
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,079
Just buy some new ones.

641
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,679
I can buy them if you don't have money.

642
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,079
It's not the same.

643
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,719
It belongs to Mrs. Na.
It's more than just a slipper.

644
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:46,519
It's like a friend.

645
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,039
A friend?

646
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,760
Oh, I meant…

647
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:55,159
A friend for your foot.

648
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,599
Everything has its value.

649
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,440
Some things can't be replaced.

650
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:02,840
I see.

651
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:04,960
Let's find it, then.

652
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,840
Tofu, help me!

653
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,960
Ms. Left Slipper.

654
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,320
Tofu, help me!

655
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
Is that it, Tofu?

656
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,719
Yes.

657
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,000
Mr. Dog.

658
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,239
Calm down, Mr. Dog.

659
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,400
May I have Ms. Left Slipper back?

660
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:29,599
Ms. Left Slipper!

661
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,559
Mr. Dog, stop!

662
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:34,559
Ms. Left Slipper.

663
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,880
Please stop.

664
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:41,400
Ms. Left Slipper.

665
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,639
Mr. Dog, stop.

666
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:46,159
Please let go of Ms. Left Slipper.

667
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:47,559
-Whoa.
-Oh, my.

668
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:49,159
Hey. Watch where you're going.

669
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:50,679
I'm sorry.

670
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,480
You've messed up all my stuff.

671
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

672
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,679
Mr. Dog, stop.

673
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:01,920
Mr. Dog!

674
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,000
Tofu!

675
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:11,000
Tofu!

676
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:12,920
Mr. Dog.

677
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,159
You pervert!

678
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,199
My gosh.

679
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,599
I never thought a pretty boy
would be like this.

680
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,960
It's not like that.

681
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:24,880
I was looking for a dog.

682
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,079
What dog? I didn't see one.
Don't lie to me.

683
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:29,920
Right. Let's take him to the police.

684
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,239
-Grab him.
-It's not that.

685
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,519
The proof is in your hand.

686
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,119
-Look at that.
-It's right in your hand.

687
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,360
-Please let go.
-I need to take pictures.

688
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,360
-Song, help.
-Look.

689
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,960
Excuse me. That's my friend.
He's not a thief.

690
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:44,239
You came together? Are you a pervert too?

691
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,079
-I'm not.
-Great.

692
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:47,159
-No.
-Hey, Oh!

693
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:48,679
-Those are your bras.
-Miss.

694
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,639
-That's not true.
-I'm not a pervert.

695
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,639
Come here, pervert.

696
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:52,880
I wasn't doing anything.

697
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,639
I don't believe you.
Tell it to the police.

698
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,360
Such a pretty boy. What a shame.

699
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,199
Come here! Come on, pervert.

700
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,519
I didn't do anything.

701
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,360
It was brand new.

702
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,000
What a pervert. Go inside!

703
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,679
Wait. What happened?

704
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,880
-Well…
-Well…

705
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:13,239
What is it? Tell me.

706
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,239
-The thing is…
-The thing is…

707
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,360
Song has probably taken him
far away by now.

708
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:23,360
You kicked him out, now you're worried.

709
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,320
How touching.

710
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,079
Nut.

711
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,519
Tell me what you want to do.

712
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:36,840
I'll support you.

713
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:39,920
But I'm warning you,

714
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,400
if you leave this unresolved,

715
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,880
you won't be able to focus on work.

716
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,840
I--

717
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:50,960
Nut.

718
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:53,760
Great timing.

719
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:57,960
Sit!

720
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,719
What's the commotion about?

721
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,519
It's this pervert.
He was stealing my bras.

722
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:06,840
I caught him red-handed.

723
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,119
-Right.
-I see.

724
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,039
Wait.

725
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,800
Last night, didn't you…

726
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,159
kiss a guy?

727
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:13,559
-Now,
-What?

728
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,599
you're stealing women's bras?

729
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,360
What are you actually into?

730
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,119
It's not like that.

731
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:21,880
I was following a dog
and ran into the rack.

732
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,320
I told them that, but no one believed me.

733
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:25,960
Liar.

734
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:27,719
We saw with our own eyes

735
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,440
that you grabbed a handful of bras.

736
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,079
Officer, here are the goods.

737
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:34,480
-I…
-Right.

738
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,199
They got wrapped around my hands
when I was getting up.

739
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,320
There you go. You're a pervert. A thief!

740
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
-Such a pretty boy. What a shame.
-Enough.

741
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,360
That's enough. I'll question him.

742
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,880
Wait a minute, Lieutenant.

743
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,039
What is it?

744
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,639
No need to question him. Someone called
to confirm it was a misunderstanding.

745
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:54,599
-A misunderstanding?
-Gosh.

746
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:55,679
Who is it?

747
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,199
There. Here he is.

748
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:05,679
Go in, Nut.

749
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:07,960
What are you waiting for?

750
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,119
Hurry up.

751
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,519
What's the matter?

752
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:19,719
I'm bailing someone out.

753
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,280
Who?

754
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,199
Someone said our friend got arrested

755
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,440
for stealing bras.

756
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,920
I see.

757
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:34,880
Wait.

758
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,679
Oh, that's right.

759
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,000
The kid who said
he kissed you last night, right?

760
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,880
Yes.

761
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,039
Someone took him.

762
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:48,960
What?

763
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,079
Just now.

764
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:51,880
Who bailed him out?

765
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:08,760
Thank goodness you came to Bangkok,

766
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,800
or Tofu could've been arrested.

767
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,039
No.

768
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,400
The security camera shows
that he didn't do anything.

769
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,079
Thank you for helping me anyway.

770
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,199
No problem.

771
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,280
Come on. Let's go inside.

772
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,239
We'll decide what to do later.

773
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,760
Don't worry.

774
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,719
If you really can't go back,
I'll find a way to help.

775
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,719
Don't worry. Let's go.

776
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:53,920
Nut.

777
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,079
Where's Tofu?

778
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,920
Is he in jail?

779
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:01,280
I can't believe it.

780
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,000
He seemed so innocent.

781
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,639
He was a poor choice.

782
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,519
When you're looking for a boyfriend…

783
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:07,800
Well,

784
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,159
I mean someone to look after your mom,
you should be more careful.

785
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,199
Thanks for going with me.

786
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,360
Get home safely.

787
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,079
Excuse me.

788
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,480
What?

789
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,320
You seem lonely,
like you have no friends to talk to.

790
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,440
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

791
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,440
Your husband doesn't visit.

792
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:54,000
You should find something useful
to do with your spare time,

793
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,000
so you don't have to butt in…

794
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,400
I mean bother yourself
with other people's matters.

795
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,480
Thank you for bringing us the news.

796
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,400
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Sad…

797
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,119
jaree.

798
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:06,440
You punk! Come out!

799
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:08,119
You punk! Come back!

800
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:09,159
Come back!

801
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,280
You seem lonely,
like you have no friends to talk to.

802
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,119
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

803
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,519
Your husband doesn't visit.

804
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,760
Why are you following me?

805
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,439
Who sent you?

806
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,239
Who?

807
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,880
VIEW SATHORN PROPERTY

808
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,199
SAEN

809
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,920
Why are you calling?

810
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,520
I'll visit you at home tomorrow.

811
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,960
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

812
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,439
To Nut, from Tofu.

813
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:12,199
Tofu kissed Nut.
He felt so good that he started crying.

814
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,880
Nut asked, "Why are you crying?"

815
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,880
Tofu answered, "I don't know.
I only know that it's sweet.

816
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:22,359
It's so sweet I'm scared."

817
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,880
Nut smiles sweetly at Tofu.

818
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,680
Nut adores Tofu.

819
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:29,000
Tofu smiles back at Nut.

820
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,159
Come on. Help me.
You should help your dad.

821
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:35,359
You do this one.

822
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:43,119
Nut.

823
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,439
If I were a screenplay writer,

824
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,560
and I could write my own ending,

825
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,279
I would want it to be like this.

826
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,840
I want us not to fight.

827
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,920
I want us to be happy.

828
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,239
Is it that moving?

829
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,439
All right. Come, Tofu. Let's eat.

830
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,760
Then Song can take you upstairs.

831
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,800
Come on. Give me a hand.

832
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:42,199
Here.

833
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,680
Sure.

834
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:58,319
I'm full. Let's take a walk.

835
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,279
Since you'll be staying here for a while,
you might as well look around.

836
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:04,479
Come on. I'll show you my favorite place.

837
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:06,199
Here.

838
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:37,279
Do you like basketball that much?

839
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,239
It's Neung's stuff.

840
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,960
It's all old.

841
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,920
Mine is in that box.

842
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,479
I would like you to stay in my room,

843
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,000
but it's small and messy.

844
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:04,920
Stay in Neung's room instead.

845
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:06,800
You look the same anyway.

846
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,680
It will be like Neung still lives here.

847
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,119
Yes, it will.

848
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,399
Is the room okay?

849
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,439
Yes.

850
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:40,399
Wait a minute.

851
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
Let's play games when you've had a shower.

852
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,800
Okay.

853
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,319
Am I really never
going to see Nut anymore?

854
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,319
TOFU TOFU UPDATED HIS PROFILE PICTURE.

855
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:05,439
TOFU: I MISS NUT.

856
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,680
Why do I look like you?

857
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:56,920
Why am I like this?

858
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,319
What happened to me?

859
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,039
I was Nut's teddy bear.

860
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,560
Why did I become your look-alike?

861
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:17,840
The person Nut loves…

862
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,199
Who did this to me?

863
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,840
Where can I find the answers?

864
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,279
What are you doing, Dad?

865
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:44,399
What is it?

866
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,239
I saw someone.

867
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,399
They're sneaking around outside.

868
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,600
Is it a burglar?

869
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:53,239
I don't know.

870
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:07,920
Dad, wait.

871
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:20,800
I'll catch the burglar.

872
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,000
What?

873
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,800
It's okay.

874
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:33,119
Are you leaving?

875
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,880
Did you come to see Tofu?

876
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,640
Come inside.

877
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
Thank you.

878
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,039
You're Nut, aren't you?

879
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,199
Song told me.

880
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:09,039
Yes.

881
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,800
Did you think it through
before coming here?

882
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,880
Although Tofu has lost his memory,

883
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,960
he still has feelings.

884
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,520
You're not just his employer,

885
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,479
and you didn't just save his life.

886
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,119
You're his whole world,

887
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,079
his sanctuary, and something to hang onto.

888
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,119
If you take Tofu back, I only hope

889
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:46,760
that he will get to stay with you
until his memory returns completely.

890
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:04,600
Nut!

891
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,079
Let's go home.

892
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:55,159
Thank you, both of you.

893
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,560
I'll get going now.

894
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,560
Thank you.

895
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:04,079
Let's go.

896
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,640
Bye.

897
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,319
Did we do the right thing?

898
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,039
I don't know.

899
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,479
But since they miss each other
and they want to stay together,

900
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,760
we have to let them be.

901
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,159
Now, we should go inside
and get some sleep.

902
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:34,520
Are you sleepy?

903
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,199
-I am.
-Go to bed then.

904
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,279
I thought about the difference

905
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:44,920
between not having you around,

906
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,479
and having you despite being suspicious.

907
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,399
Did you choose the latter?

908
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:54,439
No.

909
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,239
I just wanted to follow my heart.

910
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,840
Whatever my heart wants,

911
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,520
I want to let it be.

912
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:06,960
Right now, I want to be with you.

913
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,800
But I don't know
if I'll get paranoid again.

914
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,359
I don't know what I need to do,

915
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:21,920
but I want to move forward.

916
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,600
I don't want to leave it hanging.

917
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,520
Please be patient with me.

918
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,920
I promise I'll never kick you out again.

919
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,720
And I'll try not to mention him.

920
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:50,239
I won't be able to forget him though.

921
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,640
And I won't try to forget him…

922
01:22:57,359 --> 01:22:58,800
because our relationship

923
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,720
is the happiest memory
I have from that time.

924
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,840
But I won't force you to be him,…

925
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,119
because you are you.

926
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:27,039
He's in the past.

927
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,439
But you're right here

928
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:33,640
with me.

929
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,119
I promise,

930
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,359
I'll stay with you forever.

931
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,399
Is that all?

932
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:56,800
What more should I say?

933
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,079
I gave a whole speech,

934
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,000
and that's all you can say?

935
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,159
I must look crazy.

936
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,119
In that case,

937
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,640
I'll try to be good.

938
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,640
I'll be trustworthy,

939
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:27,760
so that you can trust me,

940
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,119
even though my identity

941
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,520
might not seem so trustworthy.

942
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,239
But everything I've done for you

943
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,840
has always been sincere.

944
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:46,520
One day,

945
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,560
you'll recognize my sincerity.

946
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,800
I'll prove it.

947
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,079
I promise.

948
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:01,920
Does that sound good?

949
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:05,920
Okay. That's good.

950
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:08,359
You promised.

951
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,239
I'll wait and see.

952
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,800
What now?

953
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,640
This is how we promise.

954
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,279
You're such a baby.

955
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:31,319
This is how adults make a promise.

956
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,079
Mom is probably asleep.

957
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,119
We can tell her tomorrow.

958
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,000
Welcome home.

959
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,359
Tofu, hurry up.

960
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:45,239
Okay.

961
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:01,640
Good night.

962
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:03,199
Wait.

963
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:08,760
What is it?

964
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:10,800
Did you forget something?

965
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,680
What did I forget?

966
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,159
This.

967
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,159
What are you doing?

968
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,399
I'm following your script.

969
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,880
Shall we start?

970
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,039
I'm not really feeling it.

971
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,800
You're so hard to please.

972
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:00,600
-We can rebuild the mood.
-Sure.

973
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:03,439
Should we start from the angry part?

974
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,439
Let's skip that.

975
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,079
Then skip to your room.

976
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:12,239
I'm not in the mood now.

977
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Nut.

978
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,600
I'll skip forward for you.

979
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,239
-Let's start at--
-Go.

980
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:23,479
I'm going to bed.

981
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:08,319
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

982
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,319
Are you a psychopath?

983
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:11,520
Why are you doing this?

984
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:15,479
I'm doing all this because I love you.

985
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,520
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

986
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,439
If I wasn't indecisive,

987
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,680
if I had been firm

988
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,319
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

989
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:29,000
She didn't really love him.

990
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:31,279
I'm just a product of their mistake.

991
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:33,680
Am I supposed to give up

992
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,720
and be a coward like you?

993
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,279
And behave immorally like you?

994
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,319
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

995
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:44,479
I already have plenty of friends.

996
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,680
But now,

997
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:48,560
I want you.

998
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,479
