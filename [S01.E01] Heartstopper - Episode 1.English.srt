Thanks for telling me.

Oh, wait, you didn't.

325
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,960
Don't be angry at me
for not wanting to come out yet.

326
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,319
I'm not angry about that.

327
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,920
If you're figuring stuff out, fine.
Take your time.

328

I would have been there for you.

Don't you think I would understand
you're figuring out your sexuality?

330
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
Then why are you angry at me?

331
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm angry because you never
even slightly cared about my feelings.

332
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,240
We only ever meet up when you want to.

333
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,279
Where you want to.
When you feel like kissing a boy.

334
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
You don't care about me at all.

335
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,440
It's not like anyone else is
going to want to go out with you, is it?

Charlie, I like you
but I'm figuring stuff out.

Go on. Piss off.

You okay?

I just…

You seemed kind of like something was up
while we were getting changed, so I…

348
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,519
I wanted to check everything was okay.

I'm sorry.

You have nothing to be sorry about.

Sorry.

352

You say sorry a lot.

Don't say it.

[sighs] We should get out.
