&lrm;Yes, Mrs Césaire. The girls are ready
&lrm;for bed, uh... technically speaking.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.340
&lrm;Yeah, we're good! Enjoy the movie!

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.380
&lrm;Come on, bedtime, you little monsters!
&lrm;That's enough mischief for one day!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.180
&lrm;It's not us, it's the Sapotis! Ha, ha!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.980
&lrm;Off to bed, little Sapotis!
&lrm;You need to rest

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.380
&lrm;-if you want to be fighting fit tomorrow!
&lrm;-It's not fair!

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.900
&lrm;We don't want to go to bed.
&lrm;We want to stay up, like you!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.300
&lrm;Yeah, we wanna watch the movie
&lrm;and tell each other lots of secrets!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.860
&lrm;And what kind of zombies will you be
&lrm;at the amusement park, tomorrow,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.140
&lrm;if you go to bed late?

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.580
&lrm;-Show 'em, Marinette.
&lrm;-Yawn... um... um...

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.540
&lrm;So what's it gonna be? Boring,
&lrm;sit-down pyjama party with the big kids,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.020
&lrm;or the super-fun amusement park tomorrow?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.300
&lrm;The amusement park!

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.700
&lrm;That's what I thought.
&lrm;Good night, Sapotis.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.580
&lrm;Wait, can we keep them on, please?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.020
&lrm;All right. But go to sleep now!

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.660
&lrm;You have the technique down
&lrm;with your sisters!

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.580
&lrm;But, uh, who are the Sapi... Sapo...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.980
&lrm;The Sapotis? They're little monsters
&lrm;from a Creole fable

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.060
&lrm;who are always pulling pranks
&lrm;and making mischief.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.860
&lrm;Now we're alone, I can tell you.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.500
&lrm;Ladybug has been around
&lrm;since the Pharaohs.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.420
&lrm;But no way can the Ladybug
&lrm;we know be 5,000 years old!

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.140
&lrm;So, I downloaded a great app that analysed
&lrm;recordings I had of her talking.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.700
&lrm;Based on the frequencies of her voice,
&lrm;it turns out she's a girl our age!

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.020
&lrm;Uh, Alya... the orange juice?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.220
&lrm;[giggling]

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.020
&lrm;[groans]

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.940
&lrm;It's not us! It's the Sapotis!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.660
&lrm;[giggle]

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.220
&lrm;-What were we saying, again?
&lrm;-Uh...

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.060
&lrm;We were about to watch a movie!

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
&lrm;Oh, yeah, Ladybug!
&lrm;She's like a high-school girl!

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.620
&lrm;So, to figure out who she is, we need to
&lrm;find a girl our age, who's always late...

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.860
&lrm;Don't you think there's a good reason
&lrm;why she keeps her identity a secret?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.940
&lrm;All right, that's enough!

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.740
&lrm;Get outta bed one more time
&lrm;and no one will go to the park tomorrow!

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.580
&lrm;-Ha, ha! It's not us, it's...
&lrm;-This is your last warning. No joke!

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.900
&lrm;What were you saying about her identity?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.340
&lrm;She needs it to protect her friends.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.260
&lrm;Otherwise,
&lrm;the villains could use them to get to her.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.220
&lrm;-Argh!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.460
&lrm;-It's not us, it's...
&lrm;-That's it!

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.580
&lrm;Come on, Alya! We won't do it again!

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.500
&lrm;Yeah? Well, it's too late!
&lrm;We'll go to the park when you can behave!

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.820
&lrm;Now, go to sleep!

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.060
&lrm;"I don't want another peep out of you!"
&lrm;"Wash your hands!" "Clean your room!"

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.220
&lrm;Kids should be able to do
&lrm;whatever they want to do,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.820
&lrm;however they want to do it.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.780
&lrm;Fly, my evil little one,
&lrm;and akumatise them!

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.260
&lrm;Well, if I knew who Ladybug really was,
&lrm;I'd keep it a secret.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.860
&lrm;I would even help her. Like, say,
&lrm;if&lrm;<i> you</i>&lrm; were Ladybug, I'd cover for you

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.580
&lrm;when you needed to transform in school,
&lrm;go fight the baddies, you know?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.020
&lrm;Oh, yeah? Well, if I was Ladybug,
&lrm;I wouldn't even tell you,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.620
&lrm;to protect you from the baddies, you know?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.980
&lrm;You serious?
&lrm;If I was Ladybug, I'd totally tell you,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.060
&lrm;because I tell my best friend everything!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.300
&lrm;You're right, Alya, you should
&lrm;always tell your best friend everything.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.140
&lrm;So, come on, spill the beans,
&lrm;are you actually Ladybug?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.900
&lrm;Right, like I'm telling you! Nah-ah!

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.780
&lrm;[laughter]

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.300
&lrm;-It's mine!
&lrm;-No, this one's mine!

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.380
&lrm;No, it's mine!

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.660
&lrm;Sapotis, I am Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Your big sister's telling you what to do?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.460
&lrm;Well, I'll let you be
&lrm;as mischievous as you want!

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.660
&lrm;And do whatever we want? Like stay up
&lrm;all night and go to the movies?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.940
&lrm;And eat lots of desserts, drink orange
&lrm;juice and still go to the amusement park?

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.300
&lrm;Yes, yes. But calm down! From now on,
&lrm;no one will ever be able to punish you,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.180
&lrm;because it will always be
&lrm;another Sapoti's fault.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.660
&lrm;All you have to do is to take
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.700
&lrm;and give them to your good friend,
&lrm;Hawk Moth. OK?

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.700
&lrm;OK!

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.220
&lrm;[wild laughter]

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.100
&lrm;That's it!
&lrm;I've totally had it with these kids!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.540
&lrm;Don't even try to blame this on the...

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.140
&lrm;-Sapotis?
&lrm;-Yaah!

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.180
&lrm;Maybe you were
&lrm;a little too strict with them.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.980
&lrm;[wild screams]

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.540
&lrm;Normally when you're firm with kids
&lrm;they don't turn into monsters!

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.220
&lrm;-They're multiplying after they eat! Aaah!
&lrm;-Window!

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.820
&lrm;Marinette, the window!
&lrm;We can't let them out!

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.660
&lrm;Marinette, take care of these two!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.260
&lrm;We've got to bring them back!

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.580
&lrm;Time to transform!

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.740
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.540
&lrm;-To the airport!
&lrm;-Rock'n'roll!

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.420
&lrm;Hey! What's going on?

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.620
&lrm;Drive! Drive!

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.740
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.700
&lrm;On your left, &lrm;<i>l'académie des beaux arts</i>&lrm;,
&lrm;and on your right, the Louvre museum!

&lrm;<i>These miniature monsters seem to be</i>
&lrm;<i>attacking more and more people. Aaah!</i>

&lrm;[indistinct chatter]

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.860
&lrm;I think we'd better take care of this.
&lrm;Plagg?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.300
&lrm;Food thieves are real dangers!
&lrm;What are you waiting for?

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.300
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.340
&lrm;[wild laughter]

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.820
&lrm;-It's forbidden...
&lrm;-..to play around with traffic lights!

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.060
&lrm;-You're just in time, kitty!
&lrm;-Mine!

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.700
&lrm;How did you know
&lrm;to destroy the hat?

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.260
&lrm;-I, uh... trial and error!
&lrm;-But no akuma's been released.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.300
&lrm;No, 'cause that monster was a clone.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.700
&lrm;These Sapotis multiply
&lrm;every time they eat.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.420
&lrm;To get to the akuma,
&lrm;we must destroy the original one,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.780
&lrm;the very first one Hawk Moth akumatised.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.580
&lrm;-So you mean we've got to catch 'em all?
&lrm;-I thought you liked a good challenge!

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.660
&lrm;Ugh!

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.940
&lrm;Aaah!

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.340
&lrm;Hey, don't eat that ice cream
&lrm;or things will get catastrophic!

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.740
&lrm;Seize their Miraculous!

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.900
&lrm;We can't destroy their hats!
&lrm;There's too many of them!

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.620
&lrm;Miraculous!

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.140
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.540
&lrm;-A teapot?
&lrm;-It's strangely familiar.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.300
&lrm;It's weird! I can't find anything!

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.580
&lrm;Hurry up! My Kung fu is not enough!

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.780
&lrm;Of course! I know someone who can help!
&lrm;Gotta go!

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.420
&lrm;-Right now? Can't it wait?
&lrm;-No, it can't!

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.060
&lrm;-You gotta trust me on this one.
&lrm;-Go on, Milady!

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.580
&lrm;[knock on door]

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.540
&lrm;It's open.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.100
&lrm;-Hello, Master Fu.
&lrm;-Hello, Marinette.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.460
&lrm;Marinette? But, you're not supposed
&lrm;to come to Master Fu's place!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.780
&lrm;Let her talk, Wayzz.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.540
&lrm;Master, I used my Lucky Charm,
&lrm;but, strangely,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.500
&lrm;I think it was a hint,
&lrm;which was telling me to come here.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.420
&lrm;I see.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.980
&lrm;Marinette. I taught you all about
&lrm;the Miraculous and their powers.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.140
&lrm;You know that yours
&lrm;works in a very mysterious way.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.140
&lrm;I think it's trying to tell us
&lrm;that you need help this time.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.660
&lrm;I don't know if it's safe.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.620
&lrm;I already took an enormous risk by putting
&lrm;two Miraculous into circulation.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.540
&lrm;And you were right to do it!
&lrm;Cat Noir and I are very careful.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.300
&lrm;Hmm.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.340
&lrm;Marinette, pick up an ally you can trust
&lrm;to fight alongside you in this mission.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.300
&lrm;-Wow!
&lrm;-Choose wisely.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.380
&lrm;Such powers are meant to serve
&lrm;the greater good.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.700
&lrm;-They must never get into the wrong hands.
&lrm;-Like Hawk Moth's.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.340
&lrm;Yes. Once the mission is over,
&lrm;you must retrieve the Miraculous from them

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.380
&lrm;and bring it back to me.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.980
&lrm;Until we've unlocked all the secrets,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.860
&lrm;it's too dangerous to allow any more
&lrm;Miraculous to be out in the open for long.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.620
&lrm;Is there anyone you can think of,
&lrm;Marinette?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.180
&lrm;Yes, Master. I know just the right person.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.460
&lrm;Hmm.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.660
&lrm;Listen, we can renegotiate
&lrm;the amusement-park idea if you want, OK?

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.660
&lrm;But first, I need you to chill out
&lrm;and come back home with me!

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.300
&lrm;Ladybug! My sisters have been akumatised!

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.060
&lrm;I need to bring them home.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.620
&lrm;There's a way to find your sisters,
&lrm;but we'll need your help. You interested?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.140
&lrm;Me, help you superheroes? You bet I am!

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.700
&lrm;-Just wait till I tell Marinette!
&lrm;-Hold on now, this has to be a secret.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.660
&lrm;Not a word to anyone!

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.740
&lrm;-Oh! Right! Understood!
&lrm;-Alya Césaire,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.780
&lrm;here is the Miraculous of the Fox,
&lrm;which grants the power of illusion.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.220
&lrm;You will use it for the greater good.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.980
&lrm;Once the job is done, you will return
&lrm;the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.540
&lrm;Totally, Ladybug.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.540
&lrm;What is that thing?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.860
&lrm;I am not a thing!
&lrm;My name is Trixx, and I am your kwami.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.540
&lrm;My "kwami"? I know! You're what gives
&lrm;superheroes their superpowers! Right?

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.780
&lrm;-Not bad!
&lrm;-She's an expert!

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.860
&lrm;Mind Blown! By the way, how old are you?

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.060
&lrm;Do you have any idea who Cat Noir is?

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.860
&lrm;-Stay focused, Alya!
&lrm;-Sorry, Ladybug.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.100
&lrm;Ready to become a superhero?

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.860
&lrm;You just need to say one thing,
&lrm;"Trixx, let's pounce!"

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.740
&lrm;Trixx, let's pounce!

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.180
&lrm;This is so awesome!

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.420
&lrm;But I look like Lila
&lrm;when she has been akumatised in this suit!

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.540
&lrm;Yes, but the superhero version! Come on,
&lrm;I'll explain the rest to you on the way.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.860
&lrm;Wow! This is so cool!

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.980
&lrm;Mission first!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.540
&lrm;Huh?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.740
&lrm;-What's taking so long, Ladybug?
&lrm;-There! Take his Miraculous from him!

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.380
&lrm;Aaah!

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.380
&lrm;This is so insane! I've got powers
&lrm;and I'm fighting supervillains.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.940
&lrm;Whoa!
&lrm;Who is this superhero friend of yours?

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.340
&lrm;No offence,
&lrm;but I thought I was the only one!

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.780
&lrm;Cat Noir, I'd like you to meet... uh...

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.980
&lrm;Uh... Rena Rouge!
&lrm;Yeah, my name is Rena Rouge!

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.580
&lrm;Well, sneaky fox,
&lrm;think you'll be as sneaky as a cat?

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.860
&lrm;-I dunno. Should we take bets?
&lrm;-Your friend seems pretty good!

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.740
&lrm;-I surround myself with only the best!
&lrm;-Welcome to our team.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.580
&lrm;If you need any superhero tips,
&lrm;you know where to come.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.540
&lrm;Really? You're gonna give me
&lrm;Ladybug's phone number?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.740
&lrm;I have a feeling working with you
&lrm;is gonna be a lot of fun!

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.860
&lrm;A new hero. So I was right. There are
&lrm;indeed other Miraculous in the city.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.740
&lrm;Sapotis, listen to me!
&lrm;Three superheroes are nothing against you!

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.700
&lrm;There are enough of you
&lrm;to destroy everything!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.900
&lrm;So band together and take their Miraculous
&lrm;or I'll remove your powers

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.060
&lrm;and there'll be no more mischief!

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.340
&lrm;-We're surrounded!
&lrm;-We're retreating!

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.380
&lrm;There must be thousands of them!

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.980
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.620
&lrm;An unicycle?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.860
&lrm;Whenever you're ready, Milady!

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.260
&lrm;Rakes, unicycle wheel,
&lrm;traffic cone, tape, trash can...

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.900
&lrm;-Do you always make it this complicated?
&lrm;-Trust me, Rena Rouge.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.060
&lrm;Here we go!

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.220
&lrm;Hear ye! Hear ye!
&lrm;Sapoti-Land is about to open!

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.460
&lrm;Mischief of all sizes
&lrm;are permitted in Sapoti-Land!

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.340
&lrm;All-you-can-eat desserts!
&lrm;Fountains of orange juice!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.420
&lrm;Big-kid movies and video games!

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.860
&lrm;All right, Rena Rouge!
&lrm;Time to use your power!

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.180
&lrm;I've never tried it. Hope it works!

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.980
&lrm;Just think of the illusion
&lrm;you want to create. Stay focused!

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.820
&lrm;Mirage!

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.140
&lrm;Awesome!

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.900
&lrm;My necklace is flashing! Um,
&lrm;that means I'll change back soon, right?

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.180
&lrm;Yeah, but it's OK if I see who you are.
&lrm;I can keep a secret.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.980
&lrm;Naughty kitty! You know very well
&lrm;that our identities must remain secret!

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.180
&lrm;Good job! You're a fast learner!

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.780
&lrm;If you need superhero tips,
&lrm;you know where to come!

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.940
&lrm;Follow me and I'll take you to
&lrm;Sapoti-Land, where there's no bedtime,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.220
&lrm;where everything goes!

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.900
&lrm;Sapoti-Land!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.620
&lrm;No, wait! Don't go there!
&lrm;Ladybug's trying to trap you!

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.660
&lrm;Phase two, Cat Noir. Now!

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.140
&lrm;Step right up! Step right up!
&lrm;The Sapotis get in for free!

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.620
&lrm;-All the Sapotis are in the alley.
&lrm;-Is this really gonna work?

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.420
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;Sometimes it's more absurd than this!

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.660
&lrm;Your turn, Ladybug!

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.820
&lrm;We've got all the hats, Ladybug!

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.060
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.340
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.580
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.460
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.940
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.140
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740
&lrm;Pound it!

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.700
&lrm;Ett...

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.860
&lrm;Uh... Gotta get going,
&lrm;uh, before I transform back.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.940
&lrm;Looking forward
&lrm;to fighting with you again, Rena Rouge!

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.420
&lrm;-I'll join you.
&lrm;-Bye, kitty!

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.540
&lrm;Miaow.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.180
&lrm;Can you make sure the two girls
&lrm;get back home safely?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.300
&lrm;-OK, who's gonna tell me where you live?
&lrm;-I will! Ha, ha!

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.900
&lrm;You and your friends
&lrm;have defeated me this time, Ladybug,

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.140
&lrm;but thanks to you, now I know
&lrm;there are other Miraculous in Paris,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.540
&lrm;and, most likely, a Guardian.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.540
&lrm;That was unreal!

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.420
&lrm;You really helped us a lot.
&lrm;Thank you, Alya.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.980
&lrm;You know, if I held onto it,
&lrm;I could help you again.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.220
&lrm;-You made a promise.
&lrm;-Oh, please, Ladybug.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.540
&lrm;We'd make a great team!
&lrm;I could help Cat Noir and you every day!

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.580
&lrm;-I'm about to transform back. Hurry!
&lrm;-Please!

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.420
&lrm;I have to go. I'm trusting you.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.740
&lrm;You're absolutely right, Alya.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.220
&lrm;The three of you
&lrm;would make quite the team!

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.100
&lrm;You have all the makings of a true
&lrm;superhero. You're strong, brave,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.340
&lrm;but, most of all, you're trustworthy.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.580
&lrm;You made the right choice, Marinette.
&lrm;Thanks to you,

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.140
&lrm;Paris has been saved from evil, yet again.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.740
&lrm;[door bell rings]

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.140
&lrm;Marinette! Are you OK?

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.900
&lrm;I called you tons of times.
&lrm;Why weren't you answering?

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.140
&lrm;Wait till you hear!
&lrm;Something crazy happened to me!

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:26.820
&lrm;-Really? What happened?
&lrm;-I... Uh... Well... My battery died!

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.420
&lrm;Can you believe it?
&lrm;My brand new phone! Super let down, huh!

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.180
&lrm;I'm just glad you're safe!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.460
&lrm;Ditto!

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.260
&lrm;Keep the noise down.
&lrm;My sisters are asleep, at last!

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.420
&lrm;Phew! All's well that ends well.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.300
&lrm;Thanks to Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.940
&lrm;I heard they had another superhero
&lrm;with them tonight. A girl!

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.500
&lrm;Oh, no! Seriously?
&lrm;I had no idea! Who was it?

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.300
&lrm;Weren't we going to watch a movie?

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.020
&lrm;Oh, come on! Please! Did you see her?
&lrm;Did you at least know what her name was?

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.580
&lrm;What did she look like?
&lrm;Come on, girl, tell me everything!

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.340
&lrm;[lively music]
