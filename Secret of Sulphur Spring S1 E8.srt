00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,327
Answer me or I'm coming in.

164
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,754
Come on.

165
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,099
Where are you going?
Back to the hatch.

166
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,101
To do what?
Confront your dad?

167
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,895
Well, yeah, Harper.

168
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,396
He confessed.

169
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,481
I have to know why.

170
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,399
What makes you think
he'll tell the truth now?

171
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,401
Your dad's lied
over and over again.

172
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,527
I mean, so have we.

173
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,072
Even if we come clean
about everything,

174
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,783
the bunker,
the portal, the past,

175
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,992
no way our parents
will believe us,

176
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,994
especially
after last night.

177
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,663
So we just
go on with our lives?

178
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,707
Act like my dad doesn't know
what happened to Savannah?

179
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,959
I can't.

180
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,044
What if there was
another option?

181
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,091
We saw my mom
running out of the hotel

182
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,175
right before
your dad confessed.

183
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,177
You think Jess saw something?

184
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,346
Only one way to find out.

185
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,065
I know waiting
is hard,

186
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,817
especially when you're worried sick
about your friend.

187
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,151
Savannah wasn't my friend.

188
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,445
Police are asking us
to do another head count.

189
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,239
Make sure no one else
is missing from camp.

190
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,490
Sit tight.
I'll be back soon.

191
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,748
What are you doing here?

192
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,293
Um, we saw Ben's dad pick him up.

193
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,754
I think they went back to Chicago.

194
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,797
Figured you'd want to know

195
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,507
since he didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

196
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,633
I don't care.

197
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,843
Ben was a jerk.

198
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
Because he spent more time
with Savannah than you?

199
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,557
(scoffs)
Wow.
Jump to conclusions much?

200
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,684
You're just like Ben.

201
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,769
I'm nothing like Ben.

202
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,105
You're accusing me
of being jealous.

203
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,356
He made accusations too.

204
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,317
Blamed me for what happened
to Savannah.

205
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,235
How come?

206
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,447
I‐‐ I dared her
to spend the night...

207
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,198
alone in the basement.

208
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,452
Hey, if Savannah
went through with it

209
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,370
and got grabbed by a ghost,
it's her own fault.

210
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,080
Wait.

211
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,750
So, Ben wasn't with her?

212
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,168
I'm done
talking about Ben.

213
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,171
Leave...

214
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,298
or I'll get Becky
back in here.

215
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,050
We should go, Harry.

216
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,342
Jess obviously wants
to be alone.

217
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,390
(door closes)

218
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,270
If Savannah was in
the basement all night long,

219
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
she would've had
plenty of time to look around.

220
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,148
Maybe even find the bunker.

221
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,566
She could be traveling
through time,

222
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,942
just like us.

223
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,910
Why would your sister be here?

224
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,037
'Cause Dad is.

225
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,291
Harper visits his grave a lot.

226
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,502
Makes her feel close
to him, I guess.

227
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,505
Do you visit?

228
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,381
I've been here
with Harper before.

229
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,925
It's not the same for me.

230
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,802
I don't really remember Dad.

231
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,845
Yeah, you were both
so little when he died.

232
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,514
How come
you never talk about him?

233
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,141
Well, it makes me sad

234
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,810
to think about the life
we could've had together,

235
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,604
the memories you and Harper
would have had with him.

236
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,731
She remembers things
about him.

237
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,566
Like what?

238
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,487
Trips to the zoo,
painting on the porch,

239
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,696
swimming in a lake.

240
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,157
That kind of stuff.

241
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,994
Why don't you go
look around for your sister?

242
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,914
Harper will be okay, Mom.

243
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,085
She's tough, like you.

244
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,673
Thank you, baby.

245
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,898
(tense music playing)

246
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,108
[Harper]
This has to be it.

247
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,069
[Griffin]
Savannah must have found the portal.

248
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,031
[Harper]
 Look.
Savannah could easily fit through.

249
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,409
Which means she could still
be alive somewhere in time.

250
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,286
Explains why the police
never found her.

251
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, well,
it doesn't explain why my dad confessed.

252
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,707
I mean, if she's okay,

253
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,041
why was he so upset?

254
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,965
We don't know
if Savannah came down here alone.

255
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,134
It's possible
your dad knows about the portal, too.

256
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,095
He does act weird
every time he's in the basement.

257
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,972
Let's say they found
the portal together,

258
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,932
but your dad decided
to stay behind.

259
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,310
Camp was ending.

260
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,853
He wouldn't see
Savannah again.

261
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,730
That's reason enough
to be upset.

262
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,982
I know, but think about
how my dad was as a kid.

263
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,817
I mean, no way
he'd pass up a chance to time travel.

264
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,652
He'd be up for the adventure.

265
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,155
Unless Ben thought
it'd make things harder for Savannah.

266
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,576
What do you mean?

267
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,995
Well, our parents
can be overprotective,

268
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,706
but your grandpa
is super intense.

269
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,875
If he found out Ben was sneaking off,
he'd want answers.

270
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,712
And he wouldn't stop
until he found the portal.
Exactly!

271
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,632
So, my dad
might've confessed
to keep the secret...

272
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,092
and make sure my grandpa
never came back to Sulphur Springs.

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,968
It's a good plan.

274
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,387
Yeah.

275
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,014
Was a good plan...

276
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,100
until my dad
bought the hotel.

277
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,645
Well, maybe he had
a pact with Savannah,

278
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,854
to come back one day.

279
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,330
Come on, Savannah.
What are you trying to tell me?

280
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,252
We should be
searching for Griffin.

281
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,003
Every minute counts.

282
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,630
The police told us
to stay put.

283
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,215
I can't just
wait around, Ben.

284
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,633
Our son is missing!

285
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,594
You think I like making calls
and checking social media?

286
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,012
I want to be out there
looking too, Sarah.

287
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,347
Instead, you're in here,

288
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,015
looking for ghosts.

289
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,145
Ben...

290
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,939
What's going on?

291
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,529
Talk to me.

292
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,114
Please.

293
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,662
There is something
you should see.

294
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,792
That was our chance to convince Mom and Dad
this place is haunted.

295
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,002
They didn't want to hear it.

296
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,838
Mom didn't,
but Dad was curious.

297
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,964
He even looked
a little freaked.

298
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,383
You gave up too soon.

299
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,926
Griffin ran away, Wyatt.

300
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,303
That has everyone freaked.

301
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,887
We shouldn't give Mom and Dad

302
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,180
more to worry about right now.

303
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,058
What if he didn't run away?

304
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,228
What if Griffin was taken?

305
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,065
By Savannah?

306
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,358
She has been trying
to communicate with us.

307
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,820
Maybe she got fed up
because we didn't understand.

308
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,157
Then we have to try harder.

309
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,491
Easy for you to say.

310
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,244
You're not walking around
with a bull's‐eye on your head.

311
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,330
Your hat?
That's what you're looking for?

312
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,374
Savannah doesn't care
about your red hair, Wyatt.

313
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,001
I was just
messing with you.

314
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,170
It has to be
here somewhere.

315
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,671
Wyatt, focus!

316
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,506
Griffin needs us.

317
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,842
You're right.

318
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,178
We could be his only hope.

319
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,441
Welcome to Camp Tremont.

320
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,860
Why are we here?

321
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,780
I need you
to see this place.

322
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,281
Maybe then
you'll understand

323
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,908
why I had to come back
to Sulphur Springs.

324
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,870
I loved spending summers here
as a kid.

325
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,790
Used to stay
in the bunkhouse right over there.

326
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,460
Swim in the springs,
pull pranks...

327
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,837
I already know
all about the happy memories you made at camp.

328
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,591
I lied.

329
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,428
Not all my memories here
were happy.

330
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,931
Some are pretty awful.

331
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,020
Looks the same.

332
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,271
Maybe the portal
didn't work.

333
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,231
I felt the jolt.

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,111
Okay, assuming we can bring Savannah back,
then what?

335
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,738
She'll need a cover story
about where she's been,

336
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,490
something that won't make
the police suspicious.

337
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,701
Let Savannah come up with that
on her own.

338
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,496
Your stories lead
to awkward talks and way too many questions.

339
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,289
Is thank you
too much to ask?

340
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,708
I did keep our parents
from finding out about the portal.

341
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,127
Our moms anyway.

342
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,878
Well, we can't be sure
exactly what my dad knows

343
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,004
until we find Savannah.

344
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,172
Let's check
the bunkhouse first.

345
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,842
Uh...

346
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,677
Yeah,
she's not there.

347
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,594
Why do you say that?

348
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,096
Well, 'cause
the bunkhouses aren't.

349
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,976
[Harper]
1960?

350
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,771
(tense music playing)

351
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,152
The summer
Savannah went missing...

352
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:45,987
I was here.

353
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,031
But you didn't know her.
It's not true.

354
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,159
We were friends.

355
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,120
Good friends.

356
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,247
Griffin was right.

357
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,668
I should have been honest when Griffin
first started asking

358
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,253
about Savannah's disappearance.

359
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,630
And instead,
you got mad at the kids.

360
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,301
Accused us of not giving
this place a chance.

361
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,470
And all this time,
you've been keeping secrets.

362
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,722
What happened to Savannah

363
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,599
is not something I've ever
talked about with anyone.

364
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,933
Not even Jess.

365
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,686
Why would you talk
to Harper's mom?

366
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,273
She went to camp here too.

367
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,985
Wait, what?
Sarah...

368
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,573
That's why she was telling me
to go back to Chicago.

369
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,911
Jess knew
you were lying to us.

370
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,246
(vehicle approaching)

371
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,042
Did she also know
about you buying the hotel
before I did?

372
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,585
All right,
it's not like that.

373
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,171
Jess and I lost touch
after that summer.

374
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,923
Never thought
she'd still be living in Sulphur Springs

375
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,216
or that one day
our kids would be close.

376
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,634
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,
sorry to interrupt.

377
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,093
K‐9 unit just arrived.

378
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,720
The handler's asking for
some of Griffin's clothes

379
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,679
to help track his scent.

380
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,018
It's gonna be okay.

381
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,812
You don't know that.

382
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,991
There's nobody here.

383
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,493
The Tremont
hasn't opened yet either?

384
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,535
This doesn't make sense.

385
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,206
The sign back there said 1960, right?
Yeah.

386
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,792
Hotel's been in business
since 1944.

387
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,044
There's a map of The Tremont
on the wall downstairs.

388
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,337
The date's on it.

389
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,922
Maybe the portal took us
further back in time.

390
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,676
How? Whenever we went
through before,

391
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,427
we always ended up
30 years in the past.

392
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,222
And this time we came
from the hatch from 1990.

393
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,307
So... where is everyone?

394
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,273
Hey, what are y'all doing?

395
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,358
Um... we're looking
for a friend.

396
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,986
Uh, she's blonde,
about this tall.

397
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,612
You're not gonna
find anybody here.

398
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,281
Big storm's coming.
Everybody's gone.

399
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,242
I'm only staying
long enough
to board up the windows.

400
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,785
You two kids need
to get on home, okay?

401
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,703
It's not safe here.

402
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,666
Where else
would Savannah go?

403
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,001
We don't have time
to look.

404
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,127
I thought
you wanted answers.

405
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,378
I do, but...

406
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,672
What if we're wrong?

407
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,674
I mean, what if Savannah
never found the portal?

408
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,967
We can't risk
getting stuck here for nothing.

409
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,179
Wait. Someone's inside.

410
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,058
Savannah!

411
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,727
Oh, there you are!
Thank goodness.

412
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,104
Hermione! Harry!

413
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,773
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

414
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,025
I almost started
to think

415
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,443
I stepped into
"The Twilight Zone" or something.

416
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,194
All right, listen,
we don't have a lot of time.

417
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,155
This was Ben, right?
What?

418
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,865
Pulling one last prank
before camp ends?

419
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,326
Talk about epic!

420
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,621
He emptied out an entire hotel.

421
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,205
My dad doesn't know
about the portal.

422
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,124
What?

423
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,584
This isn't a prank,
Savannah.

424
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,627
It's the past.

425
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,128
1960, we think.

426
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,796
That's why
things seem different.

427
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,798
The past?
(chuckles)

428
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,175

(window rattling)

You guys can drop the act.

432

Tell Ben to come out now.

433
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,895
Look around.
The phone, the calculator,

434
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,188
the guest book,

435
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,023
it's all from another time.

436
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,691
How could Ben have possibly
pulled this off?

437
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,403
His dad's rich.

438
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
You really think he'd ask his dad
for help with a prank?

439
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,201
Probably not,

440
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,120
but makes a lot more sense
than time travel.

441

Please, Savannah.
I know it sounds crazy,

to come with us.

he's been lying.

Griffin, what's going on?
Why aren't you at school?

<i>We have to go back.</i>
<i>Now.</i>

We're going back to Chicago.
