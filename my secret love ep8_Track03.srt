in a relationship with Park.

11
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,285
- Since when did you have a thing for him?
- 7 years ago.

12
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,279
You've had a crush on him for 7 years?

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,663
7 years that we've been together.

14
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,663
What should I do with this bad little boy?

15
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,342
What do you think I should do?

16
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,346
Mek!

17
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:37,804
This bad boy must be kissed!

18
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:39,833
Mek!

19
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:41,072
Where are you going?

20
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:43,698
Hey, hey, hey.
Enough!

21

[Pam: Hey, you. I've just arrived in Thailand. Wanna meet up?]

22
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,104
Why are you so stressed?

23
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:56,597
You study so much your brain is going to explode at this point.

24
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to get into this university,
so I need to work hard.

25
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:04,467
When you're too stressed,
you won't remember anything you read.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,675
Look at me, I have a quiz tomorrow.

27
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,000
But I'm still chillin'.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,764
Wasn't it because you were too busy chillin'
that you failed the exam last time?

29
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,427
I'm always chillin'.
It's my style.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,993
Mek...

31
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,700
You can't just keep going on like this.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,130
We're going to university in a few years.

33
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:25,052
Have you decided on want to study yet?

34
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,908
I'm considering a few options.

35
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:28,519
Either landscape or comm arts, I think.

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,870
But both of them seem hard.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,392
I don't know if I can make it.

38
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,752
I don't know if I aim too high.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Stop underestimating yourself.

40
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,285
Be confident.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,130
You may look incompetent,

42
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,259
but when you get serious, you can make it happen.

43
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,682
So...

44
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:47,363
Just go ahead and do whatever you want to do.

45
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:49,440
Stop procrastinating.

46
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,519
Otherwise, you're going to miss the opportunity to do what you love.

47
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,830
I thought you were giving me a compliment.
Why did it end up like a jab?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I guess now you'll have to meet the secret character.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,989
Here!

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You seem to love pranking people so much.
Why don't you make it a career then?

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,870
Can I do that? At which company? I want to apply.

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,818
I'll make Employee of the Month surely!

53
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,989
Some people actually do that,
like those YouTubers or content creators.

54
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,001
Who knows?

55
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,156
Maybe you'll get famous for this bad habit of yours.

56
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,207
This isn't a time to prank!

57
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,337
I though you said you were not afraid!

58
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,015
Are you really sure?

59
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,507
Mm.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,533
I thought about it all night.

61
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,793
Seriously, are we breaking up over this little matter?

62
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,046
Mm.

63
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,222
If you say so.

64
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,585
If we want to keep this relationship,
aren't we supposed to stay close?

65
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,493
Distance will only create a gap between us.

66
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:57,323
I don't want to be worried about you all day.

67
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:59,000
You know how I am.

68
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,688
If that happens, we'll eventually break up anyway.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,741
I think it's best to let you go now.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You words are so beautiful.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,389
But it hurts to hear.
You know that?

72
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm being serious here.

73
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,311
I'm trying to make it not too serious.

74
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,232
Up to you then.

75
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,689
You've already thought it through.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,585
I'll try to understand you.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry for being like this.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,274
No need to say sorry.

79
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:29,156
At least you made me realize how different we are.

80
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you for being direct.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Take care of yourself over there.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,582
Don't worry about me.

83
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,259
Worry about yourself first.

84
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,507
Just let me know if you need any help.

85
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,859

Why does he have to hesitate?

But it's a plain fact.

He doesn't do anything.

111
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,215
All he does is trying to hold on to the relationship.

Isn't this close enough?

133

If you want us to be closer,
perhaps we should do something else.

Today, I'll train you how to be calm.

You're good at this.

00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,000
Actually, the one on your front door came from my house.

00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,441
And the dead one is actually this one.

By the way, what is it called?

153

It's Marguerite.

154
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,200
And it has a good meaning.

155

What is it?

Before I know it, it becomes a forest here.

160
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,889
Even though you have a lot of plants,
you take care of them all so well.

161

You're so awesome.

162
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:17,285
I actually want to grow some more.

163
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,000
Make it like a plant nursery.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Once that happens, I will show it to you.

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
You're such a bragger!

166
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,000

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,170
It's Monstera obliqua.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,097
And this one?

169
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,532
It's Samse-Veria.

170
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,377
What about that little one?

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,279
This one?

172
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,935
Yes.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,533
It's Crossostephium.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,092
It's a pretty name.

175
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:47,570
Pretty and cute too, eh?

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,802
See this shrub?

177
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:54,897
Cute indeed.

178
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,870
This will do for today.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,130
I put you up to great work, right?

180
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:37,474
Here.

181
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm giving you this Little Fart Bag
so you can practice on how to be calm.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll check with you later if it survives or not.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,328
Also...

184
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,337
Now you'll think of me when you see it.

185
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,674
Let this Fart Bag be a reminder of me.

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,022
So you give it a name?

187
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,423
Sure.

188
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,500
If you misbehave,

189
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,863
Fart Bag will not get any nutrients or water.

190
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,441
So you start threatening a plant now?

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,274
I'm threatening you!

192
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,334
I'm outta here.

193
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,545
It's so hot.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Can I put my stuff here?

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,195
I have a lot of things.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,104
Why did you stop telling me when you come to campus?

198
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:50,493
But I didn't tell you every time, no?

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,119
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,811
Oh.

201
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,863
I didn't realize you attend this class too.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,122
We can get in class together.

204
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,311
I didn't know we'd meet by chance like this.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,700
Why have I never seen you in here before?

206
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,337
Well, I skipped class a lot.

207
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:10,587
So...

208
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,105
Is this seat taken?

209
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,150
No.

210
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:15,466
You can sit here, Pete.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,835
Did you watch the cat video I sent you?

212
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:25,000
So hilarious!

213
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,526
Yeah, I saw it.

214
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,767
You can send me more.

215
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,740
It kinda helps relieve my stress.

216
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,311
It's cute.

217
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,163
I thought you preferred dogs.

218
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,000
Didn't realize you're into cats now.

219
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,844
I don't know.

220
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,585
Just try to open up for something new, I guess.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,297
It's actually...

222
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,078
...quite lovely.

223
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:51,078
Oh!

224
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,000
I have one more cat video to show you.

225
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,559
It's so cute.

226
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,306
Isn't it adorable?

227
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:08,207
Thanks for helping me with the quiz earlier.

228
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:09,121
It's fine.

229
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,104
Don't mention it.

230
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,837
Is there any chance you can have a meal with me this week?

231
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,430
I'll go to the men's room.

232
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:22,198
I'm actually quite busy lately.

233
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:23,682
Really?

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,767
Who did you sit next to earlier?

235
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,034
His nae is Mai.

236
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you think he's cute?

237
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,481
I'm making a move on him.

238
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,104
Someone is coming on quite strong!

239
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,663
It's nothing, man.

240
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,481
Since he's very cute,

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,326
I need to move fast.

242
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:42,508
Hey!

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,172
Sorry.

244
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,156
I didn't mean to.

245
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:51,715
Who's that guy?

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,181
Don't mind him.

247
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:54,285
He's Mai's friend.

248
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,599
Hi!

249
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:00,182
What are you guys doing?

250
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,780
You seem to be in a good mood.

251
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,233
Anything good happened?

252
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,000
Is that so obvious?

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course, we can read you like a book.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,166
Now, stop talking.

255
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,211
Let's focus on the first content on Bear's Experiment.

256
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,548
Let me see it.

257
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:14,634
Here it is.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,985
"Hello, Little Bear out there."

259
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,350
"Now you're watching Bear's Experiment channel!"

260
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:21,936
Bomb's cute, isn't he?

261
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,793
"And the content for today is..."

262
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,611
That was some grand opening, eh?

263
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,026
Papa bear. Mama bear.

264
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,008
Roar!

265
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,434
That's creative.

266
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,604
Bear, you're such a genius!

267
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,755
I have Bomb to thank for.

268
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,674
He always supports me.

269
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know how to return his favor.

270
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,657
All I have...

271
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:48,778
is my cute, madly-in-love self for him.

272
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,493
Speaking of which, I'm gonna text him to tell him I miss him.

273
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:55,875
With a selfie?

274
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,916
Someone is madly in love indeed.

275
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,009
By the way...

276
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,674
I think we should tell the Hailstones right away

277
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,103
about the fact that we will say goodbye to Thunderous Sky channel.

278
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:12,233
I'll write a script for us.

279
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,923
I'll try to find old footages to use then.

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,248
Hello.

281
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,799
What's up?

282
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,000
You submitted the application for me, didn't you?

283
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

284
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:31,767
I submitted it.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I said I didn't want to apply.

286
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,610
Come on, babe.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,508
I just know that you're gonna regret it later

288
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,593
if you let this opportunity pass you by.

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,889
I'm sorry if it feels like I'm forcing you to do it.

290
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,130
You get why I did it, right?

291
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm always by your side to support you.

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,170
Love you.

293
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,518
You said 'love you' to whom?

294
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:03,662
My boyfriend.

295
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,248
Who is your boyfriend?

296
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,019
Bear, aren't you surprised by what you've just heard?

297
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,786
Your friend is having a boyfriend!

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Park has a boyfriend!

299
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,540
I've known it for some time.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,896
How do you know?

301
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,278
Your boyfriend told my boyfriend.

302
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,026
And then my boyfriend told me.

303
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,481
What is this?

304
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,531
Your boyfriend?

305
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:31,351
Whose boyfriend?

306
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:32,316
Who is your boyfriend?

307
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,397
I can't keep up now.

308
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:36,571
It's Lee!
Park's boyfriend.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,455
Lee who?

310
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,789
Lee Min-ho?

311
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,519
Or Lee Joon-gi?

312
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,735
Neither!

313
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,130
It's Lee from the student club.

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,863
He studied comm arts before switching to liberal arts with Kim.

315
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,156
They've been together for 7 years now.

316
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:53,066
What!?

317
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:54,690
Park is with Lee!?

318
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,475
Yeah.

319
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:56,890
Bear...

320
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,182
Perhaps you can let me tell my own story.

321
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,112
So, what's the story?

322
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,545
Lee and I...

323
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,000
We've been together since high school.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,585
Before I met you guys.

325
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,559
As of now...

326
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,810
It's been 7 years.

327
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,026
What!?

328
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,475
Why didn't you tell me before?

329
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,666
Because you never asked.

330
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,760
Also...

331
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,213
Back then...

332
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,187
There was some issue that Lee was worried about.

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,363
But we've put it behind us now.

334
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
What about you, Mek?

335
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,351
What's your story with Kim?

336
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:35,363
Stop staying silent.

337
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,519
You think we don't know anything?

338
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,396
It's already more than just the BL thing.

339
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:43,078
I knew it!

340
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,044
If only guessing the lotto numbers was as easy as this!

341
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:47,896
Since when?

342
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm not so sure.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,476
Before I know it...

344
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,415
I started feeling good to have him living next door,

345
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,518
to wake up to the smell of his cooking,

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,026
and to have him riding the bike with me
every morning and every evening.

347
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:08,364
I don't think you're the only one being madly in love, Bear.

348
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,312
We're so damn hot.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,729
We've won the hearts of three Student Club guys.

350
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,729
We really live up to the slogan of our channel.

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,242
I told you...

352
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:21,948
You're gonna love me like a bang!

353
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,174
Now that there's no Thunderous Sky anymore,
it's like I'm forced to grow up.

354
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:34,589
I'll go wake him up.

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,244
How would you do it?

356
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,279
[Crossostephium]

357
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,469
[How to grow]

358
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,642
Since when did you become interested in planting trees?

359
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,002
I'm just browsing randomly.

360
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Perhaps I can try doing things I've never done.

361
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,409
Lee...

362
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,838
How is it going, your photography contest?

363
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,907
Not much.

364
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,420
Park submitted the application for me.

365
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,952
I guess now I'll have to get a shot and submit it.

366
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,263
It's good then.

367
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,730
Just do it.

368
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:41,705
I think Park wants you to give it a try.

369
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,980
I'm looking forward to seeing your photo

370
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,765
and congratulating you.

371
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:47,796
Right.

372
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,420
Don't you want to enjoy such a moment with us?

373
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,061
Bomb and I are right here to support you.

374
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,324
Who knows?

375
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:56,971
In the future...

376
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,648
You might become a big name in photography.

377
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,420
You are so extra.

378
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,249
Just don't give up, Lee.

379
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:08,034
You see, I've never won a lottery
but I didn't give up.

380
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,388
One day...

381
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,895
I'm going to be a millionaire!

382
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,059
Speaking of which, it's time I checked the lottery result.

383
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:16,958
Kim...

384
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,100
Please cover the work for me
for the time being.

385
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,420
I didn't realize you're into that now.

386
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,211
Yeah, I have to pay special attention to this.

387
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,895
Getting rich in this country is not easy.

388
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,496
Hello, Hailstones.

389
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,762
We have a special announcement today.

390
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,091
We have been doing this channel for almost 5 years.

391
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,173
And it was the time of our life.

392
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,578
If it wasn't for Thunderous Sky,

393
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,955
I wouldn't have met...

394
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,220
Bear,

395
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:58,420
Park,

396
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,812
and every one of you.

397
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,572
After we have...

398
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:05,945
discussed it internally,

399
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,268
the three of us have come to a conclusion.

400
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,610
It is with great sadness to inform you that...

401
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,002
Thunderous Sky channel...

402
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,021
is coming to an end

403
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:20,705
and this video is its final episode.

404
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,686
I'd also like to take this opportunity...

405
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,287
to apologize to those who have been pranked by us

406
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,420
or fallen victims to our actions.

407
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:34,540
We sincerely apologize.

408
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:46,268
As time passes, the three of us have matured

409
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:50,129
and come to realize that
what we did was not a good thing.

410
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:54,337
It is reproachable and should not be followed.

411
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,958
From now on...

412
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:00,629
Although we are going on different paths that we each choose,

413
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,914
we will always cherish the memories we had in our hearts.

414
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,629
Thank you, Hailstones,

415
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,705
for making Thunderous Sky who we are today.

416
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:19,594
Yes!

417
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,103
Thunderous Sky!

418
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:26,230
Bang!

419
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,230
What are you guys doing?!

420
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,363
What the hell was that?!

421
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,420
Mek, you!

422
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:49,128
You guys done now?

423
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,508
Wait for me.

424
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:58,295
Hey!

425
00:21:58,295 --> 00:21:59,896
Damn you, Mek!

426
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Mek, my pants!

427
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,336
Mek!

428
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,260
Mek!

429
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:11,546
Mek!!!

430
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,458
Here's one last thing we want to tell you, Hailstones.

431
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,446
Thank you for loving us...

432
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,034
...like a bang.

433
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,838
There will be no more Thunderous Sky channel?

434
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,306
I don't want it to end.

435
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:03,860
I am such a big fan.

436
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,508
I've watched every upload.

437
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:08,420
Without Thunderous Sky channel,

438
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,553
where else can I find crazy and funny people like you guys?

439
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,660
You have papa bear with you now, Bomb.

440
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,920
This Papa bear here will make you happy every day.

441
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,420
Thunderous Sky isn't a channel.

442
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:32,907
It's people.

443
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,553
Here's one last thing we want to tell you, Hailstones.

444
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,819
Thank you for loving us...

445
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:48,793
...like a bang.

446
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:50,287
[Until we meet again.]

447
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:52,591
Now that there's no more Thunderous Sky,

448
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,933
it's like I'm being forced to grow up.

449
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,420
I'll never get a chance
to do something like this with them again.

450
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,955
Apart from you,

451
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,420
there are only these guys...

452
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,268
who always encourage me to do new things.

453
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,165
How about...

454
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,496
we're going out today?

455
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,325
It might help carry your sadness away.

456
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,698
Where are you going to take me?

457
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,034
I'm going out to take some photos
to submit to the contest.

458
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:37,642
Anyway...

459
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:40,553
You must cheer up.

460
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,420
Because...

461
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,610
I won't be able to take good pictures...

462
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:47,211
if you're still looking sad like this.

463
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:51,060
Cheer up, okay?

464
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:52,193
Please.

465
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:53,106
Mm.

466
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,338
You've got me smiling since the moment
you picked up the camera.

467
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,060
You're the best!

468
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:02,054
Come on.

469
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:04,409
Let me give you some happy energy then.

470
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,401
What's all this?

471
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,211
I'll go take a shower and get dressed.

472
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:11,888
Do you like it?

473
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:14,774
Yes, I do.

474
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,762
Where's Kim?

475
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:25,040
He hasn't got up yet?

476
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,799
Not yet.

477
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,719
I don't know why he gets up late today.

478
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,134
Okay, I'll go wake him up.

479
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,914
How would you do it?

480
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,211
Okay. I have to go now.

481
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:37,603
Bye.

482
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:44,812
Kim!

483
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:47,762
Rise and shine!

484
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,306
You're feeling unwell?

485
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,230
Hey, Kim!

486
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:16,420
I probably should go home.

487
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:18,629
You can take this bottle garden.

488
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,836
Why do you always make me worried?

489
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,110
You know, you're so good at playing with my heart.

490
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,441
Here's magic medicine from me.

491
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:33,110
I don't need to taste it to know that it's good!

492
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,362
This is awesome!

493
00:29:36,535 --> 00:29:37,525
Or perhaps a little.

494
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,769
So I'll know how good of a chef I am!

495
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:18,861
[Make sure you finish it all
because I poured my heart into it ❤]

496
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,751
Oh, what is it that Kim made?

497
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:09,339
Ugh.

498
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,770
Kim!

499
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,203
Who made this soup? It tastes awful!

500
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:19,629
Did you finish it?
I'll go return the pot.

501
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:21,980
No need to wait until I finish.

502
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:23,900
Just return it fast.

503
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,588
Bye.

504
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,654
I missed Thai food so much living there.

505
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:34,609
There were some Thai restaurants but...

506
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,346
The taste is just not right.

507
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:38,083
Not at all.

508
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,759
Since I came back, I've had papaya salad almost every day.

509
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,797
If you love it that much, why don't you make it yourself?

510
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:48,110
Pam can't even hold a knife the right way.

511
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,750
She's only good at studying.

512
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,956
Speak for yourself!

513
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:53,247
Your cooking sucks too.

514
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,203
You're only good at planting trees and that's it.

515
00:31:57,504 --> 00:32:00,504
Speaking of which, I want a plant for my working desk at home.

516
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:02,589
You can take bottle garden from my room.

517
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:05,389
Mm.

518
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:26,109
Hi, Kim!

519
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:32,827
Are you feeling better?

520
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,303
You're still sick.

521
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,609
You should rest at home.

522
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:41,028
I'm here to return the pot.

523
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:48,477
Oh!

524
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:49,792
This is Pam.

525
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:51,259
One of my close friends.

526
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,869
She just came back from overseas.

527
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:00,448
Kim, come join us for dinner.

528
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:03,354
No, Dao.
Kim isn't feeling better yet.

529
00:33:03,354 --> 00:33:05,448
What if you get sick too?

530
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,458
Just let Kim get back to rest.

531
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,374
It's fine, Kim.

532
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:12,636
Just come have dinner with us.

533
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,395
It's okay, Dao.

534
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,353
I probably should go home.

535
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:19,901
I'll go now.

536
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:22,629
Get some rest so you can get better soon.

537
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,723
Fart Bag!

538
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,090
You're not going to get any food or water today

539
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:00,620
thanks to Mek.

540
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,959
Your room is a mess like before.

541
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:21,709
Ever thought of tidying it up?

542
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,454
Just let it be.

543
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:24,297
If I do that, I won't be able to find my stuff.

544
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:25,450
I'm not going to be used to that.

545
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,149
Got it?

546
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,669
Here.

547
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,004
I thought you stopped doing this after choosing comm arts.

548
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,762
We can be into different things at the same time, can't we?

549
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:46,278
Being a comm arts student doesn't mean I have to give up this.

550
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,278
What do you plan to do after graduation?

551
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:51,445
I don't know.

552
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:53,109
I'll think about it after senior year ends.

553
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:55,748
At my university, there's this short-term course.

554
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:58,383
It's a course on landscape architecture that you like.

555
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:01,316
If you haven't figured out what to do next,
maybe you can apply for it.

556
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,390
Actually, I saw the call for applications.

557
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,703
But I haven't decided.

558
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,233
You don't need to worry ahead about the result.

559
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,195
If you want to do it, just do it.

560
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:11,590
But...

561
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:14,410
If you do get in and have to be far away from here,

562
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,789
will you be okay with it?

563
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,669
You probably end up breaking someone's heart again.

564
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,413
Just like when you broke mine.

565
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:22,109
I let you go so you can meet someone nice there.

566
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,109
That was a huge sacrifice on my part.

567
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:26,523
That's why I'm feeling grateful as we speak.

568
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,109
I see. You're a celebrity now.

569
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,448
You have a BL partner too.

570
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:38,015
I only do it because the chancellor told me to.

571
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:38,997
Nothing much.

572
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:40,846
And don't you like him?

573
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,068
Yes, I like him.

574
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,109
A lot.

575
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:45,072
A real lot!

576
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:49,823
I'm glad that you can now declare your love for something right away,

577
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,537
unlike in the past

578
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:53,221
where you couldn't answer a thing.

579
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,109
"I don't know." "I don't like it."

580
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:56,959
If you want to do it, then just do it.

581
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:57,973
But make sure you think thoroughly.

582
00:35:58,349 --> 00:35:59,335
And don't hesitate.

583
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:02,655
Whether it's a dream or a passion,

584
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,788
don't just let it float in the air.

585
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,908
Reach out your hand and grab it.

586
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:08,776
Well...

587
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,109
I gotta go now.

588
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,394
Thanks for this bottle garden.

589
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:17,449
What?

590
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,142
A goodbye hug.

591
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:28,819
Bye.

592
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:31,459
Tidy up, okay?

593
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,052
Yes, ma'am

594
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:51,349
What if Mek is the kind of guy who doesn't use the word love to express his feelings?

595
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,537
I made Kim upset.

596
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:53,752
I don't know how to fix it.

597
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:54,909
What did you do to him?

598
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:56,469
Something stupid, I'm sure.

599
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,999
If you wait any longer, it could get worse.

600
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,174
Hello.

601
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:57,243
Ah! About Tim's slot, right?

602
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,257
Sure.

603
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,690
I'll fit it into his schedule next week.

604
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:03,485
We're looking forward to it as well.

605
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:04,318
Thank you.

606
00:38:19,569 --> 00:38:20,815
What do you think about this look?

607
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,547
Does it suit me?

608
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,151
I don't think it suits you.

609
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:27,341
Usually...

610
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:29,811
You wear it like this.

611
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,584
Now you're looking a lot more like yourself.

612
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,466
By the way...

613
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:40,446
Can you help me match an outfit?

614
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,026
What for?

615
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:44,195
Do you have some event to attend?

616
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:45,190
Well...

617
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,999
Pete asked me out for a meal.

618
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:49,871
So I want to make sure I dress well.

619
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:52,775
Where?

620
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:53,881
When?

621
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:55,338
On what date?

622
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,298
Why are you asking so many questions?

623
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,185
Do you want to join us?

624
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,121
Will you be there to screen him?

625
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:04,908
I don't think I have the right to do that.

626
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,591
You told me yourself...

627
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,169
that you wanted to make your own decisions.

628
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,928
You're right.

629
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,794
Thank you for letting me make my own decisions.

630
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:42,775
Mek.

631
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:43,833
Why are you hanging around here?

632
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,437
I'm waiting for Kim.

633
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:47,398
Is he ready?

634
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,327
Kim's left for campus for a while now.

635
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:50,962
Didn't he tell you?

636
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,378
Kim didn't tell me anything.

637
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,908
Did you do anything to make him upset?

638
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,233
It's about what happened yesterday.

639
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,004
Mek, you're such a fool.

640
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,091
Don't you have any clue?

641
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:05,292
But we were just having dinner as usual.

642
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,444
I didn't do anything wrong.

643
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:09,021
It's about Pam's visit.

644
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:11,071
Do I have to tell you about every single thing?

645
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:13,962
Come on, Q, let's go to school.

646
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:25,959
Alright, guys, today we're going to learn about the history of Europe.

647
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,502
Has anyone read in advance?

648
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:31,708
Is the first item the correct answer, Kimhan?

649
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:35,950
Did you just sigh at me?!

650
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,024
Do you have any idea...

651
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:38,863
how sad you're making me feel?

652
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:40,601
You've changed, Kimhan!

653
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,484
It's not like that, Professor.

654
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:43,672
I was just...

655
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,289
...spaced out.

656
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,125
I'm the one who sets the paper this time,

657
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,527
so you guys better pay attention in class.

658
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:55,076
Are you okay?

659
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:56,505
I'm upset with Mek.

660
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,752
I thought he was going to call me in the morning to clear things up,

661
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:01,820
but he didn't.

662
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,426
Since when did you become so petty?

663
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,199
That's just how couples are.

664
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:09,039
It may sound like no big deal
when it's about others.

665
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,708
Only when it happens to you

666
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,210
that you realize how tough it is.

667
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,373
Well...

668
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:17,112
Mek and I, we are not official yet.

669
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:18,891
I thought you two were already in a relationship.

670
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:20,779
Relationship what?

671
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,332
He never even tells me he likes me once.

672
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:25,196
He only said that...

673
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,936
...he was possessive of me.

674
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:32,140
Maybe Mek is the kind of guy who doesn't use the word love to express his feelings?

675
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:35,196
Maybe he'd rather demonstrate it through his actions.

676
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:37,973
What exactly did he do to upset you, though?

677
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:39,290
Well...

678
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,648
Yesterday his ex showed up at his house.

679
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:45,380
And he just told me to go home

680
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,837
because I still had a fever.

681
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,327
Clearly, he was worried about you.

682
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,971
Maybe it was just his stupid way to express it

683
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:55,381
that makes you upset like this.

684
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:58,801
Why don't you just tell him you like him
and get it over with?

685
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,051
You don't need to wait for him to make the first move.

686
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,214
You can be the one to do that.

687
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:03,637
Take me for an example.

688
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:06,045
I came on strong, but now I have Bear for myself.

689
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:08,158
He's right.

690
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:11,060
I think, in the end, you two are on the same page.

691
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:16,188
Perhaps he can be a bit shy too, you know?

692
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,600
So I should do it?

693
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:19,282
Give it a try.

694
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,776
Okay.

695
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:24,538
Let's go.

696
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:27,867
I made Kim upset.

697
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,201
I don't know how to fix it.

698
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,670
What did you do to him?

699
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,211
Something stupid, I'm sure.

700
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:34,434
You should patch things up with him.

701
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:36,216
If you wait any longer, it may get worse.

702
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:38,423
The thing is, I don't know what I did wrong.

703
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,240
I do nothing but care about him.

704
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,584
Where did I mess up?

705
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:45,782
My sister said it has something do with Pam showing up.

706
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:46,716
There you go.

707
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:48,776
That's where it all started.

708
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:50,937
Kim probably got jealous.

709
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,534
Well, well.

710
00:42:52,776 --> 00:42:55,802
Didn't you get bitter too when Tim was messing with Kim?

711
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,955
Now, do you realize what you did?

712
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:02,612
Hurry up and make things right with him now!

713
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,719
I've just come up with an idea to do that.

714
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,633
But you guys have to help me.

715
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,202
The mission starts now!

716
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,518
Roger that!

717
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,131
Yeah, like that.

718
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:24,451
Add some more of this.

719
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:26,651
You have to shake it harder.

720
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,653
Like this.

721
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:29,565
Yeah.

722
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,253
Did you forget to add this?

723
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:39,311
Higher.

724
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:41,880
More right.

725
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:03,568
Q.

726
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,542
Are you home?

727
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:13,651
Q.

728
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:17,864
Where is she?

729
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:27,417
Woah!

730
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:30,818
Who is that?

731
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,593
Woah!

732
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,241
Happy birthday, Kim.

733
00:45:41,193 --> 00:45:42,477
Please don't be mad at me.

734
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:46,258
Make a wish.

735
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:00,191
What did you wish for?

736
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,624
Did you include me in your wish?

737
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:13,052
I like you.

738
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:33,580
What do you guys plan to do next after we graduate?

739
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,211
You just have to make a decision.

740
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:37,002
There's nothing complicated about it.

741
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,825
Is your indecisive tendency coming back?

742
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:41,174
I know you're a man-child,

743
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:42,973
but I never knew you'd be such a coward.

744
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:46,289
Do you remember that time I told you
that I want to take on something new?

745
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:47,882
And what does it have to do with Kim?

746
00:46:47,882 --> 00:46:49,152
Are you by yourself?

747
00:46:49,152 --> 00:46:52,073
Mai and I, we're not that inseparable.

748
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,839
I'm so disappointed.

749
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,303
I don't get why Kim even likes you.

750
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:58,663
He probably has someone else in his mind now.
