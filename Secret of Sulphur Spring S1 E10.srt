00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,479
Wyatt: <i>Previously on
"Secrets of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,814
Savannah! Hold on, we're coming!

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,066
Griffin,
we have to go. The hatch is stuck.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,301
I realize it was wrong
not talking about your dad.

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,738
‐Harper: <i>How did you meet?</i>
‐Jess: <i>At Camp Tremont.</i>

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,656
<i>He stuck his hand out,
and he said,</i>

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,200
<i>"Hi, I'm Chris."</i>

8
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,391
Ben: <i>We camped out.</i>

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,621
But after I fell asleep,
Savannah snuck out.

10
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>So I did too.</i>

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>We heard a noise. I took off.</i>

12
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,903
<i>And I didn't know
till the next morning.</i>

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,113
Harper: Griffin, look.

14
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,091
Griffin: Is that Savannah?

15
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,593
In 1962.

16
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,011
<i>We have to go back. Now.</i>

17
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,639
‐Harper,
my family is moving. ‐What?

18
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,974
‐If we could just find
Savannah‐‐ ‐You could stay.

19
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,227
But the portal only takes
us back 30 years at a time.

20
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,020
Maybe there's a
way to control it.

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,254
Let's find out.

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,067
Bingo.

23
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,193
Griffin: Dial it to
the same numbers

24
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,217
from the one upstairs.

25
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,155
It's Savannah.

26
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,619
And she's trying
to help us find her.

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,441
So...

28
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,461
what do we do now?

29
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,546
Guess we're supposed to push it.

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,547
Griffin: W‐W‐Wait!

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,114
How do we know
it's not gonna like...

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,050
melt off our faces or something?

33
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,636
Because Savannah
is the one guiding us.

34
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,680
She wants us to save her,
not melt our faces.

35
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,247
Yeah, that's a good point.

36
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,019
Whoa.

37
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,731
Harper: Looks like some
kind of weird combination lock.

38
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,942
1‐9‐9‐0.

39
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,051
Wait. I've got it.

40
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,072
They're Roman numerals. 1990.

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,574
We've only been
able to travel back

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,284
30 years from where we are now,
right?

43
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,727
‐Right. ‐So...

44
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,914
maybe this little
dial gives us control,

45
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,040
so we can choose any year.

46
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,376
Okay, uh, try 1962.

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,128
That picture I
found of Savannah?

48
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,312
That's the year it was taken.

49
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,048
Must be where
she wants us to go.

50
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,409
Six and two.

51
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,661
That's 1962.

52
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,830
Nothing.

53
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,415
It's too bad.

54
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,501
It's a pretty good theory.

Ready for one last trip?

I mean,
before you have to go back to Chicago.

59
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,559

but we should be in Chicago
by the end of the week.

I can start back at the

Yeah, it's what I want.

That's Dad's GTO, right?

Yeah,
and before you and your sister were born,

00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,499
that yellow car was
his baby. (chuckles)

He was planning
to sell it though.

Never told me why.

91

So... that's what he
was driving when...

92
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,176
It's okay.

93

But that morning...
he got into an accident.

Right.

Um, yeah, actually,

we're looking for
a friend of ours.

119

Is your friend a
guest of the hotel?

we can't go inside? ‐No.

I'm saying she can't.

What? Why? What did she do?

It's not something I did, okay?

132

It's the color of my skin.

I can believe it, Griffin.

142

Look around you.

Look at the year.

can be so calm about it.

Yeah,
I know. I'm sorry. It's just...

‐As soon as possible.

those towels down to the springs?

Yep, I just did,

Hey,
is it okay if I knock off a little early?

166
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,116
I wanted to show
them the tree house.

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,392
Okay. Just don't
be gone too long.

168
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,162
Thanks, Mom.

169
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,395
Follow me.

170
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,981
(whispers): Mom?

171
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,963
And you're sure
that spot was here?

172
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,298
Of course I'm sure.

173
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,366
We made this map together,
remember?

174
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,178
This is crazy.

175
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,079
Twelve cold spots and now...

176
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,082
(exhales)

177
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,001
Nope. No frost.

178
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,674
You don't think Savannah's hiding from us,
do you?

179
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,927
I don't know. Maybe.

180
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,698
‐Or what if... ‐What?

181
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,783
What if she stopped haunting us

182
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,701
because she finally
got what she wanted?

183
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,161
What do you mean?

184
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,081
Well,
we are moving back to Chicago.

185
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,792
Maybe she's just happy to
have this place to herself again.

186
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,816
Wow.

187
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,711
I hope that's not it.

188
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,047
How could Savannah not like us?

189
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,531
We're her biggest fans.

190
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,761
So after the tree fell
on the hatch in 1960,

191
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,665
I ran back to The Tremont
to ride out the storm.

192
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,807
Next morning, I went outside,

193
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,849
and the first person I saw

194
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,685
was this really cool
lady named Caroline.

195
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,478
That woman that we met?

196
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,772
Your mom? She seems really nice.

197
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,107
She's the best.

198
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,174
She's literally the
sweetest person ever.

199
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,569
And when she and her husband,
Ray,

200
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,737
my dad,

201
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,364
found out I was a foster kid,

202
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,032
they gave me a place to crash.

203
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,119
Next thing you know,
we're a family!

204
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,870
‐Like for real? ‐Yup.

205
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,396
Adoption became
official last month.

206
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,143
They even built me this
cool tree house to celebrate.

207
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,377
So that's where
this thing came from.

208
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,195
Yeah,
I always felt a connection to it.

209
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,990
‐Now I know why. ‐It's great,
Savannah.

210
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,719
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

211
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,387
You said you had a favor to ask?

212
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,163
Oh, yeah, right. Um...

213
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,184
‐So‐‐ ‐Uh,
first thing you should know is...

214
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,461
we haven't been entirely honest.

215
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,940
Yeah. Our names aren't
really Harry and Hermione.

216
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,758
‐I'm Griffin. ‐Harper.

217
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,135
We are... from the future.

218
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,280
Me too. Remember?

219
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,098
Yeah, but... further than you.

220
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,515
2020.

221
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,018
2020?

222
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,852
For real?

223
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,147
I have to know.

224
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,251
Are there jet packs? Robots?

225
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,568
Flying cars?

226
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,337
Harper: Um...

227
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,465
There is a lot of cool stuff.

228
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,990
Ben Campbell is my dad.

229
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,620
‐Excuse me? ‐Ben? Your friend?

230
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,182
‐From camp? ‐Uh‐huh.

231
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,791
That guy has kids?

232
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,561
‐No way. ‐Yeah.

233
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,295
Yeah,
and my mom's Jessica Carlton.

234
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,089
Jess?

235
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,840
How's that possible?

236
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,612
You're so cool,
and your mom is so... not.

237
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,304
Good news is she got nicer.

238
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,035
And Ben? How's he doing?

239
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,286
Well, actually...

240
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,978
ever since you went missing...

241
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,065
my dad felt really guilty.

242
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,192
Why?

243
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,071
Well... I was hoping
you could answer that.

244
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,383
Even after 30 years,
it's still causing problems.

245
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,968
And not just for him.

246
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,202
My mom too.

247
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,181
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

248
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,124
It's okay. There's still
a way you can help.

249
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,251
Of course! Anything.

250
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,522
I mean as long as it's not‐‐

251
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,464
We need you to come
through the hatch with us.

252
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,111
Look, I wish I could,

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,803
but I can't leave here.

254
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,097
I mean, ever.

255
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,165
Savannah: I have a family now.

256
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,750
Griffin: But they won't
even know that you're gone.

257
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,710
You could sneak away
tonight and be back in an hour.

258
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,963
‐We do it all the time.
‐And you never get caught?

259
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,280
No, never.

260
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,175
I‐‐ I mean, practically never.

261
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,678
And what if something
goes wrong again?

262
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,263
Like that falling tree branch.

263
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,597
I could be stuck there forever.

264
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,998
Well, um...

265
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,977
Please just try to understand.

266
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,353
For the first time in my life,

267
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,045
I have a mom and
dad who love me.

268
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,130
If I ever lost that...

269
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
I just...

270
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,466
Griffin, she's right.

271
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,947
‐It's a bad idea. ‐Uh, bad idea?

272
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,240
Hello?

273
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,265
Chicago?

274
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,559
‐(bell ringing) ‐What's that?

275
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,537
My mom.

276
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,438
Dinnertime. Do you want to come?

277
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,542
We're having TV dinners,
which are really just frozen dinners

278
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,043
you eat in front of the TV.

279
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,588
Thanks, but we should get back,

280
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,197
try and figure out another plan.

281
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,783
Look... I'm sorry, Griffin.

282
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,660
I really am,

283
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,203
but it's my one chance.

284
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
At a family.

285
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,706
At a family.

286
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,252
I understand.

287
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,648
And I'm happy for you.

288
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,567
Really.

289
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,318
(bell ringing)

290
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,343
I better go.

291
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,487
Good luck with your parents.

292
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,805
You too. Bye, Savannah.

293
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,227
(whimsical music playing)

294
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,061
What?

295
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,105
I just had an idea.

296
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,306
Probably start a new one.
This thing's gonna weigh a ton.

297
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,130
Mom! Dad!

298
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,464
You're not gonna believe this!

299
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,507
‐What is it? ‐All the
cold spots are gone!

300
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,760
Savannah's stopped
haunting the hotel.

301
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,784
I see.

302
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,348
So this hat I found behind
the couch this morning...

303
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,933
Guess I don't need it anymore.

304
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,667
Maybe we don't have to move now.

305
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,979
Well,
while I am glad to see this hat gone‐‐

306
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,088
We're still moving.

307
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,107
But not because of any ghosts.

308
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,735
You guys know none of that was real,
right?

309
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,612
Yeah? Then why'd
you seem so scared

310
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,614
of what you saw on the mirror?

311
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,098
Wyatt: What was that anyway?

312
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,977
That... uh, was a mistake.

313
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:50,996
Your brother was missing,

314
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,148
and sometimes stress
can cause a person...

315
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,775
to see things.

316
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,362
Anyway,
that's behind us now, okay?

317
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,507
And you two still
have a lot of stuff

318
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,716
on the back porch to pack up.

319
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,426
So, come on, let's get started.

320
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,451
Zoey: Fine.

321
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,289
(door opens)

322
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,269
‐Harper? ‐Mr. Campbell,
you have to come quick.

323
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,687
‐What's wrong? ‐It's Griffin.

324
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,022
We were goofing off
in this old tree house.

325
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,715
He fell.

326
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,183
Griffin...

327
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,104
No, Dad, Dad, it's okay.

328
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,416
(grunts) I'm fine.

329
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,733

00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,026
You mean we're not
going back to Chicago?

495
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,511
Nope. And you're okay with that,
right?

496
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,448
You kidding? That's amazing!

497
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,158
Whoa!

498
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,182
Sorry.

499
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,163
Wait, I have to call Harper.

500
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,187
Call her then.

501
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,274
(Griffin whoops)

502
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,735
‐Well,
I guess we made somebody's day. ‐Yeah.

503
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,748
(radio whirring,
electricity crackling)

504
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,133
(intense music playing)

505
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,154
Where are you? I thought
we were gonna talk.

506
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,115
Oh, well, I've got great news,

507
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,974
so call me back
as soon as you can.

508
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,954
‐Griffin,
did you hear? ‐We're not moving!

509
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,646
Yeah! Mom and Dad told me.

510
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,500
Hey,
Griff. I was just unpacking this thing

511
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,919
and kind of got the urge to jam.

512
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,070
‐What do you think? ‐Yeah! Yeah,
sure.

513
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,740
You guys have fun with that.

514
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,762
Let's go downstairs. Mom's
making banana waffles.

515
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,682
Yes, perfect! And we're staying.

516
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,207
This is, like,
the best day ever.

517
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,960
Now if we can just get
Savannah to come back.

518
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,631
‐Zoey: They smell so good. ‐Wyatt: I know,
right?

519
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,321
(creaking)

520
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,347
(eerie music playing)

521
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,003
Hey! Stop!

522
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,945
Hey,
what's up? You need some help?

523
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,971
(engine idling)

524
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,080
Harper: <i>Next time on
"Secrets of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

525
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,456
‐What are you
doing? ‐Wyatt: Shhh.

526
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,816
<i>It started rocking
all by itself.</i>

527
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,503
Griffin: <i>It's like it
was reaching out,</i>

528
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,004
<i>like it was pointing the way.</i>

529
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,089
(objects clattering)

530
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,423
Hey, guys.

531
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,008
‐Did you miss me?
‐Griffin: Savannah?

532
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,386
Savannah: <i>So, a ghost that's
not me. Who do you think it is?</i>

533
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,221
Griffin: <i>I noticed that
the tumblers in the radio</i>

534
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,806
were set to 2011,

535
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,182
the year that your dad died.

536
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,601
Oh, you really don't wanna
take Bayou Road.

537
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,252
<i>You should take
Sugar Hill instead.</i>

538
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,004
‐Look out! ‐(horn blaring)

539
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,028
