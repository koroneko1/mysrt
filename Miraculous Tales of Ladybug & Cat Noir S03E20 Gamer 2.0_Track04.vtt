‎Mommy! I wanna go on the merry-go-round!
‎Pretty please?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.580
‎As many times as you like, sweetheart.
‎It's Sunday!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.500
‎Yay!

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.020
‎When were paid holidays
‎instituted in France?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.300
‎Oh, please don't talk about holidays.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.580
‎But it's for your history test tomorrow,
‎Marinette!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.900
‎OK. First paid holiday, summer 1936!

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.580
‎Good job! Uh... you're drawing
‎on the T-shirt right now.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.860
‎-Aaah!
‎-Perhaps you should take a little break?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.740
‎I can't, Tikki! It's all due tomorrow!
‎Tomorrow. Tomorrow!

‎Marinette!
‎Ultimate Mecha Strike tournament time!

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140
‎Video games?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.180
‎It's been so long
‎since I last played video games.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.700
‎No! I can't give in! Dad, with the T-shirt
‎for Kitty Section, the History test,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.420
‎the sketches for Jagged's new poster,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.580
‎I still have 72 hours of work left
‎to fit in by tomorrow.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.380
‎And the week after, that's worse!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.580
‎I don't have a choice.
‎I have to stop playing!

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.900
‎Stop playing? But, Marinette,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.980
‎playing is like that little pinch of salt
‎in baguettes. It makes life tastier!

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.060
‎I've got so many cakes baking in the oven,
‎they're all on the verge of getting burnt!

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.860
‎No amount of salt is gonna fix this!

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.460
‎Fine. That's too bad. But remember,
‎watch your apple pie, sweetheart.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.340
‎It's bubbling all over your cinnamon flan.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.020
‎Oh, why does she have to grow so fast?

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.100
‎It's a part of life.
‎So... best of three do the laundry?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.340
‎Ha!

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.660
‎ You got me! I don't believe it.
‎You've been practicing in secret!

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.460
‎ Triple Cosmic Kick! Bam!

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420
‎- Yes! I got you!
‎- Oh, no!

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.060
‎So, paid vacation was instituted
‎to allow workers to... ?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.460
‎Take a break. Play video games.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.300
‎No!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.500
‎Found it. It really was just a dream.
‎I filled it out, for real!

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.180
‎Now, I just need to finish
‎the Kitty Section T-shirts,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.420
‎-review my English lessons and colouring.
‎- It's for my new video game.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.380
‎Ah! Video games.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.860
‎Colouring the poster.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.220
‎ I'd love to test
‎your video game, Max,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.220
‎but I promised Prince Ali
‎we'd go on a charity cruise

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.980
‎on his yacht this afternoon. Sorry.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.540
‎-Kim!
‎-Yeah?

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.740
‎Interested in the best fighting game?
‎100% created by your best friend!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.100
‎A fighting game he designed himself...
‎Aaah! What's wrong with me?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.700
‎I'm sure I'd get highest score,
‎but I've got swimming practice.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.900
‎Ondine's waiting for me.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.900
‎Alix! You up for testing my game?

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.860
‎It has 50 characters,
‎and you can loot their equipment!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.140
‎50... Loot... Aaah! No, no, no, no!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.020
‎No, can't do.
‎I've got a skate contest coming up!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.260
‎No winning without training!

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.740
‎It sounds amazing, but I've got fencing,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.260
‎then my Chinese lesson, a photoshoot...

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.980
‎A game with former akumatised people?

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.900
‎-What do you say?
‎-We still have plenty of pages to finish!

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.500
‎We'd gladly help, if it weren't for
‎our costume fitting at Marinette's!

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.700
‎Ah! Marinette!
‎The most skilled gamer in the whole class!

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.340
‎We won the interschool
‎tournament together!

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.380
‎-Of course she won't say--
‎-No!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.820
‎-But I haven't said anything yet.
‎-And I don't want you to say it!

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.140
‎Because then I wouldn't be able to refuse!
‎And I have to resist!

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.300
‎I've got too much to do today!
‎A poster to sew for Jagged Stone!

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.060
‎I mean, a Jagged T-shirt
‎for drawing Kitty. I mean... Argh!

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.100
‎What Dupain-Cheng is trying to tell you,
‎using this ridiculously fake excuse,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.020
‎is she doesn't want to play
‎your dumb video game!

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.820
‎In fact, no one wants to,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.100
‎because everyone has
‎a more interesting life, even Marinette,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.020
‎-which is saying something!
‎-No, It's not a fake excuse!

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.460
‎I do have a Jagged poster to knit Kitty!
‎No! To post a stone. To stone a jag.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.460
‎Aaah! I'm late!

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.340
‎Ah, Markov! At least I can count on you!

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.820
<i>‎Sorry, Max. I'm connected to the worldwide</i>
<i>‎artificial intelligence network.</i>

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.940
<i>‎We're looking into global warming.</i>

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.500
‎But I need you to help me
‎test my video game.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.020
<i>‎Impossible. To optimise my results,</i>

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.300
<i>‎I have eliminated all recreational</i>
<i>‎activities from my system.</i>

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.100
‎Oh, how depressing!

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.300
‎All of his friends having such important
‎and serious things to do!

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.100
‎I, however, love a good game,
‎and I've got all the time in the world!

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.100
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise him!

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.740
‎Nice to see you again, Gamer 2.0!

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.020
‎Our last little round felt
‎a little incomplete.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.900
‎So, how about a rematch?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.700
‎I could give your game
‎a whole new dimension.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.260
‎One thing hasn't changed, though.
‎I'm only asking for one tiny reward.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.660
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!
‎Game on!

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.900
‎One more ticket for--

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.860
‎Huh?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.900
‎-Something smells bad around here, Plagg.
‎-Oh, could it be Brie? Reblochon?

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.420
‎-Camembert? Please tell me it's that.
‎-No. I smell evil!

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.380
‎ Plagg, claws out!

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.620
‎The last one!

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.620
<i>‎What do you do when no one wants</i>
<i>‎to play with you? You give them no choice!</i>

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.340
‎-Max?
<i>‎-Ladybug, Cat Noir,</i>

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.540
<i>‎all of these people were once akumatised</i>
<i>‎and then saved by you!</i>

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.860
<i>‎If you want another chance at freeing</i>
<i>‎them, you'll have to play with me!</i>

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.340
‎I think you're gonna have to take a break.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.420
‎Let's make it quick.
‎I still have a lot to do!

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.700
‎Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.380
‎-The first one who finds a way in wins!
‎-We don't have time to play!

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.180
‎I've got a ton of other things to do!

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.540
<i>‎So, Ladybug and Cat Noir, ready to play?</i>
<i>‎Please enter your pyrapod.</i>

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.580
‎-What if it's a trap, milady?
‎-No, I'm sure it's not.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.940
‎He just wants to play.
‎So, let's keep in touch!

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.980
‎ Take your pyrapod!

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.940
‎Welcome to Miraculous All-Star Brawl!
‎If you win, I'll set you free.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.180
‎-You and all of them! But, if you lose...
‎-I don't have time to lose, Gamer!

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.580
‎Let's begin and get this over with!

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.020
‎ Your hastiness
‎will be your downfall, Ladybug.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.140
‎My chance of winning has just shot up 86%!

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.500
<i>‎The Mime! Riposte! Ready? Fight!</i>

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.300
‎ I'm gonna slice you into sashi-mime!

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.300
‎Wouldn't you be better off
‎with Cat Noir lending you a helping paw?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.620
‎ I know what I'm doing!

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.460
‎Careful!
‎The mimed object disappears if you talk!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.620
‎ Thank you, Captain Obvious!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.460
‎- Au revoir!
‎- Aaah!

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.540
‎<i>‎ Ring out! Mime wins!</i>

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.420
‎Talking on purpose? Miming your own yo-yo?
‎Clever as ever, milady!

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.460
‎-I won, Gamer 2.0! Release us!
‎-A game with just one round?

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.980
‎Where's the fun in that?

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.260
‎It doesn't end
‎till you've battled all the characters!

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.620
‎-But this is gonna take forever!
‎-That's the best part about it!

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.460
‎-The longer, the better.
‎- My turn! My turn!

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.900
‎Frightingale. Stormy Weather. Awesome!

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.100
‎But a little too awesome
‎for a first battle. Oh! My copycat!

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.740
‎No, I'd be too good as myself.
‎That would be too easy.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.540
‎ Hurry up! Choose Copycat
‎and cataclysm this game away

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.140
‎so we can get back home!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.860
‎Fine. If we need to hurry this up...

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.500
‎- Roo! Roo!
‎-You've got to be kidding me!

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.700
‎ I've always wanted
‎to train pigeons!

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.140
‎  There aren't even
‎any pigeons in this stadium!

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.380
‎ Roo! Roo!

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.180
‎ There is one!
‎And I'm gonna call him Fiery Phoenix!

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.220
‎ More like Megaflop Phoenix!

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.260
‎It's gonna be the fastest victory ever!

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.100
‎Aaah! Go away, you flying rat!

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.060
‎ Double-ankle grab and smash!

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.420
‎ Somersault wrap trap!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.940
‎ Feathered face wash!

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.220
‎ The volatile's elbow!

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.820
‎<i>‎ Mr Pigeon wins!</i>

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.420
‎ Pound it, Fiery Phoenix!

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.940
‎-Impossible!
‎-Can't we play the whole match in one go?

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.540
‎Then it wouldn't be fun anymore!

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.500
‎We've got more rounds left,
‎plus the finale!

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.780
‎If you ask me, this was never fun!

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.700
<i>‎Befana! Dark Owl! Ready? Fight!</i>

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.740
‎You called for coal, bird brain?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.580
‎ Owl mist!

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.580
‎ Hoomerangs!

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.300
‎ Aaah!

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.900
<i>‎Ring out! Dark Owl wins!</i>

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.420
‎ Hoo-hoo! No one is as laser-precise
‎as The Dark Owl!

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.220
‎-You got lucky, that's all!
‎-My turn!
