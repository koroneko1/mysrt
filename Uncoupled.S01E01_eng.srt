00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,928
[man 1] Happy birthday, baby.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,849
I believe I just got you and your year
off to a pretty great start.

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,726
And I thought I said no gifts.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,811
[both chuckling]

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,189
[man 1] Mm.

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,032
Hey, I prepped your birthday breakfast,
but my showing got moved up by an hour,

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,493
so you'll have to finish without me
for the second time today.

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,620
That's okay. I'm not very hungry.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,416
I'm having a hard time with this birthday.

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:46,296
Oh! Come on. I mean, 50? 50 is so young.

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,425
People only use "50" and "so young"
in the same sentence at a funeral.

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,510
Sorry. I have no time to indulge

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,473
a hot, virile, super successful dude
in a bonkers pity party.

14
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,016
[laughs]

15
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,478
-You really are so handsome.
-And you're a really cute liar.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,812
[chuckles]

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,566
Ah. Ah! I gotta bounce.
Okay, the reservation is at 7:30.

18
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,110
My last showing is at 6:00,
so I'll meet you at the restaurant.

19
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,529
-Okay.
-I'll text you the address.

20
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,990
Oh, I'm glad
it's just the two of us tonight.

21
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,825
A nice, cozy little celebration

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,286
of the milestone
that dare not speak its name.

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,455
Mm.

24
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,873
I love you, old-timer.

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,877
[door opens]

26
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,839
Yes, Eric will be there
at 7:30 on the dot.

27
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,093
Everyone knows they have to be there
by 7:15 or wait until 8:00.

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,929
Oh, and a reminder
about the lighting. Dim, dim, dim.

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,014
This is a 50th birthday.

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,140
Thanks.

31
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,061
Oh, hey. Quick, before we meet
the clients, with or without the scarf?

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,395
So without.

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,731
Even with this neck?
It's not too gobble gobble?

34
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,525
-[chuckles] Are you crazy?
-Oh!

35
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,028
And in other bad news,
Tyler Hawkins got the Beresford listing.

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,241
Are you kidding? They went with
that smug, entitled millennial over us?

37
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,327
That is just the cherry on
the shit parfait that is my life lately.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,788
-I went out with that guy I met on Hinge.
-Yeah.

39
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,541
Suffice it to say,
they should rename that app "Unhinged."

40
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,878
The psycho bastard told me
I would be so hot if I lost ten pounds,

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,588
but I could sit on his face anyway.

42
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,715
-So chivalry's not dead.
-Funny.

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,136
How's the, uh, party prep?
Colin remotely suspicious?

44
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,055
Nope. He thinks
we're going to dinner, just the two of us.

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
He is going to be blown away.

46
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,602
We've recreated the whole Limelight
from when we first met.

47
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,146
I walked into this club.

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,231
I saw Colin, and I thought--

49
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,274
"He's the one."

50
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,735
No, I thought, "How can I find a way
to rub up on his ass

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,571
-and look like I'm just dancing?"
-[laughs]

52
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,199
I can't believe it's been 17 years.

53
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,785
Ah, and you're still not married? Smart.

54
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,289
It's my secret.
He's my BFF. My boyfriend forever.

55
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,582
B-A-R-F.

56
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,333
-Wow.
-[laughing] Seriously.

57
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,421
A handsome, stand-up guy,
who's also a hedge fund manager.

58
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,840
Who do I have to blow
to get me one of those?

59
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,883
Him, actually.

-[sighs]
-Oh, here they come.

61
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,889
Hey, you two! We are so excited about 12G.

-Excuse me.
-Uh… [chuckles]

64
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,227
Hey, Carmen, what's up?

65
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,106
Why don't you guys go up?
I'll be there in a sec.

66
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,526
Wait, Car, are you sure?
What did they take?

67
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,404

[laughs] They're in there creaming
over the rainforest shower.

69
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,867
We got robbed.

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,910
-What?
-Yeah.

71
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,746
The housekeeper said
they took clothes and wine.

72
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,747
And what else?

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,542
A Sonos speaker and Hermès towels
that are too nice to actually use.

74
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,086
Sounds like somebody's havin'
a gay yard sale.

75

-So! Are we ready to change zip codes?

Is everyone in position?

-Great. That's very exciting.

-Oh my God, I can't wait! [squeals]
-Oh!

Please, no squealing, Eric.
You're the reason blue states turn red.

Real-- Oh. Here he is. Gotta go. Bye.

Hey, birthday boy.

84
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,914
Gosh, the tension in your shoulders
is off the charts. What's goin' on?

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,459
Where's this restaurant?
I don't see any signs.

86
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,004
It's right up here, and there are
no signs. It's very exclusive.

87
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,298
There might even be a password. Who knows?

I left three messages for you. Never heard
back. Did you check out the apartment?

We weren't robbed.

Carmen said all that stuff went missing.

-Suzanne thinks it may be an inside job--
-Michael. Michael, we weren't robbed.

and I moved out.

Here, baby. Congrats. It is fabulous.

-Hi.
-Happy birthday.

No, no. That's Colin, sweetie.
Remember I told you.

100
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,295
This is Michael, my best friend.
We went to high school together.

101

-Hi.
-It's his partner's…

It was a pretty quick tutorial.

104
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,345
How adorable is he?
He couldn't name three Cher songs.

105
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,763
I mean, isn't she, like, 80?

106
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,727
-Yeah, but she's got your abs, so respect.
-Hey, Billy, I'm gonna go find--

107
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,897
Hello, Michael. Billy.
And I assume Billy's new child bride.

108
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,692
Wyatt, this is Stanley.
He's a very successful art dealer

109
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,402
and much less successful homo.

110

-Um, we don't really use that word.
-I really need to find--

-Go, go, go. Do your host thing.
-Okay.

112
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
And relax, sweetie.

113
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,702
You look more shocked than Colin.

114
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,041
-Yay, you pulled it off.
-Hey!

115
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,586
-I assume he never saw it coming.
-He never suspected a thing.

116
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,670
-Hey, Kai.
-Hey.

117
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,214
I'm guessing not a ton
of straight women here under 30?

118
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,758
Kai, you're with your mother tonight.

119
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,135
Can we please give the pussy patrol
the evening off?

120
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,720
-Such a great party!
-[laughter]

121
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,097
We danced, we did poppers,
we're young again.

122
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,433
-Look at you.
-Hi, Suzanne!

123
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,686
-Who's your hot date?
-Uh, my son, you perv. [laughs]

124
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,606
-Kai, meet Jonathan and Jonathan.
-The Jonathans!

125
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,816
-That's funny.
-You guys ready for the big snip?

126
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,235
Oh, that's right.
Um, they have a baby boy.

127
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,781
The bris is in a couple of days,
and Michael and Colin are the godfathers.

128
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,824
Aww! Congratulations!

129
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,910
Sorry. I just need to talk to…

130
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,874
Oh, honey! We're having the best time.

131
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,293
-Oh, thanks, Mom.
-Aww! Oh!

132
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,129
You know, I have to admit,
when you first moved in with Colin,

133
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,298
it was kind of a curveball for me.

134
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,011
But over the years, seeing how much
you two love each other, well…

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,554
Thanks, Dad.

136
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,476
FYI, a curveball is a baseball pitch that
doesn't come at you the way you expect.

137
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,353

In honor of Colin's big night,

Michael asked if Marc and I could
come up with some kind of musical tribute.

140
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,694
Apparently, Michael thinks
because we won a couple of Tonys,

141
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,738
we can whip up a new tune in no time.

142
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,824

00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,542
-So whatever it is, work it out.
-Yeah.

310
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,462
Colin's a wonderful guy,
and I believe in the two of you.

311
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,088
-Hear hear.
-[sighs]

312
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,548
Thanks, guys.

313
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,477
-Any word from Colin?
-I'm sorry. He's a no-show.

314
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,815
Don't worry about it.
I am sitting you with Claire Lewis.

315
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,028
She and her husband are major league
art collectors. They're getting a divorce.

316
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,698
They're selling everything,
including… the apartment.

317
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
You're welcome.

318
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,952
Ooh. Claire!

319
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,579
-Hi.
-Hello.

320
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,747
[both] Mwah!

321
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,874
Claire, this is my dear friend

322
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,543
-and fabulous real estate agent…
-Oh!

323
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,503
…Michael Lawson.

324
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,423
Michael, Claire Lewis,
collector extraordinaire. Enjoy.

325
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,758
Interesting.

326
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,637
This is my first time in years
at the singles table.

327
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,097
[coughs] Oh! Uh…

328
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,181
I'm not single.

329
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,017
Oh.

330
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,354
I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood.
I was sure Stanley--

331
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,523
No, my partner just couldn't make it.
That's all.

332
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,025
I'm just single for the night.

333
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,159
Oh, and my soon-to-be ex-husband
is in a hurry to sell the apartment.

334
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,746
He says it's a white elephant. He doesn't
want the headache in a dicey market.

335
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,958
No, no, no. No, no. You cannot let him
do that. I know that building.

336
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,044
Anything with a terrace
is extremely desirable.

337
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,548
Well, I guess that makes me
extremely desirable adjacent.

338
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,549
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

339
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,677
Which, trust me, is the best thing
I've heard in a long time.

340
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,929
Oh, come on. You're fabulous.

341
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,937
Well, we haven't picked a broker yet,
so you're welcome to come and take a look.

342
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,356
How about tomorrow?

343
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,819
Sure. Be there at 11 o'clock.

344
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,739
But FYI, you've got competition.

345
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,741
I love a challenge.

346
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,577
Well.

347
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,412
Cheers.

348
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,297
Hey, Suzanne, I'm close. Are you here?

349
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
What? How far?

350
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,179
Well, hurry up.

351
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,764
[sighs]

352
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,642
Come on, you know
how much this listing means.

353
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,352
Michael Lawson to see Claire Lewis.

354
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,105
I don't wanna fuck it up
because one of us didn't prepare

355
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,692
for the slim possibility
of New York City traffic!

356
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,902
[clears throat]

357
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,446
-Is everything all right, sir?
-Yeah. I'm sorry.

358
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,824
-It's just been a rough couple of--
-Elevator to the penthouse.

359
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,659
Okay. Thanks, thanks.

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,244
[bell dings]

361
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,373
Hello, Michael. What was all that shouting
on the phone downstairs?

362
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,752
-What? How did--
-We have very proper doormen.

363
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,089
A raised voice, the use of profanity.
It sets off alarm bells.

364
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,927
After all,
one's ears are not garbage cans.

365
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,639
Just FYI, if there's a next time.
Please do come in.

366
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,775
Oh my God.

367
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,735
This is…

368
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,156
I feel like
I'm in one of those 1930s movies

369
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,492
where the Depression is happening outside,

370
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,161
but up here, it's just Fred Astaire,

371
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,247
and cocktails, and soirées.

372
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,166
Well, I'm afraid there's been
a good amount of depression happening

373
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,918
up here as well. [chuckles]

374
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,088
That tends to be your emotional state
when your husband of 28 years,

375
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,258
with whom you've raised two children
in this apartment,

376
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,928
comes home one day and tells you
you're not fun anymore and moves out.

377
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,640
-So it was just like that? No warning?
-None!

378
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,268
Goes off to work in the morning.
"What do you want for dinner?"

379
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,813
Came back, ruined my life, and then took
a few things to his new apartment.

380
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,024
So he'd already rented an apartment?

381
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,569
I'm not fun?

382
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,239
He misses his poo window in the morning,
his whole day is shot.

383
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,200
You live with a person for decades,
you think you know them,

384
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,120
and then one day,
you find out this can happen.

385
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:29,418
Was he, you know, in hindsight,
showing signs of unhappiness

386
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,795
that now you go,
"That should have tipped me off?"

387
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,840
No, nothing! Completely normal.

388
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,885
And then all of a sudden,
the fat fuck says, "I need some space."

389
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,596
I didn't understand
what he was talking about.

390
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,890
There's 5,000 square feet
in this apartment

391
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,474
and a home in Amagansett.

392
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,685
How much more space do you need?

393
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,313
And then he has the nerve to tell me

394
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,565
I'm not being supportive enough
about this.

395
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,778
So he was asking you to be more positive
about his need for space?

396
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,238
Can you even imagine?

397
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,701
He's leaving me, and I'm supposed to be
all sympathetic and encouraging about it?

398
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,661
He can go suck a dick. No offense.

399
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,664
[snorts] Please.
But back to the space thing.

400
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,834
Was he saying
that you guys could maybe work it out

401
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,378
if you understood his need for space?

402
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

403
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,467
Start all over again at my age?

404
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,180
What if I never have sex again?
What if I end up paying for companionship?

405
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,515
Oh, I don't think…

406
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,851
Uh, you're a very attractive--

407
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,771
Don't kid yourself!
I know women like that. Men too.

408
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,983
Everybody wants young, young, young!
No one is looking for someone my age.

409
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,361
I'm going to die alone.

410
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,863
How did this fucking happen to me?

411
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,622
How in the fuck did you get up here?
You are supposed to be announced.

412
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,961
Thank you for coming.

413
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,255
We'll be in touch.

414
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:06,014
Oh, and, Michael, don't forget
our little talk about lobby etiquette.

415
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,853
[sighs]

416
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,397
What is lobby etiquette?

417
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,024
It's about yelling and cursing
in the lobby.

418
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,485
Apparently, all bets are off
once you get upstairs.

419
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,571
Well, she did seem to respond to us,

420
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,283
despite whatever the hell was goin' on
before I got here.

421
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,536
She started talking about her husband
leaving her, and it spooked me.

422
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,663
Our situations are not dissimilar.

423
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,165
[bell dings]

424
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,334
Ah! Tyler Hawkins.

425
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,170
Oh my God, déjà vu!

426
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,881
The last time I ran into you guys
was at the Beresford.

427
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,134
Sorry. Oh…

428
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,302
[chuckles]

429
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,678
Mm.

430
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,764
-I assume you're here to see Claire Lewis.
-Oh! Love Claire.

431
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,310
Friends with my parents.
So sad about her and Henry.

432
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,561
Mm. [chuckles]

433
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,982
By the way, there's a listing coming up
at 1041 Fifth. Jackie O's building.

434
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,610
I went to Collegiate
with her grandson John. Dreamy.

435
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:05,615
So I know the tenants. Just didn't want
you guys to get your hopes up. [chuckles]

436
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,163
-Shit.
-It's not over.

437
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,372
We still have a…

438
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,874
Shit!

439
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,667
[groans]

440
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,675
Before we dig in,

441
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,177
um…

442
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,806
I would just like to say thank you
for giving us the opportunity

443
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,352
to take this journey of communication
while living apart

444
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,604
and for making the appointment
with Dr. Sweeny.

445
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,439
You're welcome.

446
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,276
And to demonstrate
my support for your process,

447
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,196
I bought you a housewarming present

448
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,282
for your new apartment
in the undisclosed location.

449
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,451
Thank you. That wasn't necessary.

450
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,995
[chuckles]

451
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,791
Bet it's in Williamsburg or DUMBO.
He's always romanticized Brooklyn.

452
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,086
Am I warm?

453
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,256
Well, it sounds like Michael
has a lot of questions, Colin.

454
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,761
As I understand it, you haven't
told Michael where you're living?

455
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,847
He never told me he was leaving.
I thought we'd been robbed.

456
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,184
If I had told you before,
you would've talked me out of it.

457
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,936
This was the only thing I could do

458
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,813
to give us a chance
of dealing with our issues.

459
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,815
Great. And I'm all for it.

460
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,775
You took a brave step.

461
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:26,071
Even though it might have been interpreted
as a passive-aggressive sucker punch.

462
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,573
Kind of like the surprise party

Well, gentlemen,
there is a lot to unpack here.

I am so glad that we're here

I wanna take this opportunity

I feel like we have this fantastic life.
We have so much to be grateful for.

And maybe a lot of it goes unexamined.

477

Do we need to explore some of that?
Absolutely.

But that is why we're here, right?
So let's do it. Let's focus.

I think that was a terrific first step.

496
