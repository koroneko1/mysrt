00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.680
Bad timing call, always.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.960
What is it?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I miss you.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.760
What do you mean?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.120
We just hung up seconds ago.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.640
Are you going to stay with me 24/7?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
I'll go back to shoot TikTok.k to shoot TikTok.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.280
Wait.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.200
That's it. No more shooting.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.720
What's up?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
Have you seen this post? I've just tagged you.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.040
What is it?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
Don't want to be just friend. Let me be your boyfriend.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.480
He isn't talking about me.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
But aren't you two seeing each other?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.000
I am not.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.800
Well... we are talking, 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.680
as a friend.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.680
Friend?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.120
Friend doesn't do these things.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.480
Don't you think I didn't notice.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.080
I've known you since little.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.320
You can't fool me. I know.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
He is flirting with me.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.080
But...

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.680
But I don't have any feeling for him.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.280
Are you sure?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.080
Why are you blushing?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.240
Don't lie to me.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.320
Damm,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.280
you're so annoying.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840
I'll tell him to delete that status

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.720
See you later.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.400
Hello.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.480
Are you cooking?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.280
Yes.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.800
do you want to join me?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.280
First things fist,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.120
delete the post right now.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.640
Which post?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.640
That post about don't want to be just friend.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.120
Everyone misunderstands and thinks that it is about me.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.920
I think they are right.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.880
Hey.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.240
I'm just kidding.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.080
Don't you like it? There're so many likes and shares,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.120
you'll be famous.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680
It's true...

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.920
but it is too exposed,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.480
and my friends are teasing me.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520
Too exposed, isn't it.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
I'll find a less expose way.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.920
Whatever. Just please delete that post.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.840
Sure but with one condition,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.000
we need to have a video call tonight.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.520
Isn't that what we always do.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.120
I'm afraid you'll bail on me.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.840
Promise?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.960
Promise.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840
I ilke you
share status

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.000
What the heck is this?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.480
You said to be less exposed.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.040
No one will see this, unless they are nosy.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.760
Can I ask you something?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.480
What is it, Tono?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.600
Don't you have friends or anyone else to talk to?

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.760
Why are you talking to me everyday?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.960
I don't... 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.920
and I want to talk to you only.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.800
But, so many people want to know in social medias.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.240
It's only online, not real life.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.120
So... you've never had a boyfriend?e never had a boyfriend?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.360
I don't know.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.960
Is this Pattaya Beach?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.280
This lighting and this atmospher.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.240
feel like a heartbroken person.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.640
Yes.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.360
Yes means...

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.320
My boyfriend dumped me there.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.360
Seriously? I'm so good at guessing.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.120
Should I buy a lottery?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.520
They said often stalking at someone means...

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.880
you're starting to have interest in that person.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.480
I'm not stalking, I'm showing it to you.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.480
Come to think about it, I'll look at your account.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.440
Wow, you must have lots of girls.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.440
None. I have only friends.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.520
Tono...

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080
Hmm...

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.840
Do you have someone you like?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.760
Nope.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.080
Can I take a shot with you? 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.280
What?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.640
You're already blessed I talk to you.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.200
I've never talked to anyone like this.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.560
I won't take a shot with you then.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760
So... what about this?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.480
I love you.
Share status

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.840
May I feel this way with you?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.480
It's all I ask for now.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.480
We don't have to be anything.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.640
You've already posted a status like that.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.840
Do you really need to ask?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.360
Then come closer to the screen.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.040
Why?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.480
Quickly.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.800
What did you just do?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.760
Pecked your cheek as a deposit.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.920
You're crazy!

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.640
Hello everyone.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.880
9 PM today,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.920
we're going to climb up conqueror 50 stars ranking.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.960
Right now, let's wait for our friend.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.840
Wait a sec,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.120
why isn't he waiting for me.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.880
I thought we are starting at 9 PM.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.760
Guys, I'll be back.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.960
Jade, why weren't you waiting for me?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.720
You said we are starting at 9 PM.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.640
Well, my friend happned to join in.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.440
When will you finish?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.000
So I can join.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.520
I don't think you can.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.920
What do you mean?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.240
Got and Snack said that

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.240
they are doing serious matches today.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.400
So what?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.640
The thing is... maybe they think you're not being serious?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.760
Like, you're just playing as a content.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.520
What's wrong with them?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.040
I'm not playing just to do a content.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.400
But I think you do.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.280
Fine. You guys just play.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.600
I can play alone.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.200
You're not mad at me, right?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.560
No.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.400
Just go.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.040
Ok. Bye.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.200
I've finised a book,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.920
and you're still crying?

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.600
Is it that bad?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.160
It hurts.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.960
Like I'm heartbroken.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.680
Like having a knife,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.880
cut through my heart from behind.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.680
That's more dramtic than an melodrama.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.600
Don't worry.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.000
Friend is still friend.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.120
Don't think about it too much.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.600
It's not something a friend does.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.400
Do you want me to play with you?

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.320
No.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
You'll come up with stupid rules if i loose.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600
Let's do a TikTok?

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.880
What are we doing?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.080
How about this one?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.640
It's too hard.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.320
It is not hard

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.640
Try it first.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.160
I see you have a ring light, 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.480
let's put it to use.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.040
Do not look, I've already taken my shirt off.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.680
Why are you still shy?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.600
I've seen everything,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.880
except... in the bathroom.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.600
You're sick. I'm gonna call the authority to arrest you.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.000
Why are you smiling.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.640
I'm not smiling to be flirty,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.200
I just think you're cute.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.840
Enough.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.000
I'm finishing the shoot.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.400
Tono, what's wrong?
