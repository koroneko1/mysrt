00:29.480 --> 00:32.120
Mmm. Everything
smells delicious, Mrs Césaire.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.600
Marinette! Call me Marlena!

00:34.600 --> 00:37.800
You'll let me know
how you like my colombo, OK?

00:38.120 --> 00:40.800
(Gasps) Hide, Trixx. Alya,
nobody can know about Trixx.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.840
He's a secret!

00:42.080 --> 00:43.480
Really?
Exactly why is he

00:43.480 --> 00:45.720
such a secret, Ladybug?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.920
Ladybug?
Why are you calling me Ladybug?

00:48.920 --> 00:50.560
I'm not Ladybug, I'm Marinette,

00:50.560 --> 00:52.800
just a normal girl
with a normal life!

00:52.800 --> 00:55.800
Ha! Marinette, everyone knows
that you're Ladybug!

00:55.800 --> 00:58.040
To think you've lectured
us about, "Blah-blah,

00:58.040 --> 01:00.120
you must keep
your identity a secret,

01:00.120 --> 01:01.840
or I can't give you
a Miraculous!"

01:01.840 --> 01:03.480
I'd have made
a much better Ladybug.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.200
Talk about a ridiculous
Guardian!

01:05.200 --> 01:06.600
Utterly ridiculous!

01:06.600 --> 01:08.280
What is she doing
here at your house?

01:08.280 --> 01:10.720
- (Knock on door)
- Thanks for showing up,

01:10.720 --> 01:11.520
Shadow Moth!

01:13.680 --> 01:15.120
I'm the one grateful to you

01:15.120 --> 01:17.400
for revealing
Ladybug's identity.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.440
Thanks to you,
the Miracle Box is finally mine.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.400
Alya? This is impossible!
Tikki, spots on!

01:25.200 --> 01:27.440
- Tikki?
- Why did you trust Alya?

01:27.440 --> 01:28.920
Look on the bright side.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.480
Now we're done with secrets,

01:30.480 --> 01:32.080
we can tie the knot!

01:32.080 --> 01:35.360
This is... a nightmare!

01:35.360 --> 01:37.320
If you want this to stop,
all you have to do

01:37.320 --> 01:39.040
is give me your Miraculous!

01:42.200 --> 01:45.080
This is what you get
for leaving me with Alya.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.840
Aaah! Tikki!

01:50.840 --> 01:53.840
I should have never left
the Fox Miraculous with Alya!

01:54.720 --> 01:56.520
What are you talking about,
Marinette?

01:56.520 --> 01:58.560
I had a nightmare!
It was horrible!

01:58.560 --> 02:01.800
Alya spoke out and Shadow Moth
got hold of the Miracle Box!

02:02.800 --> 02:05.800
- Phew!
- It was just a bad dream.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.880
That would never really happen.
Alya is a loyal friend.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.000
Alya is, but her kwami, Trixx,
can't help making mischief

02:12.000 --> 02:14.640
- whenever he can roam!
- The Loch Ness Monster illusion

02:14.640 --> 02:18.680
- was kind of fun, wasn't it?
- It was a prophetic nightmare!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.520
I can't leave
the Miraculous with Alya!

02:20.520 --> 02:21.800
Marinette! Wait!

02:22.800 --> 02:25.080
Marinette, it's lunchtime
and you're still --

02:25.320 --> 02:29.400
In my pajamas? I know, I...
I just need to drop by Alya's.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.440
There's this thing I need back!

02:33.040 --> 02:35.920
Where did that thing go?
Come on! Nora?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.960
If I find him, he'd better be
ready for a roundhouse kick!

02:38.960 --> 02:41.360
First one who finds the squishy
gets to keep it!

02:41.360 --> 02:43.480
- Yeah!
- I can't believe this.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.600
It's like the little monster can
go through walls or something.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.040
Everyone knows?
You... you told them?

02:50.040 --> 02:52.280
Well, I had to,
since I lost him!

02:52.280 --> 02:55.760
Imagine if someone came across
him, or worse, if he escaped?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.280
- You lost him?
- Yeah, so?

02:58.280 --> 03:00.080
Everybody
loses things sometimes.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.920
Help me look
instead of lecturing me!

03:01.920 --> 03:07.040
Stay for lunch. Let me know
how you like my colombo, OK?

03:09.760 --> 03:13.840
Aaah! A tarantula!

03:14.840 --> 03:18.720
(Laughs)
Everyone can stop looking!

03:18.720 --> 03:21.960
- Marinette found Hannibal!
- Phew!

03:21.960 --> 03:23.600
He got his legs working again!

03:23.880 --> 03:26.000
Tomorrow,
it's back to the zoo, buddy!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.920
Is it OK to come out now?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.640
Ha, ha! You flyweight!

03:29.640 --> 03:32.880
Cappie was scared of the spider,
just like you, Baguette!

03:34.040 --> 03:36.880
Nah, I wasn't scared. I went
into the bathroom to make sure

03:36.880 --> 03:39.320
Hannibal
hadn't fallen into the toilet.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.080
Why are you here
in your pajamas?

03:42.360 --> 03:46.280
Cute look, Marinette. So, are
you here for anything specific?

03:46.280 --> 03:49.480
Oh! Ha, ha! No,
it's cool, nothing specific!

03:49.480 --> 03:51.880
Especially now I've seen
you've found the tarantula.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.600
I'm so relieved it wasn't
something else that you'd lost.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.280
Ah! I know what "thing"
you're talking about!

03:58.280 --> 04:01.880
FYI, when someone trusts me
with a thing, I don't lose it.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.000
(Laughing) Look who's talking!

04:04.280 --> 04:06.560
You're the one
who just lost Hannibal!

04:06.640 --> 04:08.320
Can we chat for a sec?

04:08.880 --> 04:12.080
Sorry, Nino. This is
between Marinette and me.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.440
Aaah!

04:17.440 --> 04:18.640
(Embarrassed laugh)

04:18.760 --> 04:21.640
I swear, it was so lifelike!

04:21.640 --> 04:23.320
It was just a nightmare.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.200
Everyone knew that I was...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
you know who... you know?

04:27.120 --> 04:28.600
- (Phone rings)
- Aaah!

04:28.600 --> 04:30.520
Chill out. Everything's cool.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.200
OK! We know Shadow Moth has
identified some of the holders.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.960
He knows you've been Rena Rouge.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.560
What if he found out
I left the Miraculous with you?

04:39.560 --> 04:42.280
- He could steal it from you!
- Shadow Moth or anybody else

04:42.280 --> 04:44.160
- will never know!
- (Phone rings)

04:44.160 --> 04:47.480
- Not even Cat Noir can.
- No one's gonna find this.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.960
And thanks to this very hip bag
my BFF gave me,

04:50.960 --> 04:53.240
Trixx is always with me,
outta sight!

04:53.440 --> 04:56.400
Trixx, promise you're not gonna
make any mischief,

04:56.400 --> 04:58.600
like popping up at the table
during lunch?

04:58.600 --> 05:01.240
As silent as fennecs
and wily as foxes.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.600
I told you
everything is all right.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.680
I was silly to worry.
You're right.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.800
Trust me, and trust yourself.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.280
You were right
to give me a Mirac --

05:10.000 --> 05:13.480
Seriously? Hello?
Why isn't anybody getting that?

05:13.880 --> 05:15.520
(Phone continues to ring)

05:18.360 --> 05:21.480
Hey, where'd you guys all go?
Is this some kind of joke?

05:21.720 --> 05:25.040
- Hello?
-<i> Rena Rouge, I am Shadow Moth.</i>

05:25.040 --> 05:27.280
- Aaah!
- Marinette!

05:30.720 --> 05:33.480
- Alya!
- Marinette! No!

05:33.720 --> 05:35.120
Alya, be careful!

05:36.520 --> 05:39.680
Nino! Seriously, don't tell me
you got akumatized into Bubbler

05:39.680 --> 05:42.560
<i>again </i>just 'cause
I didn't let you in my room!

05:42.560 --> 05:46.280
I'm not Nino.
I am... the Sentibubbler!

05:46.480 --> 05:49.240
Nino is with your family,
all prisoners!

05:50.480 --> 05:53.480
ALL: Help! Help!

05:56.360 --> 05:59.120
Hey, you, keep those hairy legs
away from me, OK?

05:59.120 --> 06:02.400
Don't panic, the beetle
and Mr Whiskers will save us!

06:02.400 --> 06:03.680
(Phone rings)

06:08.240 --> 06:11.280
You've probably realized by now
that you'll have to obey me

06:11.280 --> 06:13.440
if you want to see
your loved ones again.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.240
What do you want, Shadow Moth?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.960
<i>I want you to betray Ladybug!</i>

06:19.240 --> 06:20.880
This is worse than a nightmare!

06:20.880 --> 06:23.080
I can't transform
or everyone will see me!

06:23.280 --> 06:24.920
Alya will figure something out.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.760
That's why
you left her a Miraculous.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.760
I must tell her the villain
is probably a Sentimonster.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.920
Rena Rouge has to warn Cat Noir
that he must not cataclysm him,

06:32.920 --> 06:36.040
or it will get out of control
and our bubbles could pop out!

06:36.200 --> 06:37.520
(Buzzing)

06:40.160 --> 06:41.880
- No!
<i>- The only people you will</i>

06:41.880 --> 06:44.240
<i>be able to communicate</i>
<i>with now, Alya,</i>

06:44.240 --> 06:46.800
<i>are me and my Sentimonster.</i>

06:49.040 --> 06:50.840
Why isn't she answering?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.760
(Buzzing)

06:52.760 --> 06:55.360
- Oh, no.
- Trust Alya, Marinette.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.840
- She's never let you down.
- You're right.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.160
Besides, I'm sure Cat Noir
will show up soon.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.720
<i>These bubbles have been</i>
<i>floating for five minutes</i>

07:02.720 --> 07:05.200
<i>and still no superhero</i>
<i>in sight.</i>

07:05.200 --> 07:07.040
This cheese
isn't runny enough yet!

07:07.040 --> 07:08.920
<i>Yes, Nadja.</i>
<i>And no villain either!</i>

07:08.920 --> 07:10.880
<i>These bubbles</i>
<i>are identical</i>

07:10.880 --> 07:12.640
<i>to the ones created</i>
<i>by The Bubbler,</i>

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
<i>yet in one of them</i>
<i>is Nino Lahiffe,</i>

07:14.560 --> 07:15.920
<i>the student</i>
<i>who was originally</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:17.480
<i>akumatized</i>
<i>as the Bubbler!</i>

07:17.480 --> 07:19.480
<i>Keep your distance.</i>
<i>Don't take risks</i>

07:19.480 --> 07:20.920
<i>till Ladybug</i>
<i>and Cat Noir arrive.</i>

07:20.920 --> 07:23.880
- Nino, Marinette. Plagg!
- Well, good.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.880
By the time we're back, maybe
this cheese will be edible!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.440
Plagg, claws out!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.080
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

07:47.080 --> 07:48.920
<i>Ladybug will be</i>
<i>here any minute.</i>

07:48.920 --> 07:50.640
<i>And since</i>
<i>it's your family and friends,</i>

07:50.640 --> 07:52.200
<i>Ladybug</i>
<i>will ask you to help her</i>

07:52.200 --> 07:54.480
<i>and hand you</i>
<i>the Fox Miraculous.</i>

07:54.480 --> 07:57.080
<i>Once she's given it to you,</i>
<i>the Sentibubbler,</i>

07:57.080 --> 07:59.480
<i>who'll be hiding nearby,</i>
<i>will capture Ladybug.</i>

07:59.720 --> 08:01.360
Cat Noir will come to save her!

08:01.600 --> 08:04.440
<i>No, he won't even know</i>
<i>she's been captured.</i>

08:04.440 --> 08:07.720
<i>Because you'll</i>
<i>transform into Rena Rouge</i>

08:07.720 --> 08:09.960
<i>and create an illusion</i>
<i>of Ladybug and Rena Rouge</i>

08:09.960 --> 08:12.120
<i>to distract Cat Noir.</i>

08:13.240 --> 08:15.320
<i>Thinking he's joined</i>
<i>his fellow heroes,</i>

08:15.320 --> 08:17.800
<i>he won't notice</i>
<i>the Sentibubbler.</i>

08:17.800 --> 08:19.640
<i>And you'll give me</i>
<i>your Miraculous.</i>

08:19.640 --> 08:21.280
<i>It is only then,</i>

08:21.280 --> 08:23.480
<i>when the three Miraculous</i>
<i>are in my possession,</i>

08:23.720 --> 08:26.320
<i>that the Sentibubbler</i>
<i>will release your loved ones.</i>

08:26.320 --> 08:29.160
<i>If you try anything</i>
<i>to warn Ladybug or Cat Noir,</i>

08:29.160 --> 08:32.120
<i>I'll order the Sentibubbler</i>
<i>to send them into space,</i>

08:32.120 --> 08:35.440
<i>too far for any superhero</i>
<i>to ever save them.</i>

08:35.440 --> 08:37.840
If I were you,
I would do anything I could

08:38.080 --> 08:41.440
to ensure Ladybug
showed up very shortly.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
I've got to gain some time.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.200
Phew! Alya's still free.
She'll be able to save us.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.760
You see, you were right
to give her the Miraculous.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.080
Thanks, Tikki.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.800
Ladybug! Please come save us!

08:55.800 --> 08:57.000
What's she doing?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.280
Ladybug! Please come save us!

09:00.280 --> 09:02.640
Ugh! I'll have to transform
in front of everyone,

09:02.640 --> 09:05.080
and use the Rabbit Miraculous
to go back in time.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.200
No! Time travel
is never a good idea.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.120
But if I don't transform,
I won't have access to anything.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.000
Oh! Except mine!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.600
You could take it
to another holder!

09:14.840 --> 09:17.280
The earrings can't go
through the bubble, Marinette!

09:17.560 --> 09:20.040
Then Cat Noir is our last hope.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.560
No villain in sight.
Watch out, Milady!

09:23.560 --> 09:26.200
I think someone's trying to
play Cat and Ladybug with us!

09:26.200 --> 09:27.720
I'm waiting for you!

09:27.720 --> 09:30.400
Yoohoo! Ladybug!

09:30.400 --> 09:32.840
Get ready, Trixx.
We have to free Marinette,

09:32.840 --> 09:34.520
or we're all serious goners!

09:38.800 --> 09:41.280
Hey,
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.680
- Not now.
- Not now.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.240
Seriously, it cannot wait.
Must be the stress.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.600
Plus it sure will look weird
if Ladybug finds me like this!

09:49.760 --> 09:51.920
Just remember
that if you try anything...

09:51.920 --> 09:54.640
I'll send those bubbles
right into space!

09:54.640 --> 09:57.160
I can't try anything
without a Miraculous.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.920
I just need to go to the...
Aaah!

09:58.920 --> 10:00.280
Trixx, let's pounce!

10:00.520 --> 10:02.760
- Mirage!
- Sentibubbler,

10:02.760 --> 10:05.440
- what is she doing?
- I can't see.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.000
(Chuckles)

10:12.120 --> 10:14.040
You've got 30 seconds.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.480
One... two... three...

10:19.480 --> 10:20.440
Reality!

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
...five...

10:23.520 --> 10:24.920
Let's rest.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.560
Oh!

10:28.720 --> 10:30.400
- You got a plan?
- Uh-huh.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.280
Shadow Moth doesn't know
I have my Miraculous.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.800
I'll use it to make him believe
everything is going to plan.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.840
You'll create
an illusion of Ladybug?

10:38.840 --> 10:42.240
Yep, but I must ensure Cat Noir
doesn't mess up my plan.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.720
Trixx, let's pounce!

10:47.720 --> 10:50.360
Hmm? Rena? Are you with Ladybug?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.920
Yes. She asked me to call you
and say we've got a plan.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.080
- Perfect. What should I do?
- It's a two-person plan.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.640
What do you mean?
You mean "she and you"?

10:59.640 --> 11:01.800
- What about me?
- Well, that's just it.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.960
In this plan,
you have to stay where you are

11:03.960 --> 11:06.480
- and wait for instructions!
- Hmm.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.320
I need to hear it from her.
Put her on the phone, please?

11:09.320 --> 11:12.480
Well, I... I can't.
She's super busy right now

11:12.480 --> 11:14.560
and... if you happen
to see the Bubbler,

11:14.560 --> 11:16.720
whatever you do,
don't cataclysm him.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.520
- It's a Sentimonster!
- What?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.800
I gotta go! I mean,
"we" will keep you posted!

11:21.800 --> 11:22.680
Mirage!

11:31.400 --> 11:34.040
"A two-person plan"? There's
only one "two-person plan"

11:34.040 --> 11:35.520
and that's Ladybug and me!

11:41.320 --> 11:44.200
The Miraculous Ladybug
will fix everything as usual!

11:44.200 --> 11:45.160
Hmm?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.920
Where's Rena Rouge?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.560
"Stay where I am." I can't
just sit here and do nothing!

11:59.680 --> 12:01.480
Rena Rouge has gone into action!

12:01.800 --> 12:03.560
I knew Alya could handle it!

12:03.560 --> 12:07.040
- Oh! Cat Noir! No!
- What's wrong?

12:07.240 --> 12:10.000
If Cat Noir comes into contact
with Rena Rouge's illusion,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.280
it'll disappear!

12:11.280 --> 12:12.840
I've got to warn Cat Noir,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.880
or Shadow Moth
will figure out Alya's plan!

12:15.880 --> 12:17.560
(Straining)

12:18.280 --> 12:21.760
There she is... Hurry up!
Ladybug's coming!

12:21.760 --> 12:23.720
Hurry up! Ladybug's coming!

12:23.720 --> 12:25.680
See? I didn't make trouble!

12:25.680 --> 12:29.080
Don't forget what'll happen
if you don't stick to the plan.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.920
I hear you loud and clear.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.800
Wait until Ladybug
has given the Miraculous

12:37.800 --> 12:40.200
to Rena Rouge
before you capture her.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.600
Cat Noir! Cat Noir!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.840
- Marinette Dupain-Cheng?
- You must stay where you are!

12:49.840 --> 12:51.960
Oh, come on!
What is with everyone

12:51.960 --> 12:53.720
telling me to stay where I am?

12:53.720 --> 12:56.200
Rena Rouge created an illusion
to fool the Bubbler

12:56.200 --> 12:58.440
who's a Sentimonster.
If you go there,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.040
you might
screw up the whole plan.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.960
And you know this... how?

13:02.240 --> 13:05.880
Uh... well, it's 'cause...
I've had a really good view

13:05.880 --> 13:07.720
since the beginning.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.880
You might even say
I have front-row seats here!

13:11.240 --> 13:12.880
(Sighs)

13:13.880 --> 13:16.960
What's going on? The Bubbler
captured my family, my friends.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.080
- What's going on?
- He captured my family,

13:19.080 --> 13:21.960
- my friends.
- Hmm. But not you?

13:21.960 --> 13:24.440
I don't know. He was
already gone when I got here.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.080
That's strange.
It'd have made more sense

13:27.080 --> 13:30.320
- to force you to betray me.
- I'd never betray you.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.240
Shadow Moth attacked them
because he found out

13:34.240 --> 13:35.560
you're a superhero.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.120
I won't be able to give you

13:37.120 --> 13:38.440
the Miraculous of the Fox again.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.040
- Huh?
- No. This isn't the plan!

13:42.040 --> 13:44.880
- Shall I capture Ladybug?
- Wait, just a moment...

13:44.880 --> 13:47.160
I was proud to fight
by your side, Ladybug.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.200
- Don't worry...
- I'll find another holder

13:49.440 --> 13:52.760
and give 'em a different,
but very powerful, Miraculous.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.880
- We'll save your loved ones.
- Thank you, Ladybug.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.960
I'm looking forward
to getting my hands

14:00.960 --> 14:04.360
on this new and "very powerful"
Miraculous as well.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.480
Let's follow her!

14:14.360 --> 14:18.840
If it touches the illusion,
it'll disappear. I'll stop him!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.000
Great idea!

14:21.120 --> 14:24.320
Don't worry, the real Ladybug
and I will save you!

14:25.400 --> 14:28.400
We already are, Kittycat!
We already are!

14:31.360 --> 14:33.600
So now you're
a superhero stalker, bubbler?

14:47.160 --> 14:50.000
No, that alley cat
is going to ruin my plan!

14:51.280 --> 14:53.680
Ladybug cannot escape me,
not today!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.960
- Shadow Moth?
- The real one?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.080
Reality!

15:12.600 --> 15:14.040
No!

15:14.240 --> 15:17.640
You can't hide for long,
Ladybug.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.040
Let's rest.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.560
All is not lost yet.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.840
Cat Noir, watch out!

15:47.040 --> 15:48.000
Sorry.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.520
You need more than this

15:49.520 --> 15:50.840
to capture this cat!

15:50.840 --> 15:52.000
Cataclysm!

15:55.440 --> 15:57.560
Woohoo!

16:02.000 --> 16:05.120
- (Embarrassed laugh)
- It's over for you, Cat Noir.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.040
Nothing is over. You haven't
defeated Ladybug yet.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.520
Or Rena Rouge!

16:10.560 --> 16:13.920
From this point on,
Rena Rouge can never be seen.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.680
Shadow Moth's must believe
no one's using the Miraculous.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.720
Now that's sly, very sly!

16:19.720 --> 16:21.680
Trixx, let's pounce.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.560
(Buzzing)

16:28.120 --> 16:29.720
Marinette, get ready. It's time

16:29.720 --> 16:31.520
for the real Ladybug to show up!

16:36.080 --> 16:37.040
Mirage!

16:39.040 --> 16:41.800
- What's happening?
- Alya has created the illusion

16:41.800 --> 16:44.080
of a bubble
containing an illusion of me!

16:44.080 --> 16:45.760
It completely overlaps us!

16:47.520 --> 16:49.760
Nobody can see us
from the outside, now!

16:49.760 --> 16:53.080
- It's brilliant!
- Tikki, spots on!

17:00.400 --> 17:02.800
Ladybug
will never fall into your trap!

17:02.800 --> 17:04.040
Shut him up.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.520
No one will silence me,
Shadow Moth.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.880
- (Muffled)
- Now I will have the pleasure

17:09.880 --> 17:11.360
of capturing Ladybug.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.440
Lucky charm!

17:26.360 --> 17:30.000
That cup's the object
that controls the Sentimonster.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.680
Tikki, Kaalki, unify!

17:41.760 --> 17:45.280
Show yourself, Ladybug!
It's over for you and Cat Noir!

17:45.280 --> 17:46.640
If you don't surrender,

17:46.840 --> 17:49.760
I'll send
all these prisoners into space!

17:49.760 --> 17:53.040
Three... two... one...

17:53.040 --> 17:54.400
Too late!

17:55.520 --> 17:56.960
Help! Ladybug!

17:57.560 --> 18:01.960
Hurry up, the bubbles are
rising. Tick tock, Ladybug...

18:03.600 --> 18:06.760
It's now or never for your
awesome two-person plan.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.720
I can't seize
everything at once.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.600
First, the object that controls
the Sentimonster. Voyage!

18:26.560 --> 18:28.640
- Ladybug!
- No.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.160
Pegabug!

18:33.720 --> 18:37.120
Sentibubbler!
Free the prisoners!

18:37.120 --> 18:38.640
At your command.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.000
Aaah!

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
You're forgetting something,
Pegabug.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.040
I created him!

18:46.040 --> 18:47.320
Sentibubbler,

18:47.320 --> 18:49.200
I release you from existence.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.880
No!

18:56.160 --> 18:58.920
Aaah!

18:58.920 --> 18:59.720
Reality.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.320
Aaah!

19:03.320 --> 19:04.320
No!

19:08.760 --> 19:10.720
Kaalki, dismount.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.560
Gotcha!

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440
Can you hold on
to this for me, please?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.040
Where did Shadow Moth go?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.280
I think he felt the wind
start to change.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.480
This could have been
the end of Shadow Moth.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.680
You know, I really thought
today was the end of Cat Noir.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.640
But you guys
really had it under control.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.600
BOTH: Pound it!

19:40.640 --> 19:42.560
I guess
you'll need a little something.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.760
I'll come back in a minute.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.080
- You rocked, Rena Rouge.
- You see?

19:51.080 --> 19:54.040
When someone trusts me with
a "thing", I don't lose it!

19:54.240 --> 19:57.240
I never should have
second-guessed you.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.840
Let's rest.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.200
Miraculous Ladybug!

20:22.040 --> 20:23.200
Spots off!

20:27.520 --> 20:29.720
I'm not really
afraid of spiders.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.760
You actually had Ladybug say
she'd never give you

20:33.760 --> 20:35.560
the Miraculous of the Fox again?

20:36.480 --> 20:39.120
So, he'll never try to steal it
from you again!

20:39.120 --> 20:40.920
Nightmare over!

20:40.920 --> 20:44.040
- Pretty sly, don't you think?
- Sly as a fox!

20:44.040 --> 20:45.680
You're a true superhero!

20:45.680 --> 20:47.880
You weren't so bad either,
Pegabug.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.880
BOTH: Pound it!

20:55.520 --> 20:57.600
Ladybug never makes a mistake!

21:00.960 --> 21:03.560
Don't give up.
Everyone makes mistakes

21:03.560 --> 21:05.760
and, one day,
she'll make one too.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.600
And when that day comes,
your wish will come true.
