1
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,783
How was your day today?

2
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,411
How was it?

3
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:34,213
Well, then, shall we talk?

4
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,385
Tell me a little about yourself.

5
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
Who you are, and so on.

6
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,406
Do you know who this is?

7
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,918
No?

8
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,587
It's your family.

9
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,924
Want to have a closer look?

10
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,138
Never mind.

11
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:35,024
Can you tell me about that day?

12
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,781
About what happened?

13
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,789
I'm sure you remember it quite well.

14
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,503
Don't worry.

15
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,006
From now on,

16
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,636
you can talk to me
about whatever you wish.

17
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,628
Aren't you coming?

18
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,287
Soo-yeon.

19
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,832
Soo-yeon!

20
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,596
It's so pretty.

21
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,255
Give me your hand.

22
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,469
And the other one.

23
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,853
What is it?

24
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,865
Soo-mi!

25
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,763
Welcome home!

26
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,849
It's been so long.

27
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,017
You've changed so much, Soo-yeon.

28
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,519
You've gotten prettier.

29
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,397
But I'm really disappointed in you.

30
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,443
I waited all day for you two,
cooking and cleaning the house.

31
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,236
Why didn't you say hi to me first?

32
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,780
What did you do? Did you play outside?

33
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,115
Were you at the wharf?

34
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,869
You should've changed first
before you went outside.

35
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,245
You guys are so…

36
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,375
Anyway, welcome back home.

37
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,644
Did I startle you?

38
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,065
I see you've gotten better.

39
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,235
I'm so glad you feel better now.

40
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,490
You take after your mom.

41
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,830
You're feeling a lot better too, right?

42
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,293
Right, I bet you're both tired.

43
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,379
Get some rest and come down for dinner.

44
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,966
I'm cooking a special feast for you.

45
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,513
But you have to give me some time, okay?
There's a lot of dishes to prepare.

46
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,626
We just got back.

47
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,338
Things don't look so good right now.

48
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,676
It wouldn't help much if you came.

49
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
Yeah, I know.

50
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,227
I have to go. Let's talk later.

51
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,065
You're doing okay, right?

52
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,235
Did I tell you?

53
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,280
Sun-kyu and his wife are coming over.

54
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,785
It'll be all right. I'll take care of it.

55
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,246
Okay, bye.

56
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,512
Listen,

57
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,682
I invited Sun-kyu and his wife
over for dinner this weekend.

58
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,977
Really?

59
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,980
I thought it'd be nice for them
to see the girls after so long.

60
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,690
And to catch up on things.

61
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,115
That was delicious.

62
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,868
Sorry, I have things to tend to.

63
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,622
You must be tired.
You can clean up tomorrow.

64
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,724
Did you set out
your father's undergarments?

65
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,395
Thank you, but that's my responsibility.

66
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,440
And cleaning my room is my job.
So why'd you touch my stuff?

67
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,484
I didn't. It was like that before.

68
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,489
So all those clothes
were hanging there already?

69
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,930
I don't want to have dinner with him.

70
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,390
What?

71
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,977
I said I don't want to have dinner
with that guy.

72
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,063
He's not just some guy, he's your uncle.

73
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,736
Let's not argue today. You just got here.

74
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,585
-And you?
-What?

75
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,881
Aren't you going to follow your sister?

76
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,083
What did that woman say to you?

77
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,797
If she ever gets on your case,
then tell me.

78
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,217
And don't ignore it like before. Okay?

79
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,894
Good night.

80
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,312
What's wrong?

81
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,148
Bad dream?

82
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,444
Was it the closet?

83
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,990
Then what is it?

84
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,079
I keep hearing strange noises.

85
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,004
It's because you've been away so long.

86
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,842
It's okay. Get some sleep.

87
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,722
Somebody came into my room.

88
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,938
He's asleep.

89
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,028
-I know.
-Why were you trying to wake him?

90
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,948
Why would I?

91
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,786
You were trying to wake him just now.

92
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,122
Did you have something to tell him?

93
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,874
It's none of your business.

94
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,922
I just meant that, since he's fast asleep,
don't wake him up. Understood?

95
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,008
I just came down for some water.

96
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,179
Just be quiet. Don't wake him up.

97
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,058
Did you check my room?

98
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,644
Yes.

99
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,983
Who was it?

100
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,987
That woman.

101
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,283
Our stepmom?

102
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,619
Yeah.

103
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,212
You know… it's strange.

104
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,299
What is?

105
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,679
That woman is strange.

106
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,350
And so is this house.

107
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,568
Are you scared?

108
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,660
Everything's gonna be all right. I'm here.

109
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,123
Come here. Let's go to sleep.

110
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,677
I'll always be with you.

111
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,984
Soo-yeon. Go away.

112
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,700
Are you awake?

113
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,370
Yes.

114
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,165
-May I come in?
-No.

115
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,170
Breakfast is ready. Come down.

116
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,777
What are you doing?

117
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,908
Are you on your period?

118
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,373
No, Soo-yeon is.

119
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
Soo-yeon?

120
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,462
That's funny.

121
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,930
How could we both get our period
on the same day?

122
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,587
Soo-mi.

123
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,422
It's okay, get up.

124
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,066
That was mom's favorite, huh?

125
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,372
Do this.

126
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,964
Shall we kill them?

127
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,257
Let's set them free.

128
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,848
She'll have a cow
if we mess with her precious little birds.

129
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,476
I'd hate to see that.

130
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,861
Soo-mi.

131
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,038
What are you doing out in the cold?

132
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,666
Are you all right?

133
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,293
Why?

134
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,172
You don't look so good.
Are you feeling sick?

135
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,883
No, I'm okay.

136
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,094
Tell me what's wrong.

137
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,097
I said I'm okay.

138
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,854
Just get rid of Soo-yeon's closet.

139
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:52,319
Soo-mi, we agreed
not to talk about that closet.

140
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,282
You promised, remember?

141
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,454
Soo-mi…

142
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,750
I know you're mad at me.

143
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,550
And I know I've been a bad father.

144
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,971
You're worse than a bad father.

145
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,981
It's cold, let's go inside.

146
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,900
Not now.

147
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,755
What are you doing?

148
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,507
You scared me.

149
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,343
When did you come in?

150
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,727
-Did you go to the warehouse?
-Yeah.

151
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,988
Soo-yeon, look at this.

152
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,536
Ta-da!

153
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,120
Wow!

154
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,039
-Cool.
-Pretty, huh?

155
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,793
-Yes. Is it Mom's?
-Yup. And, look.

156
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,503
There's more.

157
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,758
It's Mom!

158
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,932
Taritakoom, taritakoom.

159
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,725
What does that mean?

160
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,228
It's a spell to call Mom.

161
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,689
Who told you that?

162
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,608
Mom did.

163
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,569
What?

164
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,279
Mind if I keep this?

165
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,239
Sure.

166
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,496
This.

167
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,624
And this.

168
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,042
Wait!

169
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,297
What's this?

170
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,473
Who did this to you?

171
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,144
Tell me, who did this?

172
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,105
It's okay, tell me.

173
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,859
Was it her?

174
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,987
It was her, wasn't it?

175
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,783
Soo-yeon, what's wrong with you?

176
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,453
I told you to tell me
if something happened!

177
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,787
She did this, right?

178
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,666
Right? Did she do this?

179
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,044
Tell me!

180
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,415
What?

181
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,668
How can you be so cruel?

182
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,588
It's retribution.

183
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,840
If you disobey, you need to be punished.

184
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,259
Does Dad know what you did?

185
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,181
You think your father can help you?

186
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,350
Go get him, then. Want me to do it?

187
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,145
Sit down! Where are your manners?

188
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,023
-What would you mother say?
-Don't talk about my mom.

189
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,778
Listen carefully.
I'm your mother now, got it?

190
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,905
As much as you hate it,

191
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:55,742
I'm the only one in this world
you can call mother, got it?

192
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,038
Crying over your mom's photos
won't change anything.

193
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,832
Hard to handle, isn't it?

194
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,292
That's too bad. That's how the world is.

195
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,879
The world isn't as sweet
as you picture it.

196
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,966
Sometimes you have to bear the worst
and live on.

197
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,968
Like the way I'm bearing you two!

198
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,262
Tough, isn't it?

199
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,224
I have tolerated you brats
from the moment I came to this house.

200
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,270
I have never met
such ill-mannered menaces like you two.

201
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,780
What?

202
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,326
Why the hell did you even come here?

203
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,125
I can't believe you said that to me again.

204
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,547
I guess you're still sick.

205
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,587
Don't touch me.

206
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,018
-Let me go!
-What's wrong with you?

207
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,561
Are you that blind?

208
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,314
Don't touch me with your filthy hands!

209
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,774
Soo-mi, listen to me.

210
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,901
I don't want to hear it.
You haven't changed.

211
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,364
That's not true, and you know it.
You must try and accept this.

212
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,282
Why is it always me?

213
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,078
Why should I be the only one
to understand things?

214
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,623
Are you really that clueless?

215
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,335
Yes, maybe I don't know.

216
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,340
I don't have all the answers,
so tell me and get it off your chest.

217
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,424
Tell me!

218
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,469
Will it change anything? Will it?

219
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,516
Soo-mi, you…

220
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:30,105
Don't do this. Please don't.

221
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,899
You'll get sick again.

222
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,278
What?

223
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
Fine.

224
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,088
From now on,
whatever happens in this house…

225
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,844
all the filthy things you brought here…

226
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,973
take responsibility for it all.

227
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,231
I'm done talking.
You can answer the phone now.

228
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,188
Do you remember?

229
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,108
My memory's a bit blurry,
but I'm sure it did happen.

230
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,985
When was it?

231
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,987
Hey, remember this?

232
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,324
You jumped into the river
to catch some fish.

233
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,662
Then you started to drown,
and everyone had a fit.

234
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,292
There was another funny story.

235
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,836
What was it?

236
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,088
Oh, yeah, I remember.

237
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,507
Remember that crazy guy?

238
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,885
The funny thing is that
there was never anything wrong with him.

239
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,304
But whenever it rained, he went nuts.

240
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,349
While ploughing the field,

241
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:16,521
he'd strip off his clothes when it rained,
and run out into the highway.

242
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:23,194
The funniest time
was when it rained off and on.

243
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,740
So he'd take off his clothes
and put them back on, again and again.

244
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,746
Then he got sick of it
and just went into his house.

245
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:41,212
Everyone in the neighborhood
laughed so much back then.

246
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:45,800
But when he was little
he saw him doing that once,

247
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:51,264
and then he ran together
with that crazy guy.

248
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,813
Our mom saw that
and she almost passed out.

249
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,483
Do you remember that?

250
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,401
You remember, right?

251
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,448
Say something.

252
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,366
Don't you remember?

253
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,204
You remember, right? You must remember.

254
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,754
No, I don't remember.

255
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,174
What?

256
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,889
I said I don't remember.

257
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,624
Why don't you remember?

258
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,591
Are you crazy?

259
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,414
Mi-hee!

260
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,168
What is she saying?

261
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,505
Mi-hee!

262
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,884
Wait, hold on to her.

263
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,260
-What's wrong?
-Calm down.

264
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:54,929
Bring some water.

265
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,599
Are you all right, Mi-hee?

266
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,811
Here. Water.

267
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,674
I will hold her.

268
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,063
Calm down.

269
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,023
It's okay.

270
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,576
It's all right, Mi-hee. It's all right.

271
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,536
Please calm down, Mi-hee!

272
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,577
I'm sorry, Mi-hee.

273
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,081
I didn't want to go,

274
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,792
but Moo-hyeon begged me to,
so I had no choice.

275
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,753
Honey.

276
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,088
Yes?

277
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,050
I saw something strange in that house.

278
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,219
What did you see?

279
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,056
There was a girl under the sink.

280
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,038
Just go to bed.

281
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,978
-Can you stay with me?
-Why?

282
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,021
Something's strange.

283
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,232
What's strange?

284
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,651
It's strange.

285
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,656
After the girls came back, weird things
have been happening in this house.

286
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,577
Don't be silly.

287
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,620
Didn't you see it?

288
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:39,625
You're just having a hard time adjusting.
Get some rest.

289
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,419
No.

290
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,341
There's something in this house.

291
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,099
I'll look around. You lie down.

292
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,697
Open the door!

293
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,198
Open it!

294
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:18,909
Let me out!

295
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,626
I'll show you.

296
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,621
Get up.

297
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,543
Get out of bed.

298
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,339
Get out now!

299
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,179
I said get out.

300
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,830
Come here, now!

301
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,295
You little brat.

302
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,056
Tell me.

303
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:53,814
A person can't get any rest in this house.

304
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,238
Who did that to the photos? Tell me.

305
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,868
Who did it?

306
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,038
Tell me the truth.

307
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,164
Who did it?

308
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,416
Was it Soo-mi?

309
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,503
I'll teach you both a lesson.

310
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,130
Was it your sister?

311
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:40,778
So you like looking at
your dead mother's things, huh?

312
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,696
You like looking at her photos?

313
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,182
Say you're sorry.

314
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:14,311
I'm not gonna let you out of there
until you apologize.

315
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,490
There's no use in crying.

316
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,951
Say you're sorry and beg for forgiveness!

317
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,454
Sorry.

318
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:34,665
What?

319
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,875
I didn't hear you.

320
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,713
I'm sorry.

321
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,558
I'll ask you once more.

322
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,187
Do you admit you're wrong?

323
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:02,943
Stop crying.

324
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,405
I don't want to hear it, so stop it now!

325
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,745
Are you…

326
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,164
Are you mad?

327
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,834
Is that why you're crying?

328
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,218
Fine, let's see how long you hold up.

329
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,474
This will put some sense into you two.

330
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,797
Soo-yeon.

331
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:51,718
Soo-yeon!

332
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,643
Soo-yeon, I'm sorry.

333
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,274
I didn't hear you.

334
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:12,781
I'm sorry, Soo-yeon. I'm sorry.

335
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,082
I'll never let it happen again.

336
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,295
Never again.

337
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,933
Don't cry, it'll be okay.

338
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:50,921
Tell me.

339
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,464
What?

340
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,550
Why the hell are you doing this?

341
01:15:55,592 --> 01:16:01,431
Tell me why you've been acting so strange
since you got here.

342
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:03,308
You really don't know?

343
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,477
Don't know what? What is it?

344
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,854
I'm talking about
what that woman is doing to us!

345
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,815
So tell me what she has done!

346
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,775
She keeps harassing Soo-yeon.

347
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:15,904
What?

348
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,115
Didn't you hear me?

349
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,827
I said she keeps harassing Soo-yeon!

350
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:26,832
She's vicious, evil,
and locks Soo-yeon up in the closet!

351
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,459
Soo-mi, please stop it.

352
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,170
Stop what?

353
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:36,758
You know Soo-yeon is scared of her.

354
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,763
Soo-yeon, why don't you tell Dad?

355
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,726
Stop crying and tell him now.

356
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:47,603
Tell him!

357
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:48,854
Enough!

358
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,194
Soo-yeon is dead.

359
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:02,868
What?

360
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,081
No.

361
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,961
Soo-yeon is dead.

362
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,798
So pull yourself together.

363
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,978
How long will you keep this up?

364
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,907
It's not true, Soo-yeon.

365
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,161
Soo-yeon…

366
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,047
Soo-yeon, no…

367
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:27,744
I can't do it alone.
Can you come here tomorrow?

368
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,164
Hmm…

369
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,918
She's getting worse.

370
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,800
Call me when you get there.
I'll pick you up.

371
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:20,649
Soo-mi, I'll be back soon.
Make sure you lock up.

372
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,069
Soo-yeon!

373
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,363
Soo-yeon!

374
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:28,698
Soo-yeon!

375
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,822
-Soo-mi!
-Soo-yeon!

376
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:41,808
Soo-yeon.

377
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:44,574
Soo-yeon…

378
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:55,835
I'm sick and tired of your family.

379
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,258
So sick and tired.

380
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:05,173
How did we come to this?

381
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,807
Don't you get it?

382
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,606
Remember what I told you before?

383
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:27,528
I said you'd regret it someday. Remember?

384
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:40,917
You know… what's really scary?

385
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:47,882
You want to forget something…

386
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,970
You want to erase something
from your memories…

387
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,975
But you never can.

388
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,894
It'll never go away, you see.

389
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:02,897
And…

390
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:08,444
And it follows you around, like a ghost.

391
01:30:13,324 --> 01:30:14,617
Help me.

392
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:30,424
Sure, I'll help you.

393
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,427
Let's end it here.

394
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:24,687
Soo-mi!

395
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,691
Where's Soo-mi?

396
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:55,569
Where is she?

397
01:32:57,613 --> 01:32:58,823
Please stop it.

398
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,159
I'm tired of this.

399
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:13,004
Take this, you'll feel much better.

400
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:51,727
Soo-mi!

401
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:36,397
Don't you get it?

402
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:38,774
You're just having a hard time adjusting.

403
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:40,276
I guess you're still sick.

404
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:41,902
We agreed not to talk about that closet.

405
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,155
How could we both get our period
on the same day?

406
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:45,156
Soo-yeon is dead.

407
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,657
No, I don't remember.

408
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:50,781
Soo-mi, are you okay?

409
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,043
It's all over now.

410
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,881
You'll feel better here.

411
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,807
Get some rest.

412
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,227
I'll come and visit often.

413
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:31,238
Take care of yourself. Bye.

414
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:41,332
Soo-mi, what's wrong? Let go.

415
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:44,668
Let go, Soo-mi.

416
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:49,965
Please stop it. Let go of me.

417
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,713
-No, I'll get it.
-Let me take one.

418
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,020
Mom.

419
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:13,961
Soo-yeon!

420
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:32,385
Soo-yeon.

421
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:26,815
Mom!

422
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,527
Mom…

423
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:33,405
Mom! Mom!

424
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,536
Mom!

425
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,045
Did you hear something?

426
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,467
What are you doing up here?

427
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:20,303
Dad's not here.

428
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:24,182
What do you mean by that?

429
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:27,894
Stop acting like you're my mom.

430
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:33,316
Do me a favor.

431
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:35,694
Stay out of our lives.

432
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,035
Can you get out of the way?

433
01:49:45,453 --> 01:49:46,788
I have to go.

434
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:55,213
You might regret this moment.

435
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:57,048
Keep that in mind.

436
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:05,265
What can be worse
than standing here with you?

437
01:50:08,518 --> 01:50:12,355
When you're here, I want to be
as far away from you as I can.

438
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:14,524
Do you get it now?

439
01:50:28,246 --> 01:50:29,247
Soo-mi.

440
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:34,878
Soo-mi!

441
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:08,620
Help me. Soo-mi…

442
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:12,749
Soo-mi…

443
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:16,419
Soo-mi…
