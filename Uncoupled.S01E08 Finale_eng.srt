1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,385
[elevator bell dings]

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,729
-Oh my God!
-Really?

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,480
I sent you a photo to prepare you

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,482
specifically so I wouldn't
get that reaction.

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,027
Sorry. It's a little angrier in person.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,445
Kind of like Ellen DeGeneres.

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,323
But don't worry, you'll look like
a cover girl by the time I'm through. Sit.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,452
Oh! And, uh… this'll make you feel better.

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,536
Hmm.

10
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,580
We got our big-ass commission check

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,123
-on Claire's apartment!
-[gasps]

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,875
-Oh, snap!
-[laughs]

13
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, look at all those lovely zeroes.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,837
-Mm.
-They really get that number on its feet.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,508
I'm gonna use this money as a down payment
to buy out Colin's half of the apartment.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,468
Seriously?

17
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,928
When did you talk to him?

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,346
I will today, at the wedding.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,558
It's supposed to be on the market
six months after we separated,

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,811
but I really wanna stay here. [sighs]

21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,607
In spite of everything that's happened,
I love this place. It's my home.

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,735
Of course it is. Did you always have
this little scar above your eye?

23
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,864
No, that's a permanent souvenir
of the gay ski weekend smackdown.

24
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
Does it happen to look… sexy?

25
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,912
-Sure.
-Ugh, I really should sue Billy.

26
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,080
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,664
Because of him, I have to see Colin

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,958
for the first time in months,
looking like this.

29
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,753
He'll probably be with his new boyfriend,
the hot architect.

30
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,797
How do you know?
Did you ask the Jonathans?

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,549
No, but I was invited with a guest,
so I'm sure he was too.

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,261
And by the look of those pics in Miami,
they seem pretty serious.

33
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,805
-Sorry, baby.
-Thanks.

34
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,848
I've been meditating on it.
I bought an app.

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,642
So I think I'm in a pretty zen place.

36
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,684
-Okay.
-Yeah.

37
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,394
There's nothing I can do
about any of this.

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,896
-That's right.
-I just have to…

39
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,397
[exhales] …let it all go.

40
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,025
-That's right.
-Jesus! Can't you fix this?

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,027
I look like the last one out of Chernobyl!

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,114
Yeah, you seem super chill
about the whole thing.

43
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,619
Well, look, so Kai's friend told me
that Kai found his father on 23andMe.

44
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,832
Apparently, the guy lives in New York,
and Kai is planning to meet him.

45
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,126
Wow, bury the headline.

46
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,130
Not so much "bury" as "wait for Michael
to unravel, and then you can have a turn."

47
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,340
Fair enough. How do you feel?

48
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,801
[sighs heavily] Weird.

49
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,847
You know, this is a guy that I had
a one-night stand with 26 years ago

50
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,682
in Amsterdam, Berlin, or Rome.

51
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,811
And… I mean,
it's been me and Kai all these years,

52
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,064
and now he suddenly wants a dad?

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,942
You have absolutely no memory
of any of these guys?

54
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,402
Before you start slut-shaming,

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,113
do you remember all the one-nighters
you had in your 20s?

56
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,031
I withdraw the question.

57
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,158
Oh.

58
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,452
As much as I'm dying
to talk to him about everything,

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,414
-I don't wanna push it.
-Yeah.

60
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,916
You're doing the right thing.
Let him tell you in his own time.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,253
It's like coming out.You shouldn't
force someone before they're ready.

62
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,007
Like Brittany Blumberg did
to a very confused 15-year-old boy

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,302
just because he happened to know
all of the lyrics to "Express Yourself."

64
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,888
[laughs]

65
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,390
[theme music playing]

66
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,979
[jazz playing]

67
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,899
Sure I look okay?

68
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,777
Yes! Just avoid direct sunlight
and favor your good side.

69
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,781
Hey, guys. You remember Wyatt
from Colin's birthday?

70
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,535
That night was a blur for many reasons,
but yes, nice to see you again, Wyatt.

71
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,455
You too. I'm sorry to hear about you and--

72
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,374
It's all good now. Manageable, anyway.
Haven't seen him in a while.

73
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
The last time was not great.

74
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,961
I guess am a bit nervous.
Do I look like I have makeup on?

75
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,672
Oh my God. Here, drink this,
and calm the fuck down.

76
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,301
-Billy's wearin' more makeup than you.
-I came right from the studio.

77
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,011
Yeah, but you touched it up in the car.

78
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,263
I think we may need to have a talk

79
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,308
about what grown-ups do
in private, young man.

80
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,394
You keep it up, Wyatt.
Billy's chops could use a little bustin'.

81
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,147
I gotta go to the ladies'.
Any idea where it is?

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,649
It's upstairs. I'll walk you.

83
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,819
Funny, and a gentleman
with skin like a baby's ass.

84
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,363
Whatever do you see in him, Billy?

85
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,953
Wow, this may actually be
a first second date.

86
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,622
Yeah, it's been a while
since I've had one of those.

87
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,040
But I've been thinking about him,

88
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,251
and he called,
so I asked if he wanted to come.

89
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,336
I really like the kid, Mikey.

90
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,421
I think I might give it
the old college try.

91
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,131
That's so great, Billy.

92
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,301
Even if what you're trying for
is literally still in college.

93
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,261
Ha ha.

94
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,724
I haven't seen him.
I don't think he's here yet.

95
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,893
Well, then here's to the calm
before the storm.

96
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,688
Mm…

97
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
-There's Stanley.
-Oh.

98
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,985
What's going on with him? He looks so sad.

99
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,486
That's his gay wedding face.

100
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,239
It's like every time
he hears another "I do,"

101
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,658
-it just reminds him that he don't.
-[snorts]

102
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,288
[sighs]

103
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,457
Hey, honey, how are you?

104
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,209
I'm…

105
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,460
[sighs] I…

106
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,087
Oh, come on, now.

107
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,673
Don't be down about the wedding.
The Jonathans found each other.

108
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,176
There's hope for everyone.
You still have plenty of time.

109
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,804
-[chuckles]
Thank you for the patronizing sentiment,

110
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,514
but I'm not worried about the wedding.

111
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,351
As for having plenty of time,
I'm not so sure about that either. I…

112
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,520
I got a call from my doctor this morning.

113
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,814
-On a Saturday?
-He got some test results.

114
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,732
It's…

115
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,943
not good.

116
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,071
Uh… You're scaring me, Stanley.
What is it?

117
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,656
I have…

118
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,745
breast cancer.

119
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,789
-What?
-He's joking.

120
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,041
I wish I were.

121
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,543
Oh my God.

122
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,713
-I can't believe it.
-Me either.

123
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,967
[sighs] But it's true.
I have stage-one breast cancer.

124
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,302
But you're a dude.

125
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,263
Wait, have you always been a dude?

126
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,264
[laughs]

127
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,433
Sorry.

128
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,060
Apparently, they caught it early,

129
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,189
but I have to see my doctor on Monday
to discuss treatment.

130
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,816
Will you go with me?
I need another pair of ears.

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,818
I'm so wobbly,
I'll probably miss half of it.

132
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,489
Of course. Don't worry. It'll be okay.

133
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,409
That's what people say
when they have no idea if it will be okay.

134
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,287
Don't look now.

135
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,081
There's Colin.

136
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,791
-[laughing]
-You know…

137
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,959
Oh, and the hot architect.

138
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,379
You should go over, say hi.
Get it out of the way.

139
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
He's right. Don't worry. It'll be okay.

140
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,424
Oops.

141
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,926
All right, I'll be back.

142
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,056
How do you think you got the titty cancer?

143
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,934
[laughs]

144
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,565
Hi, Colin. Hello, I'm Michael, the ex.

145
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,529
I know it looks like I was in a bar fight,
but no, I got drunk at gay ski weekend,

146
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,906
and the friends
who were taking me to my room

147
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,199
dropped me on my face.

148
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,158
Nice to meet you.

149
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,413
Hello. I'm Craig,
and this is my wife, Janet.

150
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,374
-Sorry, wife?
-The train was moving too fast.

151
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,375
I couldn't stop you.

152
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,626
Oh, my…

153
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,296
I thought he was your new boyfriend,
the architect.

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,550
I saw pictures of you guys
in Miami last week.

155
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,552
First of all, that guy's not my boyfriend.

Craig, Janet, Colin.

Third, I'd never have brought a date
to this out of respect…

Did you bring somebody?

161
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,358
No. Honestly, I was just trying
to make you feel comfortable

00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,110
and not have it be weird between us again.

broken that news more thoughtfully.

had been together, and…

seemed so inevitable.

to choke on a chicken bone
as a distraction,

in my mouth, and have you tasted it?

-Oh! Look at you! Catchin' on so quick!

Look, the apartment has appreciated
approximately 40% since we bought it,

348
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,819
so the logical thing to do
would be to sell it, split the proceeds.

Honestly, I pictured different people,
strangers, living there after we left.
