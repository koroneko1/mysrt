1
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,387
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,090
I'm really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,060
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

4
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,628
-You are a spy.
-I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,064
-Please let me go home.
-Try again.

6
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,766
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,069
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

8
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,539
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

9
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,743
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

10
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,813
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

11
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,496
I am not a spy.

12
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,699
I am not a spy.

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:45,672
It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader...

14
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,476
...that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea...

15
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,279
...has pardoned
the American imperialist...

16
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,484
...for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.

17
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,254
Keep your head down.
Don't say anything till we make the swap.

18
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,891
In case Kim Jong Il here
changes his mind.

19
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,874
Exchange.

20
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,276
Right face!

21
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,548
Right face!

22
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,251
I don't understand.

23
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,586
You don't understand what?

24
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,324
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life...

25
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,261
...is not worth blowing operational cover.

26
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,562
You got that right.

27
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,699
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,867
So why did you do it?

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,871
Well, I didn't do it.

30
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,674
He did.

31
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,845
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

32
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,650
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

33
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,853
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something...

34
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,590
...or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

35
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,242
You okay?

36
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,712
Yeah.

37
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,558
Hey.

38
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,528
-Good morning.
-Happy anniversary.

39
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,699
You want me to make you breakfast?

40
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,369
How about pancakes?

41
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,471
Your cooking?

42
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,606
You're joking. You like my cooking.

43
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,742
Germans don't joke.

44
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,845
Burt likes my cooking.

45
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,920
Get your bugs off the table.

46
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,323
-They're spiders.
-They're bugs.

47
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,359
-They're spiders.
-They're bugs.

48
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,335
Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.

49
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,938
Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back...

50
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,941
...and over one another
about a third of the way.

51
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,547
Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.

52
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,783
Are you doing this on company time?

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,653
-And insert your favorite silverware....
-It's my anniversary.

54
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,057
And I want it to be perfect.

55
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,825
But...

56
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,560
...that is not sexy.

57
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,463
No, but it is utilitarian.

58
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,732
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

59
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,536
I ran the trace.
First name Usam, last name Utsaev.

60
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,071
-Any verifiable hits?
-One.

61
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,674
Hey, Francis, do me a favor
and stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

62
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,876
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,379
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

64
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,482
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

65
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,650
From head to toe.

66
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,886
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

67
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,357
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

68
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,060
Was I ever that young?

69
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,630
Younger.

70
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,033
Walk me out.

71
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,036
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

72
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,038
Oh, you know. The usual.

73
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,707
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia...

74
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,375
...the day before it happens.

75
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,811
How about you?
I heard that interview went well.

76
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,713
Fingers crossed.

77
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,049
You sure about this?

78
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,152
You know, once you start pushing paper,
there's no turning back.

79
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,789
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

80
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,492
-I was homesick.
-Homesick?

81
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,894
-Sir! Sir!
-Can't you take something for that?

82
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,699
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

83
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,101
-Here?
-I guess he's not buying our cover.

84
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,437
-Did you get his bona fides?
-He's Russian.

85
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,672
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

86
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,975
-He's a strange guy.
-How's his English?

87
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,410
Passable. Not great.

88
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,447
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance....

89
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,084
-Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
-Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

90
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,452
Come on, Salt.

91
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,722
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

92
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,892
-I got 25 minutes.
-I got 26. Let's go.

93
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,901
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

94
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,437
-Who called Counterintelligence?
-Not me.

95
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,072
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

96
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,076
-Peabody.
-Salt.

97
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,050
Please remove the hood.

98
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,820
Microphones are on.

99
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,922
Checking levels.

100
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,691
Baseline recorded.

101
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,865
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

102
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,069
-Ev.
-Yeah.

103
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,538
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

104
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,648
Testing earpiece.

105
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,087
Interview has commenced at 1442.

106
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,932
You're married.

107
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,570
A husband must be a distraction...

108
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,207
...for a female intelligence officer.

109
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,676
Well, we're here to talk about you.

110
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,944
So, what is your name?

111
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,581
My name is...

112
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:40,019
...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

113
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,558
I have cancer.

114
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,727
I'm moved.

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,962
A defector with cancer.

116
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,133
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

117
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:59,005
If I have gained anything
by damning myself...

118
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:05,211
...it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

119
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,915
Russia is also dying.

120
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,585
-But unlike me, she's not dead.
-Oleg Vassily Orlov...

121
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,289
...shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

122
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,858
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

123
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,226
He checks out as FSB, Ev.

124
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,262
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

125
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,931
Prior to '93?

126
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,301
-Russia was once strong, powerful....
-Nothing.

127
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,902
He doesn't exist.

128
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,839
And she will be again
when things have been set back...

129
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,975
...on the correct path.

130
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,945
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov...

131
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,747
...so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

132
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,054
I came here to tell you a story.

133
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,823
I don't like stories.

134
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,793
But I'll listen anyway.

135
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,861
In English, please.

136
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,830
Others are listening.

137
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,767
1975.

138
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,337
The Cold War.

139
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,007
In a gymnasium in Grozny...

140
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,343
...a Soviet Olympic wrestler...

141
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,113
...named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenkov...

142
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,182
...meets for the first time...

143
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,786
...the only female chess grand master
of her era:

144
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,691
Anja Nurekyova.

145
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,995
Within a month, they were married.

146
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,698
And within a year, a child.

147
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,167
One month more...

148
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,338
...the child was back
in the same hospital...

149
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,973
...sick with fever.

150
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,911
And within days after that...

151
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,715
...the child suddenly was dead.

152
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,755
Yes, a child was dead.

153
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,059
And, yes, a child was buried.

154
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,870
But the Chenkov baby was alive...

155
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,307
...and became the property
of another man.

156
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,945
A master spy
who had devised the greatest plan...

157
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,350
...a Russian patriot could ever invent.

158
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,954
A plan to destroy America.

159
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,457
It had all started...

160
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,761
...with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

161
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,999
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

162
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:43,069
Three years later, he returned home.

163
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,038
But the man
who came back to America...

164
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:51,744
...was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.

165
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,481
On November 22nd, 1963...

166
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:00,186
...Alek became the first success
of the new program...

167
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,989
...and a hero of the Soviet Union.

168
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,226
The spymaster was now
given the go-ahead...

169
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,229
...to create many more like Alek.

170
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,933
Scores of agents,
males and females...

171
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,769
...to be substituted for Americans.

172
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,439
I pledge allegiance to the flag....

173
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,908
At an abandoned monastery...

174
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,846
...Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English...

175
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,415
...long before they learned Russian.

176
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,851
Drilled in idiom...

177
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,186
...idiosyncrasy and...

178
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,422
...ideology.

179
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,962
And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming...

180
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,132
...the spymaster
made warriors of iron.

181
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,768
Unquestioning and unbreakable.

182
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,139
You're killing me, man.

183
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,441
When does the good fairy come in?

184
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,543
Never.

185
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,478
It's a story without hope.

186
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,817
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

187
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,387
There was an accident.
The family died.

188
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,490
Chenkov was sent to America...

189
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,127
...to live a complete lie...

190
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,165
...and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

191
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,333
Day X.

192
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:26,071
The long-awaited mission is here.

193
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,808
Chenkov will travel to New York City...

194
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,079
...to kill the president of Russia...

195
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:39,885
...at the funeral of
the American vice president.

196
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,391
Chenkov is KA 12.

197
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,227
-"KA."
-Cold War legend.

198
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,262
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents...

199
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,300
...inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

200
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,337
Supposedly they'd wait years to strike.
Decades, even.

201
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,439
Supposedly.

202
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,609
-What, you don't believe in moles?
-I believe in moles, all right.

203
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,211
Just not the bogeyman.

204
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,314
Especially if the plan
is to kill their own president.

205
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,382
This guy's selling smoke.

206
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,451
Wrap it up, Ev.

207
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:18,023
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

208
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,593
Okay.

209
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,128
Thank you very much.

210
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,932
And what would you like
in return for that information?

211
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,869
I simply wish to help you do...

212
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,304
...what you need to do.

213
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,875
You're good.

214
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,580
The KA program is brilliant bullshit.

215
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,950
But I'm officially off duty...

216
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,587
...so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

217
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,990
-Salt.
-Yes?

218
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,394
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

219
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,097
Evelyn Salt.

220
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,369
My name is Evelyn Salt.

221
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,605
Then you are a Russian spy.

222
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,408
Truthful.

223
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:15,381
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

224
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,286
Ted?

225
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,527
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

226
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,397
-I need to get to the phone.
-Not after the neural scan.

227
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,366
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

228
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,468
I am trained to, and so is he.

229
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,305
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

230
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,107
-Let me call my husband.
-Let me see it.

231
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,580
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

232
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,549
They don't just blow up their cover...

233
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,285
...they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

234
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,121
-Do you remember Henley's wife?
-Yes, I do.

235
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,656
Speaker.

236
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,627
Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

237
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,530
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

238
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,699
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

239
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,301
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

240
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,440
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

241
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,176
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

242
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,146
-I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
-I didn't say you were.

243
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,415
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

244
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,585
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

245
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,153
All right.

246
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,056
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

247
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,326
Ev? Five minutes.

248
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,198
-Call Protective Services, find Mike.
-I will.

249
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,467
This is bullshit.

250
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,339
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

251
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,043
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

252
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,011
-I'm just asking for five minutes.
-No.

253
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,788
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

254
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,457
-She's scared. Don't you see that?
-I don't care.

255
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,094
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

256
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,143
Please step in the elevator.

257
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,671
--Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

258
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,146
What the hell is that?

259
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,648
Sir.

260
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,151
-Where do you think he went?
-No one saw him coming out the front.

261
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,188
-Jesus Christ.
-Here he is again.

262
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,191
No sign of him so far on the street.

263
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,160
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

264
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,796
-Anything clean on him?
-We just got a match, sir.

265
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,698
It's May Day, 1981.

266
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,200
There's Brezhnev. And there....

267
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,435
-Orlov.
-That's him.

268
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,471
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

269
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,673
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter...

270
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,843
...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

271
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,313
-Get me Medford on a secure line.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,217
-Top-right screen. Is that live?
-Yes, sir.

273
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,652
Where is she going? Track her.

274
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,357
No one may leave the building.

275
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,692
Rink Petroleum, Security.

276
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,762
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

277
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,501
-We lost the visual on her.
-Damn it. Where'd she go?

278
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,503
We are on security lockdown.

279
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,506
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

280
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,909
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

281
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,710
Hey, happy anniversary, huh?

282
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,579
The stairwell.

283
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,348
-Second floor.
-What's on that floor?

284
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,218
-It's empty, a security buffer.
-Isolate and seal it.

285
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,594
Get her records to my handheld.

286
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,498
East corridor.

287
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,272
Notifying Metropolitan Police.

288
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,749
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

289
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,323
We got her.

290
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,725
Locking down all floors.

291
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,394
Security Protective Service
responding to threat.

292
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,601
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

293
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,869
-Yes, sir.
-Director Medford, sir.

294
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,871
Get me a side arm.

295
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,975
I'll call her back.

296
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,949
-Shit.
-Lost visual.

297
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,885
Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

298
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,321
Come on.

299
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,897
North hallway.

300
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,682
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

301
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,655
Switch down, switch down.

302
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,664
-Have you found him?
-What the hell are you doing, Ev?

303
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:13,932
This doesn't look good.

304
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,867
-Let's do it.
-Move.

305
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,570
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

306
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,072
Get your panties off the camera.

307
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,541
Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.

308
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,677
-Have you found my husband?
-These boys aren't fooling around.

309
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,951
Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

310
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,720
Call me when you find Mike.

311
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,089
Sweeping corridors
outside the elevator.

312
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,862
Put the masks on.

313
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,430
Situation is hot.

314
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,709
Open the door about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.

315
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,146
-Tac team in position. Waiting for a go.
-Is that absolutely necessary?

316
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,115
What, you want me to shoot her?

317
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,617
Get a medical team in place now.

318
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,799
We're ready.

319
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,138
Now.

320
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,013
Okay, on my count.

321
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,784
Three, two, one. Go.

322
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,025
Jesus Christ.

323
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,075
Where is she? Come on, guys.

324
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,112
-Find her, Albert. Now.
-Suspect has escaped.

325
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,481
There. Bring that up.

326
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,219
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

327
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,954
Pan the goddamn camera.

328
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,935
Back that up and zoom in.

329
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,938
-We're looking for Michael Krause.
-Freeze.

330
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,808
-We're looking for her husband, Mike.
-What the hell are you doing, Ev?

331
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,811
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

332
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,647
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

333
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,717
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

334
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,652
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

335
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,754
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

336
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,624
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

337
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,192
Okay.

338
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,094
Taxi!

339
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,666
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

340
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,545
Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.

341
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,307
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev...

342
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,710
...and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access...

343
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,179
...to the borders of North Korea.

344
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,883
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

345
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,288
He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.

346
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,729
Mike?

347
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,201
Mike? Honey?

348
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,710
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

349
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,812
It's all right.

350
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,082
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

351
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,982
Come on. Come on.

352
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,823
Check for back exits.

353
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,276
Go! Go!

354
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,682
Bedroom, clear!

355
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,986
Kitchen is clear.

356
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,823
Office, clear!

357
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,759
Living room, clear!

358
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,421
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

359
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,084
Come here.

360
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,753
What are you doing?

361
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,289
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

362
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,025
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

363
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,760
-Why'd she run?
-I don't know.

364
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,864
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

365
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,032
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

366
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,368
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

367
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,237
"Maybe" is your department.

368
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,106
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

369
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,976
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

370
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,211
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

371
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,381
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

372
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,883
Should it?

373
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,554
-Is your mom home?
-No.

374
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,389
-No? Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

375
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,858
Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

376
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,996
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? Here's some money for food.

377
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,931
Hi, Burt.

378
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:04,068
-What you doing? You doing homework?
-Yeah, math.

379
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,939
-Algebra.
-I hate math.

380
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,920
Hi. Nice to see you again.

381
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,158
-You talking to me?
-Yeah, I've seen you here before.

382
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,027
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

383
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,197
You?

384
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,066
Oh, I'm working here.

385
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,168
At the museum.

386
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,573
-I'm an arachnologist.
-A what?

387
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,309
I hunt spiders.

388
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,457
I got her.

389
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,393
She's heading north
towards the Metro station.

390
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,195
Ev!

391
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,121
Ev!

392
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,567
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

393
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,106
Excuse me.

394
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,921
-Will do. Headed there now.
-There she is.

395
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,125
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

396
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,070
Circle around!

397
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,005
Salt! Stop!

398
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,374
-Keep her in your sights!
-Coming up behind you!

399
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,009
Fuck!

400
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,015
Keep back! Hold your fire!

401
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,318
Salt! Down!

402
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,554
Salt!

403
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,395
Spread out!

404
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,598
-Salt!
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

405
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,001
-On the ground. Now!
-Please don't. No!

406
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,171
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

407
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,472
I have to find my husband.

408
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,441
-Why'd you run?
-To find my husband!

409
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,409
-That's not a reason.
-Don't shoot.

410
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,044
-Stay back!
-Last chance.

411
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

412
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,183
-Don't make me put you down.
-Put the gun down!

413
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,751
-Give yourself up!
-Come on, Ev.

414
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,520
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

415
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,057
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

416
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,693
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

417
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,629
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

418
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,199
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

419
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,600
No, I didn't do anything.

420
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,235
Get back! No!

421
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,746
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

422
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,748
Get a roadblock in place now.

423
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,762
Metro Police on alert.

424
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,136
There she is. On the tanker.

425
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,705
Stop. Stop!

426
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,651
Ev!

427
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,103
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

428
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,439
-We don't know that yet.
-I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

429
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,342
...and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

430
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,178
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

431
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,864
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

432
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,552
Okay, take it down.

433
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,430
Shit!

434
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,701
Shit!

435
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,409
Okay.

436
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,245
Ted, I know you're her friend...

437
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,747
...but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

438
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,951
-We gotta do it now.
-Let's go!

439
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,224
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

440
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,961
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

441
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:16,300
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

442
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:18,903
You seen this?

443
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,572
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

444
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,943
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

445
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:31,983
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

446
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,286
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

447
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,324
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

448
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,861
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

449
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,344
And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up...

450
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,980
...and preparations are continuing
well into the night...

451
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,383
...for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.

452
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,954
Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. Bartholomew's Church...

453
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,657
...is Russian president
Boris Matveyev...

454
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,393
...who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.

455
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:54,498
Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and....

456
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,537
Evelyn.

457
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,706
Look at me.

458
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,577
If there was a way, I would kill them.

459
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,415
You shouldn't have come here.

460
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,984
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

461
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,888
Now they know who you are.

462
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,924
Who?

463
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,793
Evelyn.

464
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,830
Who?

465
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,101
I would accept anything about you...

466
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,036
...but I need to know.

467
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,439
So look at me. Look at me.

468
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,977
Just tell me, okay?

469
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,712
Just tell me.

470
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,916
I work....

471
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,853
I work for the CIA.

472
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,457
So you see, there's....

473
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,394
There's no future for us.

474
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,466
You're not safe with me.

475
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,870
I don't wanna be safe.

476
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,040
I know you...

477
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,910
...and I wanna be with you.

478
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,748
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

479
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,118
Okay?

480
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,990
Okay. Okay.

481
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,947
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

482
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,183
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

483
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,651
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

484
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,628
-I'll put these in the closet, sir?
-Yeah, fine.

485
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,159
A solemn day here in New York City.

486
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,229
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates...

487
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,166
...a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior...

488
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,769
...whose greatest legacy
may be as architect...

489
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,172
...of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

490
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,308
Russian president Boris Matveyev...

491
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,244
...has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer...

492
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:04,782
...to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.

493
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,942
What's the security perimeter?

494
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,112
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

495
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,715
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

496
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,219
-So relax.
-That's real funny.

497
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,988
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

498
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,060
Detail, halt.

499
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,398
Forward, march.

500
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,819
Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.

501
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:57,728
Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.

502
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,033
What--? Hey, what's going on?

503
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,102
Hey! There's smoke.

504
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,340
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

505
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,177
Eleanor. Good to see you.

506
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,413
Thank you.

507
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,385
-Boris.
-Mr. President.

508
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,258
Hello.

509
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,438
Please be seated.

510
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,119
Stand by for president's speech.

511
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:35,259
Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.

512
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,061
Mrs. Oates.

513
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,200
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald....

514
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:47,404
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

515
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,908
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

516
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,883
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

517
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,252
As vice president...

518
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:07,024
...he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

519
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,859
And today...

520
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:13,597
...the world says goodbye
to a great man.

521
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,575
I'll check the back.

522
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,311
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

523
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,472
My friendship with Maxwell Oates...

524
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,609
...began in the unlikeliest of places:

525
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,346
-Lima Zulu 4, come in.
-Across the negotiating table....

526
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,615
What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?

527
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,116
We got two MIAs.

528
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,355
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

529
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,591
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

530
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,426
What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

531
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,663
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

532
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,064
Converge on the crypt.

533
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,233
He made all the difference,
and for that...

534
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:28,272
...he will always have
my respect and admiration.

535
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,120
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

536
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,095
What's going on?

537
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,407
Matveyev.

538
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,443
Get goddamn Matveyev.

539
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,294
-Get the bomb squad in here!
-Go, go!

540
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,635
Drop it!

541
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:41,671
Drop it!

542
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,048
-Any MTs down here?
-I see her.

543
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,785
-Keep your hands up!
-Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

544
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:58,321
-Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
-Don't move!

545
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,624
-Do not move! Do not move!
-Keep your hands up!

546
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:04,161
-Take her down, take her down!
-Check for other weapons.

547
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,497
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

548
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,466
I can't feel a pulse.

549
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,536
Back it up! Back it up!

550
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,639
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

551
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,175
Let's go, let's go.

552
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,343
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

553
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:21,511
-Back up!
-Keep moving.

554
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,846
Sir, back up!

555
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,649
Why? Why?!

556
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,220
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

557
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,822
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

558
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,157
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

559
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,692
Get ahold of yourself.

560
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,828
Get the door, get the door.

561
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,697
-Get off me!
-Back off, man! Back off!

562
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,299
That's it. Let's go.

563
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,302
Stand back.

564
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,505
Close it! Go, go, go!

565
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,321
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

566
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,156
Jesus Christ.

567
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,624
Yeah.

568
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,893
You were right about her.

569
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,497
She had the drop on me, Ted.

570
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,566
Why didn't she shoot?

571
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,389
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

572
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:04,841
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

573
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,844
Right now! Hands in the air!

574
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:28,632
-Hey, did you see that?
-Hey, get those guys over here.

575
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,001
Get them over here to help.

576
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,685
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

577
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,918
What is your name?

578
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,654
My name is Evelyn Salt.

579
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,556
What college will you attend?

580
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,591
Princeton University.

581
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,795
-Where will you work?
-The Central Intelligence Agency.

582
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,930
Who will you trust?

583
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,832
No one.

584
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,468
Be very patient.

585
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,403
Remember your training.

586
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,541
Remember, you're not the only one.

587
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,342
There are many others.

588
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,713
All of you waiting to strike.

589
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,948
-Yes.
-And we will strike.

590
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,819
-Together.
-Yes.

591
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,889
Wait.

592
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,629
One day, I will come for all of you.

593
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,537
Hello, Evelyn.

594
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,941
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

595
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,978
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

596
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,922
Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words...

597
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,659
...and called on him to take strong
action against what they are calling...

598
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:40,563
...a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.

599
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,732
These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks...

600
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:46,002
...of anti-American protests
across Russia.

601
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,472
"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president...

602
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,941
...angrily condemning
today's assassination...

603
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,645
...by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.

604
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,783
As the body of slain President Matveyev
is on its way back to Moscow...

605
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,585
...anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia...

606
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,488
...with bombings of U.S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.

607
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,692
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

608
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,862
Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis...

609
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:16,166
...President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting...

610
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,836
...with cabinet members, military leaders
and NATO representatives.

611
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,906
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

612
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,981
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

613
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,091
You were not supposed
to get married.

614
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:46,763
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

615
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,665
I did it to seem normal.

616
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,534
When you escaped today, I thought:

617
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,805
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

618
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,843
You are my greatest creation.

619
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,112
You trained me well.

620
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,819
My husband, you have him?

621
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,255
I had to be certain.

622
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,657
But now you trust me?

623
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,825
Completely.

624
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,601
So...

625
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,937
...tell me what's next.

626
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,539
Next, part two:

627
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,944
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

628
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,179
How?

629
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,015
You'll see.

630
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,684
All right.

631
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,094
Satisfied?

632
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,896
I'm satisfied.

633
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:37,000
Comrades...

634
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,970
...our sister has rejoined us.

635
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,340
Russia will rise from the ashes...

636
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,044
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

637
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,881
And the world will hear us!

638
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,783
Will hear.

639
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:58,655
Welcome back to our family, sister.

640
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,425
Sister.

641
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:15,972
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

642
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,311
You're to meet an agent, NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

643
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:28,418
Tail number N182SL.

644
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:34,057
Final instructions will come from him.

645
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,293
-That's it.
-That's it.

646
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,463
After this, we go dark.

647
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,299
Radio silent.

648
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,135
You won't hear from me again...

649
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,004
...my daughter.

650
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,989
Forever and ever.

651
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,948
Have you heard from Orlov?

652
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,051
Yes. Last word was "go."

653
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,457
Chenkov.

654
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,594
Do you remember me?

655
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,167
Chenkov.

656
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,203
Did you miss me?

657
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,005
Shnaider?

658
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,878
How long have you been here?

659
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:48,251
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

660
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,154
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

661
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,224
Colonel Edward Tomas.

662
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,628
And you are my attaché.

663
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,496
Your ID.

664
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,499
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

665
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,569
More importantly, our mission.

666
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:11,407
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

667
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,177
That's where the president
needs to be.

668
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,517
How do we do it?

669
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:25,922
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job. I'll make sure he's there.

670
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,159
-What's my job?
-Do you remember, Chenkov...

671
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:34,096
...when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

672
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,032
Had to be the best at everything.

673
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:40,202
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

674
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,004
I remember.

675
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:45,541
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

676
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,548
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

677
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,296
IDs, please.

678
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,132
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

679
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,467
I'll check the side.

680
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,305
Control, this is Hayes.

681
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,342
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

682
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,743
Undercarriage is clean.

683
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,179
Back's clean.

684
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,683
Colonel. Major. All clear.

685
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,464
You know the drill, colonel.

686
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:46,102
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

687
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,238
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

688
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,744
Step through, please, sir.

689
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,016
Turn around.

690
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,087
Thank you.

691
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,294
-Step through. Arms out.
-Patience is key.

692
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,498
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

693
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,100
-What others?
-I don't know.

694
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:21,370
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

695
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:25,074
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

696
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,776
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

697
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,277
-Major Vicek.
-Pleasure.

698
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,347
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

699
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,618
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

700
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:39,221
-What can you tell us about her?
-We think she may be a Soviet plant...

701
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:45,127
...inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

702
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:49,398
A day marking the start of a large strike
against the U.S. and her allies.

703
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,208
This should be the president now.

704
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,313
You have a big job, Chenkov...

705
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,681
...but you can do it.

706
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,284
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

707
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,319
Home.

708
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,254
I'm going home.

709
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,127
-Down! Take cover!
-Get the president!

710
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,629
-A gun! He's got a gun!
-Get back!

711
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:23,265
Get back!

712
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,780
-Are you okay, sir?
-Yes.

713
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:40,516
-Goddamn it.
-Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

714
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,423
Help, over here!

715
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,861
Get a medic! Get a medic!

716
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,170
I think I saw her.

717
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,205
You saw who?

718
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,408
Salt.

719
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,211
I think I saw her in the corridor.

720
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,249
The other NATO officer.

721
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:17,753
She's here.

722
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,489
Check.

723
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:21,924
-Clear.
-Move.

724
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,726
Go!

725
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,529
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

726
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,798
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

727
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:34,370
This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.

728
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,407
If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.

729
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,376
This is not a drill.

730
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,245
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

731
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,483
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

732
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,919
If this was authorized
by the Russian government...

733
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:52,688
...it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

734
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:58,227
If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.

735
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,296
This is not a drill.

736
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,964
-Clear!
-Let's go, sir.

737
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,402
Alpha team!

738
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,674
Move, move.

739
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,676
Close it.

740
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,411
Close it.

741
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,421
Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

742
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,623
This is not a drill.

743
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,022
Go, go.

744
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,593
Geronimo approaching bunker door
in five seconds.

745
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,699
Clear.

746
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:19,908
Any chance she could follow?

747
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,311
My own men
couldn't get through that door.

748
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,980
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

749
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,486
Okay, go.

750
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,889
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

751
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,795
Geronimo secured.

752
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,359
-Get me Director Medford.
-Yes, sir.

753
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:14,063
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility...

754
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,099
...that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

755
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,469
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

756
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,072
Marion, what's the situation?

757
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,408
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

758
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,078
What you see there
represents temperature drops...

759
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,547
...in mobile missile units in Siberia.

760
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,551
It means the Russians
are deploying their missiles to the field.

761
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,354
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.

762
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,559
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

763
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,562
At least at our forward bases.

764
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,398
Do it.

765
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,834
And since the Russians
have deployed...

766
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,771
...we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

767
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,974
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

768
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,011
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

769
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,867
Sir.

770
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,973
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

771
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:33,909
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

772
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,745
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

773
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,983
Command, our eyes are down. We have
a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

774
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,085
Get out there now.

775
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,120
Seal this room.

776
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,857
Down that corridor. Secure it.

777
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,672
Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.

778
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:40,843
Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.

779
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:44,046
This is President Howard Lewis.

780
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:48,050
-Proceed with authentication.
-Yes, Mr. President.

781
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,257
-Ready to commence authentication.
-Zulu.

782
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:56,658
-Tango.
-Echo.

783
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:57,793
-Seven.
-Niner.

784
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,094
-Juliett.
-X-ray.

785
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,229
-Sierra.
-Seven.

786
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,563
-Alfa.
-Mike.

787
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,232
-Charlie.
-Whiskey.

788
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:04,600
-Five.
-Six.

789
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,803
-Tango.
-Authentication codes confirmed.

790
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,239
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

791
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,140
God be with you.

792
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:17,012
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

793
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,114
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

794
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,651
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

795
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,155
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

796
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,524
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

797
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,127
Officer Dryer, come in.

798
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:37,266
Federal Communication Commission is
activating the Emergency Alert System.

799
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,067
Who the hell's that?

800
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,838
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

801
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,740
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

802
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,275
Give me your side arm.

803
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:50,012
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

804
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,947
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

805
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,049
Protocol is protocol, sir.

806
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:57,185
And dead is dead.

807
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,721
Behind me!

808
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,791
I'm the national security advisor.

809
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,192
Not anymore.

810
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,168
Sit down.

811
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:17,673
Who are you?

812
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:21,076
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

813
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,880
And unless you do exactly as I say...

814
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,649
...I will be the last person
you will ever see.

815
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,958
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

816
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,659
Go to hell.

817
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,257
Selective attack options ready.

818
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,959
Ted?

819
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:16,198
Emergency action message
released by....

820
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,901
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

821
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,137
Why didn't you tell me?

822
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,975
I tried many times, but....

823
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,278
My loneliness was my only friend.

824
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:33,315
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

825
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,417
I was a class ahead, comrade.

826
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,986
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

827
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,056
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

828
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,991
Excuse me.

829
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:47,162
Selective attack targets acquired.

830
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,998
Tehran.

831
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,800
Mecca.

832
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,437
Mecca? Tehran?

833
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,305
Part two of our plan.

834
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:59,408
Kill nine million people.

835
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,743
Enrage a billion Muslims.

836
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,746
America will suffer a painful death.

837
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,184
Permissive action links initiated.

838
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,921
Missiles arming.

839
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,430
Nuclear command...

840
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,433
...posts airborne.

841
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,034
Let me join you.

842
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,305
ICBMs set to...

843
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:33,008
...maximum yield.

844
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,245
You know, when you first came
to Langley...

845
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,415
...I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

846
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,485
I didn't think I'd be able to...

847
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:47,255
...resist the temptation
to say something.

848
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,258
Then you met Mike and...

849
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,227
...well...

850
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,796
...things changed.

851
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,101
Let me join you.

852
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,473
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

853
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,948
Let me join you.

854
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,851
I want to be with you.

855
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:31,967
The man we thought was dead has
made a resurrection that is miraculous.

856
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,869
President Matveyev is alive.

857
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,104
We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing...

858
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,807
...are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev...

859
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,844
...arriving at the airport outside
of Moscow. This is astonishing.

860
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,148
According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death...

861
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,783
...is attributed to
a temporary paralysis...

862
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,353
...from a toxin
derived from spider venom.

863
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,857
A recap for those who may not have
been following the events of the day....

864
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,062
At least I was right.

865
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,369
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

866
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:11,406
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

867
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,875
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev...

868
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,510
...not fall in love with him.

869
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,014
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

870
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,585
By the way, how is Mike?

871
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,856
Orlov is dead.

872
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,429
Well, that's good news.

873
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,198
Saved me the trouble.

874
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:42,304
I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

875
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:47,542
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

876
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,114
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

877
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,318
I'm the patsy.

878
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,057
And I'm the hero.

879
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:06,595
Congratulations, Ev.

880
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,966
You're about to become famous.

881
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:44,666
Identity confirmation requested.

882
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,270
Identity confirmation requested.

883
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,652
Identity confirmation requested.

884
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,358
Identity confirmed.

885
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,411
Minuteman III ICBMs' batteries
up to power.

886
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,152
Authorization, 99 percent.

887
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,294
Go!

888
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,230
Permissive action links initiated.

889
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:26,101
Trident submarines
at firing readiness.

890
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:27,769
Permission to launch.

891
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,505
Permission to launch.

892
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,631
Get down on the floor, now!

893
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,767
I said now!

894
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,741
Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restored.

895
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,777
-Move, move, move!
-Show me your hands!

896
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,745
-Get down!
-What is your name, sir?

897
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:14,349
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

898
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,652
Mr. President.

899
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,456
Mr. President, can you hear me?

900
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,659
-Hold still.
-EMT's on the way.

901
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,095
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

902
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,663
She's wearing a vest.

903
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:31,800
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

904
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:33,601
And I want her alone in a room.

905
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,304
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

906
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:40,141
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

907
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,510
If we're gonna find these people,
we gotta do it.

908
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,813
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

909
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,849
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

910
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:49,717
Who did that?

911
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,822
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

912
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:04,299
No one comes through until
the president is secure. Step back.

913
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,634
-I'm Theodore Winter--
-Step back, sir. Please.

914
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,709
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

915
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,212
Are you okay?

916
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,381
Pretty good gash there.

917
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:23,184
Looks like you got a piece of glass
in there.

918
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:46,341
She killed someone else.

919
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,577
It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.

920
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:00,755
Check him. Check him!

921
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:02,624
Checking vitals.

922
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:05,627
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

923
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,485
Sit down.

924
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,322
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

925
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:36,791
-Give me your hands.
-Then she's the FBI's.

926
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:22,937
Hey.

927
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,640
Why'd you kill him?

928
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,442
Because somebody had to.

929
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:41,956
What?!

930
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,903
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

931
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,774
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

932
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:01,442
So did I.

933
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,811
We just didn't know what it was.

934
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:07,348
-Winter did.
-Winter?

935
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,420
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles...

936
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,489
...and you saved the world?

937
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:18,726
I would like you
to believe that, yeah.

938
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,030
That's a big accusation.

939
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,632
Well...

940
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,536
...he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

941
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:31,906
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

942
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,015
How many more like you are there?

943
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,418
Like me?

944
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,087
None.

945
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,356
Like him?

946
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,792
More than you or I can handle alone.

947
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:56,097
You really think
a trained Soviet agent...

948
01:28:56,431 --> 01:29:00,902
...couldn't kill the Russian president
at point-blank range if she wanted to?

949
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,408
Or you, for that matter.

950
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,411
I could've killed you at the funeral
and I didn't.

951
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:13,448
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

952
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:15,516
You know better.

953
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,720
I had a choice.

954
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,555
You know better.

955
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,944
If I did believe you...

956
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:46,914
...and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did...

957
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,618
...nobody else would.

958
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,490
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

959
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,403
They took everything from me.

960
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,840
I'll kill them.

961
