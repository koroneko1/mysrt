00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.110
My name is Q. I'm a high school student.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.840
When I was young, people always said that I was good-looking.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280
That's why my mom wanted me to become an actor.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.930
She let me participate in many competitions, and I won a lot of prizes.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.640
But I never won first place in anything.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.680
That's because my effort makes me a loser.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.170
However, in every life, there is a turning point.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.310
And this is the beginning that changes a loser like me.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.780
This is my mom.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.420
She used to be an accountant.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.570
Now, she sells baked goods online.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.660
Apart from my mom and me, there is Uncle Man.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.130
He is...

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.370
Shit!

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.950
my mom's brother, who's always here to help her bake.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.220
You little brat!

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.350
After you finish eating, go help Uncle Man put all these desserts in the car.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.660
Oh! After school, don't forget to go to my friend's office for an audition.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.800
She's looking for a leading man for the music video.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.150
You must go.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.200
Yes, Ma'am.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.620
Actually, I've been through so many auditions already.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.730
I never get the part.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.310
You have to be patient.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.980
If you can't wait, do you want to do the TikTok dance with me?

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.280
You can do that alone.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm not a good dancer like you.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.580
But I'm more handsome.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.580
Right...

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.110
Oh, Q. Do you know who Mook Beauty is?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.240
She's in the same school as you. Can you ask her to review my bakery products? Look!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.040
Look!

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260
This girl!

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.510
She's so famous!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.310
I look at all of her clips. I follow her too.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.060
- Can you ask her for a review?
- You guys are in the same school?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.000
I don't know.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.860
She doesn't look familiar to me.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.750
I'll ask Toy and Frank for you.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.260
That's great!

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.600
You should go to school now. Are you done? You'll be late.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080
Man, drop him off first and go to deliver this later.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.950
Let's go.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.020
(Congratulations)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.820
Hey!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.130
What are you staring at?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.260
This is my best friend. His name is Frank.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.200
He was the school representative for the national academic competition.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.080
Actually, it should be me.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.200
But...

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.800
(Mr. Pratchaya Pratchayakul)

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.770
Frank!

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.800
But I lost to him during the qualifying round.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.400
I lost again!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.200
(Frank)

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.480
Here we go again.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.330
I get to be the school representative! Be happy for me!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.420
Hello, Q!

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.910
Hello, Q.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.910
Q!

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.220
Q!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.040
What are you thinking about?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.800
This girl is in our school? Why don't I recognize her?

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.640
Where on earth have you been?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.600
She is so popular now.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.820
By the way, where's Toy? Is he here?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.750
Good morning!

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.040
This is Toy.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.440
He's good at sports. He can also play musical instruments.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.680
He's interested in everything except...

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.060
his studies.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.710
But that's not a problem because he's the only student under the sports quota for graduate studies.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.170
Actually, we are on the same sports team.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.860
Hello, you guys are here with me again, Mook, The Content Creator.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.020
Today, I'm going to show you my everyday makeup looks.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.620
This is Mook. She's a twelfth grader. She is also a 'net idol.'

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.280
She's so famous right now.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.110
She has like a million followers. She gets paid to review so many products.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.380
She's the face of our school.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.600
She is a twelfth grader?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.180
She looks like a graduate student.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.040
You're not the only one. I thought so, too, when I first watched her clip.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.800
But she looks totally different in real life.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.570
Actually...

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.750
she's really cute when you see her in person.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.500
What a pity.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.080
What for?

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.110
It's a pity you're not nominated to be the SSEAYP delegate.
(SSEAYP stands for Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Programme)

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.000
If you did, you would get to do a photoshoot with her.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.440
Exactly.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.510
Why didn't they choose me?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.660
It would be weird if you get it.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.170
The person who was chosen can speak English fluently.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.370
Also, you're not eighteen yet.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.950
Why did you suddenly ask about her? Is it because...

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.040
What the hell?

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.400
My mom is interested because she wants Mook to review her bakery products.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.820
I guess it will be hard to do that.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.280
You don't have enough money to hire her.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.820
Unless...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.500
Unless what?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.420
Why don't you hit on her? Maybe she will review the products for free.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.510
No way! She's not my type.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.130
What is your type then?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.350
I don't know.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.330
But if I meet the right person,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.820
my heart will tell me.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.130
Frank, give me a a vomit bag.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.060
Is it because she's older than you?

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.110
But I think dating an older woman is good.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.660
Older women are not whinny and silly.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.600
And also...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.860
They know how to please you.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.310
Frank!

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.350
You're exaggerating. She's only one year older.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.770
And you, Q. Do you think she would date a guy like you?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.110
She might like me if she sees my handsome face.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.420
Why am I so handsome?

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.020
Where did they go?

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.080
(Grade 12 / Room 2)

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.660
Have you finished your homework?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.600
Hello.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.510
I want to thank you.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.400
Oh, it's no big deal.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.620
You've helped our school by becoming the school representative for the PR campaign.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.000
I'm glad that I can help our school before I graduate.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.200
I saw the news that you won a Net Idol Rising Star award.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.110
Do you have to go to the awards ceremony?

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.750
Yes.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.570
But don't worry! I can assure you that it won't interrupt my studies.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.570
Oh no! I'm not worried about that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.280
By the way...

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.530
Nawapol is not here today?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.580
Why are you looking for him?

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.350
I want you to take him with you.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.220
I heard that the ceremony would be broadcast live on many platforms.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.970
You and Nawapol are our school representatives.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.680
I want you two to live stream or something.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.400
Say something about school, or maybe you can say thank you to our school on the stage.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.110
Oh! I see...

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.220
That's why.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:44.770
I will ask X. I mean, I'll ask Nawapol about it.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.660
Goodbye.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.170
Wait! Don't sit yet.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.060
Yes?

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.930
My child is a big fan of yours. So, can I take a selfie with you?

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.930
Oh! Of course.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.660
Sure.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.930
Alright.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.740
- Let's make the mini heart gesture.
- Okay! Sure!

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.400
Hey! Mook. What's up?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.750
You're free to come to class today?

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.400
I always come to class. But I guess you never noticed me.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.770
That's because I'm out of your sight.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.240
What am I supposed to say then?

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.220
Should I tell you that you're always in my heart?

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.220
Maybe you can try to say that.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.950
What are you taking pictures of? You're so concentrated.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.510
Oh, just random stuff.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.730
I might use these images when I join the SSEAYP delegates. 
(SSEAYP stands for Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Programme)

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.260
I see.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.280
Oh, right! I heard that you won an award, right?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.730
Yeah! I come to see you because of this.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.770
Yeah?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.860
I want to ask you to come with me.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.240
What? Why are you asking me? I'm not a net idol like you.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.240
If I go with you and your fans start to scream my name instead,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.640
you might lose confidence.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.740
Right! You're very handsome!

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.770
Actually, it's because of the principal. He wants us to continue with the PR campaign to promote our school.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.150
That's why I'm here to ask you...

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.140
Do you have time for me?

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.550
So, you want me to go with you because of the principal's request?

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.740
No! I was going to ask you anway.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.820
Do you want to come? It'll be fun to walk on the red carpet.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.640
Fine.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.340
When is it?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.970
Er... It's around three weeks from today.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.600
It will be on the 21st of next month.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.310
21st of next month.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.710
So, that means...

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.370
Toy.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.360
The class is over?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.680
Yeah!

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.110
Can you come with me?

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.120
I don't want to be alone while waiting for my turn to audition.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.040
How should we go there?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.750
Only one person can ride the pillion.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.080
You guys can go. I have an extra class after school.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.110
Frank!

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.640
You're ditching us!

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.310
All you care about is studying.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.620
Please come with me.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:48.510
We can go there by taxi and Toy can ride his own motorcycle.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.260
I'll treat you to a meal after I finish casting.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.330
I can't.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.110
My tutor is a graduate student. My mom already made an appointment with her.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.880
If I don't go, I will be doomed.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.080
Fine! It's up to you.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.680
Alright.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.220
I'll walk you out and wait for you to get a taxi.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.280
Let's go.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.460
As for you,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.570
you must come with me, Toy.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.530
It's not like I have a choice.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.980
You must come with me.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.980
I have to drop you off anyway.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.110
Taxi!

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.970
Hey!

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.770
He just cut in line!

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.820
Your mom already called me. Please wait here.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.990
There are a few people before you who come for casting as well.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.260
Are you here for casting too?

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.800
Oh, no. I'm not good at acting.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.350
Dude!

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.730
You've come to audition so often that they can remember your entire family now?

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.060
She's my mom's friend.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.620
Oh!

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.840
Actually, I've come here so many times already.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.800
But I couldn't get any job.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.130
By the way, what do you have to do in the audition?

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.970
- Introduce myself. 
- Aha!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.330
- Face the camera. 
- Aha!

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.840
- Turn from side to side.
- Aha!

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840
It depends on what they want me to do.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.660
Whoa! That's dope, man.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.930
I need to pee.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.860
- I'll be right back. 
- Alright.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.280
I'll leave my bag here.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.280
I'll look after it for you.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.040
Hey!

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.140
What the hell?

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.840
I'm all wet!

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.460
What are you looking at?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.150
You've never seen it?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.240
I have.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.040
But I've never seen one that is so...

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.140
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.800
Hey! Wait! We need to talk!

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.460
What are you doing down there?

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.280
Do you need my help?

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.660
Go away!

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.750
Were you unable to hold your pee? Or did you just forget to give it a few shakes?

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.340
You don't know what I had to go through.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.710
The person who got me into this mess

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.000
is that dude who stole Frank's taxi.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.350
Oh!

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.860
You mean X?

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.910
You know him?

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.370
You're the only one who doesn't know anything.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.280
Everyone in our school knows him.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.400
He's handsome.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.910
He's smart.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.220
Are you serious? Everyone knows him?

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.880
Yeah! He was on the photo shoot with Mook to promote our school.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.620
He's the delegate to join the Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.330
He can speak English fluently.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.110
Also... he walked past me just now.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.370
What happened? Did you bully him?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.400
I bullied him?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.710
Did you even consider that it might be him who bullied me?

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.200
Oho!

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.640
That could never happen. He's very polite.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.080
It's you! Don't try to deny it.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.220
Whatever! Help me solve this problem first. What should I do?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.680
Yes, I've arrived.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.680
You already told the tutor that I'm waiting, right?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.330
Her name is Mind. She's a medical student.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.880
She has my number, right?

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.420
Okay. I'll buy a drink for her.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.400
Alright. Okay.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.820
- Just a minute, sir. 
- Okay.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.150
Cocoa and green tea, 100 baht.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.220
Er...

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.930
I'm sorry, but this seat is already taken.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.800
Where am I supposed to sit then?

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.060
Eh? Why don't you sit somewhere else?

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.820
Can't you see my stuff is on the chair?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.620
Are you sure that you want me to sit somewhere else?

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.110
Yes, I'm sure. It's a logical thing to do.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.680
Do you know who I am?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.680
- Do I have to know who you are? 
- Exactly!

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.130
You don't know who I am, and I don't know who you are.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.730
What if the person that I have an appointment with comes? Where should she sit?

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.970
Fine! I won't sit. I will stand instead.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.900
You talk too much. Just give me that.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.200
What's wrong with you?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.530
Stop.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.860
Hello.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.440
Are you...

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.280
Frank?

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.620
Oh, yes.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.110
You are...

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.300
I'm sorry.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.400
Sit down.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.130
Okay.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.530
You have to finish it before someone comes in and sees us.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.400
What are you guys doing?

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.570
Q, hold your audition number and face the camera.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.130
And then I'll let you act with X.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.280
I guess both of you are familiar with each other since you two come from the same school.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.420
Thank you.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.550
If you're ready, Q can start a fight with X.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.480
The situation is like X takes a girl that you like out. You see them holding hands right in front of you.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.970
You can improvise. Okay?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.860
Of course. I'll give you my best shot.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.750
Hey!

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.770
How dare you? You're so happy, huh?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.680
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.540
I'm talking about...

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.820
Mook.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.420
You took her out yesterday!

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.260
You were holding hands while crossing the streets. Did you think no one would see you?

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.950
Oh...

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.840
Holding hands while crossing the streets?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.730
What's wrong with that?

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.940
It's a normal thing to do.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.400
So, you finally admit it!

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.710
Mook is my girlfriend!

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.540
You're humiliating me by doing that.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.400
A person like you...

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.370
You like to assume things, don't you?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.400
You're so angry just because you saw me holding her hands.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.880
If you see me hug her

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.330
or kiss her cheek,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.460
I guess you will...

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.040
How dare you!

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.640
You hugged and kissed her too?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.550
That's right.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.820
I did that right in front of her mother too.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.820
How could you do that in front of her mother?

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.350
I could do that.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.200
Because...

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.280
she's only three years old.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.530
I don't think you should have a girlfriend who's that young.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.440
Three years old?

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.840
Er... Well...

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.880
Okay, cut! That's enough.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.370
X, you're so good! I mean, both of you did well.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.660
Will you let go of my hand?
