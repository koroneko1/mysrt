00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,462
<i>Michelle,
please don't hang up.</i>

3
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:28,567
<i>Just talk to me, okay? I
can't believe you just left.</i>

4
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,969
<i>Michelle.</i>

5
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,171
<i>Come back.</i>

6
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,742
<i>Please say something.</i>

7
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,479
<i>Michelle, talk to me.</i>

8
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,547
<i>Look, we had an argument.
Couples fight.</i>

9
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,618
<i>That is no reason to just
leave everything behind.</i>

10
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,256
<i>Running away isn't gonna help it any.
Michelle, please...</i>

11
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,164
<i>More details on that.</i>

12
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,733
<i>Elsewhere today, power has
still not been restored</i>

13
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,335
<i>to many cities on
the Southern seaboard</i>

14
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,038
<i>in the wake of this afternoon's
widespread blackout.</i>

15
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,440
<i>While there had been some
inclement weather in the region,</i>

16
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,142
<i>the problem seems linked to
what authorities are calling</i>

17
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:14,446
<i>a catastrophic power surge that
has crippled traffic in the area.</i>

18
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,340
No.

19
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,945
No!

20
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,061
Damn.

21
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,448
Okay. Okay, please.

22
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,183
Please.

23
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,986
Please don't hurt me.

24
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,221
Please.

25
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,128
Just let me go, okay?
I won't tell anybody.

26
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,232
I promise, okay? Please
just let me go. Please.

27
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,837
You need fluids.
You were in shock.

28
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,542
What are you going
to do to me?

29
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,913
I'm going to
keep you alive.

30
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,924
Work on getting handy
with these.

31
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,632
My boyfriend
was expecting me.

32
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,235
He'll send the cops looking.

33
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,870
I'm sorry.

34
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,073
But no one is looking
for you.

35
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,731
You've got some fight in you.

36
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,635
I can respect that.

37
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,273
But don't even think
about trying that again.

38
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,343
You're lucky
to be here at all.

39
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:16,881
And my generosity
only extends so far.

40
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,018
Eggs.

41
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,454
Toradol to help
with your pain.

42
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,024
Please.

43
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,226
Please, just let me go.
Please.

44
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,062
There is nowhere
to go, Michelle.

45
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,301
I looked through your wallet.

46
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:40,238
Given as how i saved your life,
i think that's acceptable.

47
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,874
You're lucky
to be here at all.

48
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,109
What do you mean?

49
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:50,214
I found you, and I saved your
life by bringing you here.

50
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,551
I don't understand. I...

51
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,665
There's been an attack.

52
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,536
What?

53
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,005
An attack. A big one.

54
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,842
I'm not sure yet
if it's chemical or nuclear,

55
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,011
but down here,
we're safe.

56
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:25,183
And where are we exactly?
Underneath my farmhouse.

57
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,786
Forty miles outside
of lake Charles.

58
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,123
I was driving north of here.

59
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,659
You were in an accident.

60
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,229
You were turned over
on the side of the road.

61
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,733
I was driving by
and I saw...

62
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,902
I saved your life,
Michelle.

63
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,639
I couldn't just
leave you there.

64
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,310
Okay.

65
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,278
Well,

66
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,115
thank you so much

67
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,684
for saving my life.

68
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,021
I guess I should go
to a hospital now.

69
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,825
You can't leave.

70
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,964
An attack means fallout.

71
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,600
Which contaminates
the air above ground.

72
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,035
That's how it works.

73
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,037
How long do we have to wait
until it's safe?

74
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,773
Depends on the proximity
of the closest blast.

75
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,974
One year, maybe two.

76
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:29,013
And that's if we're talking
about weapons that we know of.

77
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,715
Russians are developing
some nasty stuff.

78
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,052
And if the martians finally
figured out a way to get here,

79
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:39,891
their weapons will make the russkies'
look like sticks and stones.

80
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,362
Luckily,

81
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,298
I've prepared for this.

82
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,506
Right.

83
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,709
Well, I'll need to use
your phone then

84
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,213
to call my family and tell
them that I'm safe here

85
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,549
and make sure they're okay.

86
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,251
Michelle, they're not okay.

87
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,456
How do you know that?

88
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,994
Everyone outside of here
is dead.

89
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,572
But what about you?
Don't you have a family?

90
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,144
Who's that?

91
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,513
Excuse me.

92
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,622
What did you do?

93
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:01,205
You know what, Michelle? I'm
gonna tell you what I told him.

94
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,707
You need to eat,
you need to sleep,

95
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:07,545
and you need to start showing me
a little bit of appreciation.

96
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,050
My name is Howard,
by the way.

97
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,133
Oh, god! Oh, shit.

98
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,468
I'm sorry.

99
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,806
I'm sorry about that.

100
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,842
Uh, I didn't mean to
scare you.

101
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,844
Are you, um...

102
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,513
Here. You hungry?

103
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,654
So, how are you doing?
You okay?

104
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,991
What is this?
It's a bunker.

105
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:32,663
Your room's a little bit of a
fixer-upper, but at least you got a door.

106
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,933
A scary door,
but you still got a door.

107
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,836
How long have you
been down here?

108
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,438
Couple of days, I think.

109
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,839
You know, it's actually
kind of hard to tell

110
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:46,043
with no windows or
sunlight or anything.

111
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,946
I mean,
how do we get out of here?

112
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,983
Oh, he didn't tell you?

113
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,118
About...

114
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,224
Getting out of here is the
last thing you want to do.

115
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,793
Because the air up there,

116
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,462
it's contaminated.

117
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,965
I see
you've met Emmett.

118
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,503
What happened to him?

119
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,838
He did that to himself.

120
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,841
And his stumbling around
isn't helping anything.

121
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:17,908
What you heard earlier,

122
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,413
was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week's worth of food,

123
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:25,149
which he's sorry for,
correct?

124
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,919
Totally.

125
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,726
Let's go. Bathroom time.

126
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,707
This is
the common area.

127
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,808
Good for r & r.

128
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,778
As you can see, I've
planned for a long stay.

129
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,982
The aquaponics system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh.

130
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,652
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

131
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:06,857
If you like to watch films, i have
some on DVD and vhs cassette.

132
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:11,462
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

133
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,397
The kitchen's
fully functional.

134
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:18,636
Has an electric stove,
refrigerator, freezer, silverware.

135
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,438
And that table's
a family heirloom,

136
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,039
which means
watch your glasses.

137
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,976
Always use coasters
and placemats.

138
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,146
Keep your hands
to yourself!

139
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,817
Understand?

140
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,086
No touching.

141
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,088
Take a seat.

142
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,161
This way.

143
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,853
This is my private space.

144
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:13,023
Off-limits, unless
i give express permission.

145
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,092
Go ahead.

146
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,063
I don't need to.
You will, though.

147
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:23,000
And I've got to pace these
things out, so please.

148
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,270
I need privacy.

149
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,140
You're welcome
to close the curtain.

150
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,478
I can't with you
standing there.

151
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,882
And I can't trust you
not to burn this place down.

152
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,384
This is for my own safety.

153
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,388
I'm not some pervert!
Just go.

154
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,005
Don't flush
unless you've gone!

155
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,607
We can't afford
wasted flushes.

156
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,852
Take a seat.
Are you hungry?

157
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,493
Those are Megan's.

158
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:26,464
She never went anywhere without
two or three of those things.

159
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,965
Who's Megan?

160
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,801
Megan's not with us anymore.

161
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,243
Don't worry.
Just the generator.

162
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,515
Maybe it's a car outside.

163
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,952
That's not possible.

164
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,187
I heard one earlier.
Above my room.

165
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:53,958
If you had heard a car, the
driver would be long dead by now.

166
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,559
Well, shouldn't we
at least try

167
00:24:55,561 --> 00:25:00,397
to call the police or someone to
find out what actually happened?

168
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,166
There's no one left to call.

169
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,135
See that?
Nothing's coming through.

170
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,044
You think I sound crazy.

171
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,084
I mean, it's amazing.
You people...

172
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,553
You wear helmets
when you ride your bikes.

173
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,822
You have seat belts
in your cars.

174
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,924
You have alarm systems
to protect your homes.

175
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:30,127
But what do you do
when those alarms go off?

176
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:35,933
"Crazy" is building your ark after
the flood has already come!

177
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,577
I think maybe it's time
you met frank and Mildred.

178
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,458
Closest I could get
to an airlock.

179
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,889
See?

180
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,394
What happened to them?

181
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,930
They weren't
as lucky as you.

182
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,131
It's the air, Michelle.

183
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,267
That's what happens
when you get exposed.

184
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:37,721
I keep this door sealed
at all times.

185
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,561
No one comes in or out.

186
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,375
Met frank
and Mildred, huh?

187
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,246
It's funny, right?

188
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:02,980
The whole world ends

189
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:07,051
and the thing he's most upset
about is a pair of dead pigs?

190
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,055
You in need of some
reading material?

191
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,657
I took all the quizzes.
Sorry.

192
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,268
But I did learn
how to do a French braid, so,

193
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,872
you know, if you want me to do
that for you, just let me know.

194
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,680
What do you know about him?

195
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,618
He was in the Navy,
i know that.

196
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,090
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

197
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,926
What kind of stuff?

198
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,395
Satellite stuff.

199
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,898
Well, what brought him
out here?

200
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm not sure.

201
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,604
He bought this property
a while back.

202
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,972
But I never paid
much attention

203
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,843
till he hired me to help him
get this place set up.

204
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:11,081
The work was entertaining,
though, that's for sure.

205
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:15,753
You know, Howard's like a black
belt in conspiracy theory.

206
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,089
Plus, you know, how often do
you get hired to help build

207
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,225
a doomsday bunker?

208
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,293
So, he didn't

209
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,163
kidnap you?

210
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,899
No!

211
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,369
What about your arm?
Weren't you trying to escape?

212
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,371
I was trying to get in.

213
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,409
I watched Howard build this
place, piece by piece, for years.

214
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,278
He was always talking about,

215
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,847
you know,
possible attacks from

216
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,084
al qaeda, Russia,
south Korea.

217
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,185
You mean north Korea.

218
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,587
Is that the crazy one?

219
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,657
So, yeah, that one.

220
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,527
And, uh, you know, poured all
his money into this place.

221
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,696
Took to it like his life
depended on it.

222
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,966
Which, you know,

223
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,235
that stays with you.

224
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,474
So...

225
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,178
He told you all this

226
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,748
while you're building
his bomb shelter.

227
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,316
And now he says that

228
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:23,053
the air is contaminated
and everybody's dead.

229
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:27,357
Yeah, I know what you're getting
at, but there's more to it.

230
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,226
Howard abducted me.

231
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,064
He drove me off the road
and he dragged me here.

232
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,769
So, whatever he's telling you
about the air, some big attack,

233
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,939
the purpose of this shelter,
is a lie.

234
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,740
No. No way.

235
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,810
The attack,
i saw it myself.

236
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,712
What do you mean?

237
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,915
I was on my way
home from work.

238
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,586
And it looked like a flash.

239
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,788
Bright red.

240
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,091
Like an explosion,
from way far off.

241
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,595
It wasn't like fireworks.

242
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,533
Naw, this was more like something
you'd read about in the Bible.

243
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,906
So, what, you saw, what,
a flash of light? Lightning?

244
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,709
A fire that flared up?

245
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:19,676
I'm not explaining it right.

246
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,646
This wasn't like anything
I'd ever seen.

247
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,982
And so, my first thought
was to come here.

248
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:28,352
And when I got here,
Howard was closing the door.

249
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,988
And I could see it,
right there on his face,

250
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,390
he knew something
was happening.

251
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,659
Something bad.

252
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,063
And so, I fought my way in.

253
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,005
I heard a car.

254
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,309
Right here. Above us.

255
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,281
You heard someone?

256
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,149
Right above us.

257
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,088
That isn't possible.

258
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,992
The air is...
What, contaminated?

259
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:12,863
How do you know that?
Because I told him.

260
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,667
Dinner's ready.

261
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,151
I see you two
are getting along.

262
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,473
Hmm.

263
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,785
How's that sauce?

264
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,354
It's fine.

265
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,090
As cooks go, I'm okay.

266
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,059
Not great, but okay.

267
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,695
Megan was a good cook.

268
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,132
You'll learn to love cooking.

269
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,073
Mmm...

270
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,075
Mmm.

271
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,544
It's delicious.

272
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:37,481
That's the best sauce
I've ever tasted.

273
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,316
Are you being funny?

274
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,717
No, I mean,

275
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,387
considering the alternative,
which is, you know,

276
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:47,991
getting burnt up in a
chemical attack, or nuclear,

277
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:51,028
I'd say being alive
and down here would

278
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,164
make a fried turd taste
pretty good, so...

279
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,634
Best damn sauce I ever had.

280
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,671
That's not a bad point.

281
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,574
And, please,
watch your language at table.

282
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,978
Right?

283
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,784
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason?

284
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,386
Ever since
i got down here.

285
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,356
Tattoos.

286
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,491
Always wanted one.

287
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,226
But I never got any.
'Cause everybody always said,

288
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,797
"no, no, Emmett, you'll never get
a decent job if you do that."

289
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:27,998
Whatever.

290
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,333
Like that matters now,
right?

291
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,536
Tell you what, if I had
known this was coming,

292
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:36,139
I would've gotten, like,
50 of them. I swear, man.

293
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,975
I would look like a circus
freak, or something.

294
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,243
I'd just be covered
head to toe.

295
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,779
Tattoos all over my...
You know, everywhere. Face?

296
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,483
Sure. Right there.
Across my forehead.

297
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,553
Just my name. "Emmett."

298
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,822
Or, you know,

299
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,357
"thug life."

300
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,058
"Yolo."

301
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,892
I don't even know
what that means,

302
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,828
but, you know, I hear people
saying it all the time,

303
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,863
so, it must be cool.

304
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,735
Hey, what about you,
Howard?

305
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,274
Anything you wish
you'd done?

306
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,813
In all honesty, no.

307
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,182
No?

308
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,886
No crazy nights in Vegas?

309
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,357
Maybe, uh,
take a pilgrimage to waco?

310
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,995
Everything I wanted to do,
i did.

311
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,698
I focused on being prepared.

312
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,333
And I was.

313
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,402
And here we are.

314
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,449
Oh, my goodness.

315
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,384
Is that <i>monopoly?</i>

316
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,720
There we go!

317
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,488
Yeah, that's how
we kill the time.

318
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,824
What would you say, Howard,
we're gonna be down here,

319
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,827
what, like, a year?
Two? Maybe?

320
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,529
I bet you if we started
a game right now,

321
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,098
we might even get halfway
finished by the time...

322
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,666
Stop talking!

323
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:20,343
You don't need to make jokes about
how long we're going to be down here

324
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,780
when nobody knows
how long that's going to be.

325
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,715
Your humor is not funny.

326
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,118
I don't appreciate it
while I'm trying to eat,

327
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,052
and neither does Michelle.

328
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:33,156
Now, please shut up
and let us eat in peace.

329
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,717
Hmm.

330
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,485
Emmett?

331
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,056
Would you pass me a napkin?

332
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,331
Thank you.

333
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:18,802
I know what you're saying.
I never could finish <i>monopoly.</i>

334
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:22,172
That game really
does take forever, right?

335
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,075
For me, though,
it was, um...

336
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,277
<i>Chutes and ladders,</i>

337
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,945
uh...

338
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,847
<i>Sorry!,</i>

339
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,748
and <i>trouble.</i>

340
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,051
You know, the thing with the dice
and the thing that you pressed,

341
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,653
what was that called?
The...

342
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:39,022
Pop-o-matic bubble! Yeah.

343
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:42,025
Did you ever play that, um...
What was that, <i>operation?</i>

344
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,660
Loved <i>operation!</i>
I'm telling you, man,

345
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:44,794
I couldn't play that game.

346
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:45,495
It terrified me.
Why...

347
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:49,266
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge. I mean...

348
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,402
Good lord!
It was pretty scary.

349
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,604
Could you hand me the salt?

350
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,509
Please?

351
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,982
Ah, shoot! I'm sorry.

352
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,085
I'm gonna need
the pepper also.

353
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,128
What exactly do you think
you're doing?

354
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:18,962
I'm asking for pepper.

355
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,196
Like hell you were!
What was that?

356
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,098
I don't know what you're
talking about, Howard.

357
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,867
Are you trying to insult me?

358
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:28,338
Here, in the shelter that I
built that's keeping you alive?

359
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,608
You don't think I see
what you just did?

360
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,844
Is that how you thank me
for saving your life?

361
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,346
Howard, calm down.
Shut up!

362
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:39,249
Shut up and
stay in your seat!

363
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,990
Is it?

364
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,159
Now, let me tell you,

365
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,961
I know what a traitor
looks like.

366
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,697
Understand?

367
00:38:54,498 --> 00:39:00,170
I have shown you nothing, but
generosity and hospitality.

368
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,641
I want you to apologize.

369
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,878
To tell me
you're going to behave.

370
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,183
I will.

371
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,154
You will what?

372
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,393
I'll behave.

373
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,697
And I'm so sorry.

374
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,536
Sit.

375
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,854
Ah...

376
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,161
Have to stay hydrated.

377
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,630
Hmm.

378
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,637
That's easy to forget
down here.

379
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,479
What's wrong?

380
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,249
Nothing.

381
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,327
Where are my keys?

382
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,207
Michelle!

383
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,049
Michelle! Stop!

384
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,297
Give me those keys!

385
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,767
Come on.
No! Don't!

386
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,545
Stop!

387
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,684
No! No, don't! Don't!

388
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:29,252
Don't open that door!

389
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,457
There's a car!

390
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,694
There's a car! I see a car! No!

391
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,863
Here! Here! Here!

392
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:43,466
Michelle,
listen to me, don't do this!

393
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,671
Oh, god! Thank god!

394
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,708
- There's a woman.
- Open the door!

395
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,944
It's okay.
I just want to come inside.

396
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,447
She looks hurt.
She wants me to let her in.

397
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,816
Do not let her in!

398
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:03,019
Look at her face, Michelle!
No!

399
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,689
No, no, no!

400
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:07,657
No!

401
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:10,593
Oh, my god, I'm fine.
I really am fine.

402
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,762
No, please, I'm okay.
There's...

403
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:16,366
It really only... It only
touched me a little. A little!

404
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,769
So, could you
open the door? Open it!

405
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:22,906
She's begging me.
You can't help her!

406
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:23,907
No one can!

407
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,542
Let me in. I'll be okay.

408
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:29,712
I'll be okay. It really
hardly touched me at all.

409
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,882
- Open the door!
- Don't listen to her!

410
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,619
God! Open the door,
you bitch!

411
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,354
Let me in!

412
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,624
Let me in! Let me in!

413
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,060
Let me in! Let me in!

414
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,530
You!

415
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,134
You! You! You!

416
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,536
You!

417
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,299
I know it's hard,

418
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,337
realizing they're all gone.

419
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,474
The ones you love.

420
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,086
I have something
to confess to you.

421
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,423
I crashed into your car.

422
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,325
Your accident

423
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,629
was my fault.

424
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,800
When I found out about
the incoming attack,

425
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,801
I got frantic.

426
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,871
I knew I needed to get back
here as soon as possible,

427
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,974
so I was driving
like a maniac.

428
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,580
I tried to pass you,

429
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,315
and

430
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,086
I'm the reason
you went off the road.

431
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,758
I mean, I know I seem
like a sensible guy,

432
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,228
but at the time,
i wasn't myself.

433
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,400
It was an accident,
but it was my fault.

434
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,537
I was afraid to tell you,

435
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,806
and,

436
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,309
I'm sorry.

437
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,219
Um...

438
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,421
You should shower.

439
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:53,022
Even the smallest
amount of air

440
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,859
that came through the hinges
could be toxic.

441
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,163
These were Megan's.

442
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,899
If you want.

443
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,572
I recognized
that woman's car.

444
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:12,408
Her name was Leslie,
i think.

445
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,145
You knew her?

446
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,081
She was a neighbor.

447
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,751
Emmett wasn't the only one
who knew about this place.

448
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:26,689
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here, too.

449
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,396
As of Friday, kindness and
generosity are antiquated customs.

450
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,005
I'm going to need
some stitches.

451
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,283
What? You want me to...

452
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,586
This is your doing,
isn't it?

453
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,821
I mean, I don't think
I'm really qualified.

454
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:01,190
I'll walk you through it.

455
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,362
Here.

456
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,100
Have a drink.

457
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,371
What is it?

458
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,075
Technically, it's vodka.

459
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,515
Ah! It's safe.
I distilled it myself.

460
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:35,691
I just said I distilled it,

461
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,960
I didn't say anything about it
actually tasting good.

462
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,063
Yeah, that's awful.
You want it on the rocks?

463
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,402
Little trick I taught myself
as a young man

464
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,172
stationed on a ship
with way too much free time.

465
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,842
Every now and again, if the C.O.
was working us too hard,

466
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,544
we'd freeze and snap
the knob off

467
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:57,647
the bathroom door
while he was still inside.

468
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,217
It usually took him an hour
or two to get out.

469
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,190
I'm good.
Suit yourself. Cheers.

470
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,327
Ah...

471
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,834
This is clean.

472
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,703
All you need to do
is stitch.

473
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,927
You're doing fine.

474
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,166
Some stuff
i grabbed from your car.

475
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:54,170
I didn't have time
to bring in the booze. Sadly.

476
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,675
What is all that?

477
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,580
I wanted to design clothes.

478
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:07,783
No wonder you were so good
with the stitches.

479
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,221
Megan wanted
to be an artist.

480
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,559
She was your daughter?

481
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,227
Yes.

482
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,400
She was smart.

483
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,304
Loved to read. The magazines
were just for fun.

484
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:31,474
She inhaled books.
Anything with Paris.

485
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:35,244
She liked their movies,
their culture, you know.

486
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,345
We used to
have this little joke.

487
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,547
Every once in a while
I'd ask her,

488
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:41,584
"what do you want to be
when you grow up?"

489
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,153
You know what she'd say?

490
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,556
"French."

491
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,895
Anyway, her mother
turned her against me.

492
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,331
Took her off to Chicago.

493
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,401
People are strange creatures.

494
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:03,172
You can't always convince them that
safety is in their own best interest.

495
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,476
You don't know they're gone.

496
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:13,382
Anyway, at least
i tried to help them.

497
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,093
Hey.

498
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,965
There was nothing you
could've done for that woman.

499
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,635
Even if you let her in,
she still would've died.

500
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:42,278
You asked earlier
about regrets?

501
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,282
Yeah, I've got
some of those.

502
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,491
Welcome to the club.

503
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:02,365
I mean, I lived my life
in a 40-mile radius.

504
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:07,236
And that was by design.
I made sure that happened.

505
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,772
I was so fast
in high school,

506
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,342
I even managed to outrun
my bad grades.

507
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,916
I was all-state track
three years in a row.

508
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:26,956
Caught a full ride to Louisiana
tech, up there in ruston.

509
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,662
I remember I spent the last
two weeks of that summer

510
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:39,035
showing off the bus ticket they sent
me to anybody who'd take a look at it.

511
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:43,739
And then came the night before
i was supposed to leave.

512
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,378
And I just got so worried

513
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,117
about how bad I was
gonna do up there

514
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,553
with all those smart kids.

515
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,292
So, I went out of my way

516
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,795
to get just piss-wasted
so bad

517
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:10,299
that I knew there was no chance
I was waking up in the morning.

518
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,271
So, I missed the bus.

519
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,775
And I didn't buy a ticket
for the next one.

520
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,278
Or the one after that.

521
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:27,750
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.

522
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,252
Yeah,
lucky me, right?

523
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,323
Lucky us.

524
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,865
A few years ago,

525
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,468
I was at a hardware store.

526
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,672
And there was this little girl
with her dad.

527
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,909
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.

528
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,178
So, he kept

529
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,181
yanking on her arm.

530
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,485
But really hard, you know?

531
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,154
Too hard.

532
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,960
I know that feeling.

533
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,098
When my dad got that way,

534
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,903
my brother Colin was always
there to take the worst of it

535
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,005
for me.

536
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,609
And I thought,
seeing this little girl,

537
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:30,946
I thought maybe
i could do that

538
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,115
for her.

539
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,288
But I just kept watching.

540
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:44,293
And they're about to leave,
and I've done nothing.

541
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,999
And she slips.

542
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,336
And it throws him off-balance,
and he hits her.

543
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,141
And I wanted so badly
to do something

544
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,809
to help her, but...

545
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:04,480
I did what I always do
when things get hard.

546
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,084
I just panicked and ran.

547
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,725
Look, we're here.

548
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,061
We're alive.

549
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,097
And that means something.

550
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,569
It's gotta.

551
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:02,097
You've got to be kidding me.
What?

552
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,166
We're missing pieces here.

553
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:09,071
Look at this poor cat. He's been deformed.
He's got one eye.

554
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,775
He's about to go snorkeling
and everything, too.

555
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,545
What are you doing?

556
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:21,483
Ooh!

557
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,953
Cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

558
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:25,621
Mmm-hmm.

559
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:27,923
You need more
axes and chain saws.

560
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,825
For what?
She has a shotgun.

561
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,761
Yeah. But what if
up there it's like...

562
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,497
What? Lumberjacks?

563
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,832
Zombies.

564
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,102
Though even Howard doesn't
think that one's plausible.

565
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:44,073
But you should hear his theory
about mutant space worms.

566
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,646
What is that? Howard!

567
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:53,282
Stay calm. We're okay.

568
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,657
What was that?
Quiet.

569
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,496
That sounds like
helicopters.

570
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:09,431
Could be military.

571
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,966
But not ours.

572
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:14,470
How can you tell?
Fourteen years in the Navy.

573
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:16,572
What's happening up there?

574
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,173
My guess?

575
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:22,177
Those flashes that
kicked this all off?

576
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,113
That was phase one.

577
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:27,015
Take out your opponent's
population centers

578
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:30,552
with big hits,
all at once, fast.

579
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,855
And then for round two,

580
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:33,756
ground sweeps.

581
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:38,293
A satellite log showed an increase
in coded traffic recently.

582
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,896
Possibly
extraterrestrial signals.

583
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:44,233
I bet what we just heard
were airborne patrols

584
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:48,103
sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life.

585
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,472
Like us.

586
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,414
Okay. Oh, boy.

587
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,315
That's bad.

588
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,356
And that's worse.

589
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,092
What's up there?

590
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,761
Air filtration system.

591
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,863
I can't...

592
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,533
Something blocking
the hatch.

593
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:23,772
If we can't get it back on, we're
gonna run out of breathable air fast.

594
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,949
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

595
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:34,650
Reach what?

596
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:37,653
The filtration system. Through
there, the main duct.

597
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:41,490
Someone needs to get in there
and restart it.

598
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:45,861
Give me a hand.

599
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:48,297
Let me go. She's not gonna
know her way around the unit.

600
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,200
You won't fit. Plus your arm.
She'll be fine.

601
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:56,104
Now, to restart the unit,
you just swing the handle off,

602
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,941
then on, off, then on.

603
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,543
That should do it.

604
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:07,749
And neither of us will be able to go
in and help you if you get stuck.

605
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,821
Don't get stuck.

606
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,430
Michelle!

607
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:57,199
Everything okay up there?

608
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,602
It looks like a dead end.

609
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:01,603
That's the incline.

610
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:05,274
Climb up that and
you're almost there.

611
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,378
Ah, this sucks.

612
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,711
<i>What's wrong?</i>

613
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,013
Howard.

614
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,116
He lied,
he lied about Megan.

615
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,886
What do you mean?

616
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,989
I think he did
something horrible to her.

617
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,794
No, his family moved
to Chicago years ago.

618
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,098
What's this?

619
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,469
Is that blood?

620
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,671
Here, come with me.

621
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,749
Wait, that...
That's not Megan.

622
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:02,584
What do you mean?

623
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:04,152
Yeah. Her name is Brittany.
I remember her.

624
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:07,355
She went to high school
with my little sister.

625
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,890
She...

626
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:12,461
She went missing.
Two years back.

627
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:13,795
It was on the news
and everything.

628
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:16,665
Most people just thought
she skipped town.

629
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,869
There was a message
up there.

630
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:21,970
It said "help."

631
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:24,906
It was scratched
on the inside of the window.

632
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,341
And this earring...

633
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,210
This earring was with it.

634
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,980
Did she ever show back up
after she went missing?

635
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:38,220
He said to me... He said to my
face, that this was his daughter.

636
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,555
He said this was Megan.

637
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,283
He took her
and he killed her.

638
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:18,193
All right,
let's just think.

639
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,463
Maybe we take away
his gun.

640
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,533
Tie him up, get him to confess
to whatever it is he's done.

641
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:27,302
Confess to who?
The police?

642
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:32,674
Look, like I said, we can't
be the only survivors, right?

643
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:34,910
The woman, she was able
to get around, right?

644
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:35,911
At least a little.

645
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,379
Yeah, until she died.

646
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:40,382
Directly above us,
making choking noises.

647
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:41,216
Of all the people
to save us...

648
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:44,452
Now, that was
a great example of teamwork.

649
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:48,190
Very well done.
I feel like some music.

650
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:53,295
Problem solving always
puts me in a musical mood.

651
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,433
Michelle,

652
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,403
you should go shower,
just in case.

653
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:04,906
Sure.

654
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,615
I think I might
have an idea.

655
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,387
"Ten better ways
to style my bangs"?

656
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,122
No, not the article. This.

657
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:58,426
I think I can only make
one, but it's a start.

658
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,095
No kidding.

659
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,565
<i>What are you doing up?
I didn't wake you up yet.</i>

660
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,533
<i>Well, I'm fixing
your breakfast.</i>

661
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,636
<i>One egg over medium.</i>

662
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:09,137
Hey, Howard.

663
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:13,208
What is this? You re-watching
<i>sixteen candles?</i>

664
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,342
<i>Pretty in pink.</i>

665
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:19,314
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?

666
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:20,148
No.

667
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,350
No, I'm just
grabbing some water.

668
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,119
Say, um...

669
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,589
You know, I was
just thinking...

670
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:06,127
Not that I'm trying to tell you how
to run this place or anything.

671
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:09,497
I'm just a little curious.

672
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:12,467
Michelle...

673
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:17,172
Say, how close do you think she
got to that air filtration unit?

674
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:18,573
You think she touched it?

675
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:22,277
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she touched it.

676
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,748
Well, I know she cleaned up
after and everything,

677
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,216
but I'm just thinking,

678
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:32,387
given that unit filters god knows
what through from outside,

679
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:36,491
if she tracked anything back in with
her, it'd be pretty concentrated.

680
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:40,395
And, I mean, it could be all
over the shower and the sink

681
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,931
in your bathroom,
right now.

682
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,902
Anyway, it's just a thought.

683
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,794
Not bad so far,
partner.

684
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:23,164
If Howard finds this,
he's gonna kill us.

685
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,936
All right, so, we get
the gun away from him.

686
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:32,073
All right. We tie him up, make
sure he isn't going anywhere.

687
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,310
And then one of us just

688
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,180
goes out and looks for help.

689
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:51,960
Um...

690
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:54,596
First word.

691
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,898
Uh...

692
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,199
Tiny.

693
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,835
Small. Pygmy. Um...

694
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,704
Little.
Yep! Mmm-hmm.

695
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:05,273
All right, uh,
second word.

696
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,277
Ooh! Michelle is a...

697
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,414
A girl.

698
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,152
A girl. A child. Um...

699
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,390
A girl.

700
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,593
No, she's older,
see, so she is a...

701
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,431
"Little Princess"?

702
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,606
Um... no, it was woman.

703
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,542
Um, <i>little women.</i>

704
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,179
Wow. Little woman.

705
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:52,987
Next time, try being
a little more specific.

706
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,892
Let's see here.

707
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,439
I'm always watching.

708
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,708
Always.

709
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,150
Um...

710
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:23,985
God.

711
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,287
I go wherever I want.

712
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:29,123
Uh...

713
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,592
I mean...
Well, I don't know.

714
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:34,262
I know what you're doing.
I see what you're doing.

715
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,265
Um...

716
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:39,234
I know what you're up to.

717
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,670
Look, Howard, I don't know
what you're getting at, but...

718
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,772
I see you
when you're sleeping.

719
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:49,010
I know what you're doing,
and I'm always watching.

720
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:52,113
Always watching!
I'm always watching!

721
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:53,715
Santa claus!

722
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:57,619
You're Santa claus.

723
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,824
Yeah, Michelle,
that's great.

724
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,260
Except it was
Emmett's turn.

725
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:06,628
Sorry, I just got
a little excited.

726
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,197
Yeah, well,
I'm keeping that point.

727
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,899
Totally. You earned it.

728
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,558
Emmett?

729
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,142
Hey.

730
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,078
I need your help
with something.

731
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,482
Sure.

732
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:07,989
You.

733
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,058
On deck.

734
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,011
What is this?

735
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,512
The barrel.

736
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,716
What's in it?

737
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,385
Move it into the bathroom.

738
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:49,397
This is
perchloric acid.

739
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,034
Do either of you know
what that is?

740
01:12:54,603 --> 01:13:00,742
It's usually produced as a
precursor to ammonium perchlorate,

741
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,244
a fuel

742
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:07,048
used for launching
naval satellites into orbit.

743
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,651
It's highly corrosive.

744
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:18,059
Dissolves most biological
material on contact.

745
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:22,997
With humans,
right down to the bone.

746
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:30,037
Hey, Howard, uh, what are
you showing this to us for?

747
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,710
You think I'm an idiot?

748
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:37,245
Uh...

749
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:38,846
Howard, please,
you're gonna have to tell us

750
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,148
what it is that
you're talking about.

751
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:43,618
I'm talking about
getting rid of some waste.

752
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,890
Tell me what you two
were doing with these.

753
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,930
You tell me what you two
were planning, right now!

754
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,266
Howard, listen, just take it easy.
Take it easy.

755
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,467
Howard, come on, please.

756
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:02,136
No. I'm giving you
one chance.

757
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,239
Hey.

758
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:05,840
Howard, just calm down.

759
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:09,444
One chance to answer with some
dignity, or I swear to god,

760
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:13,147
you're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.

761
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:14,615
It was me.

762
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,920
All right? Not her.
It's just me.

763
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:20,555
No, no, no, we... Stay
out of this, all right?

764
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:23,724
She doesn't have a clue
what you're talking about.

765
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,093
I wanted your gun.

766
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:32,266
And so, I was thinking
about making a weapon

767
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,603
to get it from you.

768
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,848
I want her to respect me
the way that she respects you.

769
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,553
I'm not saying
that I was right, okay?

770
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,356
And I'm sorry.

771
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:00,728
You're sorry?

772
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,430
I'm sorry.

773
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,901
I accept your apology.

774
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,550
Listen to me. You heard him.
You heard him.

775
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:25,353
He was making a weapon.
He was gonna hurt us.

776
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:27,855
He was gonna hurt you.
And it's okay.

777
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,225
This was the way it was
always supposed to be.

778
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:32,593
You're safe.

779
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:35,263
Now it's just you and me.

780
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,231
It's okay, you know.

781
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,635
You should
go to your room now.

782
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:44,171
This next part isn't something
you need to see.

783
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,240
Okay.

784
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,142
Go on.

785
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,863
Michelle?

786
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,632
Hey.

787
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,203
I thought we'd change
things up tonight

788
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:51,405
and have dessert
before dinner.

789
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:54,942
After all, we can do
whatever we want now.

790
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,884
Would you like a cone
or a bowl?

791
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,322
Megan always wanted
hers in a bowl.

792
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:11,292
She said the cones
were too messy.

793
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,831
I know that this isn't
the life you'd prefer,

794
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:20,601
that it isn't easy for you
living down here,

795
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:23,971
but I want us
to be a happy family.

796
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,073
You and me.

797
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,878
The mess is
all taken care of.

798
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,549
So, just hang loose and
I'll go get dinner started.

799
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,931
Michelle?

800
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,316
Everything all right?

801
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,920
Yeah, I was just about
to do some reading.

802
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,590
Hmm.

803
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,526
It's time to set the table.

804
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,162
Supper's ready.

805
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,733
Yeah.

806
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,468
Okay.

807
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:14,315
It keeps doing that.
I don't know why.

808
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,964
Michelle, why is this loose?

809
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,970
Get up.
Why?

810
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:39,340
Get off the mattress now!

811
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,846
Oh, shit!

812
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:47,681
Michelle!

813
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:50,885
Stop! Goddamn it,
get back here!

814
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,272
You gonna
walk out on me?

815
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:20,247
After I saved you and kept you
safe, this is how you repay me.

816
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,083
No.

817
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,452
This is.

818
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,987
Michelle!

819
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,979
Stop!

820
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,015
You don't know
what's out there.

821
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:37,217
You can't run from them!

822
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,888
Stay with me!

823
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:43,557
Let me go!

824
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:20,994
Oh, come on.

825
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:18,678
Keys, keys, keys.

826
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,883
Come on, damn it!

827
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,205
Come on. Come on.

828
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,951
Help! I'm out here! Help!

829
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,697
Oh, god.

830
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,429
Oh, fuck.

831
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:17,303
