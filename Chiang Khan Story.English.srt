I have a name for our movie.

00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,666
What name, boss?

7
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,583
Mae Nak Liver's Apes.

8
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,500
[Kheng] Huh?

9
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,625
So you want to remake Mae Nak?

10
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,041
Of course!

11
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,458
Mae Nak...
What does that have to do with apes?

12
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:26,125
Sheesh! I said, "Mae Nak Liver's Apes."

13
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,333
Nothing to do with apes, you idiot!

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,416
Can't you understand Thai?

15
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,583
Oh.

16
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,166
"Mae Nak Riverscape."

17
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,958
-Right.
-[Kheng] Okay.

18
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,458
So what does it have to do with the river?

19
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,083
Well, why does it always have to be
Mae Nak Phra Khanong?

20
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,333
Don't you find it boring?

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,208
Why can't we come up with
a new idea for Thai movies?

22
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
So Mae Nak Riverscape then?

23
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,500
That's right. Mae Nak Liver's Ape.

24
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to make a new history
for Thai horror.

25
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,166
-Make history?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,750
How?

27
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,875
How the hell would I know?
I'm not a director.

28
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,958
I'm the boss, you idiot!

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
How is it going to change history?

30
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,625
Ask that asshole over there.
He's the director!

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Hey, it's all on you, Tukkae.

32
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,416
Mae Nak Riverscape. Got it.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,916
So do we have to film

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,708
by the actual river?

35
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,125
Are you retarded?

36
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,291
What's the damn title?

37
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,541
Of course, Mae Nak Riverscape

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,916
has to be filmed at the Mekong River.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,500
It's not Mae Nak Chao Phraya, is it?

40
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,000
You big dummy!

41
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,125

Tukkae? [laughs]

What the hell kind of name is that?

50
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,708
So you like painting?

51
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,708
-Yes, sir.
-You want to help me paint?

52

Yes, sir.

53
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,750
You can start by cleaning all my brushes.

54
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,333
Okay, sir.

00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:17,708
Here, use this water can.

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,041

going to premiere?

Hello, hello.

00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,250
Hi, Mother.

[Tukkae] Hello, ma'am.

64
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,875
Let's go, Tukkae.

65
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,041
[Tukkae] But I'm not done yet.

66
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,083
Go on.

67
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,166
I'll finish it myself.

68
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,291
You like painting, but what do you want
to do when you get older, Tukkae?

69
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,333
I want to be a billboard artist
like Master Pong.

70
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,250
Why do you want to paint billboards?

71
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,583
So he can watch movies for free!

72
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,083
Is that so?

73
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,750
That's right, ma'am. I've been painting
for a while now,

74
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,625
so the owner lets me watch movies
for free.

75
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,750
I get to see them for free too.

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,708
[Pang's mother] Mmm.

77
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,166
Where did I put my key?

78
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,458
Anyway, what do you want to do
when you grow up, Pang?

79
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,208
I want to be a movie star!

80
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,041
Really?

81
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,666
Why do you want to be a movie star, dear?

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,291
So I can see myself painted
on a giant billboard someday!

83
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:36,333
If you become a movie star,
I'll paint your billboard myself!

84
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,375
You have to make sure
it's the biggest one ever, okay?

98
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,541
He still has his Grandma Sri.

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Grandma.

104
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,291
Why aren't we having dinner
at Miss Pang's house today?

105
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,041
They were just asking to be polite.

106
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,500
But that means you need
to mind your manners

107
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,416
and know your place.

108
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,708
I'm just the maid.

109
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:01,250
There's no way I can sit at the same table
as the boss. It's not proper.

110
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,583
But I'm not their servant, Grandma.

111
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,791
Fool!

112
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,375
You are my grandson!

113
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,333
And another thing,

114
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,916
when you play with Miss Pang,

115
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,041
you see she doesn't seem
to care where you come from,

116
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,958
but you need to mind your manners
and be aware of your proper place.

117
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,625
Do you understand what that means?

118
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,125
I don't understand.

119
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,416
[Grandma Sri groans]

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,916
That's why you got a stupid name! Tukkae!

121
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,833
Grandma?

122
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,166
Now what?

123
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,833
Why am I named after a gecko?

124
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,083
How would I know?

125
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,083
Your mother was the one
who picked it for you.

126
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,541
Where is she now?

127
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,750
I've told you many times
never to ask me about that.

128
00:08:55,625 --> 00:09:00,583
But all the kids at school make fun of me,
calling me "No-Mother Boy."

129
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,750
I just want them to know

130
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,375
that I have a mother too.

131
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,166
I don't know

132
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,500
where your mother is now.

133
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,416
All I know is, when you were born,

134
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
she left you with me.

135
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,083
I asked who your father is,

136
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,666
and she didn't even know.

137
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,250
Since then, she left and never came back.

138
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,958
You really want to know
why she named you after a gecko?

139
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,833
Why?

140
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,458
Because she hates geckos!

141
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,875
Now that you know this,

142
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,458
you still want a mother?

143
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,625
No.

144
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,041
If you're not going to eat,
go wash your plate. Go!

145
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,500
Grandma?

146
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,916
What is it?

147
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,083
Can I please change my name?

148
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,541
What good would that do?

149
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,750
Because my mother hates geckos,

150
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,375
and so do the kids at school.

151
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,041
You don't have to change your name

152
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,583
because I don't hate geckos.

153
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,750
Please don't ever hate me too, Grandma.

[Nawarat] Kampol Sae-ter!

158
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,083
I will tell the teacher on you!

159
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,333
[Kampol] Just try it!

160
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,916
Let me borrow these,

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,791
so maybe I can be a great artist
like this No-Mother Boy!

Those are my pencils.
I don't want you to use them.

164
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
If they can use them,

165
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,791
then why can't I?

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,666
I'm not making a movie.

494
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm making a story.

495
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,500
Story for your movie?

496
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,083
That's right.

497
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,208
You said it yourself,

498
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:14,000
if I'm going to direct,
I have to have a story to tell.

499
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,500
Oh,

500
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,250
about the art students?

501
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes, it's about my friends.

502
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,375
And how are you going to tell this story?

503
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,583
I'm going to take these photos

504
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:31,208
and use them to build a new story.

505
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:33,291
A whole new story?

506
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:34,833
Right.

507
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,791
A teen movie?

508
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,333
A romance.

509
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,583
Oh!

510
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,291
So how long do you plan
to work at Jom's shop?

511
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,541
[Ple] I don't know. A while, I guess.

512
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't feel like thinking too far ahead.

513
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,458
Excuse me. I want to rent costumes
for a commercial shoot.

514
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,166
Who should I talk to?

515
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,250
You can leave a name card.
Someone will get back to you.

516
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,541
Okay.

517
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:18,375
Here you go.

518
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,541
Nawarat Meesukhon?

519
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,208
That's right.

520
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,458
Do you remember me?

521
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:32,458
You are...

522
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,083
It's me, Pang!

523
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,583
Pang? Meena Ruksasuk?

524
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,291
I got a degree in pharmacy at Sirirat.

525
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,708
Pharmacy?

526
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,250
Why are you working in commercials?

527
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,708
My boyfriend is an assistant director.

528
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,875
He sees that I like to dress up,

529
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,208
so he put me in charge of the wardrobe.

530
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,541
What about you?
Have you been working there long?

531
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,125
Not quite a month.

532
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,750
My friend works there.

533
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,625
She invited me.

534
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,958
I'm just killing time while I wait.

535
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,000
Wait for?

536
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,375
I'm going back to school soon.

537
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,958
Where are you going to study?

538
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,875
Chicago.

539
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,333
Chicago?

540
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,416
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,791
For my master's degree in interior design.

542
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,750
I studied decorative arts
at Silpakorn University.

543
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,208
Wow, what a cool life, Meena!

544
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,291
It's not a big deal.

545
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:49,416
You probably didn't know it,
but I was little jealous of you.

546
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,416
Yeah, but if you had known me
when I got older, you wouldn't be.

547
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,833
Well, anyway,
I'm so happy to see you again.

548
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,708
Me too.

549
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,083
You want to pitch a movie project?

550
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,541
Let's see what you've got.

551
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,666
I have some slides and a soundtrack.

552
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,541
Slides and a soundtrack?

553
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,375
Is that all?

554
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,250
[dreamy music playing]

555
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,208
You've got guts, young man.
But that's not enough.

556
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,875
Making films is much more
than just putting on

557
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:46,708
a slideshow with tape-recorded music.

558
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,500
The problem here is,

559
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,541
we don't have a clear idea
of what you want to do.

560
00:42:56,041 --> 00:43:00,125
You should go back
and write everything down,

561
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,041
explaining what the story is about.

562
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,791
You can write it as a treatment.

563
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,166
What's a treatment?

564
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,333
[man] Hmm?

565
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,708
What's a treatment?

566
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,708
Are you kidding me?

567
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:16,083
You want to make a movie,

568
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,333
but you don't know what a treatment is?

569
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,166
I don't know, sir.

570
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,041
[man sighs]

571
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:37,791
This is the best treatment
we have ever read.

572
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,333
Take it home with you.
Use it as an example.

573
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,958
NING WAI GORN SOR SORN WAI

574
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,708
[Tukkae sighs deeply]

575
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,541
Here you go!

576
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,166
What is it?

577
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,916
My sister's old typewriter.

578
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,291
She doesn't need it anymore,
so you can use it.

579
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,666
But I don't know how to type.

580
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,541
Man, you have got some nerve!

581
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,291
Because I can't type?
How is that being cocky?

582
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:29,833
You can't even type,
and you want to be a director.

583
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,166
So, if I want to direct,
I need to know how to type?

584
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,250
How are you going to write a script?

585
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,458
By hand?

586
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:42,833
You think a studio is going
to read your chicken scratch?

587
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,416
What if I write it and pay someone
to type it up. Wouldn't that be easier?

588
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,583
Sure,

589
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,291
but how the hell are you going
to pay them?

590
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,500
[Pang's stepmother] I figured
you wouldn't be coming back.

591
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,000
That's why I put all your stuff here.

592
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,625
You're lucky
I didn't just throw everything away.

593
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,625
Let's go!

594
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,166
Man, I really want to smack
your stepmom in the face.

595
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,916
I don't know why your father
married that bitch.

596
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,791
[Pang] Me neither.

597
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,083
-[dreamy music playing]
-[typing]

598
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,083
Tukkae still hasn't left his room?

599
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,416
It's been three weeks,
and he hasn't gone out anywhere.

600
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,000
This time he's serious, guys.

601
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:52,125
Where did he get the foolish idea
to become a director anyway?

602
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,041
Shit,

603
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,875
don't you remember that old
Petch Chiang Khan cinema?

604
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:01,250
[Kampol] When Tukkae took us
to the projector booth,

605
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,583
he even showed us how to change the reels.

606
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,166
I remember,

607
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,666
but this dumbass was asleep
the whole time.

608
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,958
You can't remember?

609
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,208
Of course I remember.
I was just testing to see

610
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,625
if you assholes cared about your friends.

611
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:20,541
Mmm.

612
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,291
Let me ask you guys something.

613
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,125
You're all in the same class
as Tukkae, right?

614
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:30,875
Mmm.

615
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:34,708
How come you all look so much older?

616
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,250
Honestly,

617
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,958
Tukkae had a hard life.

618
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,291
-[Kheng] How's that?
-His family had nothing.

619
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,208
What does that have to do with anything?

620
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,833
Because he's poor,
he grew up slower than the rest of us.

621
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,666
-I see.
-My family had money.

622
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,000
That's why I grew up faster.

623
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,791
So you stuffed your face all day?

624
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,000
-Wait a second.
-[Kheng] Yeah?

625
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:00,750
Your family must have been
rich too, right?

626
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,000
Watch it, punk!

627
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,458
We did okay. Wouldn't say rich or poor.

628
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:07,541
Looking at your face,
I would guess more rich than poor.

629
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:08,666
Not that rich!

630
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,791
-Well, maybe a little bit rich.
-Hold on!

631
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:15,166
I'm talking about you assholes and
why you look so much older than Tukkae.

632
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,541
Nothing to do with me.
Stop trying to change the subject!

00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,583
Are all Chiang Khan kids like this?

You want this glass in your face, bitch?

00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,833
-I'll do it!
-Calm down, bro!

640
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,875
Don't foul! Don't foul!

641
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,583
Who are you calling a fool, punk?

642
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:45,916
Not "fool." "Foul." It's a slang term.

643
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,250
"Foul" as in mess up.

644
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:51,500
Okay, so if someone is playing football
and they dive, is that a foul or a fool?

645
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,041
It's a fall.

646
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,458
That asshole!

I'm gonna shave his goddamn head.

Man, you smoke a lot.

649
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,375
You know his dad died because
of cigarettes?

650
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,333
From cancer?

651
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:10,333
No, he was crossing the street to buy
a pack when he got hit by a car!

[all chuckle]

653
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,333
It was more like a highway.

00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,250
-Here, let me help.
-Thanks.

656
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,541
Were they hard to find?

657
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:20,833
Not really.

658
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,041
This is Tong, the assistant director.
My boyfriend.

659
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,291
-Hello.
-Hi.

660
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,125
Everyone, this is Pang from Theatre,
my old friend from school.

661
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,750
So what about Chicago now?

662
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,708
Nothing happening yet.

663
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,041
I have a few things to sort out first.

664
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,291
-[Tong] Nikki.
-Yes?

665
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,875
Can I talk to you real quick?

666
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,875
Sure. Just a moment.

667
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,541
[speaking indistinctly]

668
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,208
What is it?

669
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,541
How would you like to be in a commercial?

670
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,333
Me? In a commercial?

671
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,750
[man 1] Do you know why
I asked you to write a treatment?

672
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,666
-I don't know.
-I'm too lazy to read a whole script.

673
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:23,333
You see how thick
some of those things are?

674
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,916
No, thanks!

675
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,125
So did you read mine?

676
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,375
I did.

677
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,000
Finished it in one sitting.

678
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,708
Did you like it?

679
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:36,333
Well, of course I liked it. I called you
back in for a meeting, didn't I?

680
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,583
-Hello.
-Hello there.

681
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:45,500
You know, you've got a great script here.

682
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,291
If it were a movie,

683
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,375
I would be the first
in line to buy a ticket.

684
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,000
I would be right behind you.

685
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,083
[man 2] But...

686
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,208
[man 1] But what?

687
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,750
But I don't think it's filmable.

688
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:06,500
What do you mean by "not filmable"?

689
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:10,291
Like I said, I would watch this movie.

690
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,666
If it was in the cinema,
I would be the first in line.

691
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,208
But as an investor,

692
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,208
it's too risky.

693
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:24,250
Dramas like this don't make any money.

694
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:29,875
You're welcome
to try selling it to other studios.

695
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,500
Unfortunately, we have to pass. Too risky.

696
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:01,208
[Kampol] Her name is Pang, Meena Ruksasuk.

697
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,125
A big up-and-coming model!

698
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,125
Is this for real?

699
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,875
Yeah, it's like something from a movie.

700
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,791
What a strange coincidence.

701
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,041
Don't call it a coincidence.

702
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,083
In the movies, it's called destiny.

703
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:16,875
Cut!

704
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:27,500
Pang, we are filming
the birthday party scene next.

705
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,416
Go ahead and change into your next outfit.

706
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,041
Take her to wardrobe
and have makeup give her a touch-up.

707
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,708
Okay.

708
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,958
[Pang] Can I use the phone?

709
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:41,916
Go right ahead, dear. I'll be right back.

710
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,291
Yes, sir.

711
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,375
Ple.

712
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,541
I just saw that asshole, Ake.

713
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,250
I don't like the shadows here.

714
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,500
Can I have more light over here?

715
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:58,583
Sure thing.

716
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,708
We've got a big problem.

717
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:04,791
[man] What's the matter?

718
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,791
There's a couple of army guys
beating the shit out of Ake.

719
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,208
-[man] Are you serious?
-Hurry!

720
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,541
It looks pretty bad.

721
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,041
[Ple] Okay, that's enough.

722
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,041
Yo, Pang! See you later!

723
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,291
Done.

724
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,208
Okay, Mr. Movie Critic, what do you think?

725
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,000
I like it.

726
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,291
There you go. The kiss of death!

727
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,458
You like it, so no wonder no one
wants to make Tukkae's movie.

728
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,041
So who did you pitch it to?

729
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,500
I think every studio in Thailand.

730
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:01,708
Hey.

731
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,666
Even if 100 people say no,

732
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,625
don't feel discouraged.

733
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:10,416
All you need is for one guy to say yes.

734
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,625
Hell, yeah, bro!

735
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:17,125
Tukkae, come see this music video quick!

736
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,041
-[Tukkae] What music video?
-Just come check it out!

737
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:21,416
You guys too. Move your asses!

738
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,500
[music playing]

739
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:28,166
Looks like
your Pang is becoming a big star.

740
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,333
So are you going to clear the air
with her or what?

741
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,166
How am I supposed to do that?

742
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,416
Yeah,

743
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:41,125
we're not sure
if she even remembers Tukkae.

744
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:49,375
[woman] I don't think we can risk having
someone with no name or experience

745
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,916
directing his first movie for us.

746
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:56,166
But I do have film experience.

747
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,875
What did you do?

748
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,208
I held the time slate.

749
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,541
You held the slate board?

750
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,041
Oh!

751
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,750
I don't think that's enough.

752
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,416
So what do I have to do
to become a director?

753
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,625
Sell us your script.

754
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,833
Sell it to you?

755
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,500
Yes. Sell it to us first

756
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:21,416
and work on this film
as the assistant director.

757
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,708
The next movie, you can direct yourself.

758
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,125
By then, we'll know each other better,
and you'll have the right experience.

759
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:30,750
For the next script you write,

760
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,916
if you still want to be the director,
I think that would be fine.

761
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:35,416
It's a fair deal.

762
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,583
Do you have a new story?

763
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:39,291
Come up with a new idea.

764
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,166
You write fast anyway.

765
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,625
Let them have this one.

766
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,333
Work as an assistant, and you'll learn
how to be a director in no time.

767
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,000
[Ple] So did you finish
reading the script?

768
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,708
Yes.

769
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,833
Do you know who wrote it?

770
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:03,041
[Ple] No, there is no name for
the screenwriter anywhere.

771
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:09,833
I'd like to introduce you to John.
He is going to direct this film.

772
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,166
Hello.

773
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:14,250
This is Pang, our lead actress,

774
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:17,916
and Ple, her manager.

775
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,291
Hello, everyone.

776
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,583
John is from New York.

777
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,916
He studied film at NYU.

778
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,125
[in English] Yeah, that's right. NYU.

779
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:33,458
[in Thai] Yeah, so John came back to
Thailand specifically to direct this film.

780
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,833
So you've read the script already?

781
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,541
Yes.

782
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,875
You know, Pang,

783
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:44,125
I'm certain that, after this movie,
you will be a huge star.

784
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,500
Wow, you're that sure?

785
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:50,416
I wouldn't have flewed
all the way here if I didn't think so.

786
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,041
I think you mean "flown."

787
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,708
[inaudible]

788
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,333
BAAN NAWK

789
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:23,666
[in Thai] Car coming.

790
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:27,125
Stop the car! Happy Songkran!

791
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:35,541
Get the dude in the glasses! Over there!

792
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:41,875
Hey, Tukkae!
When does your movie start shooting?

793
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:43,708
I don't know.

794
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:48,708
You know what? I read in the news
that your Pang is starring in it.

795
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,333
I know.

796
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,375
I told you, it's not a coincidence.

797
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:58,208
[Kampol] Enough with that bullshit,
Mr. Movie Critic!

798
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:23,708
[John] This way, please.

799
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,166
First AD!

800
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,375
Yes?

801
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,833
Take our star to makeup.

802
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:35,958
[May] See you.

803
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:38,208
This way, please.

804
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:42,208
[John] Hey, kid,
give me a copy of the script.

805
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,625
Jong, our leading lady
is here to do her makeup.

806
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,958
Hello, Jong.

807
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,000
Have you been waiting long, Ple?

808
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,500
Where did you go?

809
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,291
I was with John.

810
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:02,333
Excuse me, John? Which scene
would you like for the screen test?

811
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,166
One of the romantic ones.

812
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:05,958
Really?

813
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,708
But we need to find someone
to play opposite Pang.

814
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,708
Then use Tukkae. He knows the script.

815
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:18,583
Pang, we're going
to rehearse scene 69 now.

816
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:20,125
Okay.

817
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,375
You want me to act?

818
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:24,333
Yeah, just as a stand-in
for the lead actor.

819
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:25,583
Really? The lead actor?

820
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,833
Yes, you better start practicing
your lines.

821
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,666
Wait. You don't need to practice.
You wrote the damn thing, right?

822
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:47,875
John, Pang is here.

823
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:54,291
[John] Okay, Pang, today, don't worry
about getting all your lines right.

824
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:57,875
I'm just testing camera angles.

825
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,375
-Okay.
-Clear!

826
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,666
This way please, Pang.

827
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:04,875
[Pang] Okay.

828
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,708
I have someone here
who will read Puen's lines for you.

829
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,458
Assistant! Come here!

830
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,875
If our two actors are ready, let us know.

831
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,750
[Pang] Can I have a moment please?

832
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,291
You want me to call Pued and Padd
to take care of him?

833
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:53,625
What do you think?

834
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,416
No, I don't think that's necessary.

835
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,000
Can we have a minute?

836
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:10,916
I want to talk to you.

837
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,833
They must be practicing lines, right?

838
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:28,958
[May] I guess so.

839
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,500
[Tukkae] Miss Pang--

840
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't want to know
what happened at your house.

841
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,583
I just want to forget all about it.

842
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:41,041
I want you to forget what happened too.

843
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,208
Forget everything about that night.

844
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,666
Forget that you ever saw me.

845
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,250
But actually, that night--

846
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:51,833
That night we never met.

We don't know each other.

848

I don't want to have anything else
to do with you.

Puen, why did you do that?

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean it, Prim.

I was drunk.

how much she loved you?

01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,583
I think that maybe you should--

John, can I talk to you for a minute?

01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:47,833
Should I say cut, sir?

873
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:48,916
Obviously.

874
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,333
The assistant
who is reading lines with me...

875

Yes? What about him?

876
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,083
Would it be okay if he was not around?
Ever?

877
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,375
So no one from Sunny Films
has contacted you at all?

878
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,625
[Tukkae] No.

879
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,166
I think you should just go there yourself.

880
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,666
And tell them,
if they're going to fire you like this,

881
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,208
then you want your script back.

882
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,916
I don't think
we can give you back your script.

You are an employee.
And the law is on the employer's side.

Frankly, you don't have any right
to get it back.

We don't know
what happened between you and Pang.

979
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,416
-Pang?
-Hmm?

980
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,416
Do you know someone named Tukkae?

981
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,083
[Pang] Hello?

982
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,625
Hello, Miss Pang.

983
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,333
Tukkae?

984
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,625
Yes.

985
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,583
Tukkae, Mana Jitmankong?

986
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,750
That's right.

987
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,541
How did you get my number?

988
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:21,791
It wasn't that hard.
You're quite famous these days.

989
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,500
Oh, please.

990
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,291
Anyway, how long has it been?

991
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,583
How is your Grandma?

992
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,875
Grandma Sri has dementia.

993
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:40,750
She's staying at the hospital now.

994
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,041
Which hospital?

995
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:46,875
In Loei.

996
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,041
But she's healthy and happy.

997
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,833
What about Master Pong and Uncle Ong?

998
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,083
Master Pong passed away.

999
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:01,166
Really?

1000
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,583
But Uncle Ong is well.

1001
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,833
Is he still running the projectors?

1002
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,500
Yes, same as usual.

1003
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:14,833
Unbelievable!

1004
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,458
So why are you calling me?

1005
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:28,208
I wanted to say sorry about that day.

1006
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:30,791
Which day?

1007
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,208
The day I...

1008
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:38,375
I shot that cap gun at you.

1009
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,583
Oh, Tukkae!

1010
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,291
I was never mad at you.

1011
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,750
Didn't you get my present?

1012
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,000
I did.

1013
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,583
I still have it.

1014
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,791
So you should have known
I was never mad at you.

1015
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,916
Thank you very much, Miss Pang.

1016
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,458
[sniffles softly]

1017
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,916
Look, you can stop calling me
Miss Pang already.

1018
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,416
[chuckles]

1019
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,666
Okay.

1020
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:33,083
Actually, I'm glad you called.

1021
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:35,000
Are you free next week?

1022
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,083
Yes.

1023
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:41,458
I want to send you an invitation.

1024
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:43,791
Invitation to what?

1025
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,416
[inaudible]

1026
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:22,541
TUKKAE

1027
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:33,166
-[Kheng] Hey, is the boss in?
-[man] Yeah, he's upstairs.

1028
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,416
-[Kheng] Upstairs?
-[man] Yes.

1029
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,625
So how do you know this producer?

1030
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,416
I designed a logo for him once.

1031
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:45,708
[producer sighs]

1032
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,333
[chuckles]

1033
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,416
[producer] Another thing,

1034
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,541
whenever you write the script,

1035
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:56,708
I want a cat.

1036
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:59,208
-"Cast"?
-"Cat," "cast," same difference,

1037
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:05,250
I just want some big ones.

1038
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,291
Do you mean "boobs"?

1039
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,916
Watch your mouth!

1040
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,333
Kids can't hear that kind of language.

1041
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:16,083
So you want to make a kids' movie?

1042
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,500
It's not for kids.

1043
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,583
For adults!

1044
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:23,833
We have to give the audience
what they want,

1045
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:27,541
show them something exciting.

1046
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,208
But don't be dirty.

1047
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:30,791
But the boobs have to be big?

1048
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:34,541
Why do you keep saying "boobs"?

1049
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:37,333
Don't call them "boobs."

1050
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:39,833
Say "nice lady shapes."

1051
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:42,500
Nice big lady shapes.

1052
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:47,250
They must be big. Otherwise,
the audience won't be interested.

1053
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:50,500
So do you want the leading man
to have big boobs too?

1054
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:51,583
Fuck you!

1055
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,166
The lead actor with big boobs?

1056
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:57,541
If I saw that,
it would give me a fucking nightmare!

1057
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,166
Are we really going to do this?

1058
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,250
[Kheng] What?

1059
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,625
Mae Nak Riverscape.

1060
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,041
I think it all depends on you
and how good you can make it.

1061
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,458
[exclaims]

1062
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,041
Check this out.
"Pang Meena is a real-life runaway bride.

1063
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:20,708
After the director's wife
showed up uninvited,

1064
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:23,708
waving a marriage certificate
for all the reporters to see."

1065
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,958
The press is still waiting out there.

1066
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,541
What do you want to do?

1067
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,083
[phone ringing]

1068
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,750
Don't answer it.

1069
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,125
Maybe it's for work.

1070
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,708
[phone continues ringing]

1071
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,708
I really should have listened to you.

1072
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Forget it.

1073
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:05,208
What's done is done. Let's try to move on.

1074
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:11,833
[receiver clicks]

1075
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,416
[Ong] Mae Nak Riverscape?

1076
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:16,500
Yes.

1077
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,125
So you have to shoot by a river?

1078
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,000
[Tukkae] I guess so.

1079
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:45,958
[toy gun clicking]

1080
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,000
[typing]

1081
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,625
What do you want to do
with all these gifts?

1082
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,750
Throw them all away.

1083
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:44,166
[Ple] Don't you have
a friend named Tukkae?

1084
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:46,708
Yes.

1085
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:51,375
[Ple] Looks like he got you a gift.

1086
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:59,083
CONGRATULATIONS, MISS PANG
TUKKAE

1087
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,250
[sighs]

1088
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,583
[Kheng] Tukkae, you realize

1089
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:56,666
that this might be your only chance
to make a movie?

1090
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:58,416
I know.

1091
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:03,916
Do you think it's worth it?
Changing the whole story like this?

1092
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:09,208
Making it a movie meant
for only one person to see?

1093
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:12,875
I'm not sure myself.

1094
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,958
You know,

1095
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,291
I've worked on a lot of different films.

1096
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:24,333
But this is the one
I've wanted to make the most.

1097
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:29,708
And I've always waited to see
a film like this.

1098
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,041
You sure you want to do this?

1099
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,583
Yes.

1100
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,375
Then get ready to start shooting.

1101
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:45,583
-Really?
-Yeah!

1102
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,208
But what about--

1103
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:50,250
Leave the boss to me.

1104
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,541
What are you going to tell him?

1105
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,583
I'm not telling him nothing.

1106
01:22:55,666 --> 01:22:57,500
You think he'd let us keep going?

1107
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,583
Just do it.

1108
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,541
[man] Movie with No Title,
reel one, scene one, take one.

1109
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,000
Mark!

1110
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:11,208
[Tukkae] Action!

1111
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,458
-[actor Pong] Tukkae.
-[actor Tukkae] Yes?

1112
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:25,083
[actor Pong] Be careful the paint
doesn't drip outside the lines.

1113
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,250
[actor Tukkae] Okay.

1114
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:30,708
[actor Pang] Master Pong,
when is this movie going to premiere?

1115
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:33,916
[actor Tukkae] Soon.

1116
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:36,541
[actor Pong] That's right. Soon.

1117
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:39,416
[Tukkae] Cut!

1118
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,541
-I promise I won't forget.
-Good, good.

1119
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:47,541
The boss wants to know
when he can see the script.

1120
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,500
We'll send it to him once it's written.

1121
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,083
The script is not written yet?

1122
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,375
Not yet.

1123
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:56,541
Get ready for the next scene!

1124
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,625
[Ple] Your house is around here?

1125
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,291
[Pang] No, this is Tukkae's home.

1126
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,291
[Ple] The door is locked.
Looks like no one is here.

1127
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,958
[toy gunshots]

1128
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,583
You've finished half the movie already?

1129
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,125
Yes.

1130
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:38,666
Where are the ghosts?

1131
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,041
There are none.

1132
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,500
And no big boobs either!

1133
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:47,625
You mean "lady shapes," sir.

1134
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:49,833
Same difference.

1135
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,708
-Boobs, lady shapes, whatever.
-There aren't any either.

1136
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:56,333
There are only kids running around.

1137
01:25:58,541 --> 01:25:59,750
Who's going to want to see this?

1138
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:06,833
So what do you want to do next, sir?

1139
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,791
What to do next?

1140
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,916
You give me no choice.

1141
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:16,875
If we put an exorcist or girls
with big boobs--

1142
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:18,708
"Shapes," sir. "Lady shapes."

1143
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:22,625
Same difference!

1144
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:25,750
Anyway, that stuff
would fuck up the movie!

1145
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:30,958
-That's right.
-Shut up! No one asked you.

1146
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,041
[grunts]

1147
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:35,375
So how long to find the shit?

1148
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,416
"Find the shit"?

1149
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,416
You dumbass!

1150
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,875
Not "find the shit."

1151
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:45,250
I said "finish" it.

1152
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:47,000
The movie!

1153
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,000
Oh, I get it. How long to finish it.

1154
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,000
So you're going to let us finish it?

1155
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,583
Well, you've come this far.

1156
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,083
What the hell?

1157
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,333
To be honest,

1158
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:06,916
we don't see movies like this anymore.

1159
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:16,541
Let's finish it.

1160
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,375
-Hmm.
-Yes, sir.

1161
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:27,166
What is it called?

1162
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,666
We still haven't settled on a title yet.

1163
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:35,666
Halfway done and still no title?

1164
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:40,625
If you don't come up with one, I will.

1165
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,166
What are you going to call it?

1166
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:48,958
If you are making it like this, then...

1167
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:53,833
Liver Apes Love Story. [chuckles]

1168
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:58,000
-[bangs table] That's right.
-What's a liver ape?

1169
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:02,416
What the hell are you talking about?

1170
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,083
You said "liver apes."

1171
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:05,416
Liver Apes Love Story!

1172
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,750
Riverscape Love Story.

1173
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,291
[producer] Yeah!

1174
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:13,750
Okay, that sounds interesting.

1175
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,125
Do you like it?

1176
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:21,333
Maybe we should think of other options.

1177
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:23,000
I think it might be a bit too beautiful.

1178
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:25,333
Whatever!

1179
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:29,000
"Too beautiful," my ass!
You're just too dumb to get it.

1180
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:47,125
GOOSEBUMPS

PETCH CHIANG KHAN

1182
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:13,083
So who is Uncle Ong?

1183
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,708
He runs the movie projectors.

1184
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,250
I see.

1185
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:24,791
[Pang] Looks like he kept
all of Master Pong's work.

1186
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:28,583
[Ple] And who is Master Pong?

1187
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:40,291
He was the artist who painted
all these movie billboards.

1188
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,916
[Ong snoring]

1189

[sneezes, exclaims]

1191
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,458
Hello!

1192
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:51,375
It's me, Pang.

1193
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Miss Pang!

1194
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:33,083
The door was open.

1195
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:35,708
Miss Pang,

1196
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:38,333
about that night--

1197
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,708
Uncle Ong told me what really
happened the night I got drugged.

1198
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,375
You met with Uncle Ong?

1199
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:50,541
I'm so sorry, Tukkae.

1200
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,583
It was a big misunderstanding.

1201
01:31:58,416 --> 01:31:59,583
It's okay.

1202
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,083
[voice breaks] But because of me,
you didn't get to make your movie.

1203
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:10,333
It's fine, Miss Pang.

1204
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:16,833
At least you had
a chance to star in that movie.

1205
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:24,000
I never thought you would get this far.

1206
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,000
[Pang sniffles]

1207
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,791
So are you done directing your movie?

1208
01:32:31,916 --> 01:32:35,541
No, we're only about halfway done.

1209
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:39,166
What is it about?

1210
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:43,416
It's about love.

1211
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:47,125
Love?

1212
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,708
Can you star in my movie?

1213
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:58,833
I don't want to be in showbiz
anymore, Tukkae.

1214
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:02,333
You should find someone else to be in it.

1215
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,000
It doesn't have to be me.

1216
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:11,500
But I think it does need to be you.

1217
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:15,791
I'm going for my master's degree soon.

1218
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:19,666
Where?

1219
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,333
Chicago.

1220
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:25,666
For how long?

1221
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,375
Two or three years.

1222
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:33,458
What if I waited for you?

1223
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,125
You'd better not.

1224
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:42,333
It might take longer.

1225
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:49,208
Good luck with your movie.

1226
01:33:56,916 --> 01:33:58,041

01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,958
Miss Pang! Please wait!

1230
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:32,000
I want you to watch what I have so far.

1231
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,833
MOVIE WITH NO TITLE

1232
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,833
What is this?

1233
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:53,625
It's Tukkae's movie.

1234
01:34:57,166 --> 01:34:58,375
[knocking at door]

1235
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:01,708
Who's that?

1236
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:03,416
I don't know.

1237
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:12,833
Who's there?

1238
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:14,166
It's me, John.

1239
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:19,833
Don't talk to him.

1240
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:23,625
Pang, I'm not here to try
to get you back or make excuses.

1241
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,833
I just want to tell you the truth
about what happened.

1242
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,166
Pang?

1243
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,125
Whatever you have to say, just say it.

1244
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:50,208
I know that I messed up your career,

1245
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:53,083
and I probably ruined your life.

1246
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,833
But I didn't mean for it to happen.

1247
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:01,916
I want to make everything better.

1248
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:09,708
How?

1249
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:12,041
This is information about my next project.

1250
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:16,125
It's going to have the biggest budget ever
for a movie made in Thailand.

1251
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:18,875
If you agree to star in it,

1252
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,583
I will hold a press conference

1253
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:24,791
and explain that you didn't steal
anyone's husband.

1254
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:32,541
I have a divorce certificate as proof
that I'm telling the truth.

1255
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:37,791
And the reason I'm doing all this

1256
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,958
is to show everyone

1257
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,000
that I love only you.

1258
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:54,541
[producer] So you're going to come back
and make Mae Nak Riverscape with me?

1259
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:57,583
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

1260
01:36:59,041 --> 01:37:00,541
Do I really have to answer?

1261
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:03,375
Of course!

1262
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:05,416
I want to hear the reason.

1263
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,708
You really want to know?

1264
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:12,375
I really want to know

1265
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:16,708
how an artist like you thinks.

1266
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,708
If I say it, you wouldn't believe me.

1267
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,625
Goddammit!

1268
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:24,000
Just say it. Tell me, so I can understand.

1269
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:25,750
Hello, boss.

1270
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:28,625
Tukkae, you gotta come with me now.

1271
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:31,291
Where the hell are you going?

1272
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:33,708
I still haven't got your answer yet.

1273
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:45,250
Tukkae, didn't you say
that Pang was moving to Chicago?

1274
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:46,333
That's right.

1275
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:55,000
-Where's the press conference?
-[man] Please welcome Mr. Paisan Sodsai,

1276
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,583
owner of Pattana Pictures,

1277
01:37:57,666 --> 01:38:02,083
along with the director of the hit
Closer Than Friends,

1278
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:04,750
and the star of that movie,
award-winning actress...

1279
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:05,833
BLOOD OF SUPHAN BURI

1280
01:38:05,916 --> 01:38:07,791
...Meena Ruksasuk!

1281
01:38:07,875 --> 01:38:09,541
Give them a big round of applause!

1282
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:13,666
I want to know
if your movie is still worth it,

1283
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:16,291
making it for only one person to see.

1284
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:20,541
[camera shutters clicking]

1285
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:25,208
I'm sure that all the members of the press

1286
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:28,916
and honored guests who are
gathered here today would like to know

1287
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:32,458
all about this new film project.

1288
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:33,958
And, of course,

1289
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:38,791
what is on everyone's mind
is the relationship

1290
01:38:38,875 --> 01:38:44,041
between our talented director
and our leading lady.

1291
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:45,833
So without further ado,

1292
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,833
I invite the members of the press
to go ahead with your questions.

1293
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:51,416
Go ahead.

1294
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:56,333
This is for the producer. Why do you
want to make Blood of Suphan Buri?

1295
01:38:57,708 --> 01:39:00,291
I am originally from Suphan Buri,

1296
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:03,791
so this is just a way to give back
to my home province.

1297
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:08,458
Thank you. Next question from the press?

1298
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:10,333
Next question is for the director.

1299
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,958
Why did you pick Pang
to be your lead actress?

1300
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,041
Because there is no one better suited
for the role than her.

1301
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:21,458
Is it also
because you are in a relationship?

1302
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,875
[press members murmuring]

1303
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:27,125
I can't lie and say that was not a factor.

1304
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,416
I knew it.

1305
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
[reporter] So the reason
you cast Ms. Pang Meena

1306
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:33,750
is because of your romantic relationship?

1307
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,916
And because she is perfect for the role.

1308
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:39,666
[Ple] But don't you already have a wife?

1309
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:45,875
[John] I'm glad you asked that question.

1310
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:49,708
We already have a divorce.

1311
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:51,208
[press members murmuring]

1312
01:39:55,833 --> 01:40:00,583
I have this divorce certificate here
because I want everyone to know

1313
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:02,333
that Pang did nothing wrong.

1314
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:08,250
What happened at our wedding
was all my fault.

1315
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,166
I should have got
the official divorce earlier,

1316
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,666
even though we had been separated
for a long time.

1317
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,750
I was wrong to get it done too late.

1318
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:22,125
But that's not so,
according to what your ex-wife told me.

1319
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:28,416
She said that,
yes, you did ask for a divorce.

1320
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:32,666
But she did not want to lose money
to you in a divorce settlement.

1321
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,583
So she refused to agree to a divorce.

1322
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,333
That's not true.

1323
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:40,791
If she didn't want a divorce,
then how do I have this certificate?

1324
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:45,041
Because you signed
an agreement with your ex-wife

1325
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:47,958
that you would not ask
for any of her money

1326
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:52,291
because you had your hopes set on
taking money from this movie budget.

1327
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:54,250
What's more,

1328
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:58,500
this man thinks that this piece of paper
means he can fool me again.

1329
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,875
And did he succeed?

1330
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:05,916
A guy like this can only fool me once.

1331
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,875
So why did you agree to star in his movie?

1332
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:10,791
[press members murmuring]

1333
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:17,166
I'm sure John planned all of this himself.

1334
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,958
The reason I came here today

1335
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:25,500
is because I wanted everyone
to know the truth about him.

1336
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,625
As for me starring in this movie?

1337
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:33,625
In this lifetime, I will never work
with this director ever again.

1338
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,125
[press members applauding]

1339
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,791
Thank you, everyone,
for your time and understanding.

1340
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:46,333
Pang!

1341
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:47,750
[camera shutters clicking]

1342
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:52,250
Follow her!
See if Pang will give us an interview!

1343
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:08,625
[inaudible]

1344
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:20,583
[producer]
So he just runs like this every day?

1345
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:21,791
[man] Yes.

1346
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:24,833
Why is he running?

1347
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:27,750
He's not making my movie anymore?

1348
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:30,083
He said he doesn't want to do it anymore.

1349
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,000
Goddammit!

1350
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:35,541
If he's not going to make a movie,
what the hell is he going to do?

1351
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:37,416
He said he wants
to be a competitive runner.

1352
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,791
A runner? [chuckles]

1353
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:39,875
Yeah.

1354
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:43,666
[producer] This asshole
is some kind of Grump!

1355
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:44,875
[man] Forrest Gump, sir.

1356
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,625
[producer] Yeah,
he thinks he's Forrest Gump,

1357
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,708
but he's not.

1358
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:52,333
-He's an artist.
-Hmm.

1359
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,791
He needs to make damn movies.

1360
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,875
[Kheng] We just need to give him
a little bit of time.

1361
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,375
[producer] Screw that!

1362
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:00,916
I gave him a shitload of time already.

1363
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,666
I should have just listened to my friend.

1364
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,416
What did your friend say?

1365
01:43:05,916 --> 01:43:09,291
He said, "You don't just need money
to make a movie."

1366
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:10,458
Why is that?

1367
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,208
You also need to be a fool!

1368
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:15,708
-[laughing]
-[bicycle bell ringing]

1369
01:43:22,291 --> 01:43:24,416
She looks familiar.

1370
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:27,416
She's the famous actress, Pang.

1371
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:30,958
Oh. This is Pang.

1372
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:33,416
That's right.

1373
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,000
[bicycle bell continues ringing]

1374
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,208
Where are you going, Tukkae?

1375
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:44,666
Nowhere, really.

1376
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:48,208
Aren't you going to finish your movie?

1377
01:43:50,416 --> 01:43:53,500
What about you? Aren't you going
to get your master's degree abroad?

1378
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,875
Yes, but I want to do
one more movie before I go.

1379
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:00,208
[Tukkae] What movie?

1380
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:05,583
It's a movie without a title.

1381
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:12,958
But I heard that director is
no longer working on it anymore.

1382
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:21,375
Why not? I saw the first half
of the movie, and it looked promising.

1383
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
What about Blood of Suphan Buri?

1384
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,750
I prefer the Chiang Khan story.

1385
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:41,083
Why do you want to be in this movie?

1386
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:46,708
Why did you want to make it?

1387
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:53,375
Because this movie...

1388
01:44:55,083 --> 01:44:56,416
This movie is about you.

1389
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:05,125
And the reason I want to be in your movie

1390
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:10,958
is because it is

1391
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:14,916
about us.

1392
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,833
[kids clapping]

1393
01:45:29,791 --> 01:45:31,208
[men clapping, whistling]

1394
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,625
So he's coming back,
and he wants to make a romance now?

1395
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:45,708
That's right.

1396
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:47,708
And what about my Mae Nak Riverside?

1397
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:49,583
I think that's up to you.

1398
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,250
Up to me? What the hell?

1399
01:45:51,333 --> 01:45:54,375
It's up to that goddamn artist!

1400
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:56,500
So what do you want to do?

1401
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,916
I get to pick the name for this new movie.

1402
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:03,666
What are you going to call it?

1403
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:07,583
Tukkae Loves Pang to Death.
[chuckles]

1404
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:10,041
-Tukkae Loves Pang to Death?
-That's right.

1405
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:14,750
I think people will assume
it's a ghost story with that title.

1406
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,583
The hell are you talking about?

1407
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:18,583
Ghost story?

1408
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:21,416
Mae Nak, Por Mak, that's a ghost story.

1409
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,458
But if you have "Death" in the title,
people assume a ghost story.

1410
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:28,125
"To death" is just an expression
that means "a lot." Don't you get it?

1411
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:29,625
So "to death" means "a lot"?

1412
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:33,291
-A lot more than "a lot."
-Okay.

1413
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:34,666
Is "so much" more than "a lot"?

1414
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:38,041
-"So much" is not enough!
-You're killing me.

1415
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:39,916
That's closer! Tukkae Loves Pang to Death!

1416
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,375
[Tukkae] Tukkae Loves Pang to Death,
scene 33, take one.

1417
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,541
[music playing]

1418
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:50,666
Action!

1419

What did you think, boss?

1420
01:47:19,791 --> 01:47:21,083
That's Nawarat!

1421
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:22,333
I know. I know.

1422
01:47:58,708 --> 01:48:00,708
[Pang's mother] You like painting,
but what do you want to do 

1423
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:02,416
when you get older, Tukkae?

1424
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,375
[Tukkae] I want to be a billboard artist
like Master Pong.

1425
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:08,416
[Pang's mother] What do you want to do 
when you grow up, Pang?

1426
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,000
[Pang] I want to be a movie star!

1427
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:11,458
[Pang's mother] Really?

1428
01:48:11,541 --> 01:48:13,708
Why do you want to be a movie star, dear?

1429
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:16,791
[Pang] So I can see myself painted
on a giant billboard someday!

TUKKAE LOVES PANG TO DEATH

1431
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:22,250
[Tukkae] If you become a movie star,
I'll paint your billboard myself!

1432
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:25,041
[Pang] You have to make sure
it's the biggest one ever, okay?

1433
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:26,333
[Tukkae] Definitely. The biggest one ever!

1434
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:27,458
[Pang] You promise?

1435
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:29,291
-[Tukkae] I promise!

why can't we have dinner
at Miss Pang's house?

Why would we go there?

01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,458
She's right over here!

-You want a smack?

WHILE I CONTINUED WORK
ON MAE NAK RIVERSCAPE.

1447
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,541
PANG DIDN'T SAY HOW LONG SHE'D BE AWAY.

1448
01:49:35,708 --> 01:49:38,083
SHE ONLY SAID

1449
01:49:38,166 --> 01:49:42,000
THAT SHE'D COME BACK FOR SURE

1450
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:44,541
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT BACK HOME

1451

IS WAITING FOR HER
