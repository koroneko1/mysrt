00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660
&lrm;-Wow! That girl is incredible!
&lrm;-I love her!

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900
&lrm;She's totally passionate about her art!

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.220
&lrm;<i>Clara, in a few months</i>
&lrm;<i>you've become an international sensation</i>

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.940
&lrm;<i>with your singing and style!</i>

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
&lrm;<i>Apparently, you sing and dance</i>
&lrm;<i>in your sleep! Do you ever stop?</i>

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.260
&lrm;<i>Never, you see!</i>
&lrm;<i>Dancing and singing are everything to me!</i>

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.660
&lrm;<i>And I'm happy to share the joy</i>
&lrm;<i>of song and dance</i>

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.580
&lrm;<i>to the amazing people of France!</i>

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.060
&lrm;See that, Tikki? She's a true artist!

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380
&lrm;<i>You've come to Paris to film the video</i>
&lrm;<i>for your next song, titled...</i>

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.380
&lrm;Miraculous!

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.380
&lrm;Huh?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.540
&lrm;<i>I really admire and adore</i>
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.620
&lrm;<i>An homage to them I wanted to pay,</i>
&lrm;<i>because they inspire me every single day!</i>

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.340
&lrm;Aaah! She's going to be doing
&lrm;a song about me? I mean, Ladybug!

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
&lrm;Oh, I'm so excited I could... faint!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.940
&lrm;<i>Auditions will be held</i>
&lrm;<i>at the Grand Palais hotel, right?</i>

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.980
&lrm;<i>I hear you've already found</i>
&lrm;<i>a Cat Noir.</i>

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.260
&lrm;<i>-Care to share the news?</i>
&lrm;<i>-My lips are sealed!</i>

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.180
&lrm;<i>But soon he'll be revealed.</i>

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.980
&lrm;<i>We must still cast Ladybug and extras,</i>
&lrm;<i>by the way,</i>

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.620
&lrm;<i>-so come on out and audition today!</i>
&lrm;-[phone rings]

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.180
&lrm;Aaah!

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580
&lrm;<i>Marinette, did you hear that?</i>
&lrm;<i>We're heading over to audition,</i>

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.140
&lrm;<i>and you're coming, too!</i>

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.900
&lrm;<i>So don't pull a "Marinette special" on us,</i>
&lrm;<i>OK?</i>

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.220
&lrm;And miss my chance to meet
&lrm;Clara Nightingale in the flesh? No way!

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.100
&lrm;-I'll meet you there!
&lrm;<i>-See ya!</i>

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.820
&lrm;You're not auditioning
&lrm;for the role of Ladybug are you?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.460
&lrm;Of course not! We just wanna have some fun
&lrm;as extras in the video.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.940
&lrm;I'd never reveal my secret identity!

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.660
&lrm;All right, then, Marinette!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.940
&lrm;I'm proud of you!

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.060
&lrm;It will be a promotion for the opening
&lrm;of our stores in Korea and China.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.300
&lrm;-You don't have a choice.
&lrm;-But Father!

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.580
&lrm;I've designed her costumes
&lrm;from the start.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.940
&lrm;My suggestion of using you pleased her.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.140
&lrm;She's only seen you in advertisements,
&lrm;but admires you a lot.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.820
&lrm;I'm hoping you won't let us down.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.460
&lrm;Of course not, Father.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.220
&lrm;Extras on the left.
&lrm;Auditionees for Ladybug on the right.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.020
&lrm;Great choice of fabric...
&lrm;and these seams... Amazing craftsmanship!

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.860
&lrm;There's no way I can wear this!

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.460
&lrm;Yeah, I've always found that little bell
&lrm;so ridiculous! Then again...

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.260
&lrm;the costume is what you really wanted
&lrm;deep down, isn't it?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.740
&lrm;No, Plagg! I mean everyone's
&lrm;going to realise I'm the real Cat Noir!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.020
&lrm;No way! People are blind!

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.660
&lrm;[knock on door]
&lrm;You ready, Adrien?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.020
&lrm;Uh... Coming! Just a sec!

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.140
&lrm;If they see me with this mask on,
&lrm;they'll recognise me!

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.340
&lrm;I can't wear it!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.860
&lrm;Right, now, I'm going to try to act
&lrm;as lame as I possibly can.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.220
&lrm;Hopefully, they'll have to replace me.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.260
&lrm;[gasps]

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.740
&lrm;Thank you for coming, all of you!
&lrm;This is like a dream come true!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.660
&lrm;Together, we'll all dance and sing!
&lrm;It's going to be so awesome and amazing!

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.740
&lrm;We're going to be in Clara Nightingale's
&lrm;music video! This is humungous!

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.340
&lrm;I can't believe this is happening!

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.300
&lrm;And now, meet our rising star,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.140
&lrm;Adrien and Cat Noir!

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.540
&lrm;<i>The costume fits you like a glove,</i>
&lrm;<i>as I knew it would.</i>

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.300
&lrm;<i>-But where is your mask?</i>
&lrm;-Uh... I couldn't find it anywhere!

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.780
&lrm;I'll take care of it!

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.980
&lrm;It's no biggie. It's OK.
&lrm;We don't need it for tryouts anyway.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.940
&lrm;Come on!

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.780
&lrm;Didn't I tell you that Adrien
&lrm;looked a little bit like Cat Noir?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.580
&lrm;Oh, whatever!

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.220
&lrm;He's a thousand times
&lrm;more amazing than Cat Noir!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.100
&lrm;Miaow.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.740
&lrm;You must be starving
&lrm;from all this waiting!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.900
&lrm;Oh, look! She's coming in our direction!

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.780
&lrm;Ah, there you are!
&lrm;Here's a hug, because you are Ladybug!

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.940
&lrm;[gasp]

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.860
&lrm;I have no idea what you're talking about!

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.460
&lrm;You did what Ladybug would have.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.540
&lrm;Just the same.
&lrm;Your heart is pure like hers.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.340
&lrm;-What's your name?
&lrm;-Uh... Ma... Marinette!

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.740
&lrm;Marinette, say it's so,
&lrm;will you please play Ladybug in my video?

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.020
&lrm;Yes! She'd be awesome!

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.420
&lrm;Go, Marinette! You deserve it!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.500
&lrm;That's so nice of you.
&lrm;And... I'm one of you hugest fans!

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.020
&lrm;But I came here to be an extra
&lrm;with my friends

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.660
&lrm;and I really want to stay with them.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.500
&lrm;[gasp]

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.220
&lrm;That's a pity, a shame,
&lrm;but I understand, it's true.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.500
&lrm;That's a very cool gesture,
&lrm;very "Ladybug" of you.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.380
&lrm;Just sit over there, for make-up, OK?

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.620
&lrm;I'll ask your friends
&lrm;to be sent over right away.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.020
&lrm;Oh! Thank you, thank you!

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.700
&lrm;Good job, Marinette!
&lrm;You didn't give in to the temptation!

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.620
&lrm;You're crazy!

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.220
&lrm;You turned down filming with Adrien
&lrm;to be with us?

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.900
&lrm;You really are the best!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.660
&lrm;Thank you all for coming!
&lrm;You can go home now!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.340
&lrm;Uh... Heads up!
&lrm;Brat alert in the immediate vicinity!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.220
&lrm;Don't worry. Chloé doesn't
&lrm;a stand a chance of being chosen.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.220
&lrm;Wow! What's happening to you today?
&lrm;I have to bow before so much wisdom!

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.860
&lrm;That's right. From now on,
&lrm;the name's Master Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.500
&lrm;[laughter]

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.780
&lrm;Your "Ladybug" has arrived.
&lrm;So, when does the shoot begin?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.980
&lrm;Chloé, everyone has to audition,
&lrm;you know that!

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.220
&lrm;Oh, yeah! That little formality.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.060
&lrm;[cheering]

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.620
&lrm;Ah... Ha, ha! It's been a while!

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.180
&lrm;Eight years of private classes
&lrm;with Aurélie Dupont from the Opera!

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.660
&lrm;I know. I'm breathtaking!

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.940
&lrm;You've definitely
&lrm;got enough talent for me.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.580
&lrm;But you and Cat Noir have to be
&lrm;a good match, you see?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.220
&lrm;No problem! Adrikins and I have known
&lrm;each other since we were little!

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.140
&lrm;The son of the greatest fashion designer
&lrm;and the daughter of the mayor of Paris.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.900
&lrm;That would be just perfect.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.820
&lrm;Grr.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.980
&lrm;Is there a problem, Master Dupain-Cheng?

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.220
&lrm;Chloé playing Ladybug? No way!
&lrm;Not gonna happen!

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.100
&lrm;Oh? That bothers you more
&lrm;than not being with Adrien in the video?

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.820
&lrm;Uh... if I were Ladybug, I wouldn't want
&lrm;a brat like Chloé playing me!

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.580
&lrm;What do you think, Gabriel?

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.460
&lrm;<i>Hmm. Artistically speaking,</i>

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.740
&lrm;<i>the other girl would have been ideal.</i>
&lrm;<i>But it's time to start.</i>

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.420
&lrm;<i>-We'll make do with Miss Bourgeois.</i>
&lrm;-I trust you.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.420
&lrm;Woohoo! We're both going to be
&lrm;in a music video, Adrikins!

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.260
&lrm;Or should I say "Adri-Cat"?

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.460
&lrm;Hee, hee! Get it? Adri-Cat?

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.820
&lrm;Adri-Cat... Yeah... Ha, ha!

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.860
&lrm;Hey, wait!

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.940
&lrm;I've changed my mind.
&lrm;I do want be Ladybug!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.380
&lrm;Awesome! This will be the best video yet!
&lrm;Thank you, thank you, Marinette!

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.580
&lrm;I'm really sorry, what's-your-name,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.460
&lrm;but you can still be an extra
&lrm;if you're game!

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.380
&lrm;What? You want me to be a mere extra?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.420
&lrm;Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.100
&lrm;Oh! Stop annoying me
&lrm;with that stupid, dumb bear, Jean-Eudes!

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.940
&lrm;[gasps]

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.180
&lrm;Hmm.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.020
&lrm;Ooh! Great choice of fabric...
&lrm;And these seams... Amazing craftsmanship!

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.620
&lrm;Almost like the real thing,
&lrm;don't you think?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.340
&lrm;Yeah, it's too well done! Oh, wow, Tikki!
&lrm;I've really messed up this time!

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.300
&lrm;If they see me with this mask on,
&lrm;they'll all recognise me, for sure!

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.420
&lrm;-There's no way I can wear it!
&lrm;-You ready, Marinette?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.580
&lrm;Yes! I'm coming!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.580
&lrm;-There she is!
&lrm;-Woohoo!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.700
&lrm;Spot on and spotlight!

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.700
&lrm;-So, you're Ladybug and Cat Noir, right?
&lrm;-No!

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.060
&lrm;[both] Uh? Oh, yes! Ha, ha! Uh...

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.540
&lrm;But sweetie, there's no way
&lrm;we can cancel the shoot now!

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.500
&lrm;I'm going to call Mom and tell her
&lrm;how all my dreams have been crushed.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.740
&lrm;Aaah! Let's not disturb our queen
&lrm;for such a little matter,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.180
&lrm;right, my little princess?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.420
&lrm;One... two... and three!

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.500
&lrm;Your dance moves need to be
&lrm;synchronised if you can.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.060
&lrm;So you'll need to hold each other
&lrm;by the hand.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.740
&lrm;OK. [nervous laugh]

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.980
&lrm;[laughter] Not like that!
&lrm;Don't be shy. Like lovers do.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.860
&lrm;-Give it a try.
&lrm;-[gasp]

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.700
&lrm;Marinette's jaw will drop
&lrm;when she sees these pics!

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.140
&lrm;Oh! I can't believe how much they look
&lrm;like the real Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.700
&lrm;One final task, put on the mask!

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.780
&lrm;-Uh! Well...
&lrm;-Uh! I didn't see it. I looked everywhere

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.700
&lrm;-in the dressing room, but it was...
&lrm;-nowhere to be found!

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.060
&lrm;[laughter]

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.780
&lrm;They don't look a thing
&lrm;like Ladybug and Cat Noir now!

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.500
&lrm;It's OK! I've found them!

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.500
&lrm;[gasp]

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.420
&lrm;Go ahead, put them on, you two!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.060
&lrm;We've got a lot
&lrm;of singing and dancing to do!

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.100
&lrm;-Woohoo!
&lrm;-Come on!

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.700
&lrm;I'm sorry,
&lrm;but my staff just realised

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.540
&lrm;you never submitted permit A-38
&lrm;as stipulated in the circular B-65

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.180
&lrm;that one can only get at counter C, which
&lrm;is closed for renovations until August.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.220
&lrm;Which means you don't have a permit
&lrm;for the shoot anywhere in France.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.420
&lrm;-I... I don't understand.
&lrm;-It means no more dancing,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.380
&lrm;no more singing today.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.060
&lrm;The Nightingale
&lrm;can spread her wings and fly away!

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.860
&lrm;Oh! Did you hear that? I made a rhyme!
&lrm;How talented am I?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.340
&lrm;No! The video needs to be shot here,
&lrm;in Paris, the capital of love,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.260
&lrm;the city of Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.460
&lrm;This ruins all of my plans!
&lrm;I'm so sorry, my beloved fans!

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.620
&lrm;[sobs]

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.860
&lrm;Ah! Tears of disenchantment.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.140
&lrm;Such sweet music to my ears!

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.420
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her!

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.500
&lrm;Frightningale, I am Hawk Moth.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.260
&lrm;So they tried to silence you?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.620
&lrm;With the power I'm giving you, the world
&lrm;will be nothing but song and dance!

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.700
&lrm;Yes, Hawk Moth, thank you
&lrm;for making this dream come true!

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.980
&lrm;The show is over.
&lrm;You all have to leave now!

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.780
&lrm;[cackles]

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.340
&lrm;Sing, dance or rhyme.
&lrm;Or you'll be frozen in no time!

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.980
&lrm;Ugh! What is she talking about?
&lrm;Dancing and making rhymes?

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.460
&lrm;Why not play the trumpet too,
&lrm;while we're at it?

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.180
&lrm;[gasp] Chloé, hon--

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.020
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.780
&lrm;Please, please! I'll keep up this rhyme!
&lrm;Don't make me freeze! Not this time!

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.060
&lrm;Oh, bravo! And you've got the right tempo!

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.260
&lrm;[screaming]

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.140
&lrm;Time to transform!

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.380
&lrm;Tikki! Spots on!

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.020
&lrm;Yeah!

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.780
&lrm;Ready to vocalise?

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.780
&lrm;Plagg! Claws out!

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.460
&lrm;Sing, dance or rhyme

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.220
&lrm;or you'll be frozen in no time!

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.580
&lrm;I thought you were a fan of ours,
&lrm;Nightingale,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.460
&lrm;-so you should know we fight villains!
&lrm;-I'm Frightningale from here on out!

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.780
&lrm;For ever and ever, there's no doubt!

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.380
&lrm;If you stand in my way,
&lrm;there'll be a price to pay!

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.220
&lrm;You have to come round!
&lrm;Don't let negative emotions take you over!

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.340
&lrm;Song and dance will make the world
&lrm;a better place! Don't agree with me?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.340
&lrm;Ha! Then you're a disgrace!

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.700
&lrm;I can help you, if you give me your akuma!

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.860
&lrm;I won't let you take my akuma away.
&lrm;I like the new me and I'm here to stay!

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.140
&lrm;Do you mind if I join in the dance?

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.540
&lrm;You're like all the others,
&lrm;but you can't silence me!

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.140
&lrm;I'm trying to make the world better,
&lrm;can't you see?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.700
&lrm;Strike them, Frightningale!

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.660
&lrm;It'll be easier to overpower them
&lrm;if they have to sing and dance.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.820
&lrm;Then no one can interfere
&lrm;with your dream.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.300
&lrm;Now is your chance!

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.780
&lrm;Do you think the two of you
&lrm;can win this through and through?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.780
&lrm;Two is always better than one!
&lrm;Cat Noir! I'll take the left!

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.860
&lrm;I'm on it!

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.140
&lrm;-Hey! Look out!
&lrm;-Oops! Sorry, Milady!

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.460
&lrm;Welcome to my musical show!
&lrm;I hope it will be your fatal blow!

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.020
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.380
&lrm;Wait! Stay right here and dance
&lrm;or else you'll be frozen...

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500
&lrm;without a chance!

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.540
&lrm;Yeah, you're right, we have to rhyme!
&lrm;Not so easy... all the time?

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.860
&lrm;-[sighs]
&lrm;-Nice work.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.060
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir cannot fight back!

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.980
&lrm;They are be to busy singing and dancing,
&lrm;while we're on the attack.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.420
&lrm;Now hurry, my sweet Nightingale,
&lrm;it's both of their Miraculous that I lack.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.340
&lrm;Hawk Moth, you bet. Miraculous you'll get!

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.540
&lrm;Stay in charge, don't blow a fuse!
&lrm;Don't forget your dancing moves!

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.300
&lrm;Dancing fight moves...
&lrm;like my Capoeira grooves!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.860
&lrm;Ha, ha! Why is Cat Noir so dumb?

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.780
&lrm;He doesn't even know
&lrm;50 plus 50 as a sum!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.500
&lrm;-Yes, I do! The dummy is you! It's--
&lrm;-50 plus 50 is 102!

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.780
&lrm;-Huh?
&lrm;-Your maths is crazy. Count again, Milady.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.380
&lrm;50 plus 50, the sum doesn't rhyme!

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.220
&lrm;One more false move
&lrm;and you're trapped, big time!

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.460
&lrm;I almost made a serious boo-boo,
&lrm;but I didn't, thanks to you!

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.940
&lrm;You think you two are being so clever,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.060
&lrm;but soon you'll tire yourselves
&lrm;and be frozen forever!

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.140
&lrm;It's not in our favour, at a glance,
&lrm;because we constantly have to advance

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.860
&lrm;while keeping up the song and dance.
&lrm;We can leave nothing to chance!

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.060
&lrm;Sweet bugaboo, I agree,
&lrm;but what possible plan do you see?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.940
&lrm;Our last weapon can do her harm.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.020
&lrm;It is my... Lucky Charm!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.620
&lrm;What is this thrown our way?
&lrm;Handcuffs, I would say...

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.980
&lrm;We know we have to stop her,
&lrm;but what solution do you offer?

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.740
&lrm;Hmm.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:48.140
&lrm;They're not for her. They're meant for us!
&lrm;Now, Cat Noir, do your stuff!

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.580
&lrm;-What's with the frown? What's going down?
&lrm;-I can't find a rhyme.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.420
&lrm;-Can you help me this time?
&lrm;-You're a sweet talker,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.380
&lrm;rhymer, dancer and walker!

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.980
&lrm;Look at the bright side today.
&lrm;Don't be pessimistic

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.340
&lrm;and make way...

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.540
&lrm;For optimism!

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.540
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.940
&lrm;Connected, we are one.
&lrm;Our movements are synched,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.500
&lrm;so let's get a move on,
&lrm;because we are linked!

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.820
&lrm;As if we were dancing without thought,
&lrm;take this shot!

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.260
&lrm;By any chance,
&lrm;will you grant me this dance?

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.900
&lrm;Let's cut a rug, Miladybug!

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.340
&lrm;You can't bend the rules!
&lrm;Dancing tied up is cheating, fools!

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.540
&lrm;When someone's akumatised,
&lrm;we never compromise!

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.380
&lrm;You're feeling unsteady.
&lrm;You know you've lost already!

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.940
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.540
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.540
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.820
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.740
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.940
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Ladybug? Cat Noir?

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.020
&lrm;-What are you doing here?

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.300
&lrm;You were akumatised by Hawk Moth.
&lrm;But everything's back to normal again.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.300
&lrm;I was saved by you?

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.660
&lrm;How amazing! Too good to be true!

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.780
&lrm;And I have an idea how you can finish your
&lrm;video without anyone getting in your way.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.020
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! Simply the best! ♪</i>

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.740
&lrm;<i>♪ Up to the test when things go wrong! ♪</i>

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.300
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! The luckiest! ♪</i>

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.100

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.300
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous ♪</i>

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.620
&lrm;-It's so much better like this!

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.380
&lrm;Now everybody gets to be in it!

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.060
&lrm;Besides, even though they kinda looked
&lrm;like Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.060
&lrm;-they really weren't believable.
&lrm;-I couldn't agree more.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.340
&lrm;And I wouldn't have had any fun.
&lrm;It was so much better being with you guys!

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.980
&lrm;I prefer this version too. I couldn't have
&lrm;pulled off playing Cat Noir.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.300
&lrm;I know! Worlds apart!

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.260
&lrm;Huh?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.300
&lrm;Uh, what I meant was, that you'd be
&lrm;more lame as Cat Noir than in real life.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.980
&lrm;No, not that you're lame in real life,
&lrm;right? Just compared to Cat Noir.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.900
&lrm;You don't look a thing like him.
&lrm;That's what I mean!

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.300
&lrm;And you don't look a thing
&lrm;like Ladybug either!

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.860
&lrm;Uh... Yeah! I mean,
&lrm;I'm sure she's not as funny as you are!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.220
&lrm;[laughter]

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.380
&lrm;Yeah.
