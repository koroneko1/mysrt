Emilie, I miss you every moment.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.900
But, one day, I will get the Miraculous
of Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.980
repair the mistakes of the past,
and make sure you return to us.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.260
Yeah!

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660
-Today is the day! I can feel it!
-Bet you my skates she won't do it!

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.700
And I'll bet my favourite unicorn plush
that she will!

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.020
Oh! Marinette!

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.820
What?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.020
Aw!

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.380
I was thinking,
maybe Adrien doesn't like berets?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.900
Or hates it when people
celebrate his fifth name's day?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.780
Or maybe he wouldn't want to know
that I love him?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.540
Don't worry! Princess Twinklepeach
will be happy with me!

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.700
The only way you'll know
is to tell him how you really feel.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.220
I know, but...

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.940
That's it, Marinette! No more picnics,
sleepovers or going to the movies with us

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.620
until you've given him that gift!

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.140
You made that cap for St Athanase's Day,
which is today!

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.140
How's Adrien supposed to know
you're thinking of him

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.180
on his fifth name's day
if you don't give him your gift?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
She's right! Today is the day!

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.620
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.660
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.580
Rise and shine!

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500
Behold, the goddess
of self-confidence has awaken!

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.100
- Go, girl!
- You're gonna do it!

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.660
And don't forget the card!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.620
Are you really going to do this?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.820
I am, Tikki!
Know what I won't take for an answer?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.020
<i>-</i><i> No.</i>
-OK, well, um... when will he be back?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.900
<i>I can't tell you. Goodbye, young lady.</i>

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.420
But Adrien's fencing class ended
27 minutes ago. He should be back by now.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.980
Maybe you can give him his present
tomorrow at school?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.020
No! You heard what Rose said.
I can't back out again.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.900
Since he's not back yet,
I can go through the window.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.300
Oh, no, no, no!

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460
You know it's not a good idea
to use your powers for personal reasons!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.380
I'll be quick, Tikki.
No one will ever know.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.660
Mmh?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.660
Tikki, spots on!

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.140
Adrien's trophies!

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.620
Adrien's basketball hoop!

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.180
Adrien's foosball table!

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.980
Adrien's desk!

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.940
Adrien's video games!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380
Adrien's bed!

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.540
You're very late, Adrien.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.100
The award ceremony
took longer than expected,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.340
then we gave Kagami a ride home.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.020
Will you let my father know I won?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.780
As soon as he's done with his work.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.980
Oh, Adrien's scent!

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.580
Ah! Adrien's present!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.980
Oh! The card! I forgot the card! Uh...

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.020
This should do!

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.660
Signed, "Marinette".

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.980
Oh!

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.340
Ladybug?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.780
Oh!

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.140
Why would Ladybug
leave me a gift from Marinette?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.820
And with a heart embroidered on it?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.540
Uh, well, it's obvious,
because Marinette asked her to.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.940
Or because...
Ladybug and Marinette are the same person.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.780
<i>You're my friend.</i>
<i>And I'd never want to lie to a friend.</i>

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.740
<i>But why do you think it would be lying?</i>

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.420
<i>Because there's this boy I...</i>

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.340
Me!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.860
No, no, no! It doesn't make any sense!

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.700
-Marinette is Marinette, and Ladybug is...
-Marinette!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
OK! Adrien, this whole thing
smells like rotten cheese!

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.820
You know you aren't supposed to know
each other's secret identities.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.060
Just because I know her secret identity
doesn't mean she has to know about mine.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.580
Everything will be just fine, I promise.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.780
Adrien! Putting a smelly piece of cheese
in a box doesn't stop it from smelling!

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.460
-Bunnyx?
-Minibug! Something happened today

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.260
that caused a major disaster
in the future.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.260
I'm not sure what it was
or when it happened exactly.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.780
Nothing unusual to report on your side?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.980
-Uh...
-Think, Minibug! Think!

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.180
-Uh... No!
-Argh!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.580
-In my burrow, now!
-Aaah!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.700
Wow! It's a lot bigger on the inside!

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.420
Wow!

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.300
What's that for?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.900
You wanna know what you're getting
for your next birthday?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.180
-No, of course not!
-Exactly!

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.380
What about you? You know about
all your birthday presents?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.260
I know about some of them.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.540
Normally, we have to avoid interfering
with past or present events

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.140
as much as possible,
but this is serious, Minibug.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.260
Our future is in danger. I need your help!

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.460
What happened here?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.300
The less you know about the future,
the better!

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.180
Just do your thing.
Capture the akuma and restore order.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.860
Then the train will be back on track.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.380
You're not staying?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.860
I gotta stand ready to jump back into time
and try something else, in case you fail.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.780
Mwah!

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.220
- <i>♪ Little kitty on a roof ♪</i>
-Cat... Noir?

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.220
- Cat Noir!
-Milady?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.460
I thought I'd lost you! Oh, I was feline
so sad that you were gone!

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.140
What's happened to you? No, don't tell me!
We're gonna fix everything!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.140
Of course we're gonna fix everything
now that you're back

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.340
and now that you're going to

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.900
give me your Miraculous!

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.780
My Miraculous?
What's wrong with you, Cat Noir?

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.060
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude, milady.
Could you hand me your Miraculous, please?

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.380
Cat Blanc has gotten into some mischief.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.820
You've been akumatised, Cat Noir.
You don't need my Miraculous.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.980
You need me to de-evilise you.
Let me help you!

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.900
Save me.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.940
My poor kitty. Tell me...

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.420
Do you remember where the akuma went?

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.500
Right here! But it's already broken!

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.700
Now, you're breaking more than my heart,
Marinette!

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.660
What?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.300
-What did you say?
-Give me a hug, Marinette!

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.260
You're wrong! I'm not Marinette!

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.300
<i>It's impossible!</i>
<i>I never told you anything!</i>

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.060
Hmm!

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.860
<i>Huh?</i>

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.220
<i>Ladybug?</i>

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.020
Oh, no! What have you done, Marinette!

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.300
<i>Ta-dah! I did it!</i>

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.180
-I'm so proud of you!
-You rock!

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.260
How is this possible?
That's not what I remember!

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.580
So, how did you get to Adrien?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.740
I... I was very convincing!

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.660
Marinette!

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.420
I have something to tell you.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.780
I've realised...

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.900
I've realised that you're not
just a friend to me.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.860
I've always felt you were more than that.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.900
And now I know why!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.140
Oh!

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.420
Does, uh, does this mean
that you... you like the beret?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.500
It means that I love you.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.060
It's worse than I thought.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.020
Come on, Ladybug, quick!

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.780
Give me your Miraculous so I can make
everything go back to the way it was!

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.540
Mega-cataclysm!

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.860
Oh, no! What happened?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.900
Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!!

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.740
<i>It's heartbreak</i>
<i>for all the girls of Paris,</i>

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.980
<i>as supermodel Adrien Agreste</i>
<i>has a girlfriend,</i>

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.260
<i>classmate Marinette Dupain-Cheng!</i>

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.660
You have to succeed, Ladybug!
Capture his akuma, now!

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.220
Things were purr-fect until Hawk Moth
found out about everything.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.740
Once the cat is outta the bag,
it's a matter of time till everyone knows!

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.780
It was our love
that did this to the world, milady.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.940
But how did it?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.660
<i>Miss Dupain-Cheng,</i>

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.620
<i>your relationship with my son is</i>
<i>detrimental to the Gabriel Agreste brand.</i>

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.740
<i>I demand you to stop seeing him at once.</i>

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.420
But I didn't do anything.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.060
She loves Adrien and Adrien loves her!
You can't decide...

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.100
<i>If you refuse, I will not hesitate</i>
<i>to withdraw Adrien from school.</i>

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.460
<i>And he will never see his friends again!</i>

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.700
Adrien doesn't deserve this.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.780
<i>Then make the right choice.</i>

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.620
Get out of my bakery! Now!

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.620
Marinette?
Why won't you come in? What's wrong?

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.700
Adrien, I...

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.420
Forgive me. We're just...
we're just not right for each other.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.260
What are you talking about?
Of course we are. We love each other!

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.580
No. I... don't love you anymore!

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.820
No, Marinette! Please let me through!
It can't end like this!

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.100
It can't end at all! I love her!

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.340
Everything is going as planned, sir.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.060
I've never felt such utter despair.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.820
Marinette Dupain-Cheng
will be my ultimate masterpiece!

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.580
Fly away, beautiful akuma,
and evilise this broken heart!

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.460
I beg you, please!

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.620
Marinette! Move!

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.340
Adrien?

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.260
Plagg! Claws out!

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.780
Cataclysm!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.460
Adrien!

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.340
You were about to be akumatised.
I didn't have a choice, milady!

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.780
Milady? How did you know? Our identities
were supposed to remain a secret!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.460
Everything will be OK, I promise.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.620
<i>Nathalie? Nathalie?</i>

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.060
It's Adrien, your son.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.780
He's...

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.700
He's Cat Noir.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.100
Cat Noir? My own son?

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.220
Ah! The Miraculous will soon be mine!

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.140
Oh! Huh?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.700
Hurry up!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.140
I'll find you, milady. And when I do,
you'll give me your Miraculous!

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.940
Time to de-evilise... Huh?

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.180
Looking for my akuma, milady?

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.780
There's a faster way to make this end,
you know.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.020
You just need to hand over
your Miraculous!

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.380
Never!

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.540
Lucky charm!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.140
An eraser?

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.260
I'd like to erase the past too,
but there's only one way to do that.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.020
You know that by merging our Miraculous
together, we'd be granted one wish, right?

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.940
Any wish we wanted?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.340
Well, my wish would be to fix everything,
so we could be in love again!

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.500
And have a hamster too. You've always
dreamed of having one. We'll call it...

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.740
Time to de-evil--

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.980
You're not even listening.
You don't understand.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.740
Aaah!

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.980
You're done, Hawk Moth!
Give us back your Miraculous!

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.700
You know what they say, the wave
of a moth's wing can set off a cataclysm!

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.780
I would put that cataclysm away
if I were you, Adrien.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.380
How do you... ?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:43.980
Mother?

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.980
I'm doing it for her, Adrien.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.380
For you. For us.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.420
Father?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.700
Why? Why? Why?

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.300
Why?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.260
We can save your mother,
using your Miraculous and hers.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.820
No! Just stop!

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.220
Don't listen to him! There would be
a terrible price to pay in exchange!

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.940
If she loves you,
she'll let you save your mother!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.700
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.460
Cat Blanc, I'm giving you
the infinite power of destruction!

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.420
Together, you and I will seize Ladybug's
Miraculous and awaken your mother!

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.460
Obey!

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.740
I'm sorry, Ladybug.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.740
Seize her Miraculous, my son!

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.620
No, Adrien! You have to resist!

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.620
How dare you? Not me, Adrien!

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.140
I... I don't know what to do!

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.380
Milady!

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.380
My prince!

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.700
Aaah!

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.660
Fix this nightmare, Ladybug. Please!

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.580
-What did you do to them?
-I didn't mean to.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.220
Why won't you try and help me fix it?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.460
The simple truth is,
you don't love me anymore!

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.700
So, I might as well destroy you,
me, our memories. Everything!

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.660
No!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.540
No, no, no! He's about to trigger
the end of the world! Ladybug!

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.980
OK, OK!
I'll give you my Miraculous, Cat Noir.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.300
I'm not Cat Noir anymore. I'm Cat Blanc.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.060
You will always be Cat Noir to me.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.420
No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.700
Time to de-evilise, Cat Noir.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.500
Gotcha!

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.660
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.980
Yes! Yes! You did it, Minibug!

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.740
Marinette, what happened? What's wrong?

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.980
You're still calling me Marinette.
You're not supposed to know who I am.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.180
It means that if I use my Miraculous
Ladybug to fix everything now...

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.980
You'll still have this memory of her.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.940
Of course!

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.900
I'm gonna fix everything, Cat Noir.
I promise.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.060
I know.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.620
Bring me back before you came to get me!

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.460
I don't have much time
before I lose my lucky charm!

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.220
I have to erase my mistake
to get things back to normal.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.180
This future is the result
from something of the past.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.180
I must not throw my eraser here and now,
I must throw my eraser back then!

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.980
Do you know how Cat Noir found out
about your secret identity?

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.140
I think so. When I went into Adrien's
house as Ladybug, he probably saw me!

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.980
He figured out Ladybug is Marinette
because of the note on the gift!

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.340
But I'm not sure what happened next.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.260
He probably told Nino, who told Alya,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.740
who wrote about it on the Ladyblog!

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.180
They would never do that.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.820
But Adrien probably told someone,
who told someone else and so on,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.540
until it was all over the news!

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.460
The best-kept secrets
are the ones you never share!

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.900
Signed, "Marinette!"

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.780
-What the... ?
-Trust me, it's better this way!

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.060
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.900
Woohoo!

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.260
Ladybug?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.060
Oh! Adrien Agreste! What a surprise!

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.580
I brought you a gift
from your fan club in Brazil!

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.500
There's a postal strike, but they really
wanted it to arrive for St Athanase's Day.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.020
That's my fifth name.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.340
Wow, they must be serious fans
to know that about you!

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.380
Well, happy fifth name's day!

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.700
Thank you!

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.820
Ugh! Why would anyone send a beret
when they could send cheese instead?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.500
Hey, Bunnyx, when you travel through time,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.900
do you forget
what happened when you're done?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.620
What's seen can't be unseen.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.980
I know who you are
and a few other things, too.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.260
-Do you know who Hawk Moth is?
-Even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.460
There's a time for everything,
and time is a fragile thing.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.140
That's the reason you picked me, Minibug.
I know how to keep a secret!

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.820
He wasn't home. His fencing competition
probably ended later than expected!

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.220
How about the gift?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.940
Oh, I dropped it off at home
before coming back here.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.700
I was going to tell you I'd given it
to him, but I just couldn't do it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.540
But I promise next time, it'll work.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.260
You know what they say.
563rd time's the charm!

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.460
<i>♪ Little kitty on a roof,</i>
<i>all alone without his lady ♪</i>

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.900
Hey, Bugaboo!
So, what was that sudden call for?

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.380
I did it.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.260
I have no idea what you're talking about,
but I'm perfectly fine with it.
