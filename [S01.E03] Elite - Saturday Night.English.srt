1
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,000
This is almost ready.

2
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,559
Let's see.

3
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,039
All set.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
Here you go.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
"Partay," with ay? Really?

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,719
That's the way they say it.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,719
Quit stalling and create the event.

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,000
How often is your mom out
on a Saturday night?

9
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,520
Who are all these people?

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,880
They are my friends.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,880
You still haven't told me
where you know them from.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
You're not the only one
making new friends.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,359
If you're too chicken to do it,

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,840
-I will.
-What are you doing?

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,799
Let's see.

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,119
Event "partay," create...

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
-Created. Done.
-Give me my phone!

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,119
-OK.
-Idiot.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,640
We'll have strangers in our house.

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,159
-You're irresponsible.
-That above all else.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,200
But I know you, Samu.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,640
You only care
about that fancy girl coming.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,319
That's why you're organizing all this.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,959
Idiot.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,879
MARINA ACCEPTED THE INVITATION

26
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,560
Ander!

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,519
Ander!

28
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,280
Ander.

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Can you give me a minute
to explain myself?

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,120
Or will you keep ignoring me?

31
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,719
-I don't want you to end up--
-I know! I won't end up like your sister!

32
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,120
She was drugged and taken advantage of.
No one's gonna do that to me!

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,599
...to end up like my parents.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,280
-What do your parents have to--
-My biological parents.

35
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,079
A week ago, I went to the agency.
I asked about them.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,480
Apparently, I was ten years too late.

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,719
They both died of an overdose.

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,520
That shit ruins your life, man.
I can't let anything happen to you.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,039
You're my friend.

40
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,520
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,000
Because... we talk about other things.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,199
We talk about cars, girls, parties,
but not that.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,599
Maybe we should, right?

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,199
We could get kebabs and see a movie,
like the old days.

46
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,599
I'd like that, but I'm still grounded.
Because of you.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Your father listens to me.

48
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,400
I'll talk to him.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,319
All right!

50
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,120
You were beaten
by someone who grew up in the desert.

51
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,919
It's as if you cared for Taliban girl.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
-Who's saying I care for her?
-It looks that way.

53
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,759
I think you're gonna end up
like your sister.

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,960
Falling for the first person
from the slums who crosses your path.

55
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,000
-Fuck you, Lucrecia.
-That's what you were going to do.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Fuck her, to then expose her.

57
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,000
Because if I remember correctly,

58
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,800
that fundamentalist threatened you
in your own home.

59
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,560
When are you going
to cut her down to size?

60
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,000
-I'm gonna kill you, man.
-It wasn't me, I swear.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Why would I tell him anything?

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
He's had it in for me since day one.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,719
Besides, I wouldn't tell on you.
You are my buddy.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,240
In fact,
you're the only friend I have here!

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,960
-The wedding's off, then?
-Just postponed, OK?

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
It's going to happen.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
It's the "weekend," man!

68
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,839
I end up learning the important words.

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,279
By the way, there's a party
at Samu's this weekend.

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Lots of chicks.

71
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,240
Oh, and my buddy the dealer.

72
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,839
I'm not telling you anything,
but there you have it.

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,720
How come your parents
are letting you go to the party?

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,920
-Easy, I haven't told them.
-And your brother?

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
-No, it's better if he doesn't find out.
-Shit! What do I do with his invite?

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
I don't know.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
-And your brother?
-He's the DJ.

78
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,959
You better like twerking.

79
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
-Love it.
-Oh, yeah?

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,079
Look.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
OK, great, then.

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,439
As your lawyer, I advise you
to stop talking to the police.

83
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,439
-Unless you want to confess.
-I have nothing to confess.

84
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,720
You were covered in the victim's blood.

85
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,319
A victim you knew very well.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,199
With whom you were seen
having an argument.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,720
Look, Samuel,
maybe it's not what it looks like...

88
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,360
but I doubt any judge will believe you.

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,439
What if I saw someone leaving
when I got there?

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Who?

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,319
Nano, someone is asking for you.

92
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,319
Great burger.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,439
-You wrecked my house.
-No.

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Not us.

95
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,720
We are not sent to break furniture.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
We break bones.

97
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,240
Do you know how expensive wheelchairs are?

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,360
-If you pay now, you'd be saving money.
-I need more time.

99
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,160
People want what they don't have.

100
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,319
Look.

101
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm working on getting the money,
but I'll need the weekend.

102
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,360
I can say I didn't find you today.

103
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,839
That you had left for the weekend.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,839
But on Monday...
I will have run out of excuses.

105
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,000
And so will have you.

106
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
I swear, if I had the money,
I'd lend it to you.

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
I know.

108
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,079
What are you going to do?

109
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,279
Get the fucking documents.

110
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,000
I know the combination to the safe,
so I get them...

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
hand them over so they can get more dough

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
from the construction company owner
than I owe... and we all win.

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,560
If they catch you breaking
into that house,Â you don't win shit.

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,759
-You lose it all.
-Fancy girl's going to let me in.

115
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,160
-She's coming to the party.
-You'll try to hook up with her?

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,800
-Aren't she and your brother...?
-I know.

117
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,240
They're inseparable in class.

118
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,079
Don't get me wrong.
If I were a chick, I'd be all over you.

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
I'd fuck you dry.
Make you quadruplets, at least.

120
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,439
But there's no accounting for taste.

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,519
Maybe this chick isn't into good ham
and prefers bland turkey breast.

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
No way!

123
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,040
She's dumb enough to like me better.
For that, she deserves anything she gets.

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
-And your brother?
-What?

125
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,399
Does he deserve that blow?

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,279
He was due for a blow regardless.
The sooner the better.

127
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,480
Why don't we go on Monday?
Can Polo make it?

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
You ask him. He's not talking to me.

129
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Wasn't it you who wasn't talking to him?

130
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,519
Same thing.

131
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,040
Same thing? Let me get this straight.

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,519
He brings that caveman
into your relationship,

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,160
then he freaks out, makes a scene,
and gives you the silent treatment?

134
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,959
He's gonna expect you to get
on your knees and beg for forgiveness.

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,879
And as usual, you'll do it.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,680
Why are you mad at me too?

137
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
Because I can't stand it
when he walks all over you.

138
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,560
It's good to put your ovaries on the table
every now and then!

139
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,800
What do I say? "Marina, I like you, girl."

140
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,079
"Gurl" with a u.

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,439
Recite a sonnet or whatever.

142
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,879
No, don't do that.

143
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,519
Just make it clear that you like her.

144
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
-OK.
-This can be your night.

145
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Is this a bad time to admit
I fear rejection?

146
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,639
How do I look?

147
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,039
You're shaking like a flan.
A very elegant flan, mind you.

148
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,360
OK, I'll go change.

149
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,480
Have a couple more pills?

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
What's that?
Have you expanded the business?

151
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
No surprise he has so many friends.

152
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,320
With yours, we still needed more.
I had to go through my contacts.

153
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,919
What are you doing?

154
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,720
Nothing. The usual, man.

155
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,200
-Relax, what's a couple of pills?
-Don't let Samu see.

156
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,879
-Is this sangria?
-No.

157
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,320
It's an alcohol-free punch.
But he put way too much sugar in it.

158
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
Better stick to beer.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,679
OK.

160
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,879
Let's have a look.

161
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,120
Three...

162
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,240
two...

163
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,960
one!

164
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,919
Not bad, right?

165
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
Merry Christmas.

166
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,399
What's up?

167
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,120
-How are you?
-Good.

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,039
Hey, do they know who I am?

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,279
-They know who your dad is.
-I'm not like him.

170
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,000
You have his last name, right?

171
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,720
That must surely open
lots of doors for you in life.

172
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,679
If the price is getting the stink eye
from those two, that's still a good deal.

173
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,799
Wow, a reggaeton DJ and a philosopher!

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,759
Have fun.

175
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,720
Thanks.

176
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,919
Hey, GuzmÃ¡n, what's up?

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
Thank you for talking to my dad.

178
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,000
In the end, he's lifted the punishment.

179
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm not coming today.

180
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,720
I'm tired from training,
so I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

181
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,720
Bye.

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
Come on, Ander!

183
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,559
What are you doing here?
My father is in the back room.

184
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
Hello, by the way.

185
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,679
I'm a customer, Nadia. I'm here to buy...

186
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,399
this.

187
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,559
Asparagus?
You've come here to buy asparagus?

188
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,879
No.

189
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,960
I've actually come to ask you
where the skinny kid lives.

190
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,759
I know he's throwing a party.

191
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,799
Well...

192
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,559
If you don't have the address,
I guess you're not invited.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Listen, Nadia.

194
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,240
Marina is there
without my parents' permission.

195
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,480
You don't know her
or what she's capable of.

196
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,519
I just want to make sure she's all right.

197
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
Please, tell me where she is.

198
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,759
Nadia!

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,399
Nadia, please, tell me where it is!

200
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,559
Calm down, or I'm not going to tell you.

201
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,519
I close in half an hour.
There's a bar across the street.

202
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,000
Have a cup of tea whileÂ you wait,
and if you've calmed down,

203
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,600
maybe I'll go with you.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
You're coming with me?

205
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,480
No.

206
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,200
You're coming with me.

207
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,639
I did get an invitation.

208
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,120
With me, they might even let you in.

209
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,480
Sir.

210
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,879
Your asparagus.

211
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,279
Put it on my tab.

212
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,919
What are you doing here?

213
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,000
Christian invited me.

214
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,399
I see he didn't tell you.

215
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,399
Never mind, don't worry.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

216
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,480
Come.

217
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,639
Omar.

218
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,759
This is my friend, Omar. Ander.

219
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,840
He's in my class, but fortunately,
he's not a leader of tomorrow.

220
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,039
-Can I take your jacket?
-Nice to meet you.

221
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,519
Likewise. You look familiar.

222
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,159
You don't. AndrÃ©s, was it?

223
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,159
-Ander.
-You're RomÃ¡n, right?

224
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,639
Thank you.

225
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,720
AndrÃ©s, really?

226
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,799
Samuel doesn't know about me.

227
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,919
Which part? That you're a dealer
or that you're a fag?

228
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,759
Neither. Does everybody know about you?

229
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,720
Which part? That I'm a stoner
or that I'm a fag?

230
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,960
That's why you won't answer my messages?
In case they catch you.

231
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,200
What is it?
Can't live without me, or what?

232
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
You know it! I'm here to buy.

233
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,440
It's your lucky day.

234
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Come.

235
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,679
I've never tried these.

236
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,120
It's easy.
Put it in your mouth and swallow it.

237
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,399
If you're horny now, just wait
until that hits you. See you later...

238
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,559
AndrÃ©s.

239
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,159
Thank you.

240
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,679
Hey!

241
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,399
Who wants to play spin the bottle?

242
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,080
We're a little too old for that!
We are not children!

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,120
Know who's not afraid of being childish?
An adult. Who's in?

244
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,000
-I am.
-When he's right, he's right.

245
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,559
Kiss, dare, or truth?

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Come on!

247
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,759
Do you like anybody here at the party?

248
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,359
It wasn't Nano.

249
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,960
I swear to God.

250
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,799
Why are you so sure?

251
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,759
Who did it, Christian?

252
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,640
Christian, who did it?

253
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,119
I only know Nano didn't do it.

254
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,039
I'm at the marchioness' house,

255
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,240
chilling on the sofa,
taking off our clothes...

256
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,000
and the guy shows up at the pool.
All that was missing was the popcorn.

257
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,279
I swear. But that's not all.

258
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,440
It turns outÂ he had also been watching
at Marina's party.

259
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,079
He had a front row seat, for free.

260
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,319
-Polo is a voyeur?
-A fucking faggot is what he is!

261
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,960
-He got a hard-on and all.
-Like a pole.

262
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,119
Come on, it's not such a big deal.

263
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
-What's not a big deal?
-I mean...

264
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,680
If they wanted to do that,
they should have told you, but...

265
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,000
The fact that Polo likes guys,
if he does...

266
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,000
Who cares?

267
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,000
My cousin in AlmerÃ­a is a drag queen.

268
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,480
-Yes, Eligenio.
-Eligenio, total fag, man.

269
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,519
And he fucking rules.
I'll introduce you one day.

270
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
He's with me.

271
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,039
He just wants to talk to his sister.

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,119
Come on.

273
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,559
Let's show him that we do know
how to be good hosts.

274
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,200
Have you seen yourself?

275
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,160
Remember what happened
the last time we left you alone?

276
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,000
What did you take this time?

277
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,640
Pablo didn't drug me.
We smoked a little, that's all.

278
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,039
I slept with him because I wanted to.
I had bad luck.

279
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,039
Not bad luck.

280
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
You slept with the wrong person,
but you don't learn

281
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,359
and keep hanging out with those people.

282
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,920
You still believe
it's a disease of the poor, right?

283
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Pablo liked rich girls, just like you.

284
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,119
How do you think he got infected?

285
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,680
It can happen to anybody.

286
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,839
It can happen to you too.

287
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,160
HIV doesn't give a fuck
about how big your house is,

288
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,880
how much money you make,
or how long your list of last names is.

289
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,440
It's not like you.

290
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,480
Did you bring him here?

291
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,039
-Your brother just worries about you.
-He doesn't need to.

292
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,480
You sure?

293
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,039
So, you're free to wear a veil,
but I can't take my clothes off?

294
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,039
How does that work?

295
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,559
I also have a sister.

296
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,400
I wish somebody had worried that much
about her.

297
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,119
-She wouldn't have ended up like she did.
-How did she end up?

298
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,039
-Lost.
-What are you doing here?

299
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,839
Nothing. She's come to save my soul.
But it's a bit late for that.

300
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,599
Do you have anything without alcohol?

301
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,359
There's punch over there,
but they put too much sugar in it.

302
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Hey, fuckers, be quiet!

303
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,119
My brother and I have some poetry
for you. Is that OK?

304
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,799
If not,Â too bad, it's our house. Hit it!

305
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,559
Yeah, yeah

306
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,480
Yeah, yeah

307
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,359
Say, say, say, say

308
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,039
Passions, brothers, and blood
I have plenty balls to bust this jail

309
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,559
If money doesn't count
If my accounts are erratic

310
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,759
The reason for my hopes
Is not to stop making mistakes

311
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,440
My life is an extreme
And you say no

312
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,079
How to ash my cigarette
Or throw away a banana peel

313
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I don't want any money
I prefer a heart

314
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,240
The bills asphyxiating you
Are not my prison

315
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,559
I'm everything you're waiting for
I'm the one coming for you at night

316
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,519
To make you dream

317
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,039
I'm the starless sky
That can light you up, ah!

318
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,000
Brother, listen

319
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,880
You'll draw your dreams
On paper buildings

320
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,039
To make them understand

321
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,559
There's no triumph in the future
Without fighting in the present

322
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,640
Are you OK?

323
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,759
-Yes, and you?
-I'm great.

324
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,759
Best party of my life.

325
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,839
Why don't you introduce me
to your friends?

326
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,519
Those are not my friends.

327
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,599
They are not my friends--
I'm not good with people.

328
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,119
Or at life in general.

329
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,680
Then why throw this party?

330
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,759
Sorry!

331
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,119
-Are you OK?
-Sorry. I'm really sorry.

332
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,160
-It's OK, don't worry.
-I'm really sorry.

333
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,000
-No problem, Samuel.
-Shit.

334
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,480
Are you having a good time?

335
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,599
A better time than you, for sure.

336
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,359
You've had a sour face all night.

337
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,880
You've been watching me, huh?

338
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,279
Look...

339
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,319
I also like to play, but with my luck,
I'm sure I would never get a turn.

340
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,200
I'd rather do it without the bottle.
Want to?

341
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,599
Truth.

342
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,640
Why have you been looking at me all night?

343
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,160
Why do you think
I've been looking at you all night?

344
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,000
Kiss.

345
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,759
Dare.

346
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,400
Let's get out of here.

347
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
And go where?

348
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,519
Is there anybody at your place?

349
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,480
Give me another pill.

350
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,599
Another?

351
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,200
Not like this, like before.

352
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,279
Are you crazy?

353
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,559
What are you doing?

354
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,920
Ander!

355
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,839
-Why are you here?
-GuzmÃ¡n.

356
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,880
You lied to me
and used me to get away...

357
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,200
but the worst part is you did it
to come to this party. Why?

358
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,160
Look who it is!

359
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,559
-It's the Ken doll!
-I'm talking to my friend.

360
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,200
He's my friend, too.
Actually, I invited him.

361
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,039
-You're crashing.
-Yeah, I was dying to come.

362
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,720
Let's see.
I think the chlorine from the pool

363
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,720
must have atrophied
that part of the brain

364
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,160
that takes hints.

365
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,759
We don't want you here.

366
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
Shall I say it in English
so you understand?

367
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,519
-GuzmÃ¡n...
-What are you doing?

368
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
-What are you on?
-Nothing.

369
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,119
-You are high!
-I'm not!

370
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,079
You can't shut up!

371
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,440
-I didn't take anything!
-You!

372
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,039
-What did you give him?
-Nothing.

373
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,960
Don't go near him again,
not even with a cough drop.

374
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,759
Or your sister, mother, father,

375
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,799
and your whole family
will know what you do, OK?

376
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,160
GuzmÃ¡n, I'm fine.

377
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,599
Stop lying to me, you retard. He told me!

378
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,119
OK?

379
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,359
If it's about joints, pills,
or cheap hair gel, I trust him.

380
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,559
Don't yell at him. He's so dumb,
he told me unintentionally.

381
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Fuck off, GuzmÃ¡n!

382
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,000
Fuck you, too! And fuck you!

383
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,240
You hear me? Fuck all of you!

384
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,960
Maybe I'll wind up having a good time
after all.

385
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
-Nadia, did you drink?
-Only punch.

386
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,960
That punch is loaded with sugar.

387
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,519
Samu! The cops!

388
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,279
The cops!

389
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,640
Polo, have you told your mothers
you are coming with us to Sardinia

390
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,039
for Easter?

391
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
I may have other plans.

392
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,880
I need to think. I don't know if I'll go.

393
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Whatever GuzmÃ¡n says, surely.

394
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,559
Excuse me?

395
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,480
Wow, you're talking to me.

396
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,039
-Carla, this is not the mom--
-Come now, kid.

397
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,799
After the fortune your mothers
have spentÂ on speech therapists!

398
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,559
Please, don't tag the wall, OK?

399
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,440
Or what? They'll take away your hot tub?

400
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,920
You think I'm the typical rich girl
who's had nothing bad happen to her?

401
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,240
Actually, yes.

402
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,960
-There's something you should know.
-Oh, really?

403
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,319
OK, then.

404
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,039
Truth.

405
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,240
What should I know?

406
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,519
Where to now?

407
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,200
-I'm going home, and so are you.
-Why?

408
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,200
Because you all are bad
at looking down on people.

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,079
At least we do it discreetly.

410
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,920
I want to swim in your pool.

411
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,839
The two of us, swimming in my pool?

412
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,359
No.

413
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,039
Shall I tell the principal...
what I saw in the showers?

414
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,279
So swimming in my pool, huh?

415
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,799
Fantastic idea.

416
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,880
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

417
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,559
You're not going to talk?

418
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,039
OK, it's enough if you listen.
I really don't understand.

419
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,279
Why did you have to ruin it all
if we both liked it?

420
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,559
I panicked, OK?

421
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,680
What if you like him better than me?

422
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,119
Remember what you told me after the party?

423
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,039
"I love you more than ever."

424
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,160
I felt the same way.

425
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,160
I loved you more than ever
because you did what you wanted,

426
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,200
regardless of what people think.

427
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,480
Carla!

428
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,519
Fuck the world.

429
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,880
-What else do you want to do?
-You want to know?

430
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,640
Come on in.

431
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
-Shit. Please, they can't see you here.
-That wouldn't be good for me either.

432
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,920
Wait here for a moment, OK?

433
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,160
Hello.

434
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,680
Hello.

435
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,720
What are you doing?

436
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,599
Nothing. You?

437
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,400
-You could have answered my calls.
-And you could leave me alone, right?

438
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,480
Omar.

439
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,759
-Have another pill?
-Stop it.

440
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,519
Guys. You deal?

441
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,279
Get lost.

442
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,799
-No.
-What are you doing? Let's go.

443
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,839
Stop.

444
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,759
I mean, do you sell pills or anything?

445
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,559
-Do we look like dealers?
-Ander, come, let's go.

446
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,119
You don't look like boy scouts.

447
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,079
-Man.
-Is he for real?

448
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,319
Ander!

449
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,759
Who do you think you are, rich boy? Look.

450
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,519
Hey, leave him alone.

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,119
Easy, man. Easy.

452
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,400
Please, stop.

453
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,559
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's high?

454
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,720
Please.

455
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,039
Stop, please.

456
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
Let's go.

457
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,920
-Get out of here!
-Take your boyfriend, you fucking Muslim!

458
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,480
See? If you'd given me a fucking pill,
this wouldn't have happened.

459
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,000
Go fuck yourself, man.

460
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,279
And don't call me again.

461
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,759
Or write.

462
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,440
Why?

463
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,359
Why? Are you so high you don't remember?

464
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,839
Your friend threatened me.

465
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,079
-And if they find out about me...
-Which part?

466
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,480
If that gets out, you'll ruin my life.

467
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,440
It's best if...
we don't see each other again.

468
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,440
Best for both of us.

469
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:19,880
Nadia?

470
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,239
Are you getting in?

471
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,960
Are you OK?

472
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,440
I've never felt better.

473
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,679
You've been drugged, Nadia.

474
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,360
You're high.

475
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,559
Where are you going?

476
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,679
To get a towel and call a cab.

477
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,880
What happened?

478
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,880
What do you mean, what happened?

479
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,400
He hurt himself in your pool.

480
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,599
Ander?

481
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
Yes, Antonio, sorry.

482
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm surprised.
I didn't know it was that bad.

483
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,039
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

484
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,199
Yes, he'll have to wear it for two weeks.
You should be more careful.

485
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,599
It was my fault. I wasn't looking,
and he started goofing off.

486
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
It won't happen again.

487
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,079
I'll keep an eye on him.

488
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,519
All right, then.

489
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,639
What?

490
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,079
It means "I'm sorry."

491
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,800
I should have stayed out of your life.

492
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,119
How do you say "I'm still hungover"?

493
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,679
You remind me of May. My sister.

494
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,800
She used to smile all the time too.

495
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,239
Even if she felt sad on the inside.
Mainly, when she felt sad on the inside.

496
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,280
What did you mean the other day
when you said she was lost?

497
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,119
She drank.

498
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,480
She smoked.

499
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,559
Went out with boys.

500
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,639
She wanted to be like all Spanish girls.

501
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,639
She ended up doing what none of them do.

502
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
She left home at 18.

503
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,519
It's been two years...

504
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,119
without any news from her.

505
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,679
All I know...

506
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,920
is she left my family brokenhearted.

507
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,719
And the last thing I want
is to do the same.

508
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,280
-I think I'm also losing myself a little.
-Nadia.

509
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
We are 16 years old.

510
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,800
If we don't lose ourselves now, then when?

511
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,119
We have all our lives
to find ourselves again.

512
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,639
We have a witness

513
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,360
who saw you run bloodstained
out of the school.

514
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
A witness?

515
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,320
Of course. Some rich kid, probably.

516
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,559
Of course, because they never lie, right?

517
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,559
Our witness is Samuel.

518
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,960
Your brother.

519
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,559
Is he lying?

520
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,239
He knows perfectly well
I would never hurt Marina.

521
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,719
-Why?
-Because we were together.

522
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,519
Thank you.

523
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,639
What for?

524
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,639
For... not taking advantage
of the situation.

525
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:41,880
And for the cab.

526
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,960
-I'll pay you back.
-No problem. My treat.

527
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,519
Who would have thought.

528
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,760
You are a gentleman.

529
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,159
You surprised me too.

530
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,440
I did not see that business
with the pool coming.

531
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,800
Gentlemen don't mention those things.

532
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,519
Never. Ever. OK?

533
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,519
OK.

534
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,199
Can I give you some advice? As a friend.

535
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,840
-Are we friends?
-No.

536
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,360
But we are women.
And I don't like it when men toy with us.

537
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,000
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-GuzmÃ¡n's only interested in you

538
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,440
because he bet
he could take your virginity.

539
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,039
To then humiliate you and tell everybody.

540
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,000
To get back at you for threatening him
the night of the party.

541
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,960
He's so vindictive.

542
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,639
That is a lie.

543
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,360
Ask him.

544
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,280
-Ready, girls?
-Friends?

545
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,480
Positions, and...

546
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,440
Nadia.

547
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,199
I swear it was her idea.

548
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,320
And you think that's an excuse?

549
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,960
I'd expect it from her.
But I don't know what to think of you.

550
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:25,400
I had you in my pool, ready for anything,
and I didn't touch you.

551
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,400
Not for lack of wanting to. It's true.
I could have taken advantage, but...

552
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,920
I could've taken advantage,
but I didn't.

553
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,159
So... I should thank you.

554
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,480
For not going through
with your plan to humiliate me.

555
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,440
Do you realize how disgusting it is
to even consider that?

556
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,400
The kind of person that makes you?

557
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,679
You're no saint either.

558
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,559
Excuse me?

559
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,559
You spread your legs for me in my pool,
Nadia.

560
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,559
I had been drugged.

561
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,079
Marina.

562
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I'd offer to pay your dry cleaning,
but I'd be lying. I'm broke.

563
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,519
-It doesn't matter.
-Yes, it does.

564
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,840
You're avoiding me, and I understand.
I screwed up the other day.

565
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,360
-You didn't.
-I did.

566
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,800
I had too much wine, vodka...
too much alcohol.

567
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,239
I wanted to feel brave,

568
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,920
-but I just threw up.
-Don't--

569
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,360
I needed some Dutch courage
to tell you I like you.

570
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,760
Samuel, I'm not good for you.
There's things about me--

571
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,679
What things?

572
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,800
What things?

573
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,000
I am HIV-positive.

574
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
I don't know what to say.

575
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,000
It doesn't matter.

576
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:26,639
I'm OK with you not saying anything...
to anybody.

577
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,920
You can stay at my place.

578
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,719
So when they show up at mine,
they'll find my mom and Samu, right?

579
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:49,320
-Life sucks, Nano.
-Fucking right.

580
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,079
Look at her. She's saying
she wants to meet so we can talk.

581
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:57,920
I'll pass.

582
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,239
If they want to spice things up,
they should find somebody else.

583
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,760
Do you know why they need
to spice up their relationship?

584
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,920
Because it's bland, Christian.

585
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,480
That's why they're looking
for a good stud.Â Listen...

586
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,599
The more she can compare...

587
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,159
the more she'll see
that what she has looks expensive,

588
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,199
but it's just a cheap plastic trinket.

589
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,559
-So what are you trying to say?
-Don't be stupid.

590
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,760
That guy's letting you steal
his girlfriend right under his nose.

591
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,239
You can't pass on that.

592
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,360
I won't.

593
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,599
Attaboy.

594
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
You can't be doing this to me, Carla!

595
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,280
What do you mean,
you have something else to do?

596
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,400
Do you think I'm stupid?

597
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,800
Why don't you just say you have a date
with that fucking influencer?

598
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
You know what?

599
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,159
I pity you for letting people
boss you around like this.

600
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,239
And for having such low self-esteem...
dear.

601
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,679
Stop treating me like I'm being abused,
OK?

602
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,320
You say you're progressive
and that you do what you want with men,

603
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,519
but the only reason you agreed
to be GuzmÃ¡n's fuck buddy

604
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,760
is that he didn't want anything serious,
and you wanted him really bad.

605
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh, sorry.

606
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:16,079
I was just putting my ovaries
on the table.

607
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,280
Hello.

608
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,199
Son of a bitch!

609
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,039
Check out this shack!

610
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,320
It's beautiful!

611
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:33,159
Is this yours?

612
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,320
Our parents bought it for us,
and we are furnishing it little by little.

613
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,440
We got the bed last Friday.

614
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,519
Great.

615
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,280
Christian, do you like fish?

616
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,159
Is that a trick question?

617
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,760
We're about to order dinner. Our treat.

618
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,679
-Besides, I think we owe you that.
-OK.

619
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,239
Listen...

620
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,119
The neighbor who called the cops told mom.

621
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,599
So we are in trouble. What's the matter?

622
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:28,039
Marina.

623
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,679
What's wrong with Marina?

624
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,599
She's HIV-positive, Nano.

625
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,920
That's not the worst part.
I stood there and didn't know what to say.

626
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,800
Instead of telling her I don't care.

627
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,480
Besides, it's not a problem.

628
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:50,840
I've been reading up online,
and nowadays, it's no big deal.

629
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,320
Instead, I just stood there
and stared like an idiot.

630
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
We have it all planned. All of it.

631
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,159
Even our retirement.

632
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,840
-Sometimes, it's too much, right?
-Yeah.

633
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,280
That's why we decided to add some...

634
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,159
-spice to our lives.
-And that would be me, right?

635
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,199
The spice.

636
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,239
Which one am I?
Pepper, cayenne, hot chili?

637
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,800
Forgive us, really.

638
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,880
But... it wasn't so horrible, right?
At least, I hope so.

639
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,360
Didn't you have a good time?

640
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,159
I did.

641
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,000
Would you like to do it again?

642
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,079
Have you ever had a threesome?

643
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,199
I love you more than ever.

644
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,920
I love you more than ever.

645
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,119
He told you, right?

646
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:35,400
I'm on medication. It's undetectable.

647
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,159
That means I can't infect you.

648
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,280
I don't care that you didn't tell me.

649
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,360
But you kept quiet
because you were afraid I'd bolt.

650
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,079
It's not a problem, it's normal.

651
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,559
But that's why you told Samu,
to scare him away.

652
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,880
-Maybe.
-Marina, please.

653
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,760
You don't know him. You won't be able to.

654
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,159
He'll research it, and tomorrow,
he'll know more about it than you.

655
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:08,840
Why are you here?

656
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,320
Shit.

657
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,679
Stop toying with my brother,
and tell him the fucking truth.

658
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,960
That you're not into him.

659
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,119
I'm not toying with him.

660
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,280
-I feel something, but...
-Yeah.

661
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,559
Like with me the other night?

662
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,039
No way. That is easy to see.

663
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,760
You felt something, too.

664
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,840
Didn't you?

665
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,840
Come on.

666
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,480
Truth.

667
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,480
This isn't a fucking game!

668
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:50,960
Did you know she was pregnant?

669
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,880
Did I know?

670
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,599
Whose baby do you think that was?

671
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,320
Why do you think
we were going to run away together?

672
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,199
I went to school to pick her up...

673
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,320
I found her like that.

674
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,480
We wanted to get as far
as we could from here.

675
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,840
Do you know who couldn't stand the idea?

676
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,119
Your fucking witness.

677
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,239
Are you...

678
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,639
suggesting...

679
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,320
that your brother killed her?

680
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,800
