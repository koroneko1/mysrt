Oh.

69
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,439
Charlie's my friend. I was worried
about him joining the rugby team

70
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,000
and becoming friends with you

71
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,759
because I knew that he'd get picked on
by some of the idiots in your year.

72
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,519
And guess what? He did.

I'm done trying to protect him
when he's forgotten I exist, like…

I deserve to be appreciated.

If he'd just told me
that you two were going out, like…

Maybe I would've done things differently.

77

Maybe I would have stayed more low-key
and Harry would have left us alone.

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,839
I think Charlie might be nervous
about telling you

79

because he really cares
about your opinion.

Because he loves you a lot.

81

Yeah.

Well, I'll believe that

I think maybe…

85
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,600
he's finding it hard having
to lie to people about us.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
He's not angry about me being
in the closet or anything, like…

I've known Charlie since we were 11,

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,720
and he's always had a tendency
to believe that him just existing

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,279
is annoying for other people.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,319
Yeah.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,480
I sort of got that impression.

94
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,319
He's not going to force you
to come out. Which is good.

95
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
He would literally never tell you this,

96
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,279
but he probably wants to be something more

97
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,040
than "secret guy you kiss sometimes
on the down-low."

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,240
And if you can't give him
more than that then…

I mean, that's fine,

100
