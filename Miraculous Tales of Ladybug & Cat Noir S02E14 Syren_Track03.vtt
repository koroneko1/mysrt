&lrm;I'm sure they'll get them
&lrm;back in the zoo fast!

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.020
&lrm;Right, sir! They are the best.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.420
&lrm;Ah, I wish I could be a superhero.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.740
&lrm;The powers, the secrets, the costume.
&lrm;That would be awesome, right?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.020
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha! Yeah, sure.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.980
&lrm;How can I become one? You think
&lrm;there is some kind of superhero school?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.500
&lrm;Or maybe some super secret
&lrm;training facility?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.020
&lrm;-You wanna know my secret?
&lrm;-Yeah! Totally! I love this game!

&lrm;"I have a serious crush on this boy,

&lrm;That boy's clueless!

&lrm;OK, now it's my turn.

&lrm;-But we haven't finished yet.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.500
&lrm;I've really gotta split.
&lrm;I asked Chloé to come!

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.100
&lrm;Remember? The girl I told you about
&lrm;in my class? Next time, I promise!

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.740
&lrm;"The boy I'm crushing on is... you!"

&lrm;Poor little mermaid.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.500
&lrm;How many times have you tried to tell
&lrm;your prince how you feel?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.940
&lrm;And how many times has he dismissed you?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.740
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her!

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.060
&lrm;Come on, guys,
&lrm;you wouldn't eat a cousin, would you?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.500
&lrm;Mirage!

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.780
&lrm;How about some tasty chops instead?

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.820
&lrm;Pound it!

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.380
&lrm;-Hey! Where are you going?
&lrm;-Rena's about to transform back!

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.460
&lrm;So, you're allowed to know
&lrm;her true identity but I'm not?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.780
&lrm;Because I have to get her Miraculous back!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.620
&lrm;So what's my role?
&lrm;The guy who's always left in the dark?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.460
&lrm;-What else are you hiding from me?
&lrm;-We really gotta jam!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.540
&lrm;OK, I'll talk to him about it.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.940
&lrm;Him? Who's him?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.900
&lrm;Uh... when the time is right, Cat Noir.
&lrm;I promise.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.460
&lrm;I hate secrets.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.140
&lrm;We can do this again whenever you want--

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.620
&lrm;Uh... If you want to get to that movie
&lrm;on time, you better go the way Alya went.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.220
&lrm;Sorry, Tikki, we'll just have to miss
&lrm;the trailers again.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.220
&lrm;Syren, I am Hawk Moth.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.220
&lrm;I am giving you the power to turn Paris
&lrm;into your own underwater kingdom,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.540
&lrm;for you and your prince.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.820
&lrm;In return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.060
&lrm;May they all sink under my sorrow.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.260
&lrm;You're three minutes
&lrm;and 37 seconds late! Everybody's inside.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.940
&lrm;-Is Chloé here?
&lrm;-Ha, ha!

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.340
&lrm;She's watching
&lrm;<i>Mechamonkey vs Cybersharks 3.</i>

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.820
&lrm;I think your swimming cap's on too tight,
&lrm;Kim.

&lrm;[panting]

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.140
&lrm;Ah! Let me guess.
&lrm;Marinette hasn't arrived yet?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.620
&lrm;True to form.
&lrm;We'll save you both a seat!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.700
&lrm;Ooh! Marinette, Marinette, Marinette.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.700
&lrm;Aaah!

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.820
&lrm;Perfect. Now come and tell me
&lrm;what's bothering you, Marinette.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940
&lrm;-Huh? How do you... ?
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.100
&lrm;-Hold on. You both stay here.
&lrm;-Oh, Master, please!

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.740
&lrm;Kwamis must never know the recipe
&lrm;that can modify their powers. Ever!

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.220
&lrm;Modify their powers?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.220
&lrm;Imagine what would happen if one of you
&lrm;were captured by Hawk Moth's kwami.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.580
&lrm;Aaah!

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.660
&lrm;-So, what's on your mind?
&lrm;-Master Fu,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.220
&lrm;Cat Noir's asking more and more questions.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.620
&lrm;He's tired of being left in the dark.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.540
&lrm;Tell me. Do you put the noodles
&lrm;in the water before the water boils?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.500
&lrm;-Uh... no.
&lrm;-Exactly.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.380
&lrm;That's because
&lrm;there's a right time for everything.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.500
&lrm;-Uh... What are you cooking exactly?
&lrm;-When fed with specific ingredients,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.460
&lrm;the kwamis can grant special power.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.900
&lrm;Each power's specific mix is listed here,
&lrm;encoded in the grimoire.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.500
&lrm;I've deciphered most of the ingredients.
&lrm;For example, for aquatic powers you need

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.620
&lrm;"a branch from the dragon king's garden".
&lrm;That's "seaweed".

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.020
&lrm;"Secret kept in a shell"
&lrm;is "an oyster pearl".

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.220
&lrm;But the last one still puzzles me.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.820
&lrm;"A Tear of Joy". I can't figure it out,
&lrm;and it's required for almost every blend.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.820
&lrm;Oh! Maybe it could be
&lrm;some dancing ant honeydew!

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.300
&lrm;I think I may have finally got
&lrm;the right mix.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.220
&lrm;Aaah!

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.660
&lrm;"Hey, Cat Noir, do you trust me?"
&lrm;"Sure, Ladybug, do you trust me too?"

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.820
&lrm;"Are you kidding?
&lrm;I will never trust you! Ha, ha, ha!"

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.260
&lrm;[sighs]

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.060
&lrm;-You must know what she's hiding from me.
&lrm;-I'm just a kwami, Adrien.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.180
&lrm;And we have a right to remain silent.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.180
&lrm;Pity. Just when I was about to order you
&lrm;some very tasty cheese.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.060
&lrm;Ever sampled "la Trappe d'Echourgnac"?
&lrm;It says here it tastes like walnuts.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.100
&lrm;I can't be swayed. Sorry.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.500
&lrm;Did you know about
&lrm;the "Fourme de Montbrison"?

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.980
&lrm;-It's the oldest cheese in the world!
&lrm;-You don't say?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.180
&lrm;Yes, and do you know
&lrm;why its rind is orange?

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.020
&lrm;Because they age it on special
&lrm;boards of spruce wood!

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.100
&lrm;There's only one thing in this world
&lrm;that smells as good as cheese!

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.140
&lrm;-[takes deep breaths]
&lrm;-Which one do you prefer?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.540
&lrm;-"Tomme des Beauges" or "Saint-Aillon"?
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.460
&lrm;Mmm! There's a slight flavour to it.
&lrm;Yes! I remember it being a lot like this!

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.020
&lrm;I knew it!

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.620
&lrm;Wayzz! Power up!

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.020
&lrm;A little more salt, maybe?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.300
&lrm;Oh... Failed again.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.580
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.260
&lrm;Hey, Alya! Yeah, what's up?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.220
&lrm;The movie? Of course I didn't forget!
&lrm;Uh... I'm almost there!

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.180
&lrm;Sorry, Master.
&lrm;Good luck finding the secret ingredient!

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.820
&lrm;[sighs]

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.100
&lrm;Coming! Sorry, I was...

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.980
&lrm;No time to explain. Come on!

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.180
&lrm;Hi!

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.260
&lrm;Sorry, sorry, sorry!

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.980
&lrm;What's going on?

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.860
&lrm;Aaah!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.460
&lrm;-OK, who left the faucet running?
&lrm;-The stairs! Quick!

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.420
&lrm;-Hurry up!
&lrm;-Everyone up on the roof!

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.540
&lrm;Tomme de Quercy with truffles,
&lrm;raw-milk Camembert,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.860
&lrm;aged on vine leaves,
&lrm;marinated in Emmenthal juice. Oh!

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.540
&lrm;[Plagg] La-la-la-la-la-la.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.900
&lrm;Looks like your cheese strategy
&lrm;will have to tread water!

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.860
&lrm;Don't worry. This isn't over!
&lrm;Plagg! Claws out!

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.900
&lrm;-My circuits are sensitive to water!
&lrm;-Woohoohoo! [splash] Ha, ha, ha!

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.860
&lrm;Come on guys! I can teach you to swim
&lrm;in two seconds flat, Markov!

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.700
&lrm;You put your arms like this,
&lrm;then push your legs and...

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.940
&lrm;It's kinda like being a frog.
&lrm;And it helps to think as a frog.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.020
&lrm;Kim!

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.700
&lrm;Where is he? Can you see him?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.460
&lrm;-Marinette! What are you doing?
&lrm;-Um... I'm gonna go get help! I'm fine!

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.220
&lrm;OK, so... I guess we're saved, then?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.020
&lrm;Kim! I've found you, at last!

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.140
&lrm;OK. We are alone!

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.620
&lrm;Ha! This is amazing! I can breathe
&lrm;underwater, just like a fish!

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.340
&lrm;I knew you'd love it. I have lots
&lrm;of other surprises for you. You'll see!

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.580
&lrm;Hey!

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.900
&lrm;My prince!

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.900
&lrm;With every new environment
&lrm;comes a new set of rules, Ladybug!

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.820
&lrm;You won't be able to win this time.
&lrm;Ladybugs can't breathe under water!

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.020
&lrm;Syren, are you going to let Ladybug
&lrm;steal your prince away from you?

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.140
&lrm;Never!

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.100
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;-Ladybug?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.220
&lrm;You didn't tell me
&lrm;you were going swimming today.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.420
&lrm;I wasn't planning on it. Ladybugs aren't
&lrm;exactly cut out for deep-sea diving.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.860
&lrm;Cats aren't exactly
&lrm;crazy about water either.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.780
&lrm;Is there any chance
&lrm;you can get us a submarine?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.460
&lrm;Paw-ssibly, Kitty Cat.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.900
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.420
&lrm;Huh! Well, we can use it
&lrm;to scoop up the water.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.860
&lrm;-It'll just take a long time.
&lrm;-Oh! I'll be right back!

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.500
&lrm;Wait! Where are you going?

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.300
&lrm;-I can't...
&lrm;-Say anything. Yeah, I know.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.820
&lrm;But we are a team, aren't we?
&lrm;I'm tired of all these secrets.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.500
&lrm;I'm sorry. It's not exactly easy for me,
&lrm;either, trust me.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.060
&lrm;Spots off!

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.820
&lrm;Master Fu? Master?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.500
&lrm;This way.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.140
&lrm;-We can't defeat the mermaid under water.
&lrm;-I know.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260
&lrm;And unfortunately, I haven't found
&lrm;the correct blend that could help you out.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.180
&lrm;I've failed you.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.900
&lrm;No way!
&lrm;We are going to find that last ingredient!

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.500
&lrm;The "tear of joy"? I've tried everything,
&lrm;water from the Laughing Fountain,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.860
&lrm;snow from the Mountain of Jubilation,
&lrm;drops of pure chocolate.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.900
&lrm;But have you tried
&lrm;a real tear of joy?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.340
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-Come on! Tell me a really funny joke!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.340
&lrm;Do you think
&lrm;this is really the time to have fun?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.860
&lrm;-OK. Why do you go to bed at night?
&lrm;-I don't know, I...

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.780
&lrm;-Because the bed won't come to you!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.700
&lrm;What goes up, but doesn't move?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.700
&lrm;-Stairs!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.420
&lrm;What does a snail say
&lrm;when it rides on a turtle's back?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.100
&lrm;-Woohoo!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.220
&lrm;I think you just found
&lrm;the magic ingredient, Marinette!

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.820
&lrm;Mmm. Yummy!

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.820
&lrm;Tikki, power up!

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.500
&lrm;AquaTikki!

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.660
&lrm;AquaTikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.100
&lrm;Master Fu, I think it's time you put
&lrm;those noodles into the boiling water.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.940
&lrm;You're right, Ladybug.
&lrm;I'll take care of it.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.900
&lrm;This is so dumb.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.380
&lrm;Claws in.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.220
&lrm;What's taking her so long?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.140
&lrm;Whoa! Easy! What are you doing?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.660
&lrm;Tell me what Ladybug
&lrm;is hiding from me or I'm done.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.300
&lrm;-You can't do that!
&lrm;-Why not?

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.180
&lrm;No one will know if I quit.
&lrm;No one will care.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.740
&lrm;-I will.
&lrm;-Why?

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.740
&lrm;'Cause no one will give you camembert?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.060
&lrm;Oh, I'm sure there will be another
&lrm;Cat Noir to give me cheese.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.980
&lrm;But he won't be you.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.340
&lrm;-Hello, Cat Noir!
&lrm;-Huh?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.540
&lrm;<i>Adrien, please reconsider.</i>
&lrm;<i>You know what your father wants.</i>

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.380
&lrm;<i>-This is what I want to do!</i>
&lrm;<i>-[groaning]</i>

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.420
&lrm;<i>Thank you, young man.</i>

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.500
&lrm;-You? You're the man who--
&lrm;-I'll explain everything, I promise.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.660
&lrm;But right now,
&lrm;you must go and help Ladybug.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.340
&lrm;Oh, no! I hate transforming!

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.100
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.820
&lrm;I love what you've done with the pool.
&lrm;It's awesome!

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.300
&lrm;This is the pool where the old me tried to
&lrm;pour her heart out to you so many times.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.300
&lrm;Uh... But I've never seen
&lrm;a Syren at the pool!

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.100
&lrm;[chuckles]

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.220
&lrm;-Ondine?
&lrm;-I'm your Syren, now,

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.980
&lrm;and you could be my Merman.
&lrm;It only needs a kiss,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.540
&lrm;and you'll become like me.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.620
&lrm;You mean,
&lrm;I could swim as fast as you do?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.060
&lrm;Yes, Kim. You'll be my prince and we'll
&lrm;rule this underwater city together...

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.620
&lrm;forever.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.540
&lrm;Wait. Does this mean I'd never get to see
&lrm;<i>Mechamonkeys vs Cybersharks 3?</i>

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.100
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-Oh, yes, you will. Don't worry!

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.540
&lrm;In fact, you can make it
&lrm;to the next showing!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.860
&lrm;The three of us can go together.
&lrm;I'll even share my popcorn!

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.260
&lrm;I knew those Miraculous
&lrm;had hidden powers.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.620
&lrm;Syren! There's too many fish in this sea!

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.100
&lrm;Take their Miraculous
&lrm;before they take your Merman away!

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.060
&lrm;Aaah!

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.300
&lrm;Your new outfits are so cool!

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.820
&lrm;Oh, um, thanks!

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.980
&lrm;But what happened to your friend
&lrm;that got her so worked up?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.700
&lrm;We were playing "Secrets". She was
&lrm;trying to tell me I'm the boy she likes.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.020
&lrm;-But I was a doofus and didn't realise.
&lrm;-Game of secrets? What kind?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.380
&lrm;Ondine invented it.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.900
&lrm;You write down a secret
&lrm;and put it in the bracelet.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.740
&lrm;It's awesome! You wanna know my secret?

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.420
&lrm;That's where the akuma must be!

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.860
&lrm;Aqua lucky charm!

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.660
&lrm;Car keys?
&lrm;I guess we should hit the road, then.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.180
&lrm;Here, you can breathe through this.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.660
&lrm;Kim!

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.500
&lrm;Hey! We're not done yet!

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.340
&lrm;Ladybug!
&lrm;What have you done to my prince?

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.540
&lrm;-I think he took someone else to the ball.
&lrm;-I won't let you steal him from me!

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.380
&lrm;Kim is mine!

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.580
&lrm;-Cat Noir, are you all right?
&lrm;-Yeah, Bugaboo, I'm like a fish in water!

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.300
&lrm;Now be ready to strike!

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.180
&lrm;Cat Noir, now!

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.180
&lrm;Looks like I've got a nibble!

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.700
&lrm;How cool! I've always wanted a goldfish!

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.940
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.300
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.940
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.940
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.740
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.260
&lrm;-Thank you for keeping your promise.
&lrm;-We are a team, aren't we?

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.820
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Pound it!

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.740
&lrm;Each blend corresponds to a new power.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.700
&lrm;Oh, wow! That's a lot of powers!

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.300
&lrm;You should keep these vials with you
&lrm;at all times, just in case.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.380
&lrm;Well, that's not very practical.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.260
&lrm;Only the ingredients matter.
&lrm;They could be contained in anything.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.500
&lrm;Then, I may just have an idea!

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.380
&lrm;My little girl's
&lrm;mini macaroons are ready!

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.700
&lrm;Mmm! They look so good!

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.060
&lrm;Uh... actually... I'll taste them first
&lrm;and see if they are good!

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.220
&lrm;My daughter baked them.
&lrm;They're bound to be great!

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.940
&lrm;Mmm... magical macaroons!

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.900
&lrm;I love your idea, Marinette!

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.980
&lrm;-One magicaroon, one transformation!
&lrm;-The blue one looks yummy!

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.140
&lrm;You'll see. I'm told it's icy!

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.700
&lrm;Wanna play a game of secrets?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.820
&lrm;Ha, ha!

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.300
&lrm;"Wanna go to the movies with me?"

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.540
&lrm;[door bell rings]

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.780
&lrm;<i>-Who is it?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Over here. Lower.</i>

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.660
&lrm;<i>Hello, I'm Mr Chan. Adrien's</i>
&lrm;<i>Chinese tutor could not come today.</i>

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.860
&lrm;<i>I'll be replacing him.</i>

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.740
&lrm;Hmm.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.580
&lrm;<i>-What time is it?</i>
&lrm;-[Chinese translation]

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.340
&lrm;[repeats Chinese translation]

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.260
&lrm;Very good, Adrien. It's the right time.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.100
&lrm;Adrien, here is Mr Chan. He'll be
&lrm;your substitute teacher for today.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.940
&lrm;Hello, Adrien. I think you and I
&lrm;should have a little talk.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.180
&lrm;Adrien, meet Master Fu,
&lrm;the last guardian of the Miraculous.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.540
&lrm;-Nooroo. How can I obtain more powers?
&lrm;-What do you mean, master?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.540
&lrm;Don't treat me like an idiot!
&lrm;They have new powers. How did they do it?

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.580
&lrm;-We kwamis do not know the recipes.
&lrm;-It's inside this grimoire, isn't it?

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.380
&lrm;-Can't you read it?
&lrm;-Only guardians can.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.740
&lrm;-I don't know anything. I swear!
&lrm;-Well, then,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.940
&lrm;I will have to find this guardian
&lrm;of the Miraculous, wherever he is!

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.820
&lrm;Oh, no! I hate transforming!
