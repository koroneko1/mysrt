1
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:45,458
LONDON SWEETIES

2
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,416
I beg you. Come with me. It's just London.

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,125
It's only for a couple of days.
I will lend you my suitcase. I have two.

4
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:01,791
Business class ticket. Five-star hotel.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,375
What five-star? I'm serious.

6
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,000
You know how I am when I freak out.
I'll go crazy, and I'll lose it.

7
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,083
You have to come with me.

8
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,375
You should ask Pop then.

9
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,166
Just leave him there, in my heart.

10
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,291
-Kaew, right?
-Yes.

11
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,083
-You're late today.
-Only a little bit.

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,708
-What did you do last night?
-I went to bed late.

13
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,166
Oops!

14
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,750
Got stuck paper.

15
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,125
-Got stuck paper.
-"Paper got stuck."

16
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,916
-Right. Stuck got paper.
-That's it. "Paper got stuck."

17
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,500
You got it worse.

18
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,000
You always mess with me.

19
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,041
-Pop, hello.
-Pop, hello. Hello.

20
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,208
Why messing me with you are?

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,458
"Why are you messing with me?"

22
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:11,125
You struggle with Thai. How will you
manage just English in London?

23
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,083
Business class ticket, remember!

24
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,166
Business class, business class.

25
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,291
I'm paying in installments
for economy class.

26
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,791
I miss eating rice.

27
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,166
You miss Thai rice or midnight meals?

28
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,833
I miss Thai rice. It's so expensive here.

29
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,750
Just go to bed so you won't get fat.

30
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,958
No. Otherwise, you'll seduce me
while I'm asleep.

31
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,500
Bo, can you buy me new bras?

32
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,416
-Can't you buy them in London?
-I want the same model.

33
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,625
-And my boobs got bigger.
-Is that possible?

34
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,750
You don't believe it? Come and touch them.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,208
Yeah, I'll go touch them in London.

36
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:11,333
Get yourself out of there first
if you want to come to London.

37
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,208
Which model do you want?

38
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,708
Like this. But get me the red one.

39
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,500
Are these big? I can see
down to the belly button.

40
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,833
-Can you help?
-Don't worry.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,541
-Who's that?
-Jungwon.

42
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,000
Ju-On who?

43
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:38,708
Jungwon, not Ju-On.
He helped me when I first arrived here.

44
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:50,750
Hey, Four, every time we talk, why do you
only talk about Ju-On and not Emma?

45
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,625
So what is it? What's going on?

46
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:59,291
Well, it's something secret.
Wanna talk to him? I'll get him.

47
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,458
No, I can't.

48
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,375
I think Pen's tricking me
into going there.

49
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,625
Just go.

50
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,333
I'm not ready.
I haven't finished my internship.

51
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,541
Or is it that you don't want to leave Pop?

52
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,750
Find someone in London. Lots of men there.

53
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,125
I struggle with Thai language.

54
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,875
How will I manage English?

55
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,375
Go, or your brother-in-law
will think you don't like him.

56
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,416
My brother-in-law is one thing.
Me being crazy is another.

57
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,166
Me not being able to speak English,
that's another.

58
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,916
He would understand. He's not stupid.

59
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,666
He'll try to talk to you anyway.

60
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,458
It's stressful
that he'll try to talk to me.

61
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,458
-Why?
-Of course, I'm stressed out.

62
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,041
Let's say he talks to me.
I stress out, then freak.

63
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,000
If I freak, then I lose it.

64
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,166
How could I explain that to him?

65
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,416
-Eating chili relieves stress.
-Yeah, eating chili relieves stress.

66
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,833
Eat. Eat.

67
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,750
-Why?
-If you start the first sentence,

68
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,916
he'll think you speak English
and always talk to you.

69
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,041
-So I can't speak to him at all?
-Then don't go.

70
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:21,541
No, I have to. It's Pen's wedding.

71
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,666
You don't love her anymore?

72
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,166
Four, did you tell your friends
that I'm a mechanic?

73
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,291
I did.

74
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,791
-Not just an ordinary mechanic.
-What kind?

75
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,958
Super cute mechanic.

76
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,708
My girlfriend. She lives in London.

77
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,208
Bo, should we race?

78
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,125
I'm going to school,
but you are going home.

79
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,958
Let's see who will arrive first.

80
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,250
Shuttle boat against subway in London?

81
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,625
Of course, the shuttle boat is faster.

82
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,583
Fine. Fine.

83
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,791
If you win,
I'll let you kiss my butt cheeks.

84
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,916
If you lose,
I'll let you kiss my cheeks. Okay?

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,458
I gotta go. I'm in a hurry.
I miss your butt.

86
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,000
It's freezing.

87
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,083
Hey, I'm home.

88
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,666
You've just arrived?
I've been waiting here a long time.

89
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,166
-You lost.
-I went easy on you.

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,750
What does the loser have to do?

91
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,791
You have to come and kiss me.

92
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,750
Kissing you now.

93
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,375
Jude, why are you going to London?

94
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,666
I want to shag a westerner.

95
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,333
Then, show me,
how will you speak English to them?

96
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,250
There you go.

97
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,375
You can only say words about food?

98
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,833
Don't underestimate me.

99
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,875
If you disagree,

100
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,958
how about we bet 3,000 baht?

101
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,958
Don't challenge me. I'm quite confident
about this. How about 5,000 baht?

102
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,208
-I say 10,000 baht.
-15,000 baht.

103
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,458
-I say 20,000.
-30,000.

104
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,583
Then 40,000 with a live video.

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,416
You said it, Ouan. Deal.

106
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm trying to finish writing this essay.

107
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,583
And I have another part-time job.

108
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,250
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

109
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,875
I just have to finish my assignment.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,375
If it's too tiring,
why not finish school first,

111
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,625
then get a job in Thailand.
No need to do both at the same time.

112
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,875
No. They pay you well here.

113
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,875
Actually, I even want to get a job here,

114
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,833
but I miss someone in Thailand.

115
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,166
One sec.

116
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,541
What's wrong, Four? Why are you crying?

117
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,750
I'm not. I've just got dust in my eyes.

118
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,583
Tell me.

119
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,583
I'm not crying. I really have dust
in my eyes. I'm fine.

120
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,000
How about I sell my old house
and go to London?

121
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,375
It's just dust in my eyes,
and you're going to sell your house?

122
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,541
Even a drop of your tears is a big deal.
I'm going to London.

123
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,166
You don't have to come. I'm fine.

124
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,208
Why can't a suburb guy
like me go to London?

125
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,833
How will you manage here?
You can only say, "Yes, no, okay."

126
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,750
HOUSE FOR SALE
Contact 081-469-1443

127
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,708
It's been so long. I miss you.

128
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,333
Give me a hug.

129
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,958
-Is this all your stuff?
-Yes.

130
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,458
-Let's go.
-Wait. Take me to buy a SIM card first.

131
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,583
Why? We just got together and you want
a SIM card? Don't you miss me at all?

132
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,041
I read about it. It's cheap here.

133
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,916
All right, we'll buy it later. Go.

134
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,541
It's cold.

135
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,583
Michael is a really nice guy.
You'll like him when you two meet.

136
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,833
Got something to insert here
so I can pull the SIM tray out?

137
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,708
Can you do it at home? Listen to me first.

138
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,291
I'm afraid of getting lost.

139
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,750
Here is the story.

140
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,500
It was 7:00 a.m. on my day off.
I went to the beach.

141
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,875
I was appreciating the scenery.

142
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,333
And then a strong wind
blew out of nowhere.

143
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,625
It blew my scarf away. It was gone.

144
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,416
Wait. What does this story
have to do with Michael?

145
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,833
-Don't rush me. I'm telling you now.
-All right. Day two.

146
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:08,208
So, on day two, I went to work
at the clinic, and I met Michael.

147
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,041
Day three.

148
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,083
I bumped into him in front of my flat.
I just realized

149
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,333
he'd been living there for years,
but we never met.

150
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,833
When I told him that the scarf was mine,

151
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,833
he was surprised,
and he shouted "Destiny!"

152
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,875
-What's "Disney"?
-No, not Walt Disney.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,083
"Destiny'" as in...

154
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,000
-godsent.
-Godsent.

155
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,208
"Destiny," right?

156
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,041
-"Destiny," okay?
-I see, "Destiny."

157
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,666
And, on day eight...

158
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,333
It was the last day of his treatment.

159
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,875
As I was treating him,
he wrote on his back,

160
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,875
-"You are the apple of my eye."
-Apple?

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
-What does it have to do with an apple?
-It's an idiom.

162
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:05,625
It means, "You are my heart,"
or something like that.

163
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,625
What is "idiom"?

164
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,541
Are you happy to have
a foreigner as your brother-in-law?

165
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,833
Yeah, I guess.
I don't even know what "idiom" is.

166
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,541
Here, Michael calls me "June."
Don't be confused.

167
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,458
Call yourself "Polly," I beg you.

168
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,791
-Why?
-Because "Pron" here sounds like "porno."

169
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,375
It means, "You are my heart,"
or something like that.

170
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,166
What is "idiom"?

171
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,916
I can't speak Thai.
No, I can't speak English.

172
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,208
Pen.

173
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,791
If you start the first sentence,

174
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,500
he'll think you speak English
and always talk to you.

175
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,541
Hey...

176
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,166
Are you Thai?

177
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,000
Is there anything I can do to help?
Can you speak English?

178
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,250
The policeman want to see your passport.

179
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,583
-Passport.
-Passport.

180
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,708
Do you have it?

181
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,083
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome. We're both Thai.

182
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,916
Next time, you should be more prepared

183
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,708
about the passport,

184
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,750
travelling, listening,
and speaking English

185
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,291
because that makes
Thai women here look stupid.

186
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,708
Damn.

187
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,791
Pron.

188
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,041
-You waited long?
-Pen.

189
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,375
After your wedding, I'll go back home.

190
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,083
I won't be able to get married soon.
Michael had a bicycle accident.

191
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,750
His arm is still in a cast.
He won't have healed within seven days.

192
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,041
What did you say?

193
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,083
What are you guys laughing about?

194
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,916
You just said you wanted
to give him a blow job.

195
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,708
But it's okay.
They don't use that word here.

196
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,916
What does "moke" mean?

197
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,958
Oh, no.

198
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,791
What did Ju-On say?

199
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,000
His name is Jungwon!

200
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,041
Yeah, what did he say?

201
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,750
He offered to swap rooms
because he has a bigger bed.

202
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,625
Tell him it's all right.
I can sleep on the couch.

203
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,500
You said that yourself.

204
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,791
Here, I barely made it through here.

205
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,750
Bo, how much is it for my bra?

206
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,458
It's nothing. I bought it for you.

207
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,833
Come on, you bought them for me
so many times.

208
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't worry.

209
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,833
Last time you lost, right?

210
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,916
-Take off your pants. I'll kiss you.
-Creepy!

211
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,666
If you lose, you kiss the cheeks,
not the butt cheeks.

212
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,250
-What?
-You have nice hands.

213
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,125
Why?

214
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,000
-What did she say?
-She just said hello to you.

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,458
-Let's get to the point.
-What?

216
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,041
I want to experience the real London.

217
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,041
-Aren't we in London?
-No...

218
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:04,250
-What?
-I want to sleep with women. Is it hard?

219
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,083
You want to sleep with women here?

220
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,083
It's not that hard.
But women here don't smile much.

221
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,500
If they smile at you,
then you might have a shot at it.

222
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
You should take an English class
until the wedding.

223
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,416
It might help you stop freaking out.

224
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,791
I've been learning English
since I was a kid. It doesn't help.

225
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,583
How much longer do I have to study?

226
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,541
If you can exclaim in English,
then it's a start.

227
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,458
If you dream in English,
you've got the hang of the language.

228
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,000
If you have a westerner as a boyfriend,

229
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,458
you'll get the right accent.

230
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,416
-Like you?
-Yeah.

231
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,708
What did he say? Do you understand?

232
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,583
Thai language is not allowed, I guess.

233
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,291
Are you Thai?

234
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,500
-Yes, I am.
-We'll speak Thai then. I'm Bo.

235
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,916
I'm Pron. I think I'm younger.

236
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,291
Hi, Pron. I'm Jude.

237
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,375
That's my friend.

238
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Aung Tuan. He's half French.

239
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,708
Hi.

240
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:55,250
He's a westerner but can't speak English.
He has a crush on you.

241
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,083
You're weird.
You even mess up exclamations.

242
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,416
Oh, God!

243
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,375
What's wrong, Pron?

244
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,041
Guys can't chat me up. I go crazy.

245
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,583
-I freak out and lose it.
-You'll be dead meat.

246
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,458
When French people greet each other,

247
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,416
they French kiss with the tongue.

248
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,333
Go with the tongue all the way.

249
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,375
Why do you avoid me all the time?
You don't want to talk to me?

250
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,541
I like you.

251
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,708
I don't understand. Why do you follow me?

252
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,083
I don't understand you.

253
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,333
Here, here.

254
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,000
Bonjour.

255
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,541
Yes, one moment, please.

256
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,041
-Aung Tuan is getting serious.
-Why?

257
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,208
He asked me to teach him Thai
so he can talk to Pron.

258
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,583
How do you know he wants you to teach him?

259
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,458
We're alike.

260
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,291
-I know that.
-What did you teach him?

261
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,458
Hey, Aung Tuan. Tuan.

262
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,666
Wanna go eat some pussy?

263
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,625
Yeah!

264
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,833
Bo.

265
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Jungwon wants to talk to you.

266
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:55,375
You speak English so well now!
Did you understand him?

267
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,291
I can't take you there.

268
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,833
-To where?
-To give handouts.

269
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,083
To give handouts?

270
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah, okay, that's fine.
What will you do then?

271
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:16,125
I have an exam. I won't be home.

272
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,750
-Go ahead. Don't worry. I'll manage.
-You sure?

273
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,791
It's handouts, Four. Can't be so hard.

274
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,750
You gave him your word.
If you don't want to go, tell him.

275
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,291
No need. I can do it.

276
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,833
Giving handouts. Easy, piece of cake.

277
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,750
-Will you be okay?
-Just go to your exam. Don't worry.

278
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,416
But I really won't be home.

279
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,083
Just go to your exam. Don't worry.

280
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,083
What boy? I'm a man.

281
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:58,916
Eat.

282
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,541
Go. Go eat. Eat...

283
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,333
Eat...

284
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,958
Eat... Eat...

285
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,666
Eat...

286
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:49,041
Damn it. What the hell?

287
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,583
Damn! I still have no chance.

288
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,000
He doesn't see me.

289
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,166
He doesn't see me. I don't see him.

290
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,583
I see nobody. Nobody sees me.

291
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,083
No...

292
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,458
Last night, I even had a dream
about me trying to avoid Michael.

293
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,916
Why did you avoid him? Just talk to him.

294
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,125
Well, was your dream
in English or in Thai?

295
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,500
In my dream,

296
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,416
Michael was gonna choke me,

297
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,250
so I shouted...

298
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,708
What?

299
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,333
So it's either the number eight or an egg.

300
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,791
"Eight," the number, or "egg"?

301
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,250
-Aren't they the same thing?
-They are not!

302
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,375
Straight or box?

303
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,625
Pen, what kind of lottery is that?

304
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,291
What is "straight"? What is "box"?

305
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,791
Straight is the jackpot.
Box is matching numbers.

306
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:06,583
We bought two pounds, right?
If we win, we'll get 10,000 pounds.

307
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,375
When will you talk to him?

308
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:13,291
I do want to talk to him,
so I can thank him for loving you

309
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,208
and taking care of you.

310
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,250
Then we can talk about other things.

311
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,500
Maybe about when you used to be a tomboy.

312
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,541
If you talk about that, you'll get hit.

313
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:43,958
He didn't even teach us. He cooked without
heating the pan. The class is expensive.

314
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,041
Do I look stupid?

315
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,208
I think he wants to teach us
how English language works.

316
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:53,250
After we finish shopping at the market,
let's go cook at my place, okay?

317
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,916
-Invite Aung Tuan too.
-No, no, no.

318
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,375
Westerner!

319
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,041
What is "ear shark"?

320
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,583
What are you looking at?

321
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,125
I saw an Arab guy leaving his bag there.

322
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,125
Then he was gone.

323
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,166
Is he a terrorist?

324
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,083
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

325
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,208
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

326
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,833
Where did he go?

327
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,958
She parked a baby stroller there.

328
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,250
-What do we do? You go tell her.
-What should we do?

329
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,125
-What should we do?
-Go tell her!

330
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,708
You should call the police.
Hurry. Call them.

331
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,708
-Call. Call.
-What the number?

332
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:00,708
-Number! Number!
-Number, number...

333
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,166
-What's the number? What is it?
-Number?

334
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,083
-I don't know.
-Tell her.

335
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,000
Wait.

336
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,000
-What will you tell her?
-I don't know.

337
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,500
-What will you say?
-I can't.

338
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,625
"Baby." How do we say "baby"
in English?

339
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,666
-Baby.
-Baby.

340
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,708
Go tell the baby.

341
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,208
Get back here!

342
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,083
Why are you taking all this with you?
Leave it with me.

343
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,333
-Bomb!
-Bomb!

344
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:24,125
Pron, get back here!

345
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,500
We're in trouble!

346
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,416
Why did you run?

347
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,041
-Why did you me with mess?
-It's "mess with me."

348
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,208
Hello, how are you?

349
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,083
-Is Pron here?
-Aung Tuan.

350
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,625
Hi.

351
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,541
-He's Pron's boyfriend.
-Pron's boyfriend?

352
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,375
Thank you very much.

353
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,916
Pron.

354
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,583
Your boyfriend is here.

355
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,500
Hi.

356
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,333
No, he's not. No.

357
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,708
Why are you hiding? He's here to see you.

358
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,791
Everyone, this is Michael, my groom-to-be.

359
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,708
Talk to him.

360
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,666
-What are you doing?
-Washing veggies.

361
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,250
I'll make salad.

362
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,750
Are you embarrassed?

363
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:17,000
Bo.

364
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,875
Chicken rice? Yeah. Okay. No skin?

365
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,500
Okay, I'll go make it now. Wait a bit.

366
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,500
-What are you doing here?
-Getting fresh air.

367
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,625
Come here.

368
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,833
Close the door, or he'll come after us.

369
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,000
Why did you invite him? You too.

370
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:28,500
Wanna go eat some pussy?

371
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,000
God, no!

372
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,541
What is this?

373
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,958
How come you don't understand
your own language?

374
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,041
What went wrong?

375
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,875
Straight, left, right.

376
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:09,958
Is he really a westerner?

377
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,875
Hi, there!

378
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,666
Girls!

379
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,375
Do you want to make out?

380
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,041
POSSIBLE

381
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,375
POSSIBLY

382
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,958
POSSIBILITY

383
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,000
PROBABLE

384
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,750
Enough! No more talking!

385
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,875
PROBLEM, THEN

386
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm okay.

387
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,250
It's just that Michael and I...

388
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,250
It's over. That's it.

389
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,375
I came back home, and I didn't see him,
so I called.

390
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,541
And we argued.

391
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,208
I speak English well enough
to marry a westerner.

392
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,375
We still can't work it out.

393
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,000
It's not about the meaning.
It's about the feeling.

394
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,750
I think "possible" means possible.

395
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,666
POSSIBLE - It can happen

396
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,083
But Michael thinks "possibly"
means possibly.

397
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,000
POSSIBLY - It might happen

398
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:49,916
Hey, Four.

399
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,833
-You said you had an exam.
-I'm about to leave.

400
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,291
I'm in a hurry.

401
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,541
-Gotta go. Bye.
-Why is your hair so wet?

402
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,583
What's with her?

403
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,000
Hey, Jude. What did you do?

404
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,125
What did I do?

405
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,875
Why did you make fun of her?

406
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,041
She is mute.

407
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,333
Want to eat?

408
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,000
Want some?

409
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,583
It's already bad enough for her.

410
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,583
If you were not Thai,
I would fire you now.

411
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,000
Should I apologize to her?

412
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,666
No. What are you going to say?
She can't hear.

413
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,000
I don't understand.

414
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,833
One second. I'm about to explain.

415
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,958
Michael thinks it's impossible

416
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,625
that anyone can be so scared
of speak English,

417
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:20,083
but he thinks it's possible
that someone doesn't like him.

418
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,125
So we argued.

419
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,541
I don't know if I heard
it wrong or if he was being silly.

420
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,875
We talked, and we became frustrated.

421
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,541
I don't know if he said it wrong or right.

422
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:36,083
And I had to translate.
I just translated what he said.

423
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,375
I don't know.

424
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,541
I need to go to present...
a marketing project.

425
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,375
I have an exam. I won't be home.

426
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,750
Maybe I just don't understand him.

427
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,916
If we marry, we won't make it last.

428
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,291
The wedding has to be cancelled.

429
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:26,916
Is it because of me?

430
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,000
Yes.

431
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,583
Here, I barely made it through here.

432
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:42,625
Four.

433
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,250
Four. Four.

434
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,875
I want to go home.

435
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:54,833
-Bo, what's wrong?
-Did you cry because you want to leave me?

436
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,916
I'm not crying. I really have dust
in my eyes. I'm fine.

437
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,458
How long have you been with Jungwon?

438
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,791
Well, it's something secret.

439
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,666
I'm fine. You don't have to come.
Don't sell your house. Calm down.

440
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:10,916
Bo, what's wrong with you?

441
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,375
We hadn't seen each other in a long time.
Why did you hesitate to hug me?

442
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,041
I'm shy.

443
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,500
What did she say?

444
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,333
Look!

445
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:36,833
One second. I'll be back.

446
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,708
Sorry.

447
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,000
Hey, Jude. What are you doing?

448
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,333
I'm here to apologize to her.

449
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,208
I told you, didn't I?

450
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,666
You can't communicate with her.

451
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,750
I told you in Thai.
You still don't understand?

452
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:26,041
I think you should leave. Go back home.

453
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,708
Get out.

454
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,166
What's so scary about speaking English?

455
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,375
He must have dumped me.

456
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,458
Should you two talk face to face?

457
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:10,791
No.

458
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:15,750
I know what you said. I studied English.

459
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:18,708
Where did you study English?
You misunderstood.

460
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,750
I understood what he said.

461
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,916
"Closet" doesn't mean wardrobe here.

462
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,375
He's gay.

463
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,750
He wants to let everyone know.

464
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,291
Four, are you speaking English to me?

465
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,541
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

466
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,750
I didn't mean to speak English to you.
Don't be mad at me.

467
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,750
Hello.

468
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,625
I failed.

469
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,416
I thought she spoke English,
and I didn't understand.

470
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,791
Actually, she didn't speak at all.

471
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah, I'll ask my grandma
to transfer half of it.

472
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,000
I lost, and I accept that.

473
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:34,166
Damn. I've been mistranslating
all this time?

474
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:35,958
Bo, what's wrong?

475
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,666
IS IT THAI OR ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

476
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,666
I don't want to understand English.
It makes me look stupid.

477
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,458
Four, we live in different worlds.

478
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,041
You better leave me.

479
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,375
I'm stupid.

480
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:04,875
I'm stupid like a donkey!

481
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,958
Stupid how?

482
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,125
Too stupid to be with her.

483
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:06,500
I'll ask to stay with Aung Tuan
until I find a ticket home.

484
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,083
I'm much stupider than you.

485
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:15,375
I wanted to apologize to a mute,
and I got fired.

486
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,750
Idiot! We've studied English
since the first grade.

487
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:35,291
-Hey, Jude, Bo.
-Why are you here?

488
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,041
Can you ask Aung Tuan to give me a lift?

489
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,458
-Where to?
-Michael's home.

490
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,083
-Why do you want to go there?
-A bit of a misunderstanding.

491
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:46,750
How serious is it?

492
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,125
-The wedding might get cancelled.
-That bad?

493
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,333
Jude,

494
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:54,166
can you please ask Aung Tuan?

495
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,958
Me? Talk to Aung Tuan?

496
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,541
Aung Tuan.

497
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,041
Vroom!

498
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,916
Sorry, I don't get it.

499
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,541
Bo, your turn to talk to him.

500
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,291
He doesn't understand.

501
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,625
For Pen. For Pen. For Pen.

502
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,291
Okay.

503
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:15,791
I knew it.

504
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,166
You, playboy!

505
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:29,291
That's sad.

506
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:45,666
Pen.

507
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,416
I'm sorry.

508
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,500
Turn left.

509
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,333
Left? Okay.

510
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:16,375
Chonnicha. You are Pron's friend, right?

511
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:19,708
You already know. Why do you ask?

512
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,083
I already know. Why do I ask?

513
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,750
Well, when will she come back?

514
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,541
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

515
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:34,583
Well, an intern should finish
an internship

516
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,666
in order to graduate. You are her friend.

517
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,541
You should call her. Will you? Call her?

518
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,875
You should call her yourself.

519
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,166
Call her myself.

520
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:52,750
Call her. Call her myself.

521
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:54,916
I don't have her number.

522
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,208
If you don't, then me neither.

523
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,416
Friends have each other's numbers.

524
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,000
I don't have her number,
but I can take you to her.

525
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,125
-Really?
-Business class ticket.

526
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:46,125
-Pen is getting married.
-That's great.

527
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,041
I'm her only family.
I have to give a speech.

528
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,666
Do it then.

529
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:54,666
A speech in English. Piece of cake!

530
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,958
I don't think you should.
You're nervous enough.

531
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,291
You haven't added water yet.

532
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:08,750
Water's not boiled.

533
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,208
It's spilling.

534
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,291
The tap is still running.

535
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,958
Water, water, water.

536
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,000
Are you making coffee or salad?

537
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,541
Pour it into a cup.

538
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,208
I'm also gonna sing.

539
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,208
-Sing?
-Yeah.

540
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,041
Don't. You'll ruin the party.
Don't embarrass us Thai.

541
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:35,375
I'm so ready. So ready. Look.

542
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,333
I'll eat alphabet crackers. Here!

543
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:48,291
Don't forget to say, "Hooray!"
after you're done singing.

544
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,541
-Hooray.
-Hayroo.

545
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,541
-Hooray.
-Hayroo.

546
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,750
-Hooray.
-Hayroo.

547
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,291
-Hayroo.
-Hooray.

548
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,875
What are you doing?

549
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,958
I'm rehearsing for singing
at Pen's wedding.

550
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,500
Is this rehearsing?

551
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,041
Berremme...

552
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,583
What's with the spoonerism?

553
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,125
Now go and get her. Berremme...

554
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,875
"Remember."

555
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:19,041
-What does it mean?
-Remember.

556
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:22,291
I'm remembering. I'm memorizing it.
What does it mean?

557
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,916
Remember.

558
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:29,458
-Berremme...
-Remember. Remember.

559
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,291
Remember.

560
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:37,416
Seriously, I think you shouldn't sing.
Just memorize it.

561
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:41,041
Write it down and recite it to them.

562
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:46,041
You'll embarrass yourself
with your singing.

563
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,125
You can't even say "remember."

564
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,625
It's "remember."

565
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Hi, where are you going?

566
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,625
I'm rehearsing for Pen's wedding.

567
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:05,000
Can we talk in English?

568
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:10,250
This way we can practice English together.

569
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,708
This song, here.

570
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,291
Did I sing it right?

571
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,875
Awesome.

572
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,500
Really?

573
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,458
Awesome.

574
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:20,083
June, I love you.

575
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:24,291
I love you. I love you.

576
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,375
Aung Tuan.

577
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,041
It's pretty here,
but my country is more beautiful.

578
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,083
What's wrong with Bo?

579
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:30,125
I planned to stay in
London for only one month,

580
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:34,125
but, after meeting you,
I don't want to leave.

581
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:38,541
It'd be nice if Jan were here too.
We'd surely take a lot of pictures.

582
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:42,041
My next destination is Manchester,
where I'll stay for three months,

583
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,250
and Scotland after that for three months.

584
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,083
They can understand each other.

585
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,166
Do you want to listen to a song?

586
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,666
A bra?

587
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,166
A song.

588
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:50,958
What's the song? Do you understand it?

589
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,708
So touching.

590
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,000
But I don't understand a word.

591
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:01,250
Don't flirt with me. I'm weird.

592
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:04,250
Today, I had a date with a French girl.

593
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,041
When I'm startled, it causes spoonerism.

594
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,875
But I want to speak Thai today.

595
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:12,708
Actually, before I came here,
I had a crush on a guy at the office.

596
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:19,833
But I pulled down his pants.
So embarrassing!

597
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,833
-Kim hiss!
-Kiss him!

598
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,125
-Kag and shiss!
-Kiss and shag!

599
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,375
Let's go!

600
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,750
I don't understand.

601
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:42,875
But it's just one-sided love.
I don't know if he likes me or not.

602
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,625
My scarf.

603
01:08:58,541 --> 01:08:59,541
Pop!

604
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,833
I've missed you.

605
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,375
Bro.

606
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:40,541
Pron is weird,
but guys still go after her.

607
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:42,500
Who do you think she'll choose?

608
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:46,125
Have you asked her who she likes?

609
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,333
I don't know who she's gonna pick,

610
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,125
but Aung Tuan is my friend.

611
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:30,541
I'm here! I'm here!

612
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,333
I think you should just stand there
and smile.

613
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,000
Good afternoon.

614
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,083
At first, I wasn't sure...

615
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,583
It's a Bee Gees' song!

616
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,333
You two speak different languages.

617
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,916
But...

618
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,083
But...

619
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,291
You say it best...

620
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,166
This is from Notting Hill!

621
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,750
You come from different countries.

622
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,625
We are the world.

623
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,791
You are the best...

624
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:40,833
Just the way you are.

625
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,208
It's a Bruno Mars' song!

626
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:44,791
When you're angry...

627
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:47,791
Please remember...

628
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,791
How do I live without you?

629
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:54,791
This is from the movie Con Air.

630
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:56,833
Let it go.

631
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,208
The animated film Frozen.

632
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,125
-So touching.
-You feel touched?

633
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:11,250
I didn't get her point.

634
01:15:27,625 --> 01:15:30,750
-Can I walk with you?
-Yes.

635
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,291
It's cold.

636
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:39,083
Will you go back to Thailand
right after the wedding?

637
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,375
Well...

638
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,958
They miss you in Thailand.

639
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,166
I do too.

640
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,958
Come back. With me.

641
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:03,250
Let's go back together.

642
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,041
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

643
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:12,000
-Wait up.
-No!

644
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:13,791
Pron.

645
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,416
I'm embarrassed!

646
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:25,041
What do you have to be embarrassed about?

647
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,375
About Pron.

648
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,333
She's weird,
but she made it work in the end.

649
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,958
I won't give up.

650
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:23,083
Jan, what are you listening to?
Can I listen to it too?

651
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,583
Here.

652
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:44,166
Awesome.

653
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,083
Awesome? Really?

654
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:49,875
More. More.

655
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:58,416
You like it?

656
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:03,083
I don't understand a single word,
but it's so touching.

657
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:18,500
Listen to this song. I like it.

658
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:28,625
I have only this song for you to listen
I need you to understand and try to love

659
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:34,708
I will make you understand that
How much I love you

660
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:44,250
I give you with all my heart
And no need to return my love

661
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,625
I just want you to know...

662
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,333
Understand or don't understand.

663
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,541
Which to choose?

664
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:52,083
Four, I'm sorry.

665
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:54,833
I didn't try hard enough.

666
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:04,958
Where are you, Four?

667
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,375
I came back to see you in Thailand.

668
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,166
Where are you now?

669
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:26,208
I'm outside your flat in London.

670
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:29,666
Why did you go there?

671
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:33,958
Four, don't cry. I'll come to you.

672
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,833
Should we have another race?

673
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,916
Who's going to arrive first?

674
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,291
You challenge me again.

675
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:58,416
If you win, you can kiss my butt cheek.

676
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:02,208
If you lose, you can kiss my cheek.

677
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,708
Get your butt cheek ready then.

678
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,333
I'm sorry.

679
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,166
I'm sorry.

680
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,500
I'm sorry.

681
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:46,125
-Hi.
-Hi.

682
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,583
-Thank you very much. See you!
-Thanks.

683
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,791
Sorry, I'm done.
