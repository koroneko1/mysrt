The exact same car that your grandpa had.

There's this psychiatrist, and she's on
all of the "Best of Atlanta" lists.

in this case, we're really lucky,

So what did the doctor say?

‐ She said that I have
"an irritable uterus,"

which feels vaguely misogynistic,
even though she's a woman.

I had a miscarriage
when I was in grad school.

I had to have two surgeries.

And the doctor,

she said she didn't know if I'd ever have
a viable pregnancy after that.

I realize that if I lost this baby,

it would hurt just as badly
with or without a name.
