00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:33.920
I can't do this anymore...

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.534
What's wrong?

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.349
Well...his boss's son!!

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:37.792
He won't stop playing

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.245
I'm super tired

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:43.051

It's too tired for me

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:52.088
If you call me only because of this

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:53.702
I'll hang up !!

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:54.412

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:56.129
What?
Minie !

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.270
I separate Win from James 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.119
It's your job to handle everything now on!!

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.969
Hmm...

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.838
Damn !

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:08.705
She's so useless

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.692
well what I've to do next...

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.050
Where's Teenoi?

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.592
Oh yes where's he?

00:02:41.592 --> 00:02:43.483
Where's he?
He's in the couch 

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:44.866
let's watch

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.242
where's he?

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:48.521
this is so interesting

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:50.178
can you find him?

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:52.717
I'm trying to but I just can't see him

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.779
I'm gonna go play game

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.779
Come on
Let's go play!

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:57.977

I'll follow you

00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:19.104
You look a lot better!

00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:21.465
Really? Is that so obvious?

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:22.670
Yep

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.580
You feel better now right? I mean...about Beauty?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.951
Well…I still think of her sometime

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:29.943
I still feel something 

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.922
but I know what to do

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.808
Being single is not that bad

00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:38.033
You only need cold beer 

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:39.777
and things will be fine

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:42.571
….for single life 

00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.543
Are you sure that you’re single?

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.942
I saw you're on call for an hour?

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:50.560
Oh..

00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:55.040
What?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:04.077
(crying)

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.491
It’s just friend

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.526
(crying)

00:04:09.526 --> 00:04:11.302
Oh shit...

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:13.937
I just need someone to talk to and I’m happy with that so…

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:26.766
(crying)

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.652
(laughing)

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:30.868
Are you alright?

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:33.591
Damn crazy....I should ask you

00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:35.535
I'm ok

00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:37.245
How can I be not ok? Look!

00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.826

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:42.491
I'm ok !!

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:47.542
Be careful !

00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:56.378
Yeah..let’s chill out

00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:59.177
Nope
I'm tired today

00:04:59.177 --> 00:05:00.849
I'll rest now

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.473
I'll follow you

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:19.713
Great?

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:21.336
Nothing to tell us?

00:05:21.336 --> 00:05:22.217
so what's wrong with Teenoi?

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.000
He’s tried I guess

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
He played a lot today	

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.381
Play?

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:28.261
Play with the kids

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.437

Why you try to force us like this!!

00:05:52.717 --> 00:05:55.131
Hmm...well

00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:57.558
How can I date her?

00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:00.413
Well..look around

00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:01.989

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:57.326

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:08.480

Don’t flirt ! I’m not into it 

00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:12.486

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:18.080
So annoying…I know I’m beautiful so stop flirting 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.845

If you don’t ask me to be your girlfriend

00:20:17.114 --> 00:20:19.607
I’ll say yes to the other guys

00:20:19.607 --> 00:20:22.667
I won’t let it happen

00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:24.556
....to let you be with other guys?

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:27.292
I'd rather die

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.887
LOL

00:20:28.887 --> 00:20:31.765
Teenoi

00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:32.982
yep

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.680
Do you like the birthday this year?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.380
Absolutely

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.758
you did a lot for me

00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:42.649
how can I say?

00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:51.415
Honestly 
love is always good

00:20:51.415 --> 00:20:55.040
How about you? Win

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.897
Me?

00:20:56.897 --> 00:21:02.117
Well…
I think I understand what it is 

00:21:02.117 --> 00:21:05.900
I get to know more of myself

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.206
I’ve been through a lot of pain 

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:11.804
and expectation

00:21:11.804 --> 00:21:15.346
today

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:17.953
I see people who share love 

00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:20.424
and people who take very good care 
of their love like...James

00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:22.141
so I really understand the meaning of it

00:21:23.473 --> 00:21:28.824
Also, I’m so happy for Beauty 
who starts her new love life

00:21:28.824 --> 00:21:33.175
Love is just like that

00:21:33.175 --> 00:21:35.582
There’s no perfect rule for it 

00:21:35.582 --> 00:21:38.338
but there’s a deep meaning 

00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:42.759
that we all have to learn by ourselves

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:45.162
and how about you?

00:21:48.061 --> 00:21:50.143
me right now?

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:54.820
I understand the meaning of self-love I think

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.094
but if you ask me that am I ready for a new love?

00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.654
I’m glad and ready to open up 

00:22:03.654 --> 00:22:05.717
How?

00:22:05.717 --> 00:22:10.597
There’s no reason for love

00:22:10.597 --> 00:22:13.124
There’s no right or wrong 

00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:17.951
we just need to admit it

00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:20.090
admit the way it is

00:22:23.707 --> 00:22:26.518
If you’re ready...

00:22:26.518 --> 00:22:29.119
let Minie find someone for you

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:33.205
Look what I’ve got from her? Damn good

00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:34.875
Nope

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:40.355
It’s our love so we've do it by ourselves right?

00:22:43.155 --> 00:22:44.715
but....it's not that bad

00:22:44.715 --> 00:22:47.091
it might be a destiny you know?

00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:57.920
Awww look at you

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.003

00:23:01.178 --> 00:23:03.170
I'm leaving now

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.228
