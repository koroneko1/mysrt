1
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,439
I need the trophy.

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,000
What?

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,439
What are you talking about? Huh?

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Polo, come...

5
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,640
Where is it?

6
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,320
-In a safe place where nobody can find it.
-I want them to find it.

7
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,759
I want them to know I did it
so all this will end.

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,680
No.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,840
No one will know you had it.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,879
-No.
-I don't want you to suffer.

11
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,079
You don't?

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,120
I've been suffering for months
by your side.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,159
Supporting you.

14
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,120
You want to throw it all away,
and you're asking me to help you?

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,319
Cayetana, it's my decision. My life.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,040
-I'm tired of everyone deciding for me.
-When have I ever done that?

17
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,920
Did you contact the British school
so they'd reject me?

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,239
What?

19
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,120
What's he talking about, Cayetana?

20
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,200
-No...
-Of course.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
It had to be you.

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,480
I did it because I can't lose you.
I love you. All right?

23
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,159
You want me by your side,
knowing my life here is hell?

24
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,359
-That isn't love.
-Hi!

25
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,359
Why are you here? 
What's going on? Everything OK?

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,400
-Lu, stay out of this.
-What a threesome you've got yourself.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,040
Yesterday, I still thought
this was like a horror movie.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
Two monsters fighting
over a damsel in distress.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Now she's in tears
over two monsters who aren't worth it.

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,599
One is the bastard who came to fuck up
our lives. Right, Polo?

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,439
Perhaps the monster isn't who you think.

32
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,360
-Valerio...
-Please!

33
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,319
Can we talk for a sec?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Fine...

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,319
but you'll need to get cleaned up first.

36
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,520
What the hell, Lu?

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,919
Fuck!

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,719
-You fucking ruined my life, asshole.
-Lu...

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Lu, I just want...

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,960
to talk about your scholarship.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,680
Just ignore him, please.

42
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,280
Be right back.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Want a sip, Marchioness?

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,719
No... thanks.

45
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,639
No wonder you don't want anything from me
after the other day.

46
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,400
Well, it wasn't entirely your fault.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Carla, I wanted to apologize.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I sold you the Molly out of jealousy.

49
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,360
I knew you weren't okay
and could've gotten hurt.

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,560
And all for what? A guy.

51
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,960
It's not your fault he's in love with you.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,599
And then I say I'm a feminist.

53
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,000
Fucking patriarchy.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,120
Don't beat yourself up over it.
I was jealous too.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,919
You? Why?

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,240
He was with me,
but all he did was think about you.

57
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,919
Yeah, I was with someone else,
but all I did was think about him.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,280
We really hurt each other. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't get carried away, blondie.

60
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,759
It takes more than that
to bring me down.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,479
I'm worried about Samu.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,879
Why?

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Haven't you realized it yet?

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,159
That kid worships the ground you walk on.

65
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,719
He'd go to hell just to warm up a pizza
if you asked him to.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
He eats out of your hand.

67
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,759
So, don't clench your fist...

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,519
Can I have a napkin?

69
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,120
You really have some balls
showing up here.

70
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
I just want to dry off.

71
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,800
And I want you to go.

72
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,319
For your own good.

73
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,879
Omar... give me a napkin, please.

74
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,879
Omar, go get more bottles.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,759
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

76
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,199
-What are you going to do?
-Are you protecting him?

77
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,000
No, you idiot. I'm protecting you.

78
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,480
Say you stab him in the heart,
then what? You'll end up in jail,

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,399
your mom will be devastated,
and Polo's moms will want revenge.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,519
When will this nightmare end?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,399
Valerio, please. Let's forget about Polo.

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,319
-It's over now.
-A bottle of champagne, please.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,279
-Don't let him come between us.
-Just get away from me, OK?

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,519
Here you are, guys.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,240
Polo was right. All this was crazy.

86
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,639
-You made us think it was possible.
-Yeah, because it was possible.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
It didn't end
because there are three of us.

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,879
It ended because of who we are. Glasses!

89
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
Thanks! Cheers.

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,519
Son of a bitch.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,439
Lu, forget about him.

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,199
Nadia, don't play innocent.

93
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
You want to smash this bottle
over his head as much as I do.

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,639
Admit it.

95
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,720
Is it true your mother's out?

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
It is, and she's eager
to get back to business.

97
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
I need her to send someone to scare Polo.

98
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,720
-Excuse me?
-To scare the living shit out of him.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,439
Literally scare him to death.

100
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,920
What're you talking about?
How much have you had to drink?

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,319
I just stopped someone
who was headed straight for you,

102
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,160
but I won't be able to stop everyone
who wants to slit your throat here.

103
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,160
Thank you.

104
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
I didn't do it for you.

105
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
Why the fuck did you come here?

106
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm going to turn myself in.

107
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,360
What?

108
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,959
Tomorrow.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Tonight.

110
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,120
I'll never be able to fix
all the damage...

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
I've caused you...

112
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,600
and Samuel...

113
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
but at least my moms will pay
for Nadia and Lu's program.

114
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,519
That's why I came.

115
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,519
To tell them in person.

116
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
To ask your forgiveness...

117
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,040
and tell you it's over.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,879
Great.

119
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,439
Now get out.

120
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,040
When I get out of prison...

121
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
someday...

122
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
will you forgive me?

123
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,679
Never.

124
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,080
-I'll get another one.
-No.

125
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,440
-No, you said this was the last one.
-Just one more!

126
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,440
Shit! Careful, guys! GuzmÃ¡n!

127
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,879
Help me pick this up
before someone gets hurt.

128
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,120
-Where's the neck?
-I don't know. I haven't seen it.

129
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,600
Rebeka.

130
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,679
I said no.
Do I need to spell it out for you?

131
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm never going to send anyone
to scare Polo.

132
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,159
But your mom took care of that kid.

133
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm not like my mom.
Get that through your fucking head!

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,080
So, nobody's taking him out?

135
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,399
I would if they let me.
Watch out for the broken glass!

136
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Let me do it. It's my job.

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
Just what I needed...

138
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,080
You have to be kidding me. Shit, Polo...

139
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,879
Can't you wait one night
for him to be gone?

140
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Are you still defending him?

141
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,960
Talk later, guys. Cleanup time.

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,759
Look for the bottleneck.

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,840
Get out of here, Polo.

144
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,320
You think I don't realize I'm not welcome?

145
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,639
Do you think I need you
to tell me that... every day?

146
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,679
What the fuckÂ did I ever do to you, Lu?

147
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,879
Huh?

148
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,000
Nothing.

149
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,600
What about Carla?

150
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,039
And Ander?

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,519
GuzmÃ¡n...

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,639
You don't know
how much you're hurting him.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
You have no fucking idea

154
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,879
how much it tortures him
that you're still alive.

155
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,679
That you're breathing the same air as us.

156
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,480
Mark my words, Polo...

157
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,799
I'll always protect my loved ones.

158
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,799
GuzmÃ¡n...

159
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,639
doesn't love you.

160
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
Lu...

161
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,240
stop groveling
for once in your fucking life.

162
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,840
But you're an expert at groveling, right?

163
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,000
You are.

164
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,240
Until they leave you
for someone better, right?

165
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,360
At least Carla loved me at one point.

166
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,000
Has anyone ever loved you, Lu?

167
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,240
Did you think that by being
the most stylish...

168
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,240
the richest...
and the smartest, they'd love you?

169
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,480
-Shut up.
-But nobody loves you.

170
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,440
-They envy you...
-Shut up.

171
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,879
...fear you, despise you...

172
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,960
That's why they don't love you.

173
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,000
That's why you're alone.

174
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,480
Shut up!

175
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,679
Polo.

176
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,120
Polo?

177
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,879
No, I didn't...

178
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,840
Polo, I didn't mean...

179
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,399
I know.

180
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm so sorry.

181
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,159
-I'm sorry.
-I know.

182
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,559
Forgive me.

183
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,279
Polo...

184
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Forgive me.

185
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,039
Lu?

186
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,080
What happened?

187
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
Polo!

188
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
Polo!

189
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,559
Polo.

190
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,879
Call an ambulance, please!
Call an ambulance!

191
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,639
Polo?

192
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,000
Polo.

193
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
I forgive you.

194
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,360
I forgive you.

195
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,879
Don't worry.

196
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't worry.

197
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,919
Careful!

198
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,360
-Move aside.
-Don't let anyone near him.

199
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
-Come on.
-Polo!

200
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,159
-Please.
-The police are on their way.

201
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,519
Calm down.

202
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
I didn't mean to. I didn't.

203
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,599
It was an accident, Lu.

204
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,119
-It was my fault.
-No.

205
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,920
We'll say it was an accident.

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Nobody will believe that.

207
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,519
Everyone saw herÂ throw a drink
in his face.

208
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,039
-But it's true!
-The cops don't want the truth.

209
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,359
They want to close the case,

210
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,279
find someone to blame,
and lock them up 20 or 30 years.

211
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,559
We have no choice.

212
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,240
Yes, we do.

213
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,880
We can put an end to this nightmare
once and for all.

214
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
We've all suffered enough.

215
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,359
Too many lives have been shattered.

216
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,440
We'll walk out of here together, free.

217
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
And we'll leave this shit behind forever.

218
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Her fingerprints are on the bottle.

219
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,759
We could break it.

220
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,000
Not here.

221
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,880
The noise would give us away.

222
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,680
Are you guys for real?

223
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,400
What if there are other fingerprints?

224
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,680
What if they found
all of our fingerprints on it?

225
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,079
It would be the same as not finding any.

226
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,039
Polo did something horrible...

227
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,759
but he wasn't a murderer,
and neither are you, Lu.

228
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,680
He wouldn't want you to waste your life
paying for one mistake.

229
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,559
Nadia.

230
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,880
You're risking the scholarship
in New York.

231
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,839
What?

232
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,799
Before coming,Â Polo convinced his moms
not to cancel it.

233
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,400
Fuck!

234
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,599
If we go to New York...

235
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,920
we'll go together.

236
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,640
Did everyone touch it?

237
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,279
We're missing one... The most important.

238
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,680
We could make it look like a suicide.

239
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,599
How will we do that?

240
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,559
-Where are you going? Stay back, come on.
-She's like his widow.

241
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,680
Can't you let her say goodbye
before they wrap him up like a sausage?

242
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
Shit, have a little decency.

243
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,960
Go ahead.

244
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,319
Come on.

245
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,839
Come on.

246
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,799
Hey, thanks for this.

247
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,160
I really loved you.

248
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,839
So much.

249
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,680
If only I had loved you better.

250
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm sorry.

251
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,279
Cayetana.

252
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,880
Cayetana!

253
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,599
For fuck's sake, Cayetana!

254
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,640
Come on,Â Cayetana, that's enough.

255
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,480
Let go of the bottle. Let's go.

256
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't let anyone touch the body.

257
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,480
My God.

258
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,000
It's done.

259
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,319
What will they do now?

260
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,200
Interview us one by one...

261
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,119
which isn't a problem,
because no one saw a thing.

262
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Agreed?

263
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,759
Someone saw me.

264
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,480
What?

265
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,880
Yeah, when I went
to pick up the bottleneck...

266
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,000
I bumped into a group of...

267
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,920
girls, I think.

268
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
Fucking hell.

269
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,599
Did anyone see you go into the bathroom
with the bottleneck?

270
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,039
Yes.

271
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,559
It's OK.

272
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,920
I need you to remember who it was.

273
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,839
It's important. We have to talk to them.
Who was it?

274
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,359
-I can't remember.
-Fuck...

275
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,559
-What if those girls talk?
-Have a better idea?

276
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,799
I hated him.

277
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,839
I blamed him for my illness.

278
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,119
I couldn't control myself,
and I stabbed him in the heart.

279
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
You're crazy. Why would you confess?

280
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,480
It doesn't matter.

281
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,279
I'm as good as dead.

282
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,640
I don't care if I die
in the hospital or in jail.

283
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,839
No fucking way.

284
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,359
You won't sacrifice yourself
to protect anyone.

285
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,240
Who's going to sacrifice himself?

286
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,119
We need a decoy
to throw the cops off track.

287
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,799
Not just one.

288
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
We need a lot of decoys.

289
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,480
It's important that you tell us
everything you saw.

290
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,559
Anything you think could be useful.

291
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,359
Everything. Any detail could be key.

292
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,039
GuzmÃ¡n...

293
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,440
Wait, you're saying
we should all accuse each other?

294
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,480
That's right.

295
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,240
If witnesses saw Lu go into the bathroom
with the bottle, it's over.

296
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:25,480
But if the police have witnesses
who saw me, Samuel, or Valerio--

297
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,640
-Those testimonies will be worthless.
-Exactly.

298
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,480
So, now the question is...
Who accuses who?

299
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,319
It was Samu.

300
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,039
He went into the bathroom
with the broken bottle.

301
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,240
It wasn't me.

302
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,000
If I knew, I'd never tell you.

303
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,759
-That means you do know.
-That means I'd never tell you.

304
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,599
Although, maybe...

305
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
I saw Valerio go in just after Polo.

306
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,559
Are you sure?

307
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,960
Absolutely.

308
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,519
Cayetana was jealous of my relationship
with Polo.

309
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,720
As soon as I saw her follow him,
I knew what would happen.

310
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,599
What time was that?

311
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,000
Twelve thirty...

312
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,000
No, 12:45.

313
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,160
I know because that's
when I take my allergy pill.

314
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,559
I was going to the bathroom,
but I saw Polo go in.

315
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,440
Then, I thought I'd better not...
because I didn't want to bump into him.

316
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,000
That's when I saw someone
follow him into the bathroom...

317
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,920
carrying a glass object.

318
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Who did you see?

319
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,799
I just feel so bad

320
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,640
because of everything
he's going through--

321
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,599
Cayetana... who did you see?

322
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,400
Ander.

323
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
GuzmÃ¡n.

324
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,079
He picked up the bottleneck
and went into the bathroom.

325
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,640
You saw him?

326
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,720
With your own eyes? You saw GuzmÃ¡n?

327
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,480
Omar.

328
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,359
Nadia. That's all I know. Can I go?

329
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,359
-Carla.
-Rebeka.

330
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,039
I didn't see anything at all.

331
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,759
Hey... You did the right thing.

332
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,240
Hey.

333
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,839
You did what you had to.

334
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,519
Nothing will happen to GuzmÃ¡n...

335
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,720
or to any of us.

336
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,440
Omar, Polo's dead.

337
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,160
I've been talking about death for months.

338
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
The more I talked about it,
the less I feared it.

339
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,680
But now I've seen it...

340
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,440
and I'm scared shitless.

341
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,359
What can I do for you?

342
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,640
What do you want? What do you need?

343
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,359
I need you.

344
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,119
What about the guy you were with?

345
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,640
That was nothing.

346
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,359
What do you mean?

347
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
I made it all up...

348
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,559
just to push you away.

349
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,799
If you wanted to get rid of me, congrats.

351
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,440
You did it, man.

352
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,119
Omar...

353
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,279
Lucrecia, your turn.

354
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,640
Your turn.

355
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,359
I can't, Nadia.

356
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,519
You have to lie.

357
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,720
Say you saw someone else go in.

358
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,559
It doesn't matter who.

359
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,400
Do you remember when Dad asked you
who messed up the car?

360
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,319
Or who stained the carpet,
or who dyed the dog pink?

361
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,039
I need one more story.

362
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,960
Lu, I need you to lie.

363
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,000
But this time it's not for me,
it's for you.

364
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,079
Please.

365
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,200
Several witnesses have told us
they saw you arguing with Polo.

366
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,880
Did you throw a drink in his face?

367
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,440
Yes.

368
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,759
And at least two people saw you
go into the bathroom

369
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,000
with the bottleneck in your hand.

370
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,400
Did you do it?

371
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,039
Did you kill him?

372
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,279
No.

373
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,880
We know each other
more than we'd like to, Lucrecia.

374
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,400
I think you're lying to me.

375
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,559
Tell me the truth.

376
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,440
Why are you so shaken up? 

377
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,279
What's wrong?

378
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,559
I'm shaken up
because I saw who killed him.

379
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,039
Who?

380
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't know. I don't...

381
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
What happened tonight, Lucrecia?

382
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
I've never seen you like this before.

383
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,880
And I don't believe
you're this upset overÂ Polo's death.

384
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
You weren't even friends.

385
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,039
What do you know?

386
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Polo was my friend.

387
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,960
Despite everything...

388
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,279
we're all friends.

389
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,200
More like a family.

390
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,279
We might not say
we love each other every day...

391
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,119
but you have no fucking clue
what I've been through with these people.

392
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,319
Year after year...

393
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,079
and all the years to come!

394
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm shaken up...

395
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,160
because it hurts my soul...

396
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:24,720
that... the best people I've ever known...

397
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,359
have to go through this shit again...

398
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,480
like with Marina.

399
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,759
They don't deserve it.

400
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,559
If I'm crying, if my voice is shaky...

401
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,119
and I don't know what to do,
it's because...

402
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,559
But I didn't do it.

403
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,960
Thanks, Valerio.

404
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,599
Carla.

405
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,720
What did you want to tell me?

406
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,559
I'm leaving...

407
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,199
to study abroad.

408
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,239
Alone?

409
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
That's the idea.

410
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,039
What about visits?

411
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,920
That depends.

412
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,119
Will you bring macaroni?

413
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,639
Come here, come on.

414
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,079
It's a pleasure
doing business with you again.

415
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,519
You know I've been away for a while,
but I'm back now.

416
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,639
Good morning.

417
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,679
How are you, baby?

418
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm tired.

419
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,599
What's wrong? Party hard?

420
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,079
Go to bed and get some rest.

421
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,280
No, Mom. No.

422
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,519
I'm tired of dead bodies...

423
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
police, threats...

424
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
I can't do this anymore.

425
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,840
All I'm asking for is a boring life.

426
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,280
Come on, baby.

427
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,480
And all I'm asking
is that you quit this shit.

428
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,719
Please.

429
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,159
Tell them to leave.

430
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,039
Because if you don't,
I'll be the one who ends up leaving.

431
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,119
Inspector.

432
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
An anonymous call

433
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,760
warned us of the presence
of a suspicious box in a park,

434
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,400
about 100 meters from here.

435
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,519
I called you because if we find...
Polo's fingerprints on the trophy,

436
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,559
we'll have to reopen the investigation.

437
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,760
I know it's a difficult moment for you...

438
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,039
He did it.

439
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,719
He confessed to us just before he--

440
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,840
That same night.

441
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,719
Your brother is free.

442
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,840
He can come back anytime.

443
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,440
He's not coming back.

444
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,519
He doesn't trust you...

445
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,559
and neither do I.

446
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,559
I don't believe you've been honest
with me either.

447
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,599
What happened that night
at the club, Samuel?

448
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
What wouldn't have happened
if you had done your job.

449
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,079
I'm sorry.

450
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,760
I'm really sorry, Samuel.

451
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,719
Would you like a beer?

452
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,239
Yes.

453
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,559
Did the police really buy
the suicide story?

454
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,960
At leastÂ they have a culprit
who can't contest it.

455
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,519
Carla...

456
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,559
Can we talk for a moment?

457
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,239
-Sure, I'm leaving.
-No. With you, Cayetana.

458
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,679
Of course.

459
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,719
You can go to Oxford, Columbia, Harvard...
whichever university you want.

460
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,280
We'll pay for it.

461
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,400
-We'll pay for housing too.
-No, but... Seriously...

462
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,360
It's what Polo would have wanted.

463
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,400
You were the only one
who always stood by him.

464
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,760
We didn't know how to do that.

465
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
You deserve it.

466
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
No, I don't deserve it.

467
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,119
Besides, public university is great.

468
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,800
Seriously, and I think...

469
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,480
it's time I accept
that my resources are limited...

470
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,800
that I have the family I have...

471
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,280
and that my last name is what it is.

472
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,719
And I can still achieve
whatever I put my mind to.

473
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,800
Of course you can.

474
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,760
Carla, I guess you know

475
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,360
that you can't leave to study abroad.

476
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,440
You're in charge of the wineries.

477
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,719
I have a trusted contact here
who will report to me.

478
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,719
You'll work hand in hand.

479
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,280
Who?

480
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,320
Valerio!

481
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,440
I don't know if you know Valerio.
This is my dad.

482
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,599
Nice to meet you.

483
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,079
Yes, he has a greatÂ rÃ©sumÃ©, this kid.

484
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,880
I don't know what you heard,
but the reality is much worse.

485
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,920
I heard you didn't even graduate.

486
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,440
And yet, I ran
my own highly successful business.

487
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,360
Yes, an illegal business.

488
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,719
Since when are you scared
of breaking the law, Teodoro?

489
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,559
Relax, I'll mostly be taking care of PR.

490
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm the best at partying.

491
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,199
Do you think this is what
the wineries need?

492
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,119
Valerio is a good person...

493
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,760
and we really need that.

494
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,280
-Carla, I hope this is all a joke--
-Let me tell you about my plan.

495
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,199
I think social media will be crucial
for marketing...

496
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,280
If we want to sell, this will be key.

497
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,519
Nadia, hurry up!

498
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,599
-You have your passports and tickets?
-Yes.

499
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,199
-You're not checking that bag?
-No, I'll take it with me.

500
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,119
-Are you taking winter clothes?
-Yes.

501
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,360
-It's cold there.
-I know, Dad.

502
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,480
I'll call you when we get there.

503
00:42:59,039 --> 00:42:59,880
Good.

504
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,800
Omar...

505
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,840
I'm sorry about that boy.

506
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,960
What boy, Dad?

507
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Your friend... Your boyfriend.

508
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm really sorry.

509
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,760
GuzmÃ¡n won't make it on time.

510
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:41,440
Why not?

511
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
He's with Ander.

512
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,320
He's getting the results
of his latest round of chemo.

513
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,480
I guess we'll find out when we land.

514
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:57,880
Your parents aren't coming?

515
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,320
No... They're on a business trip,
as always.

516
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:07,320
No, that's not true.

517
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,880
My parents say
they no longer have a daughter.

518
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,639
You'll always have a family here.

519
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,559
Of course you will.

520
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,800
Thank you.

521
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,079
Look after our little girl, please.

522
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,199
Like she looked after me.

523
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,719
Hi, Nadia.

524
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,400
First, let me apologize.

525
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,000
This will probably be
the corniest message ever.

526
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,559
But I wanted to say that...

527
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,679
if you ever decide to come back...

528
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,039
I'll be here...

529
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,199
waiting for you.

530
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,159
We have to go.

531
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,639
Yes.

532
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,800
You look familiar.

533
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,039
AndrÃ©s, right?

534
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,239
RomÃ¡n.

535
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:28,880
I don't care how hard you push me away,
I'm a fucking boomerang,

536
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,079
and whatever the diagnosis is,
I'll be by your side.

537
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,360
-Omar--
-Even if the chemo lasts 100 years,

538
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,639
I'll be at your side in this hospital,
repeating the school year.

539
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:39,559
Listen.

540
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:42,639
So what if I graduate when people retire?
I don't care.

541
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:45,679
But I won't leave you,
because I love you, dickhead.

542
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,159
I haven't stopped loving you
for a single day.

543
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,639
You won't have to.

544
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,119
I'm in remission. They just told me.

545
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:02,079
But that was a really beautiful speech.

546
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,519
Hi, GuzmÃ¡n.

547
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,800
You know I'm a bit... competitive,

548
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,079
so here's a warning:

549
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,840
this is going to be
the corniest message ever.

550
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,119
I promise I'll come back for you.

551
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,280
I MISS YOU ALREADY

552
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,840
TWO MONTHS LATER

553
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,079
Hi.

554
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,840
Hi.

555
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,719
Hey, man!

556
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,039
-I never thought I'd be glad to see you.
-Same here.

557
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,239
-I don't know anyone here.
-What do you mean?

558
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Isn't anyone gonna tell me
how hot I look?

559
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,639
You look divine, darling.

560
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,559
One rich kid, two, three...
Rich kids everywhere.

561
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,400
Las Encinas is fucking awesome.

562
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:10,880
-Should we go in?
-Yeah.

563
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,599
Let's see what surprises
await us in class.

564
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,920
