00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:02,146
Harper:
<i>Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,395
For the first time in my life,

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,016
I have a mom and dad
who love me.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,977
I can't leave here.

5
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:07,306
I just had an idea.

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,976
This was inside
an old coffee can

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,936
<i>Savannah and I used
to pass messages.</i>

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,516
She's out there
just living her life.

9
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,556
Change of plans, Griff.
We decided to stay.

10
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,146
Harper:
<i>Don't you ever think about
what things would be like</i>

11
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,646
if Dad hadn't died
in that crash?

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,686
Wouldn't it be amazing

13
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,725
if we could go back
and change things?

14
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Of course it would.

15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,789
Hey, what's up?
You need some help?

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,396
Before I know it,
I'm flying over the handlebars,

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,725
and I'm thinking,
"Where did that
dumb log come from?"

18
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down now.

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,380
So where's the bike?

20
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,146
Left it by the creek.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,856
Bent frame.
Chain's in a knot.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,305
I was wondering

23
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,896
if I could get
a ride back into town.

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,225
Didn't your daddy ever tell you

25
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,710
not to accept rides
from strangers?

26
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,500
Actually, you're
not really a stranger.

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,396
Uh, my mom knows your wife.

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,789
You're Mr. Dunn, right?

29
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,039
My dad's Mr. Dunn.
You can call me Chris.

30
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,356
- And you are?
- Marie... Granger.

31
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,670
Marie?

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,079
That's my mother's name.

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
How about that?

34
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,789
Hop on in, Marie Granger.

35
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,539
Oh, you really don't want
to take Bayou Road.

36
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,555
I don't?

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,225
It's closed up ahead.

38
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,396
You should take
Sugar Hill instead.

39
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,670
It's faster too.

40
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
If you insist.

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,960
I come out here every Sunday.

42
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,975
Drive around
the old Tremont property.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,436
Don't tell anyone,
but I'm planning to buy it.

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,710
You are?

45
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,765
I mean, that old place?

46
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,936
Why... Why would you
want to buy The Tremont?

47
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,079
The land was owned
by my family for generations,

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,329
even before it was a hotel.

49
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,670
Just a farm back then.

50
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,460
Sugar cane mostly.

51
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,329
- Look out!
- (horn blaring)

52
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,920
(sighs in relief)

53
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,436
That was close.

54
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,579
Thanks.

55
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:07,879
Guess it's what I'm here for.

56
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,539
Oh, there's Sugar Hill.

57
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,096
(theme music playing)

58
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,750
â™ª

59
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,829
(rock music playing)

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,170
(both continue playing)

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
(Ben playing uptempo riff)

62
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,039
Ooh!

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,556
Ooh, hoo-hoo.

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,830
- Woo!
- Yay!

65
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,015
You're really good, Dad.

66
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,436
It's been a while, hasn't it?

67
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,920
Yeah, it feels like forever.

68
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,765
Okay, check this out.

69
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,436
Prepare to be amazed.

70
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,079
(playing rock riff)

71
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,789
(playing off-key)

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,829
Gah! Dang!

73
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,500
I always mess up there.

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,936
'Course when you're on a stage

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,436
in front of a bunch of campers
and your father...

76
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,146
Is that the same song
you won the trophy for?

77
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,225
Yeah, with the same mistake
and all.

78
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,920
I still have no idea how I won.

79
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,579
You know, maybe
they stuffed the ballot box.

80
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,420
I remember thinking
the exact same thing.

81
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,580
Well, it's good old
Camp Tremont.

82
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,210
You know, I had a dream
about it last night.

83
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,960
I was 12.

84
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,330
Everything was
exactly the same except...

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
you were there.

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,646
Me? Uh... really?

87
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,096
Yeah. We were hanging out
in one of the bunkhouses,

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,420
and talking about...

89
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,540
I don't know, who-knows-what.

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,209
Then I woke up.

91
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,725
Hmm. That's...

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,096
It's weird.

93
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,709
Yeah, it kinda was.

94
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,555
I hope I'm not keeping you
from your family.

95
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,016
My dad said he'd be here soon.

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,079
No worries.

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,685
I've got some time
till we go out to the lake.

98
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,516
The... the lake?

99
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,879
My other Sunday tradition.

100
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,685
When the weather's nice,
I take the family
for a picnic.

101
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,516
Thought it'd be the perfect time

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,975
for me to tell them
about my plan
to buy the place.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,709
- Your wife doesn't know?
- No.

104
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,516
I didn't want
to get her hopes all up

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,100
until I had the money
to get it started.

106
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,759
It's going to be
such a great place
for the kids.

107
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,185
So, how old are your kids?

108
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,016
Well, there's Harper.
She's four.

109
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,209
And Toph is three.

110
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:10,920
Harper's my little artist,

111
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,040
and Topher, he's turning
into the family comedian.

112
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,920
So the idea is to move
into The Tremont
when you buy it?

113
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,475
I used to work summers
at the hotel when I was a kid.

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,266
It's where I met my wife.

115
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,290
Jess.

116
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,975
She was a camper,
and I'd help out
the bellhops

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,646
or whoever else that needed me.

118
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,266
Heard The Tremont has a ghost.

119
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,709
Hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah.

120
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,040
Savannah Dillon?
(chuckles)

121
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,185
Hmm. Don't tell me
you believe that stuff.

122
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,766
Oh, well, I did.

123
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,266
I mean, I used to.

124
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,646
Listen, I've been
through that whole hotel.

125
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,920
I didn't find any ghost.

126
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:49,829
But that car of mine?

127
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,879
'67 GTO.

128
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,396
Restored it soup to nuts.

129
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,935
And when I sell it,

130
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,800
that'll be the money
I use for my down payment.

131
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,355
Sorry. Like you care
about any of this.

132
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,266
No. It's really cool.

133
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,459
I definitely care.

134
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,000
- What?
- It's... it's just funny.

135
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,379
You remind me
so much of my daughter.

136
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,790
Oh, no.
Not an artistic bone
in my body.

137
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
Hmm.

138
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,896
Well, I should get back
to the tribe.

139
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't want to be late.

140
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,096
You sure your dad is on his way?

141
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,620
Be here any second.

142
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,896
It was really nice
meeting you, Marie.

143
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Um...

144
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,290
Um, it was just a ride.

145
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,016
Uh, I know. Sorry.

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,670
I just get silly sometimes.

147
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,670
Well, Miss Silly Marie,

148
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,646
I'm guessing we'll be
running into each other again.

149
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,829
Counting on it.

150
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,000
Wyatt?

151
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,750
Where are you?

152
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Wyatt?

153
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:19,790
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

154
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,555
It started rocking...

155
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,209
all by itself.

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Come here.
Sit down.

157
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,790
Watch.

158
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,379
- I really don't think...
- Shh.

159
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,379
You're gonna scare it.

160
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,290
(creaking)

161
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,596
Just like before.

162
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Savannah...

163
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,579
is it you?

164
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
(eerie music playing)

165
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,379
I think I'm gonna need my hat.

166
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,516
- Hey!
- Oh!

167
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,596
There you are.

168
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,435
- How did you find me?
- I was looking for you.

169
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,516
To tell you that
we're not moving,
after all.

170
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,725
And then I noticed
that the tumblers
on the radio

171
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,396
were set to 2011.

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,725
The year that your dad died.

173
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,355
I saved him, Griffin.

174
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,766
I saved my father
from the car accident.

175
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,975
That...

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,225
That's... That's incredible.

177
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,435
How?
What happened?

178
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,975
I got in his car with him.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,620
There was this truck
headed right for us.

180
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,475
I warned him,
and he avoided the wreck.

181
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,056
We took a short cut into town.

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,936
And then we had coffee
at my mom's place.

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,306
Only it wasn't Dunn's.
It was some other name.

184
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,855
But get this!

185
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,765
My dad's dream
was to buy The Tremont.

186
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,145
And why?

187
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,515
Because it was in his family

188
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:45,725
years and years ago.

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,936
But how could you not know this?

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,056
I mean, before now.

191
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,475
My mom never talked about it.

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,120
Maybe she didn't know.

193
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,039
He was planning
to surprise her
the day he died.

194
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,789
I know what you're thinking.
You're worried.

195
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,225
I messed with destiny,
changed things.

196
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,936
But I'm telling you, Griffin,
when we get back,

197
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,436
my dad will still be alive,

198
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,936
waiting at home for me.

199
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,539
And everything
will be all right.

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,120
You'll see.

201
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,379
We're going to find
a whole new world up there.

202
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,000
(door opens)

203
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,395
It's all the same.

204
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,895
Okay, then he didn't buy it.

205
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,895
Probably bought
the coffee shop instead.

206
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,289
He'll be at home.

207
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,936
Harper, come on.
I mean, what if he...

208
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,395
Why are you doubting this?

209
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,669
For once, why can't you
just be happy for me?

210
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,419
Dad?

211
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:18,669
Dad?

212
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,789
Dad?

213
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,210
Dad?

214
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Dad?

215
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,039
(footsteps approach)

216
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,830
Did you just say, "Dad"?

217
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:45,669
Yes, I did.

218
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,330
Yeah. I've been thinking
about him too.

219
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,145
Today's the anniversary of...

220
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,539
the accident.

221
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
(door closes)

222
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,960
(knocking on door)

223
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,975
Topher:
Harper...

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,169
you okay?

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,330
Yeah, Toph, I'm fine.

226
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,500
I just need some time.

227
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,056
(melancholy music playing)

228
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,120
â™ª

229
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,210
(sniffling)

230
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,960
(music intensifies)

231
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,539
(music continues)

232
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,919
(music continues)

233
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,879
- Shh.
- You'll scare it.

234
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,289
Scare what?

235
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,750
And why
is this rocking chair
in my room?

236
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,669
We brought it in
to keep an eye on it.

237
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,855
This is a stake-out.

238
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,725
There's a ghost.

239
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,895
Guys, come on,

240
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,686
I thought we were done
with all this ghost stuff.

241
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,515
- We saw the chair rock.
- Twice.

242
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,789
In Mom and Dad's room.

243
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,169
By itself.

244
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,080
- Savannah?
- We thought that too.

245
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,710
But when we asked,
"Are you Savannah?"

246
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,710
It wrote on the mirror again.

247
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Wrote what?

248
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,210
N-O.

249
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,379
Noooo.

250
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,645
So we think it's someone else.

251
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,169
Someone who likes
rocking chairs.

252
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,855
Sit with us.

253
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,210
Help us watch.

254
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,879
But just so you know,
it only comes out...

255
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,306
when you're really...

256
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,460
really quiet.

257
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:43,765
Topher:
Harper, wait!

258
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,879
What are you talking about?

259
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,169
I remembered.
It all came back.

260
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
What?

261
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,710
Our dad didn't die
on Bayou Road.

262
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,669
It wasn't a car accident.

263
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,120
Oh, my poor baby.

264
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,620
We were at the lake.

265
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,710
Our canoe went over.

266
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,330
I held on, but Dad didn't.

267
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,080
And I blocked it all out,
didn't I?

268
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,580
The whole day. All of it.

269
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,620
Yes, baby, you did.

270
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,725
The doctors...
They said not to tell you,

271
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,096
not to force things,

272
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,330
that it would all
come back on its own.

273
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,265
But you told me
it was a car accident.

274
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,765
Oh, sweetie,
you woke up one morning

275
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,460
and you said
it was a car accident.

276
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,620
And for the first time
in forever, you seemed so...

277
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,039
at peace.

278
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,379
I figured it was
the closure you needed.

279
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,620
That's why you always said
The Tremont was cursed.

280
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
Because that's where
we lost him.

281
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,580
In that lake,
on The Tremont property.

282
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,556
And after that,
I never wanted
either of you

283
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,960
anywhere near that place.

284
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,080
Because bad things happen there.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,789
Did you know
it was Dad's dream
to buy it?

286
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,056
I knew it had been
in his family,

287
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,895
that he liked
to go out there, but...

288
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,419
buy The Tremont?

289
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,580
- No, he never told me that.
- He was gonna fix it up.

290
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,580
Move in.

291
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,919
Baby, how could you
possibly know that?

292
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,225
I don't know.

293
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,750
Maybe I made that up too.

294
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,210
Whatever happened
to his yellow convertible?

295
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,895
I sold it.

296
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,460
For a down payment
on the coffee shop.

297
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,899
It's where we had
our first date.

298
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,960
And a lot of dates after that.

299
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,539
You okay, baby?

300
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,879
Yeah, I am.

301
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,539
I am now.

302
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:50,169
Finally, it all makes sense.

303
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,120
(Wyatt sighs)

304
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,379
I'm hungry.

305
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,500
Can you watch it
while we go get
something to eat?

306
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,580
If you make me something too.

307
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Peanut butter and jelly?

308
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,669
Yeah, that works.

309
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,669
Great. It's the only thing
we know how to make.

310
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,210
(rocking chair creaks)

311
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,750
(tense music playing)

312
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,379
(music continues)

313
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,379
(music continues)

314
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,420
(music continues)

315
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,710
(music continues)

316
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,079
Harper?

317
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I... I tried reaching you...

318
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,250
Your dad's still gone.

319
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,619
He didn't die in a car accident.

320
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:57,829
My mother just told me.

321
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,306
After it happened,
I blocked it out.

322
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,210
Came up with the car accident.

323
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,539
But... what actually happened...

324
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:08,539
was he drowned.

325
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,645
The same day but later.

326
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,645
So even if I wanted
to go back, it's too late.

327
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,016
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,726
Griffin, I started
to think about it,

329
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,355
all you've said.

330
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,960
No, no. I...
I shouldn't have.

331
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,355
I should have just
kept my mouth shut.

332
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,920
But you were right.
We can't change things.

333
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,789
And we shouldn't try to,
ever again.

334
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,016
The truth is...

335
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,460
my father died so I could live.

336
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,920
He died saving me.

337
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,500
That's what was
supposed to happen.

338
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,240
Maybe we should close it up.

339
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,476
Yeah.

340
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,880
(whooshing)

341
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:45,579
It's cold.

342
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,210
Do you feel that?

343
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,895
Where did those come from?

344
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,016
Oh, the rocking chair upstairs.

345
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,355
It was rocking by itself

346
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,516
and then
whatever was rocking in it

347
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,039
came down here.

348
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,685
Wet footprints.

349
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,266
My father died in a lake.

350
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,855
(objects clattering)

351
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,619
- (Griffin exclaiming)
- Hey, guys.

352
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,895
- Miss me?
- Griffin: Savannah!

353
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,016
You said you were never
coming through the portal,

354
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,435
that you've found your family.

355
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,619
I know. I know.

356
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,460
But then I found this.

357
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,250
Looks like you're not done
time traveling either.

358
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,210
(intense music playing)

359
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,685
My folks had me
clearing out
this storage room.

360
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,685
It was sealed
in an envelope
in a crack in the wall,

361
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,170
I'm guessing, by you.

362
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,395
Griffin:
W-Wait, back up.

363
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,976
Savannah:
What are you not
understanding?

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,556
It's like what we did
with the coffee can.

365
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,435
You did the same thing.

366
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,976
Went back to 1930,
put on those clothes,

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,016
got your picture taken,

368
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,766
and then left it for us to find.

369
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,380
But why?

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,596
Why would I go back to 1930?

371
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,516
Maybe because The Tremont
is in your family.

372
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,619
It has to be connected somehow.

373
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,960
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

374
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,329
I mean... unless you have
somewhere else to go.

375
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,609
As long as we're home
before dinner.

376
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,266
We'll pick up clothes
on the other side

377
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:09,306
so we don't stick out.

378
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:10,766
This is really cool.

379
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,789
Yeah. Finally, an adventure
that doesn't involve
saving you.

380
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,000
So that's how you do it.

381
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,266
How did you
ever figure that out?

382
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,226
It was really weird.

383
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,016
We're still not
exactly sure
how it works.

384
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,170
We might've gotten
a little help
from the other side.

385
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,710
So a ghost that's not me.

386
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,096
- Who do you think it is?
- It could be anyone.

387
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,329
I followed
those wet footprints
down to the basement.

388
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,556
It's like it was reaching out,

389
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,935
like it was pointing the way.

390
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,420
This is really spooky,

391
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,079
but, like, good kind of spooky.

392
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,226
All set. 1930.

393
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,476
(radio whirring.
Electricity crackling)

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,789
Harper: Let's go.

395
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,670
Wow!

396
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,079
Griffin:
Savannah, wait!

397
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,210
Ow!

398
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,210
(birds chirping)

399
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,920
There's no rust.

400
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,539
Welcome to 1930, guys.

401
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,185
So cool.

402
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,380
Epic.

403
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,539
(horse neighing)

404
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,079
(rooster crowing)

405
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,016
Remember, guys,
we're just here
to check it out.

406
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,789
Stay together and out of sight.

407
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,306
You guys see anything?

408
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,895
(sighs) Nothing.

409
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,210
It's too dark.

410
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,056
Maybe the door's unlocked.

411
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,476
Well, shouldn't we knock first?

412
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,579
Not dressed like this.

413
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,170
Whoa!

414
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,119
Where's the lobby?

415
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,556
Guess it was added later

416
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:04,266
when they turned
this place into a hotel.

417
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,960
(jazz music playing)

418
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,539
Where's that music coming from?

419
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,079
Let's go.

420
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,329
(music continues)

421
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,039
(music continues)

422
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,789
(music continues)

423
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,289
That's the radio
from the bunker.

424
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,380
Well...

425
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,517
what do we do now?

426
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,016
(creaking overhead)

427
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,710
(footsteps)

428
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,170
Upstairs.

429
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,500
(tense music playing)

430
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:38,960
(floorboard creaks)

431
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
- Go, go, go, go!
- Griffin: Hurry up!

432
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,329
Go!

433
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,920
- (Harper gasps)
- (gasps)

434
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,935
<i>â™ª There's a place

435

436
