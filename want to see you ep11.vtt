00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.650
You shouldn't think about bad things anymore.

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.844
She'd like to take me to the US to cure my eyes..

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.315
What about the terms?

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.685
Break up with Phuc.

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.052
Why did you leave me at that time?

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:55.396
I just wanted to threat you.

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:58.568
You say as if it was that simple.

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:01.039
Do you know how serious those words are?

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:05.131
But, do you know if you marry an ill-educated girl,

00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:07.131
it'll bring a lot of risks? 

00:02:08.832 --> 00:02:11.695
Have you counted on my words now, yet?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.337
Adultery, laziness, splurge.

00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:17.677
She can't be my daughter-in-law with those traits.

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:22.516
It's just because I tolerated her a lot.

00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:26.190
Never mind. You still have more chances to make it better.

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:31.503
For Phuc, he's a good person.

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:32.991
I vow with you this time 

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:34.232
I know.

00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:35.648
He's a good one,

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:37.648
but he's a male, you know.

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:48.689
Why are you always getting into such ridiculous romantic relationships?

00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:52.248
What does "ridiculous" mean to you?

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.738
I love him.

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:00.267
He loves me, too.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.267
Why is it ridiculous with a mutual love?

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.915
But it's not appropriate to tradition.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:06.735
Imagined that two men 

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.735
take care of and kiss each other.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.735
Don't you think it is so objectionable?

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.193
How to define that "morganatic match"? 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.690
How to be a normal person?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.293
Having everything but not loving each other, what is the meaning left?

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.699
I wanted to let Phuc go,

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:28.504
but eventually I couldn't.

00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:33.172
If I come to the US for treatment,

00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:36.768
I'll be too selfish for him, won't I?

00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:43.366
It's me who don't want him to leave.

00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:47.284
But letting him go, it's also me. 

00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:53.907
Since I was in a relationship with Phuc,

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.666
I've suddenly become a crybaby.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:02.775
Or... You can keep going to the US for the treatment first,

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.861
and get back together with him when you're back.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I think your mother will agree then.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.250
She used to leave me because of my relationship with Linh.

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:15.692
Now she knows I'm in love with Phuc,

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.084
she has come and given me a lucrative offer.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.074
Such things adequately get me know

00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:25.074
that compared to my feelings, 

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:29.168
her honor is much worthier several times.

00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:32.982
My brother.

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:36.918
I think she left you as you were a strong-willing one in her mind at that time.

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:41.691
You're still robust and resolving enough to live your own life.

00:04:43.932 --> 00:04:46.848
But she's still a mother anyway.

00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:50.679
There's no mother who likes to see her child in such

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.679
miserable and grievous situation.

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:04.204
I know what I say will hurt you,

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:07.224
but you can't be captivated by the moment

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.695
or be curiously keen on new pleasures.

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:11.486
I don't want to lose you.

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:13.852
I beg you, just once, please.

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:16.637
I'm childless.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.001
Stand here, dear.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.750
I wonder why is my life full of mishaps?

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.761
Blindness,

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:29.735
disabled leg

00:05:30.154 --> 00:05:32.154
and childlessness.

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:36.000
I think how weird I will be if I fall in love with a man,

00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:38.157
but not.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:41.334
He gives me peace.

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:44.764
 I really want to be with him.

00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:48.203
As long as we understand each other.

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:00.328
Mom.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:03.584
I beg you,

00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:07.180
please let me treat my eyes.

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.339
I'd like to see him.

00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:16.071
I want to know where he is,

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:17.567
what he's doing,

00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:20.221
how he feels.

00:06:22.602 --> 00:06:24.602
I really want to see him.

00:06:25.988 --> 00:06:27.988
Can you give me a hand?

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:34.564
Mr. Thach is not childless.

00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:38.265
It's because I used money to change the test result.

00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:41.285
He's not childless at all.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
What are you saying, Nu?

00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.001
What do you mean?

00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:49.749
Because you insisted on seeking Ms. Linh,

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:52.455
 I spent money changing the result.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.319
Mr. Thach.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.711
I have to find Linh, I must take her back.

00:07:07.563 --> 00:07:10.086
She left you because she knew you're childless.

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:14.995
What've you just said?

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.995
Who's childless?

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.034
The result of the last medical check-up

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:22.034
said that you were childless.

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:27.579
No way!

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.082
- I don't believe. 
 - Mr. Thach...

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:30.245
Calm down. Listen!

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:31.617
I know you're so shocked.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.343
You're so sad. But your health is more important.

00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:37.603
How can I be childless? 

00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:40.436
I don't deceive you. 

00:07:40.436 --> 00:07:44.929
You can ask anyone about the result. They'll explain for you.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.154
Are you crazy?

00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:51.467
I can't be childless. I have to give Linh back.

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:53.467
Mr. Thach! Thach.

00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:56.812
I'm not childless.

00:07:56.812 --> 00:07:58.812
I can't be.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.466
Tell me. I'm not childless, right?  

00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:08.852
Did I do anything wrong that the god ill-treats me like that?

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:14.541
Next day, you, please, come to talk with me.

00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:46.866
What time is it, Duy?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
About half past four.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.680
Phuc will be back in half an hour.

00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:02.686
Thach!

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:04.686
Get out!

00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:06.867
Why did you do that to me?

00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:08.259
Please, let me apologize.

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:10.259
Get away from me!

00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:18.337
Ever since, I've just thought that I was a loser,

00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:20.777
a catastrophic guy.

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:25.786
I even failed to have a baby with my sweetie.

00:09:26.362 --> 00:09:29.434
It eventually turns out to be your trick, huh?

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:32.255
Get back to your home!

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:34.255
Piss off!

00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:37.719
Then why don't you understand for me?

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.765
I like you that much. You don't know, do you?

00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:42.194
Yeah.

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:44.822
It's me who told Ms. Linh that you didn't need her.

00:09:44.992 --> 00:09:46.992
I also added salt to your noodles.

00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:50.614
I made myself burned and painful. Alright?

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:53.085
But I didn't do the wrong things, Thach.

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:55.660
I didn't also make something unacceptable.

00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:59.062
I just wanted keep you for myself. Was I wrong?

00:10:00.177 --> 00:10:01.889
You still don't think you're wrong now, right?

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:02.905
It's them.

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:05.611
They're exactly ones who broke our relationship. Do you know that?

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:12.466
You're so pathetic.

00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:14.977
Do you think how long will you fancy him?

00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:18.312
Eventually, who stays with you can be me only.

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:23.628
You treat Phuc just like you do with me, right?

00:10:23.863 --> 00:10:27.223
Neither like nor love, just wanna be together.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.774
Wanna care and "get" but not f**king "give", right?

00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:34.771
You come to your home!

00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:37.686
You know what I'm thinking, Mr. Thach? 

00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:40.846
I always feel the sense of losing you.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.161
But actually when I look back,

00:10:45.887 --> 00:10:49.012
I've never got you, Mr. Thach.

00:10:51.378 --> 00:10:52.279
Duy.

00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:53.703
Take Nu home.

00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:55.703
I don't need.

00:10:56.828 --> 00:10:58.828
Nu.

00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:01.605
You hear everything, right?

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:02.977
Let me give you a sentence.

00:11:02.977 --> 00:11:06.651
Mr. Thach then will treat you like the way he did to me.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.079
You two's emotion right now, just because he's indebted you.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.720
I'm back.

00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:26.243
Come to me.

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:36.669
You just need to be my side.

00:11:37.088 --> 00:11:39.088
Don't go elsewhere.

00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:51.028
Nu!

00:11:51.898 --> 00:11:52.564
Nu...  

00:11:52.564 --> 00:11:54.000
Get me off.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.370
Why do you follow me?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.972
You're just as him, right?

00:11:57.972 --> 00:12:00.286
I'm the one who made up all the things.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.495
I told Thach's mother that he was in a relationship with Phuc 

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:04.547
that's why Thach's mother told Phuc to leave him. What next?

00:12:04.547 --> 00:12:05.631
Huh?

00:12:05.631 --> 00:12:06.771
Yes. 

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:09.373
Why don't you scold me?

00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:13.435
Do you think you're wrong?

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.368
You love Mr. Thach.

00:12:15.787 --> 00:12:17.787
You want him to response.

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.069
I agree that's your love desire.

00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:23.671
But did he love you?

00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:30.257
You sacrifice your heart just to get that one from others, right?

00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:32.859
How many times are there?

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.770
What did you get?

00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:42.000
Love is not what you can fight for.

00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.753
Sometimes, readily parting for our beloved one's happiness

00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:47.988
is what a real love seems to be. 

00:12:50.197 --> 00:12:52.851
Instead of chasing the one who doesn't love you,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.392
why don't you find the one that loves you?

00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:58.721
But, who will love me?

00:12:58.983 --> 00:13:01.637
I can't find him. 

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:08.215
It's me.

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.761
It's hot here. Come in, my dear!

00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:43.357
Morning light is good for our immune system.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.912
It's really good.

00:13:47.057 --> 00:13:49.057
What would you like to do today?

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.208
Whatever.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.470
As long as with you.

00:13:56.766 --> 00:13:58.224
Mr. Thach!

00:13:58.224 --> 00:14:01.663
One day, you'll be just fed up with me.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.866
It's like there's always someone who keeps talking all the time.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.866
It's tired.

00:14:09.263 --> 00:14:11.263
Mr. Thach.

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:14.697
You'll definitely find back the light.

00:14:21.342 --> 00:14:24.624
I have backache. Can you help me massage it?

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.964
Your back?

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.471
Here.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.912
That's right. Only that place.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.850
Let me do it myself.

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:56.452
I want to do with you.

00:14:57.524 --> 00:15:02.061
But... We can buy bread outside. Why do we need to?

00:15:03.158 --> 00:15:05.158
I'm homesick.

00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:08.832
Homesick?

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.365
It's next week when my sister's birthday comes.

00:15:12.365 --> 00:15:14.365
I want to get back home.  

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:19.356
I'll go with you.

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:22.059
No. 

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.713
My house is quite small as well as messy.

00:15:24.713 --> 00:15:26.922
Wait until Tet, I'll take you home.

00:15:28.932 --> 00:15:29.886
Uhm.

00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:33.796
I forget to have procedures next week for the flight next month.

00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:36.894
Just do your bit.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:40.333
If you have any problems, just press the Zero key.

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:43.824
Don't need to remind. I know what the Zero key means.

00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:46.663
But,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.410
have you got any uncomfortable thing, lately? How's your study?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I'm fine.

00:15:57.968 --> 00:15:59.968
I want to share with you.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.281
Not only that you can see me,

00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:09.281
but also that I want to feel you.

00:16:10.363 --> 00:16:12.886
I want to share with you, too.

00:16:12.886 --> 00:16:16.429
But I'm ok. Nothing much.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:20.777
Really?

00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:22.463
Yes.

00:16:32.844 --> 00:16:34.844
Come on, quickly.

00:16:37.024 --> 00:16:40.593
Hurry up or the powder will turn hard.

00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:49.165
My dear.

00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:51.714
Tell me something.

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:53.949
I'm gonna be home tomorrow.

00:16:54.184 --> 00:16:56.184
I'll miss you so much.

00:16:56.472 --> 00:16:58.472
What should I tell you?

00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:02.407
Hmm. Nothing to tell.

00:17:03.349 --> 00:17:06.683
My life is so boring.

00:17:07.997 --> 00:17:09.526
No friends.

00:17:10.206 --> 00:17:12.206
No free time.

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:14.834
No hanging out.

00:17:15.776 --> 00:17:18.351
I go abroad mainly because of work.

00:17:18.482 --> 00:17:21.973
In short, I have nothing to tell you.

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:25.715
Why do you adore me?

00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:28.997
I don't adore you at all?

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:30.689
Ah. It's painful.

00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:32.689
You don't adore me, do you?

00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:34.375
Uhm.

00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:37.212
I don't adore you.

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:42.492
I love you.

00:17:55.127 --> 00:17:56.264
Dear!

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:57.579
Huh?

00:17:57.579 --> 00:18:01.776
Later, if possible, can you not love me anymore?

00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.931
Why?

00:18:06.297 --> 00:18:09.186
Hmm.... You shouldn't love me anymore.

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:42.943
My dear. Let's play puzzles.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.681
Puzzles?

00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:46.001
Yep.

00:18:47.047 --> 00:18:48.498
Ok.

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:15.048
So, what is this?

00:19:15.048 --> 00:19:16.629
The door!

00:19:16.629 --> 00:19:18.629
Exactly.

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:24.710
One step. Two steps. Three...

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.937
Four... Five... Six... Seven...

00:19:31.277 --> 00:19:36.233
Eight... Nine... Ten.

00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:40.613
Here you are.

00:20:09.527 --> 00:20:11.527
How many steps does it take to get to the kitchen?

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:13.445
Ten steps.

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.445
Exactly.

00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:19.635
From left to right, salt, sugar, sodium glutamate.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.635
How about knives and forks?

00:20:21.897 --> 00:20:25.885
Those dangerous tools, I put them in the corner, near the sink.

00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:30.000
About meat, I sliced and put into the freezer.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.098
How many steps are there from the spices tray to the fridge?

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.176
One.

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:40.176
Well done.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.187
Do you think your lover is thoughtful?

00:21:44.367 --> 00:21:46.367
It's ten steps from here to the kitchen.

00:21:46.864 --> 00:21:48.864
But just seven steps from my room.

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:51.831
Four steps away from the living room.

00:21:52.459 --> 00:21:54.459
Sit down, please.

00:21:56.278 --> 00:21:59.638
Dear. I've bought some ice-cream. Let me give you.

00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:21.814
Here. Enjoy it!

00:22:27.295 --> 00:22:28.436
My dear.

00:22:28.671 --> 00:22:31.750
From now on, the Zero key is the number of the Head.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.849
In case I'm not home. He'll come to help you.

00:22:35.733 --> 00:22:37.391
Yeah, I know.

00:22:37.548 --> 00:22:38.711
How about yours?

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:40.999
Of course key number 2.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.825
Why not number 1?

00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:44.514
That is your mother's number,

00:22:44.514 --> 00:22:47.246
because you're about to go to the US for your eyes' treatment with her.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.020
Thank you.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.012
She said the paperwork had been done.

00:22:55.432 --> 00:22:57.589
But she has to arrange her works in next two months. 

00:22:57.589 --> 00:22:59.388
Then she will take me to the US.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
That's good for you.

00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:06.164
Phuc.

00:23:06.923 --> 00:23:08.217
Yes?

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.779
I'd like...

00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:16.989
I really want to see you.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.687
Hello. My brother.

00:23:28.184 --> 00:23:29.295
It's me.

00:23:30.132 --> 00:23:33.152
Did you return home? Where are you now?

00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:36.690
Are you free? I want to meet you.

00:23:36.977 --> 00:23:39.866
Yes. So, where will we meet?

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:42.821
I'll come to your coffee shop.

00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:44.376
Yes.

00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:56.982
Now I can see the light.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.000
But why is it still dark in front of me?

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.069
Hello

00:24:19.069 --> 00:24:21.069
Yes, I am Phuc

00:24:22.363 --> 00:24:24.363
My answer is...

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:26.692
I AGREE.
