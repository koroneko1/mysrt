00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,148
See? Your first night out as a single guy.

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,234
Didn't I tell you
goin' dancin' would make you happy?

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,863
Isn't it great? I don't even care
that we're the oldest gays in the club.

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,866
-Oh shit.
-No, honey. You keep dancing.

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,577
-We have as much right to be here--
-I think that's Colin.

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,457
-Well, first of all, you look fantastic.
-You really do. So hot.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,584
It's not him.

9
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,501
Oh, thank God.

10
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,672
I'm not even sure if I'm happy or not
that that wasn't him. I need a drink.

11
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,051
Mikey, there's only one way
you're gonna move on from this.

12
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,054
Yeah, it's been one whole week.
Enough with the wallowing.

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,890
Sorry. I just think
if you wanna start feelin' better,

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,975
you gotta pop your Colin-cherry
and get laid.

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,436
So eloquent. Sadly, I don't disagree.

16
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,482
So glad to know that you're both
on the same page about what's best for me.

17
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,150
Uh, three vodka sodas, please.

18
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,319
What do you guys want?

19
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,573
Look how many guys in the club
are on Grindr right now.

20
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,910
You could hook up tonight and be one step
closer to your future happy Michael.

21
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,413
Why are they on Grindr
when they're right next to us?

22
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,040
That's how you meet people now.

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,335
You've been away a long time,
Rip Van Winkle.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,047
Nice. Oh, I'm so not up for this.

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,673
I was late to the Grindr party,

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,177
but it does actually cut the chitchat
and get you down to business.

Your rich divorcée? [chuckles]

30
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,560
She typically text you after midnight?

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:47,065
Ah, she's a little demanding, but I need
to keep her happy. She's my golden goose.

Twenty-something else,
less than 50 feet away, very cute.

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,281
Billy, we are here to support our friend,
not abandon him for a hookup.

35
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,368
I'm just showing him how easy it is.
Oh, he's so into me.

[phone alert]

37
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,832
Claire again? Sweetie, that is not
the notification you wanna get in here.

38
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,084
I am not interested
in getting back in the game,

looking at naked selfies on my phone.

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,798
I don't want my first time to have sex
with someone after 17 years with Colin

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,925
to be a quick, anonymous fuck.

42
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,095
What are you lookin' for?
Dinner and a movie? Come on.

43
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,931
You must've fooled around with other guys
during your relationship.

44
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,059
Not really. I put the mono in monogamy.

45
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,018
Or monotony.

46
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,812
Up top.

47
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,857
-No. No.
-If and when I'm ready to have…

48
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,109
To put myself out there.

49
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,695
Oh, Jesus, I can't believe
I'm even saying this.

50
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,197
I-- I want it to be a little special.

51
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,615
Good luck with that, sweetie.

52
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,119
Nowadays, special is when they still
wanna have sex with you after you show up.

53
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,747
I think they're all special.
Like snowflakes. No two alike.

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,084
You just gotta get 'em before they melt.
Don't wait up, boys.

55
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,838
She can torture a metaphor,
but she always gets her man-child.

[chuckles]

57
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,884
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Stay a little bit longer, please.

58
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,178
It gets lonely at night in the apartment.

59
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,180
Oh, Michael.

60
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,141
It gets better, you'll see.

61
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,434
What if it doesn't?

62
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,438
-What if I wind up bitter and alone like--
-Careful.

63
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,357
-I was gonna say, "Like Claire."
-Oh!

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,859
Yeah, so sad.

65
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,402

-Oh, hey, Diane.
-Hello, Michael.

69
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,254
I just got a delivery from the drugstore,

70
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,050
and along with my medications,
there was also this one for Colin.

71
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,637
Hmm. Must be his Propecia.
All smoke and mirrors up there.

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,598
Oh. [chuckles]
I heard you two split up.

73
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,767
And I guess it didn't end well,

74
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,895
after seeing the way
you scratched his name off the mailbox.

75
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,896
Thanks, Diane.

76
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,564
-Can you send me--
-Bye-bye now.

77
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,151
[sighs]

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,074
Colin's on PrEP. [scoffs]

79
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,993
So the thing he needs to figure out alone

80
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,956
is how to fuck his way across
New York City without getting a disease.

81
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,084
Well, I'm glad we solved that mystery.

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,253
Well, at least he's being responsible.

83
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,838
Do you really think this warrants
a look on the bright side?

84
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,090
Sorry. Slut!

85

[grunting]

86
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,554
Anyway, this may be
just the push I need to get off my ass

87
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,015
and hopefully up into somebody else's.

88
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,520
Say hello to Grindr's newest Grindee.

89
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,689
-Quick turnaround!
-Huh?

90
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,482
Which, by the way,
you hear a lot on Grindr.

91
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,693
Here, help me pick a photo.

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,361
Um…

93
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,446
Ooh, how about this one?
We just had it taken.

94
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,615
It's our company ad.
If I crop out Suzanne…

95
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,285
Mm, sorry, darling.
You're a bit ragged around the eyes.

96
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,703
Suzanne looks great, though.

97
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,706
She should crop you out
and put it on her profile.

98
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
-[clears throat]
-This is why you have no friends.

99
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,501
Hmm. Oh, here's a good one.

100
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,877
-Oh,
-Ooh, post that.

101
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,671
-Okay.
-Mm!

102
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,964
[man] Hey.

103
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,217
It's not a bar stool. You need to move
so other people can use it.

104
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,013
I'm training him. I'm in the middle
of a session, so easy. Let's go. Six.

105
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,597
-Six.
-Come on now. Seven.

106
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,683
-Seven. Thanks.
-Now bend the knees. Eight.

107
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,600
Uh, eight.

108
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,813
Let's check the grid.
See who in here is on the prowl.

109
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,899
-Hmm.
-Oh. Oh!

110
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,318
-He's cute.
-Mm.

111

-GreatNateEight.
-Oh!

112
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,904
Catchy, informative.

113
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,075
No Sondheim in the rhyming department,
but definitely worth a quick turnaround.

114
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,535
-Nice.
-[chuckles] Text him.

115
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,747
I'm actually doing this.
Okay. Okay. Okay! Here goes.

116
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,960
How long does it usually take before--

117
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,922
Um…

118
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,758
-I am not hating this.
-[chuckles]

119
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,681
Uh-oh.

[buzzer sound]

121
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,809
-What happened?
-[sighs]

122
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,271
You need a dick pic. You won't get
anywhere on this without one.

123
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,774
It's like your Grindr passport photo.

124
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,901
You have a dick pic?

125
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,196
Oh no, I believe you.
You do not have to show--

126
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,614
Relax.

127
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,825
An artist I represent did it.
Something different for the people.

128
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,951
[sniffs]

129
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,746
What, you actually sat for that,
like Whistler's Mother?

130
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,041
I like the kind of men it attracts.

131
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,794
For instance,
I'll be in Rhinebeck antiquing,

132
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,837
and I'll get a tap and realize

133
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,591
that we are both looking
at the same 19th-century school chair.

134
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,676
Next thing you know,
I'm face down in a barn.

135
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,804
-Great.
-Mm.

136
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
Now there's two images
I can't unsee.

00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,202
So I had to wait for them
to open this morning.

157
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,746
I didn't wanna look
like I needed a drink at eleven o'clock.

158
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,290
So I walk down the block,

159
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,460
and my heel gets caught in a subway grate
and snaps the fuck off.

160
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,838
$400 pair of SJPs
literally down the drain.

161
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,008
Oh my God!
My life right now is literally just…

162
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,427
Sorry.

163
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,222
How are you?

164
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,224
That's okay. I know you liked it better

165
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,269
when you were the disaster,
and I was the boring, old married guy.

166
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,228
I really did.

167
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,646
-Me too.
-[sighs]

168
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,109
I've been working on the figures
for Claire Lewis's broker's open.

169
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,652
This listing is so next-level,

170
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:11,032
and given my reduced circumstances,
I really need this commission.

171
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,993
This event can't look cheap.
We're gonna have to spend some money.

172
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,913
-[groans] We've gotta sell this bitch.
-[phone vibrating]

173
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,957
I can feel my Amex card begging me
to put it out of its misery.

174
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,584
[sweetly] Suzanne Prentiss.

175
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,759
So congrats on poaching Claire.
Heard you had to reduce your commission.

176
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,135
[groans, chuckles]

177
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,471
Yeah, well, it's still
a fuckload of money.

178
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,264
Well, I hope it's worth it.

179
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,935
I almost didn't have the energy
to deal with her. And I'm young. [laughs]

180
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,356
I'll be fine, Tyler.
We've actually made a genuine connection.

181
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,651
Oh, right. The whole parallel
lives falling apart thing.

182
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,904
I can see it's really taking its toll.

183
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,073
[chuckles]

184
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,743
Honey, our luck has just changed.

185
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,620
[squeals] We have a new client.

186
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,038
Paolo Forella,

187
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,042
a big Italian furniture importer
in from Rome tomorrow for one day,

188
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,087
and he needs to lock down a pied-à-terre
in the two million range,

189
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,798
and he wants us
to put together a multiple showing.

190
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,967
That's great. Who referred us?

191
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,219
No one. He said
he picked us from our picture.

192
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,137
I told you those photos would pay off.

193
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,306
Only you look good in this picture.

194
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,517
I look ragged.

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,396
[gasps] Oh my-- oh my God. He is so hot.

196
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,439
Oh-ho-ho!

197
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,900
Recently divorced. Check.

198
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,860
Two grown kids. Check.

199
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,739
Residences in Rome and Positano.
Check! Check!

200
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,199
Oh-ho-ho!

201
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,578
Paolo, mi amor. Molto bello.

202
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,747
Why did I eat all those fucking wings?

203
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,707
He's okay.

204
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,626
Do you think I should get my eyes done?

205
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,798
[sighs]

206
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,883
[sighs]

207
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,390
[Netflix ident tune plays]

208
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,603
No. Delete, delete. He's not watching!
He's not watching!

209
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,687
[incoming call alert]

210
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,771
[sighs]

211
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,107
What up, Mikey?

212
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,944
I'm just eatin' Chinese
and missing fucking Colin.

213
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,990
Aww. Sorry, baby.
But Stanley told me you're on Grindr.

214
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,659
So pants off to you. What's your handle?

215
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,414
I haven't thought about it.
How about MikeNewToThis?

216
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:27,168
Because you're a young Amish boy who
just arrived in the big bad city? [scoffs]

217
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,629
Gina, get under my eyes.
I had a very late night.

218
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,380
You need somethin' sexy,

219
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,676
like HungAlphaJock or NineHardForYou.

220
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,054
Which, memory serves,
is a bit of an exaggeration,

221
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,930
but nobody's coming in with a ruler.

222
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,142
Jesus, your makeup lady is right there.

223
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,061
How about PiggyWantACumHole?

224
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,270
[giggles]

225
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh my God.

226
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,232
Gina's seen it all.
She used to do Charlie Rose.

227
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,694
Look, all I'm saying is make sure
you pick something that says you're DTF.

228
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,113
AthleticTop?

229
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,573
Sounds like a sports bra.

230
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,660
From personal experience,
wouldn't AthleticVers be more accurate?

231
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,786
Okay. You know what?

232
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,331
One hookup, 25 years ago, Billy.
People change.

233
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,376
Don't you have to mispredict the weather?

234
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,961
Sweetie, I just look pretty
and read the shit.

235
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,091
Look, you know what?
Ooh. I'm gonna go with NewHotMike.

236
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,592
[alert chimes]

237
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
-Oh! I have a message waiting.
-[Billy] There you go.

238
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,970
Message back.

239
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,808
[alert chimes]

240
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,851
-[Billy] What'd he say?
-It's a pic.

241
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,814
But I can't really tell what it is.
Oh my God! It's a butthole. Classy.

242
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,191
-[Gina] Ah!
-[chuckles]

243
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,402
-Welcome to Grindr, NewHotMike.
-[door opens]

244
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,071
-[man] On set in five.
-Oh, I'm on. I love you.

245
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,698
You too.

246
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,037
[sighs]

247
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
Claire?

248
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,503
[Claire] Up here.

249
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,765
Oh my God.

250
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,060
How did this happen?

251
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,856
I had a moment.

252
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,735
You did this? Why?

253
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,486
My hus--

254
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,282
My ex-husband went to visit our daughter,

255
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,536
sorry, our kid, at Brown this weekend,

256
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:30,583
and brought his whore, gold-digging
girlfriend along to meet them.

257
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,085
As you can see, I didn't take it well.

258
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,589
I'm… so sorry.

259
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,718
This used to be his favorite room.

260
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:46,015
[chuckles] It still has so many
of his most treasured possessions.

261
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,977
Had. I'll show you a fucking hole in one.

262
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,395
-Oh!
-[screams]

263
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,646
[grunting]

264
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,148
[Michael] Okay. Oh--

265
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,654
-[sighs] Would you like a drink?
-Yes, please.

266
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,745
Vodka all right?

267
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,662
Sure.

268
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,000
So, obviously we'll need to postpone
the broker's open

269
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,502
till we can deal with all this,

270
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,339
but moving forward, don't you have
anyone you can vent to about this

271
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,760
so we can avoid a, you know,
future gut renovation?

272
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,386
Yeah.

273
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,971
Oh.

274
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,598
Me. [chuckles]

275
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,811
-Have a seat.
-Sure, yeah. Let's… Uh, sure.

276
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,105
I'll sit right here in Beirut.

277
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,651
And why not? Our lives are in ruins.

278
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,363
I think my apartment
would look exactly like this

279
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,533
if I didn't have
a great support system of friends.

280
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,035
They've been helping me through a lot,

281
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,664
forcing me to put myself out there.

282
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,124
You know, to try to somehow move on.

283
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,378
Most of my so-called friends
went with Henry.

284
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,839
Half of them even knew about the affair.

285
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,385
In a split like mine,
people follow the money and the access.

286
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,555
He's even gotten my children
to see his side! [growls]

287
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,475
It's dead, Claire! You can quit trying
to murder it. The room is already dead.

288
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,977
[sighs]

289
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,354
Why do you even have a sledgehammer?

290
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,439
Well, I didn't until this evening.

291
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,567
Amazon Prime, same-day delivery.

292
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,860
Oh.

293
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,821
Really should think
about a three-day waiting period.

294
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,867
You know, until this happened,
the divorce, I mean…

295
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:36,125
I never would have considered myself
a person capable of actual rage.

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,835
But look around.

297
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
[chuckles]

298
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,881
That is exactly what I feel
most of the time.

299
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:48,053
All I can afford to destroy is
a Tiffany-framed picture of us.

300
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,973
Deeply unsatisfying.

301
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,017
-I should have just ripped up the photo.
-[laughs]

302
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,187
Oh, it would've been so much easier
if he had just died.

303
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,735
Making funeral arrangements,
choosing what I would wear to the funeral,

304
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,528
having people over after the funeral.

305
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,490
All of those activities
seem fun compared to this.

306
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,370
He's off in another life,
and I'm stuck in the one he's left behind.

307
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,914
I know.

308
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,542
But maybe not for long.

309
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,587
I hope not for long.

310
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,300
Thank you for coming over tonight.

311
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,346
This has helped. Talking to you.

312
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,850
Mm. Even if our friendship
is commission-based. [chuckles]

313
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,101
Glad to be here.

314
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:43,651
So you're done hobbling the apartment,
Annie Wilkes from Misery,

315
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,736
or do I need to take this with me?

316
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,738
[laughs]

317
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,906
You should take it.

318
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,909
[upbeat jazz playing]

319
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,662
Hey.

320
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,997
[clears throat]

321
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,750
Really? It's a showing, Suzanne,

322
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,336
not ladies drink free night
at the Lizard Lounge.

323
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,796
Too much?

324
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,715
Only if you're not expecting cash
on the nightstand later.

325
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,427
Oh. Perfect. If you think it's a little
slutty, then I'm in the right area.

326
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,056
And what is goin' on with you?
You look tired, like in our photo.

327
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,265
Ugh, I didn't get much sleep.

328
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,226
Claire had a meltdown
in the middle of the night.

329
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,894
I had to go over. It was a whole thing.

330
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,272
[sighs] Wow. Those are some seriously
blurry boundaries.

331
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,901
Be careful. Mixing business
with your personal life is a huge mistake.

332
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,860
Oh! There he is.

333
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,405
Paolo Forella.

334
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,657
-Ciao, Paolo. Suzanne Prentiss.
-Ciao.

335
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,784
-How lovely to meet you.
-Pleasure.

336
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,578
Hi. Michael Lawson. Shall we?

337
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,913
-[Paolo] Sure.
-[laughs]

338
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,795
Prime location, spectacular views.

339
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,964
Three terraces. Come on.

340
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,966
Lots of light. Wow.

341
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,803
[sighs] Uh…

342
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,723
I'm sorry, but it feels
a little corporate.

343
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,101
Oh, well, that's the trouble
with new construction. No soul.

344
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,602
Not like in Rome,

345
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,440
with those wonderful buildings
still standing after centuries.

346
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,775
-You've been to Roma?
-[laughs] Sì.

347
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,821
Oh! Loved. I backpacked
all through Europe after college

348
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,950
and just spent one whole day
just sitting in the Colosseum.

349
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,952
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

350
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,872
Yeah, it was back when they were still
feeding Christians to the lions.

351
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,041
-[forced laughter] So funny.
-[chuckles]

352
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,083
-Ju--
-Ah.

353
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,755
Michael can only make that joke because
Suzanna is so young and-- and beautiful.

354
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,298
[Suzanne] Aww!

355
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,716
[gasps, chuckles]

356
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,095
Sorry, but-- but this apartment,
it-- it is not for me.

357
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,724
And because of time, please, can you
show me the photo of the rest of them?

358
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,393
-[Suzanne] Oh--
-Then we can only go to the one I choose.

359
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,936
-Great idea.
-[Suzanne clears throat]

360
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,606
[Michael] Ah! Okay,
so this is a two-bedroom, two-bath

361
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,107
with a large terrace in Turtle Bay.

362
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,194
-Turtle Bay? Grazie, no.
-[Suzanne] Oh.

363
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,363
Okay, well, this next one, it--
it is on the hill.

364
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,698
Um… Ahem.

365
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,160
It's, uh, newly renovated,
three bedrooms, high floor.

366
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,245
-Yeah, I like this one. Let's see it.
-[phone rings]

367
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,749
-Great.
-Scusi. I gotta take this, sorry.

368
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,125
Sure. [chuckles]

369
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,128
-What the fuck with the dick pics?
-It was for my Grindr profile.

370
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,464
I must have mistakenly saved it
into the wrong folder.

371
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,007
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

372
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,383
-Oh my God.
-Okay, wait, wait.

373
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,344
It went by pretty fast.
Maybe he didn't notice.

374
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,138
-Just pretend it never happened.
-Okay. Good. Yeah.

375
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,098
[Paolo] Ready?

376
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,267
Oh! We're calling a car, Paolo. [chuckles]

377
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,770
I know you're
on a pretty tight cock. Clock!

378
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,193
Okay.

379
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,489
-Bravo. I love that apartment.
-[laughs]

380
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,992
-Oh!
-And I love this street.

381
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,578
It feels already like home.
I hope they accept my offer.

382
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,372
Oh… [laughs]

383
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,917
I have a very good feeling about this.
Thank you.

384
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,676
[chuckles] You know, Paolo, this is one
of the great New York neighborhoods.

385
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,178
Il Cantinori,
my favorite Italian restaurant,

386
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,847
is right around the corner.

387
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,100
You must let me take you there
once we close.

388
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,812
Perhaps I can cook you
a real Italian dinner at my new apartment.

389
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,480
-Oh! I would love that.
-[phone alert]

390
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,606
-[phone alert]
-[chuckles]

391
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:16,780
And, um, Paolo, if there's anything
that you need before you move in,

392
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,660
I would be more than happy
to, uh… move some boxes for you.

393
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,706
And my interior design, from what I hear,

394
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,168
I mean, that's what they tell me,
is just a gift.

395
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,419
It's a real gift.

396
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,254
I mean, from the top to the bottom.

397
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,507
Okay, the very bottom is so-- [laughs]

398
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,468
And I'm really good with wood.

399
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,304
I mean, so good with wood.

400
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,807
I mean, like, how much wood
would a woodchuck chuck?

401
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,726
I know, 'cause I can chuck it.

402
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,561
[laughing]

403
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,520
So…

404
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,398
So you just let me know, okay?

405
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,401
Hey, why don't we have a drink
at the hotel bar

406
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,446
to celebrate finding the perfect apartment
in one day?

407
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,033
I wish I could, but I have calls to make
and a very early flight back.

408
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,492
Oh, okay.

409
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,331
Ciao, bella. It was a delight
to spend the day with you.

410
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh!

411
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,000
Michael.

412
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,878
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

413
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,796
Ciao. Ciao.

414
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,881
God damn it.

415
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:21,303
[sighs] Well, I guess it's for the best,
right? Client and all.

416
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,098
Yeah. You know, I only live a couple
of blocks away, and it's nice outside.

417
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,642
-I'm just gonna walk.
-Uh-huh.

418
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,644
[phone rings]

419
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,104
Hey, Kai. Yeah, I'm on my way home.

420
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,690
Want me to pick up dinner?

421
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,487
I don't know. I've been in the mood
for Italian all day.

422
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,572
Damn!

423
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,658
Entrare. Come in.

424
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,077
[sighs]

425
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,664
This is crazy on so many levels.

426
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
I don't fool around like this in Italy.

427
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,586
But in New York,
I like to have a little fun.

428
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,507
Especially with a hot all-American
like you.

429
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,057
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just…

430
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,395
I just got out of a 17-year relationship
really, like, just last week,

431
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,814
and I haven't been with anyone else yet.

432
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

433
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,735
-It's okay. I understand.
-All right.

434
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,113
We can go down to the bar
and have a drink.

435
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,155
That…

436
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,283
Let me just change my shirt.

437
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,704
[gasps]

438
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,163
Yeah, I'm ready.

It's a non-smoking room.

No, I wouldn't really smoke. Eww!

455
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:11,663
I mean, I just feel like I should
mark this moment with something… new,

456
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,290
something I haven't done before.

457

Isn't this something
you haven't done before?

[chuckles]

459
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,379
I guess it is.

460
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,342
It's kind of how I imagined it, too,
the first time.

461
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,053
-Well, I'm honored.
-Mm!

462
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,555
I wasn't sure if you were into me.

463
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,267
-Then, you show me a dick pic. It was--
-Oh my God.

464
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,270
That was so embarrassing.
I was hoping you hadn't noticed.

465
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,856
-You didn't mean for me to see it?
-No! Are you kidding?

466
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,232
-No!
-Oh! Mamma mia.

00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,734
-What?
-[both laugh]

468
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,613
I took it really fast 'cause my friends
said I had to have one on Grindr,

469
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,907
-which I just got on yesterday.
-Mm.

470
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,826
So, jackpot, by the way.

471
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,622
Molto gentile.

472
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,790
-[laughs] Mm!
-Mm!

473
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,959
Actually, the photo doesn't do it justice.

474
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,171
-It's much better in person.
-Oh, thank you.

475
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,299
Thank you.
It's been a bit of a recluse lately,

476
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,886
so I'm not really sure
how it's gonna do out in the world.

477
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,305
Plus, I'd never taken a dick pic,
so I had no idea--

478
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,723
I can take it for you.

479
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,726
I can light it at the perfect angle.

480
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,604
I will send you to the Grindr-verse
with a pic…

482
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,442

00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,861
-You're amazing.
-[sighs]

484
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,281
Okay. Might have to wait a little bit
before it gets hard again, but--

485
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,366
Mm-hmm?

486
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,494
It's not… It's…

Oh my God. Kurt, Stephanie, hi.

Hi.

-So sorry to hear about you guys.
-Ah…

505
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,641
We were gonna reach out. Even though,
technically, we're Colin's friends,

506
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,185
obviously, we care about you too.

507
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,437
Oh, I know. Thank you.
What brings you to the gallery?

508
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,857
Oh, Stanley mentioned the show to us,
and thought we might like the artist.

509
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,693
I didn't know you knew Stanley.
Did you meet at Colin's 50th?

510
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,322
Yes, and then we saw each other again
last night at Colin's new apartment.

511
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,531
He had a little dinner party.

512
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,371
-Anyway, it's really good to see you.
-Take care, Mike.

513
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,499
Yeah, yeah.

[scoffs]

515
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,961
Michael, I was gonna tell you.

516
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,046
Tell me what?

517
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,550
That you went to a fucking
dinner party at his new apartment?

518
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,763
That he made
his special linguine alle vongole,

519
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,682
which I'm sure he served
in the Williams-Sonoma pasta bowls,

520
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,683
which I bought,

521
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,186
and in what is becoming
a daily occurrence,

522
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,854
just realized are gone?

523
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,148
How could you do that, Stanley?

524
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,817
-He reached out, so I--
-No!

525
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,903
No. He does not get to reach out.

526
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,657
He has lost all reaching out privileges,
which you should have told him,

527
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,034
or, better yet, not reached back.

528
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,702
Just ghosted him, like he did me.

529
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,954
Michael, please.

530
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,206
I've known him all these years.

531
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,961
I just wanted to find out his side.

532
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,671
His side?

533
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,466
His side is that he is a sociopath

534
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,762
who walked out on a 17-year relationship
without telling me.

535
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,974
You're supposed to be my friend.

536
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,144
And Colin, despite his dinner parties
and his fucking reaching out,

537
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,729
is a very bad person.

538
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,233
Or maybe he's a good person
who did a very bad thing.

539
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,484
To me!

540
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,238
He did a very bad thing to me,
your friend.

541
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,115
You don't get to have pasta with him

542
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,952
a week after he told me it was over
in a text!

543
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,247
It actually wasn't pasta.

544
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,125
I can't believe I'm even
having this conversation with you.

545
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,460
It's not a conversation.
You're not letting me--

546
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,547
You can't be friends with both of us,
Stanley. You have to pick.

547
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,926
Uh-- Of course I'm your friend first, but…

548
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,680
I shouldn't have to pick.
