1
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,761
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,680
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,811
Sang-hee.

4
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,401
Oh Joo-hyung, you're under arrest
for the charges of murdering your wife.

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,407
-Let me talk to her for a moment.
-Take your time.

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,619
How could you kill your wife?

7
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,662
You do look like a wife-killer, though.

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,172
Thank you for your cooperation.

9
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,674
He said he'd get divorced,
so I trusted him.

10
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,426
But this is what happened.

11
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,472
Come with us to
the police station as a witness.

12
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,849
You can testify about what happened.

13
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,227
Later.

14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,269
I…

15
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,939
I don't think I can do it right now.

16
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,359
I'll take my stuff and leave.

17
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:50,944
Sure.

18
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,881
SAE-BOM

19
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
Hey, Sae-bom.

20
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,888
Where are you?

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,557
I'm locked up inside.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,518
Don't fight them trying to get in.

23
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,979
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

24
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,356
What does that mean?
Where are you locked up at?

25
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,275
I'll be

26
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,819
watching our apartment.

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,156
Sae-bom, tell me what's going on.

28
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,616
Damn it.

29
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,955
I was going to tell you later…

30
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,172
I thought I was left alone.

31
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,266
Sae-bom, I have to catch that jerk.

32
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,603
It's okay. No one can get out.

33
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,577
Who is this?

34
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,579
Hi, did you order rice cakes?

35
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,624
Enjoy and order more, okay?

36
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,877
Are you a police officer too?

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,920
How did you know?

38
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,547
You saw this.

39
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,383
I'm not someone suspicious.

40
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm friends with your neighbor.

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,721
So you have two jobs.

42
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,057
But why did you bring a gun?

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,352
Someone bad lives here,
so I'm going to arrest him.

44
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,396
People need to see my gun
to know that I'm a police officer.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,441
-Can I see it up close?
-No, it's dangerous.

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,613
To be honest, I've never actually used it.

47
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm just carrying it around.

48
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,909
Because it looks awesome, doesn't it?

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm home.

50
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,210
Are you dead?

51
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,629
You don't even look at me when I'm back.

52
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,298
Hey, here's your hamburger.

53
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,428
And you get up right away because of food!

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,181
Thanks.

55
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,308
You said it's a hamburger.

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,019
It's still bread. What's the problem?

57
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,813
If you don't want it, then forget it.

58
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,817
Honey, I'm not saying that
I don't want it…

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,652
Did it get chapped again?

60
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,569
No.

61
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,947
My goodness.

62
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,325
Apply something on it! You're old now!

63
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,036
No, it didn't get chapped. This is…

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,622
I sprained it a bit when I fell yesterday.

65
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,374
Don't overreact.

66
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:56,963
Honey, aren't you even curious
about what happened? I got hurt.

67
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,968
Did something happen?

68
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,094
Yes.

69
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,222
Yesterday, on the sixth floor…

70
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,975
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?
I have a meeting!

71
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,604
Hey, how are we supposed
to know about your appointments?

72
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,440
We're not telepathic!

73
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,734
Dong-hyun, want this sandwich?

74
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,445
You two eat it and live a happy life.

75
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,196
Hey, take this…

76
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,741
That rude brat!

77
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,036
Good grief.

78
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
I MADE MONEY THROUGH YOUTUBE!

79
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,796
What in the world…

80
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,305
I got more than 1,000 subscribers.
At this rate, we can surely make a profit!

81
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,392
No, you just need to pay the initial cost!
Can't you trust me?

82
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,519
All right.

83
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,772
I'll be there soon. All right.

84
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,036
Why can't I go out? Hey, mister!

85
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,162
What the heck?

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,583
I can't believe this.

87
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
Can't you hear me?

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,883
What's going on?
I don't have time for this!

89
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,145
-Even the smallest room is pretty big.
-It is.

90
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,778
SY HOME CLEANING

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,450
Nice weather.

92
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,954
You can't smoke indoors.

93
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,165
This is an electronic cigarette.

94
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,434
Happy now? Are you satisfied?

95
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,064
Jeez…

96
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,484
Honey, can't we fire him?

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,611
He's weird.

98
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,114
Just let him be.

99
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,368
He doesn't mind getting paid
lower than the minimum wage.

100
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,663
His name is weird too.

101
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,248
Andrew?

102
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,417
Is that a fake name or what?

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,377
Seriously.

104
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,353
That's been going on since this morning.

105
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,106
Is there a fire?

106
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,066
If it was a fire,
we would have known already.

107
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,652
I've been in a fire before.

108
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,738
You don’t know unless you smell it.

109
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,323
Your house caught on fire?

110
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,449
Yes.

111
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,659
I heard the sirens outside,

112
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,828
and the fire trucks
were lined up on the road.

113
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,789
I opened the window
and looked around to see where it was,

114
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,667
and someone from the apartment
across the street yelled at me.

115
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,712
-What did they say?
-"Young lady, come out!"

116
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,047
"Your apartment is on fire!"

117
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,009
The top floor of
my apartment building was on fire.

118
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,722
It's clearly visible from the outside,
but you don't know when you're inside.

119
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
No way.

120
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,948
Hello, this is Lawyer Kook Hae-seong.

121
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,784
Hi, I'm your next-door neighbor. Unit 601.

122
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,037
I need urgent legal consulting…

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,206
Yes, hi.

124
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,834
You must be worried
because of your wife, right?

125
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,836
I'm home now. Are you home?

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,589
Would you like me to go to your house?

127
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,134
No, I'm outside right now.

128
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,386
I see. Okay.

129
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,389
Then please tell me. What's going on?

130
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,392
The police arrested me without a warrant,

131
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,979
but an arrest without
a warrant is illegal, right?

132
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,566
What are you being charged with?

133
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,025
Murder.

134
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,446
You evaded arrest and escaped, right?

135
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,575
Help me, please!

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,451
I live in Building 101.

137
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,495
I'm a doctor! A specialist!

138
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,914
We're from the police.
You can just keep going.

139
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,457
Young lady. Or old lady?

140
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,959
Anyway, he's your husband?

141
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,628
I'm going to report you
for human rights violations.

142
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,967
What are you waiting for?
Hit him where it won't show.

143
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,804
Just come with me.

144
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,474
And put your shoes on.

145
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,481
They're locking us up?

146
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,483
-I can't believe it…
-What are they doing?

147
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,861
-Why did they set those up?
-What's going on?

148
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,280
-This is so scary.
-They're so big.

149
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,532
This is nonsense.

150
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,347
I'm so disappointed in you.

151
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,600
Hey, I'm your only older brother,

152
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,311
and you can't even give me 150 million?

153
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,479
I have no money.

154
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,314
You do have money.

155
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,775
You know what the price for this place is.

156
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,403
-You won the lottery.
-Are they doing construction work outside?

157
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,905
Or how about we live together?

158
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,910
It would be great for my kids
to study in a house like this.

159
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,330
You have a lot of rooms.
Give one each to my kids.

160
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,999
And honestly, you get lonely
when you live alone.

161
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,169
Have you heard of lonely death?

162
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,462
Yes.

163
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,880
That's why I read newspapers.

164
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,715
So people can find out when I die.

165
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,177
To be honest, you've been living here
with Father's deposit.

166
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,388
And thanks to that, you got the house.

167
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,557
But you inherited the fortune,
in cash and lands!

168
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,476
But I got them ten years ago.

169
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,854
-Ever heard of inflation?
-Be quiet.

170
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,898
Greetings, all residents of Building 101.

171
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,900
I am the building representative.

172
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,570
I'm sure you are confused
because of all the noise.

173
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,950
The entire apartment complex
is now separated from the outside.

174
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,618
-What?
-And the government

175
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,621
has something to tell us
about Mad Human Disease.

176
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,542
A resident meeting will take place
at the basement gym at five.

177
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,795
With the government admitting the
existence of Mad Human Disease,

178
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,464
three nursing homes,
two homeless facilities,

179
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
and one apartment complex in Seyang

180
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,428
have been put into cohort isolation
due to Mad Human Disease.

181
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,431
Hey, was it like that when you came in?

182
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes.

183
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,268
I thought they were
just doing construction work.

184
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,394
The government revealed

185
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,439
that it was an inevitable action
to prevent additional infections,

186
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,233
and stated that they will prevent
the spreading of infection

187
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,987
through accurate diagnostic tests
and establishing countermeasures.

188
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
I'm sure we can get out, though.

189
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,533
Nice place.

190
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,376
-My mom is inside.
-Let me go in just for a moment.

191
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,086
-No.
-My kid is all alone.

192
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,811
Your mom must be worried too.

193
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,355
But she'll call you soon, so…

194
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,443
-Mom?
-Seo-yoon, are you okay?

195
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,280
-Did anything happen to you?
-No. I'm at our neighbor's.

196
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,324
I'm in front of the apartments.

197
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,327
I'll go inside somehow,
so just hang in there.

198
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,789
They're not letting anyone out,
but letting people in won't be a problem.

199
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,916
Okay.

200
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,169
Can I speak to that lady
if she's with you?

201
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,221
Hello?

202
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,768
I'm so glad we have you.

203
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,894
Thank you so much.

204
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,648
I'll be heading inside soon.

205
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,567
Please take care of Seo-yoon
for a little while longer.

206
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,110
Don't worry.

207
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,863
I love hanging out with Seo-yoon too.

208
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,906
Seo-yoon…

209
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,992
has a heart problem.

210
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,161
She has mitral regurgitation.

211
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,872
Blood wells up inside her heart.

212
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,834
She must never do vigorous exercise,
and she must never bleed.

213
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,836
Last time, she injured her fingernail

214
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,506
and she was hospitalized
and got an antibiotics injection.

215
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,840
I will watch over her.

216
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,635
I couldn't stay with her
just because of some money…

217
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,305
I got a call earlier,
but I couldn't answer.

218
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,726
I will try and find out
if there's a way to let Seo-yoon out.

219
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,354
Thank you so much.

220
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,940
It's not your fault.

221
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,776
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

222
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,486
Okay.

223
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,798
Mom, can I eat the rice cakes?

224
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
MS. KIM BOK-NAM

225
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,479
Hi, Mom.

226
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,024
You said you're okay. What's going on?

227
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,318
That's your apartment
getting locked down, right?

228
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,821
It's a preemptive action
to control the infections. Don’t worry.

229
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,532
They say many people got infected,
so just stay home.

230
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,950
Don't go poking around.

231
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,203
I want to stay put, but…

232
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,376
someone has to do something.

233
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,004
-What?
-I'm busy. I'll call you later.

234
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,424
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAN TAE-SEOK

235
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,387
Lieutenant Colonel?

236
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,431
We need to meet.

237
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,143
What do you mean, when?
As soon as possible.

238
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,440
You knew your wife
was taking drugs, right?

239
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,275
Did you take that drug too?

240
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,864
Did Min-ji become like that
because of drugs?

241
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,118
You can't run away now anyway,

242
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,620
so just stay here quietly.

243
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,123
If you want to consult a lawyer,
then do so.

244
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,379
What about me?

245
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,214
I'm not even a resident here.

246
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,092
No one can go out, and no one can come in.

247
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,346
You're a police officer.
Can't you do something?

248
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,098
I can't get out, either.

249
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,020
Anyway, there's a resident meeting.
Come with us.

250
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,980
No.

251
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,649
I'm sure everyone knows
what happened here.

252
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,526
What would the others think about me?

253
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,153
Then would you like
to stay here with Mr. Oh?

254
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,163
Hang on.

255
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,512
What now? What?

256
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,397
I'm worried about Ms. Woo, that's why.

257
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,608
I'll uncuff this later, so get some sleep.

258
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,945
Why would you do this?

259
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,740
Why are you doing this to me?

260
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,367
Then what about the bathroom?

261
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,995
Should I just pee in the room?

262
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,336
Make sure you don't spill.

263
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,967
Damn it.

264
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,476
You're not going?

265
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,353
I want to go too, but…

266
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,522
you know how sensitive I am.

267
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,026
If I go to a crowded place
with Mad Human Disease going around,

268
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,196
I can't use 100% of my abilities.

269
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,491
Then what about me?
You think I'm not scared?

270
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,951
That's why I only trust you.

271
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,913
Clients will line up on days like this.

272
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,000
This lockdown has
a high possibility of legal issues.

273
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay. I'll go and promote you.

274
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,798
-So-yoon.
-Yes?

275
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,341
You can do it!

276
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,142
Hi.

277
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,814
I heard you arrested the man next door.

278
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,440
Where is he now?

279
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,485
He's at home.

280
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,530
Because of the lockdown.

281
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,617
I cuffed him, so tell him to go
and consult him if he wants to.

282
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,330
Is there evidence for murder?

283
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,833
You should ask Mr. Oh about that yourself.

284
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,293
But if I were you two,

285
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,796
I wouldn't defend him.

286
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,638
Sang-hee.

287
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,391
Sang-hee. You're out there, right?

288
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,059
We need to talk!

289
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,603
We're soulmates! Come on!

290
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,563
No.

291
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,483
Do you think you can be happy on your own?

292
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,405
Everyone knows we had an affair,
and you're locked up in here.

293
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,032
You have no money,
and you'll get fired from the clinic.

294
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,744
I am the only one
who understands you, Sang-hee.

295
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,957
You know me, right?

296
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,919
Sang-hee, I'll give you money. Okay?

297
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,338
Sang-hee.

298
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,383
How much are you going to give me?

299
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,446
Hi, I'm the wife
of Lawyer Kook Hae-seong, Unit 602.

300
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,949
If you have legal problems,
please call this number.

301
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,579
He said he doesn't know
anything about drugs.

302
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,333
He got all upset,
saying that he doesn't use steroids.

303
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,264
Is the meeting just for our building?

304
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,308
Just the units that end with 1 and 2.

305
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,060
Looks like we're meeting separately.

306
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,575
Dear residents of Seyang Forest Le Ciel.

307
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,579
Due to the dangers of
additional infections in the complex,

308
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,916
the entire complex will be
in cohort isolation for one week.

309
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,543
Hey, young lady!

310
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,712
I don’t even live here!
Am I locked up too?

311
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,298
We will compensate for all damages caused

312
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,010
by the lockdown
until we can manage all the infected.

313
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,011
I'm not talking about that…

314
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,765
We will make sure
you won't suffer any inconvenience,

315
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,350
so please wait until then.

316
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,560
And if you need anything else,

317
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,271
discuss it among the residents
and let us know.

318
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,564
That will be all.

319
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,068
-No, it can't end like this!
-Hey, wait!

320
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,946
Young lady! Wait!

321
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,031
I'm sure all of you are shocked,

322
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,951
but I believe that we,
as the residents of Seyang Forest Le Ciel,

323
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,371
can remain calm and overcome this crisis.

324
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,123
It's not about remaining calm…

325
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,334
I can't hear you
if you all talk at the same time.

326
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,878
I will give you a chance to speak in turn.

327
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,550
Is it because of someone
getting infected yesterday?

328
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,429
Then they should separate those
who were in contact!

329
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,389
I've never even seen that person!

330
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,229
The lady from Unit 302 bumped
into the lady from Unit 601 and fell.

331
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,148
Didn't you hear about it?

332
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,065
Really?

333
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,485
It seems your family hasn't had
any proper conversations.

334
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,154
By the way…

335
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,741
If it's contagious,
then we shouldn't gather like this, right?

336
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,534
You watched the announcement.

337
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,995
It doesn't spread through the air,
so don't worry.

338
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,204
How can we believe that?

339
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,416
But what happens
if someone's infected here,

340
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,251
and tries to bite us?

341
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,466
With all of us gathered up in this
small place, we will all bite and kill

342
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,051
-and eat each other…
-Oh, my head.

343
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:29,556
Honestly, I don't think there are
any more infected in our building.

344
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,225
Everyone's sophisticated.

345
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,062
And thankfully, we have a detective here.

346
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,189
Detective.

347
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,902
Don't look at me, I'm suffocating. You go.

348
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,203
There are symptoms
that show before the disease occurs.

349
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,915
The infected feel extreme thirst,
and the pupils get smaller,

350
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,000
-making the eyes look white.
-What?

351
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,919
And they also show compulsive behaviors

352
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,630
like hitting the wall
when they're alone in an empty space.

353
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,466
Please meet others
in a group of two or more

354
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,011
and try to keep the doors open.

355
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,139
If you see suspicious behavior,
ask for help right away.

356
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,350
I live alone. How can I stay in groups?

357
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,352
-Hold on.
-It's one week.

358
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,899
You just need to endure this for one week.

359
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,427
The kids were at school,

360
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,930
and you stopped
the school buses from coming in.

361
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,600
You wanted a lockdown without kids, right?

362
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,978
It looks better that way.

363
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,189
There's a kid who didn't go to school.

364
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,482
Let her out.

365
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,861
You can do that at least, right?

366
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,070
Park Seo-yoon.

367
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,947
We're testing her parents.

368
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,824
They have a high risk of infection.

369
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,161
Are you sure?

370
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,371
I'm sure they took the drugs to stay awake

371
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,165
because delivery work is tough.

372
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,627
They're telling their daughter
that they love her and miss her, right?

373
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,255
It's no use.

374
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,633
You never know how people can change
in times of crisis.

375
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,720
Lieutenant Colonel.

376
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,682
You can talk about
your pessimistic views to someone else.

377
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,517
So what?

378
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,899
I'm saying it's better for Seo-yoon
to be here with a good guardian.

379
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,901
We don't know…

380
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,865
what will happen outside.

381
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,204
Mr. Police Officer.

382
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:03,376
I think I'll be able
to jump over the walls outside.

383
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,047
Will I get punished if I jump over it?

384
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,468
Well, the reporters
would love seeing that at least.

385
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,679
If you're lucky, you might end up
on the evening news.

386
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,308
-I see.
-What about food?

387
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,685
Do we eat on our own?

388
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,396
We'll give you boxed lunches,
starting tomorrow.

389
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,273
Do you have enough food for dinner?

390
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,944
But where are
the Management Office people?

391
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,156
We got isolated at 9:30 a.m.,
but no one came to work by then.

392
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,117
And the person on night duty
is at the other meeting.

393
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,577
Absolutely ridiculous.

394
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,537
What?

395
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,375
Then are the other buildings
having a meeting without us?

396
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,211
The first infected came from our building,
so they're scared.

397
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,005
They are abandoning
their responsibilities.

398
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,384
Then we have no one
from the Management Office here?

399
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,099
No, we don't.

400
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,769
Something unfathomable has happened.

401
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,437
But she's right there.

402
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,778
I was living in the US with my husband

403
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,906
but returned because I fell in love with
the so-called K-Quarantine.

404
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,616
Excuse me, building representative.

405
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,160
We do have someone from
the Management Office, outside.

406
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,918
Our apartment complex
teems with corruption.

407
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,630
They secretly fixed the elevators
because they didn't pass the safety test.

408
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,591
And they collect recyclables
only once a week,

409
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,012
and they're wasting money to fix
the roadside trees in the complex.

410
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,722
If you trust and follow me,

411
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,434
I will become the resident representative

412
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,813
and solve all these unreasonable issues
in the apartments.

413
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,984
Then let the public rental floors
use the gym too.

414
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,906
My husband graduated from
the College of Theology in Kentucky.

415
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
-But I said…
-I know some of you are worried

416
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,037
about worships
because the apartments are in quarantine.

417
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,164
Hallelujah!

418
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,127
-God is always with you.
-Amen.

419
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,882
Believers, please come to me.

420
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,346
If you're having difficulties calculating
your losses due to the lockdown

421
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,474
or are in need of legal consulting,
please let me know.

422
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,643
We will provide
high quality legal consulting service.

423
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,228
Please come to Unit 602.

424
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,356
Hey.

425
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,690
Hurry up.

426
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,193
I hate this.

427
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,161
I heard you're also
something like a police officer.

428
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,040
You should be cooperating
with maintaining order in the apartments.

429
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,459
I'm in a completely different field.

430
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,128
I only learned
how to suppress terrorist attacks.

431
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,172
If you need cooperation, talk to me.

432
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,351
Will I get a raise if I do this?

433
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,519
I don't think so.

434
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,480
But I'm sure it will help
with my promotion.

435
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,316
Hey, I didn't know until I came here.

436
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,568
I want to go home
and deliver rice cakes too.

437
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,196
What is this about?

438
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,866
You should tell me so I can help.

439
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,913
-Why are you locking the door…
-Let us ask you something.

440
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,249
Are you close to him?

441
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,834
Joo-heon?

442
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,170
No, I work every other day,
so I didn't even see him much.

443
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,715
He stopped coming to work a few days ago,
so I've been filling in for him.

444
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,143
You're drinking too much water.

445
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,520
Do you keep feeling thirsty?

446
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,272
I always drink a lot of water.

447
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,107
Can you open this for us?

448
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,317
I'm from the SOU.

449
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,070
Okay.

450
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,282
Look all you want.

451
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:11,332
Your co-worker sold drugs here.

452
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,253
And the government thinks
those drugs cause Mad Human Disease.

453
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,714
You know the symptoms, right?

454
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,133
Extreme thirst.

455
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,843
Hallucinations.

456
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,310
Be honest. Did you take those drugs?

457
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,313
No, I only took supplements.

458
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,566
But you know who took them, right?

459
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,529
If you don't tell us now,
you could be charged with selling drugs.

460
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,616
I really don't know.

461
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,869
Hiding it won't solve anything.

462
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,828
This entire complex

463
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,955
is on lockdown because of you,
you know that?

464
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,290
I told you, it wasn't me!

465
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:03,009
You two keep talking
as if I'm the bad guy.

466
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,720
But I seriously did not take those drugs.

467
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,075
We're behind on
our cleaning schedule this week.

468
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,202
Isn't there a way to solve this?

469
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,119
SY HOME CLEANING

470
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,457
Sir, I came in here
and suddenly got locked in too.

471
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,044
They said they'll compensate
for financial losses, so let's be patient.

472
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,924
Do you two have a place
to sleep, at least?

473
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,259
No, we don't.

474
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,345
I have a kid at home too.

475
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,265
-How old is your kid?
-A sophomore in high school.

476
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,684
A sophomore in high school…

477
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,273
I will find out and see if you can sleep
at one of the houses you clean.

478
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,359
By the way, is he from your company?

479
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,571
He's our employee, but…

480
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,613
What's your name?

481
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,741
I'm Andrew.

482
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
What?

483
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,829
Excuse me.

484
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:22,463
He's a bit dumb, but he's nice.

485
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,550
He has a deep scar on his face
from an injury when he was little.

486
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,177
So he couldn't go outside
and only stayed at home.

487
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,556
But no one thinks it's weird
to wear a mask these days,

488
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,017
so he mustered up the courage
to start working.

489
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,143
I see.

490
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,771
Do you all have your IDs with you?

491
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,898
-Yes.
-Can you please give them to me?

492
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,484
They said they need
a list of those who are inside.

493
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,869
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD: AHN KOOK-JIN

494
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,621
I erased it.

495
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,959
Ahn Kook-jin.

496
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,755
Why did you say your name was Andrew?

497
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,801
Because I wish I could have superpowers.

498
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,346
There was a TV show about it.

499
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,817
Who were you calling,
and why did you hang up so quickly?

500
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,944
I just called my friend.

501
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,738
Shall we tie him up?

502
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,239
We don't know yet.

503
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,616
We won’t tie you up,

504
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,785
so just stay here, okay?

505
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,538
Mr. Kim, if we catch you outside,

506
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,083
then we really will
consider you as an infected.

507
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,334
As for water…

508
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,506
Just hang on until morning.

509
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:58,351
DO NOT ENTER
RISK OF INFECTION!

510
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,269
You'll get thirsty if you stay up,

511
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,438
so put the phone down and go to bed.

512
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,237
UNIT 601
UNIT 1202

513
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,154
UNIT 602

514
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,785
It's a relief that
the public rental residents

515
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,328
weren't allowed to use the gym.

516
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,706
There's a fewer number of
possibly infected people.

517
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,500
You truly are…

518
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,794
a detective.

519
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,297
Of course.

520
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,217
I did go to the gym a few times,

521
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,469
but besides that, I was always home.

522
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,805
I won't leave my house
until the lockdown is over,

523
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,931
so don't mind me.

524
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,683
It's not about that.

525
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,103
The people downstairs
need something, that's why.

526
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,647
Blankets.

527
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,316
You have military blankets, don't you?

528
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,158
I can bring you the T-shirt tomorrow.

529
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,387
Thank you.

530
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,561
ARTICLE 1003
ORDER OF INHERITANCE OF SPOUSE

531
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,996
You remember
that I live downstairs, right?

532
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,042
If you make noises on purpose,
I'm coming for you.

533
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,546
What are you going to do, then?

534
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,547
Mister.

535
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,635
Even if you die on the run,
no one would say anything.

536
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,386
Lots of people would talk.

537
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,597
This is illegal confinement.

538
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,016
Well, more than that,

539
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,393
your name wasn't on the gym register.

540
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,479
Don't you exercise regularly?

541
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,315
I breathe. And I play golf sometimes.

542
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,108
My wife went to the gym.

543
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,946
Why?

544
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,117
Did Mad Human Disease spread from the gym?

545
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,410
Stop trying to play tricks

546
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,622
and just repent your murder
if you have time for that.

547
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,083
If you're a human being, at least.

548
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,591
Ms. Woo, we prepared
a change of clothes for you

549
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,135
and a place to sleep on the fifth floor,
so come with me.

550
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,596
I just want to stay here.

551
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,600
I got angry and gave false testimony.

552
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,188
To be honest,
I didn’t see or hear anything that day.

553
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,898
I'm sorry, Detective.

554
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,818
Sang-hee got tricked by you

555
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,696
and thought that I really did something.

556
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,702
I explained to her that
Min-ji's death was an accident.

557
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,851
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAN TAE-SEOK

558
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,064
What is it?

559
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,734
Unit 302 is livestreaming
about what's happening in the apartment.

560
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,319
Stop him immediately.

561
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,946
If not, we will cut off the Internet
and all TV signals.

562
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:59,550
Hey, get up for a minute.

563
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,261
Why?

564
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,387
Did you…

565
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,557
meet someone infected yesterday?

566
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,644
Did you figure that out now?

567
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,899
-Did you get scratched?
-No, I didn't.

568
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,693
Yes, you did.

569
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,612
My goodness.

570
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,614
Stop it!

571
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,908
I said I didn't!

572
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,204
Pretending to be concerned
when you never bothered before.

573
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,626
You were lying down for this?
It's not even serious.

574
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,755
Just drink some soju.
If you drink, the pain will go away.

575
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,131
Gosh.

576
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,805
What is it?

577
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,181
Is your son home?

578
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,225
I think he went outside earlier.

579
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,685
Do you know where he went to?

580
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,228
I'm sure he's in the complex.

581
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,063
Anyway, he's not here.

582
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,150
I know where he is.

583
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,737
I told you, I won't be talking
about stocks today.

584
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,115
Today's contents are real, no fabrication.

585
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,659
Giro, good to see you.

586
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,328
It's Giro, our biggest sponsor.
Good to see you!

587
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,416
All right, everyone.
Can you guess where this is?

588
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,087
This is where
the first infected person was found.

589
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,841
The family is still living here,

590
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,593
so I'm going to meet and talk to them.

591
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,890
Shall I ring the doorbell?

592
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,143
Ring it? Or not?

593
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,979
Ring it? Or not?

594
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,190
Shall I ring it, or not?

595
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,108
JUST RING IT ALREADY

596
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,526
Ring it or not?

597
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,612
-Oh, my gosh…
-Shall I punch him? Or not?

598
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,782
Punch him? Or not?

599
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm getting lots! Lots!

600
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,079
We're turning this off.
Go to bed, everyone.

601
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,748
What the heck? How do I turn this off?

602
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,500
-Streaming off!
-What is this?

603
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,461
Thank you.

604
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,463
Is this something you should thank us for?

605
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,549
-I got 500,000 won!
-This is driving me nuts…

606
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,429
-Damn it!
-Why did you do that?

607
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,014
Mister, come here.

608
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,021
Today's been such a long day.

609
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,773
Right.

610
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,358
What about the clinic consultant upstairs?

611
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,320
She got coaxed by Oh Joo-hyung.
She said she'll just stay there.

612
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,074
Should we try persuading her again?

613
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,160
No, she's an adult.
She can make her own decisions.

614
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,954
I'm sure Oh Joo-hyung
won't cause any more trouble.

615
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,707
Let's just check on them
from time to time.

616
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,043
-I'm so tired.
-All right, then.

617
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,296
About our beds…

618
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,965
Where should we…

619
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,929
Where should I sleep?

620
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,547
Hey, Yi-hyun. Smile.

621
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,673
All right. One, two.

622
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,343
What are you doing?

623
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:34,431
My wife told me to send her a picture.
She thinks I went fishing.

624
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,475
Why won't she believe me?

625
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,185
I can't believe it, either.

626
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,146
Can't believe what?

627
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,106
That I'm here with you right now.

628
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,318
Things seemed so nice today…

629
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,113
There you go.

630
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,531
Here.

631
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,742
You just need to wait for a few more days,

632
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,745
so think of it as staying
at a vacation house, okay?

633
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,746
Okay.

634
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,262
Are you praying?

635
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,266
I changed my prayer today.

636
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,311
I prayed that the lockdown
would be over when I wake up tomorrow.

637
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,898
Right. I'll pray for that too.

638
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,734
-Good night.
-Okay.

639
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,820
You have a good night too.

640
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,071
Let's have a good night.

641
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,285
Yi-hyun.

642
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,121
What?

643
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,831
I have a bad back.

644
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,463
-All of a sudden?
-Yes.

645
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,010
Jeez. You can sleep on the sofa.

646
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,261
Thanks.

647
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,394
-This is mine, so take that one.
-Okay, thanks.

648
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,858
I got treated by a bad acupuncturist.

649
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,258
I'M SORRY I KEEP CALLING YOU
WHEN YOU MUST BE WORRIED TOO

650
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,884
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MARRIAGE

651
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,095
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE, SO DON'T WORRY

652
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:40,015
STAY HEALTHY
DON'T BECOME LIKE ME, AND BE HAPPY!

653
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,739
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY TOO, MOM

654
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,746
COUNT ON US FOR
A CURE FOR VIRAL PNEUMONIA

655
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,044
THE DARK SIDE OF ATUM THERAPEUTICS,
TEAM LEADER HAN TAE-SEOK ASSAULTS CEO

656
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,171
Jung-kook.

657
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,382
I know you’re not asleep.

658
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,429
-What?
-About Han Tae-seok's assault…

659
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,932
What happened to the CEO of that company?

660
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,434
What are you talking about?

661
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,353
If it was an assault,
that means he's not dead.

662
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,650
So I'm wondering
what happened to him after that.

663
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,886
DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MARKET TRENDS

664
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,726
You look well, Mr. Choi.

665
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,188
I heard you revealed Mad Human Disease
and locked the apartments down.

666
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,564
It's chaos worldwide.

667
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,359
The article will be released tomorrow
and the borders will be closed.

668
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,780
I recommended you to the higher-ups

669
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,199
because you said
you could take care of it quietly.

670
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,701
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

671
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,164
Someone was releasing Next
into the market.

672
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,582
That's why I failed.

673
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,209
Who?

674
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,673
You.

675
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,551
You took out all of the stock

676
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,679
left in the storage, didn't you?

677
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,639
I didn't buy those.

678
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,477
Someone told me where the storage was
and told me to take them all.

679
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,730
Why would I do that?

680
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,484
Because the more infected there are,
the faster the cure can be developed.

681
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,695
Aren't you the type
who would rather see the world end

682
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,489
than face your death?

683
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,909
Tae-seok.

684
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,664
Your wife's life also depends on this.

685
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,708
And the baby is still in her womb, right?

686
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,046
Two tenacious lives.

687
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,471
Did you know that
your wife's blood tasted the best?

688
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,896
That thirst…

689
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,399
it's hard to hold it in, isn't it?

690
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,009
Lieutenant Colonel.

691
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,808
It's okay.

692
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,946
That old man did release it.

693
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,574
I'll get the numbers of his entourages.
Track them down.

694
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,910
We must block
all possible routes of infection.

695
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,745
Is it okay to leave him like that?

696
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,539
Do you have an alternative?

697
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,249
We should quarantine him too.

698
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,084
His status is way too high for that.

699
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,087
Once the cure is developed,
he'll get the shot first.

700
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,174
Even if he gets cured,
he might still bite people.

701
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,009
Because he's tasted blood

702
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,179
and learned that he can get away with it.

703
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,224
-Then we should…
-The most important thing is the cure.

704
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,354
Whether or not he survives after that…

705
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,775
is a whole different matter.

706
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,461
It's still the same.

707
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,046
This morning, the government announced

708
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:25,050
that they put two more nursing homes
into cohort isolation.

709
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,970
Places in cohort isolation include
one apartment complex,

710
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,473
three nursing homes,
and two homeless shelters,

711
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,560
making it a total of eight
in only two days.

712
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,687
There are also suspicions

713
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,439
of Mad Human Disease
spreading overseas as well.

714
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,317
Russia closed its borders
due to infectious disease,

715
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,402
and its customs…

716
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,154
Did you sleep well?

717
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,197
Of course.

718
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,116
Did you sleep well too, Mister?

719
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,200
Yes.

720
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,869
Let's go.

721
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,455
-Go where?
-To get boxed lunches!

722
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,832
Right.

723
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,166
Hi.

724
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,419
-You're up, Seo-yoon.
-Hi.

725
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,004
-Did you have a good sleep?
-Yes.

726
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,258
Sae-bom, you look really happy today.

727
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,178
Yi-hyun was tossing
and turning all night long.

728
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,894
People are happy when
they are looking forward to something.

729
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,854
What do you mean?

730
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,189
Aren't you curious
what kind of food they'll give us?

731
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,567
Right.

732
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,028
Why?

733
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,450
I bought this apartment with my money!
Why can't I go out?

734
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,118
Open it!

735
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,580
Sir, you're a public rental resident.

736
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,915
You got in here with the taxes I paid.

737
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,544
I'm still a resident here!

738
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,880
Damn it!

739
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,758
They're from the Management Office
and the other buildings.

740
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,343
What's going on?

741
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,011
We can't go outside anymore.

742
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,721
The other buildings voted for this.

743
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,889
Lock it up.

744
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,685
What do you think you're doing?

745
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,856
This is all because
there was someone infected here!

746
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,818
I heard you also locked up
someone infected in the gym!

747
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,820
How do you know about that?

748
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,073
We can see it from the Management Office.

749
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,785
So you've been spying on our building?

750
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,746
For the sake of
this entire apartment complex,

751
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,248
the residents of this building…

752
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,751
should stay home for a week!

753
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,545
And our lunches?

754
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,006
We'll bring the necessities for you.

755
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,967
It's hard for all of us. Don't do this.

756
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,096
It's not like you can get infected
through airborne transmission.

757
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,015
This building has
the most public rentals, right?

758
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:37,974
Yes.

759
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,310
What does that have to do with this?

760
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,271
It means it's unfair for us!

761
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,941
If more people get infected
and the apartment price drops,

762
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,943
-it'll only damage us!
-That's right!

763
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,905
You can just live here for ten years
and buy it for a low price!

764
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,825
Are you doing this on purpose?

765
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,119
Mr. Kim, please help.

766
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,623
I can't even persuade my wife.

767
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,501
They told us not to go outside,
so let's not go outside.

768
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,961
Not that.

769
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,504
-Let me borrow your gun.
-Hey!

770
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,721
Want me to break out,
or will you just open it?

771
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,557
The key.

772
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,730
Seo-yoon, you must never learn
to do things like that.

773
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,232
She's so awesome.

774
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
Every day I'm losing my love for humanity.

775
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,913
We just need to hold on for six more days.

776
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,249
How is time flowing slower
than during our drills?

777
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,929
You people are so heartless.

778
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,392
We made these boxed lunches
with extra care, though.

779
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,769
With lots of protein.

780
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,444
What about the other buildings?
Is this it?

781
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,822
They said they'll take theirs
after your building residents are gone.

782
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,951
Sometimes they're brave,
and sometimes they're cowardly.

783
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,621
Human beings are just so puzzling.

784
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,290
Did you bring enough?

785
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,793
We'll take these and go inside first.

786
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,713
Go inside and wait.

787
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,882
-Okay.
-Seo-yoon, let's go.

788
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,636
Do you need anything else?

789
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,514
Then…

790
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,808
A T-shirt. Large-sized, for men.

791
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,435
Something that looks extremely rare.

792
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,604
With the logo of a special unit…

793
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,108
You don't have an SOU T-shirt, do you?

794
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,072
Are you the only one working here?

795
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,742
Yes, the owner and his wife
went out to get things, so…

796
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,829
Not much is left.

797
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,164
The other buildings bought
everything last night.

798
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,416
A few from Building 101 bought stuff too.

799
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,463
You're pretty calm
considering the situation.

800
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,091
I'm getting three times my original wage.

801
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,551
If I work for 12 hours a day

802
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,387
and get paid for working on holidays,
it'll be a huge amount.

803
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,098
Aren't you scared to be alone here?

804
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,185
I'm sure they'd go mad in their homes,
not at a supermarket.

805
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,271
When we run out of stock,
I'll lock the door.

806
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,406
No parcel deliveries?

807
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,576
I was supposed to get something today.

808
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,702
Bye.

809
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,498
I'm vegetarian.

810
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,834
Isn't there a vegetarian option?

811
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,544
-Vegetarian?
-Yes.

812
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,005
Just take it and shove it in your mouth.

813
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,511
ARMED FORCES MEDICAL COMMAND

814
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,096
It's genuine.

815
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,389
I know someone there.

816
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:08,226
And I'll get you the SOU T-shirt
when the lockdown ends.

817
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,899
-I like it.
-Right?

818
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,321
Have you been on the rooftop?

819
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,704
-It's nice to be out here, right?
-Yes.

820
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,724
It's nice to be in an open space.

821
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,602
It feels like we're on a picnic.

822
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:51,978
Right.

823
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,898
Let's stay like this for a while.

824
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,713
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

825
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,382
Help yourself, Seo-yoon.

826
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,133
This is actually pretty good.

827
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,134
-It's good.
-Yes.

828
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,803
Have some more of these.

829
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,054
Thanks.

830
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,140
-Jung-kook, have some dumplings.
-Thanks.

831
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,729
Eat up, Seo-yoon.

832
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,983
What?

833
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,476
We have three boxed lunches left.

834
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,022
Are you sure you passed them
out to everyone?

835
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,899
Yes, even the cleaning lady took hers.

836
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,069
Right.

837
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,947
The gym.

838
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,494
Mr. Kim, we're sorry.

839
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,538
You should've called
and told us you're hungry…

840
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,253
That punk must have run away.

841
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,776
Hello?

842
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,736
The guy in the gym disappeared.

843
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,072
Make an announcement
and tell everyone to go home.

844
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,325
I was just about to tell you this.

845
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,619
The Management Office
won't answer the phone.

846
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,245
They must be upset
about what happened earlier.

847
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,998
They're trying to have
a meeting without us again.

848
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,708
Okay, I'll call them then.

849
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,959
What? Hello?

850
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,089
Does this jerk think he's above me?

851
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,091
That worthless cop…

852
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,134
EMERGENCY CONTACT NETWORK

853
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:38,728
A SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY CITY
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

854
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,483
Hey, where are you going?

855
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,532
They're not answering. What should we do?

856
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,866
Where are you going?

857
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,167
I'm sure he's hiding here somewhere.

858
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,847
Wrong card.

859
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,530
Let's go inside.

860
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,418
Is he here?

861
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,752
No, he isn't.

862
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,632
What is that?

863
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,847
Hey!

864
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,103
It's blood.

865
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,867
-Let's go.
-Let me see what's going on first.

866
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:16,951
Sae-bom!

867
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,162
I don't want to get scared
without knowing what’s going on.

868
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:58,785
Hey Mister, come out!

869
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,829
-Shouldn't we take him?
-Come out if you don't want to die!

870
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,581
Damn it.

871
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,217
Why isn't this working?

872
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,135
Please try again.

873
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,849
Thank you.

874
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,779
What?

875
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,322
What's wrong?

876
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,865
I…

877
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,867
I really just went to my car for a moment.

878
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,661
I didn't drink water.

879
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,037
Then why were you running?

880
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,206
I ran because you two ran.

881
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,874
Let me go, please!

882
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,835
Come on.

883
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,506
Can you see them?

884
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,883
See what? Is something out there?

885
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,596
This is crazy…

886
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,856
Let's go up.

887
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,695
Help!

888
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,989
Help me, please!

889
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,102
Ma'am!

890
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,436
Are you okay?

891
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,398
I'm fine but the couple from that house…

892
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,576
Mom, I'm doing fine.

893
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,898
MOM, I'M DOING FINE

894
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:22,447
MOM: SEO-YOON, I LOVE YOU…

895
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,163
Hey!

896
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,748
This is our chance.

897
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,000
Yes.

898
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,461
I'm sure Hyun-kyung
is feeling troubled too.

899
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,381
Let's stay strong, okay?

900
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,509
Hey, we have to find a house
within two months!

901
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,554
Where will you live with our kids, then?

902
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,723
A tiny studio?

903
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,018
Ma'am, you shouldn't go outside.

904
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,069
Stay still. If you run away again…

905
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,659
What are you doing?

906
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,995
-Is something going on?
-Be quiet.

907
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,588
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAN TAE-SEOK

908
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,304
Ms. Yoon, are you all right?

909
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,725
Now do you see
why a lockdown is necessary?

910
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:54,330
Who's that?

911
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,719
The other buildings are all done for.

912
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,679
I know.

913
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,441
If it's dangerous,
you shouldn't hesitate either.

914
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,567
Don't open the door.

915
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,236
But they all got infected already?
That makes no sense!

916
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:10,448
What if this doesn't end
even after one week?

917
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,283
We have to have as much food as possible.

918
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,409
Instant noodles.

919
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,622
We just need to silence
the couple downstairs.

920
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,749
Are you thirsty?

921
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,418
We should not let them pity the infected.

922
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,920
We must make them fear them.

923
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:24,920
Open the door!

924
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,089
If you're a human being,

925
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,592
you should have responsibility
at the very least.

926
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:36,891
