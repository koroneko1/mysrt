1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,000
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

2
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you a psychopath?

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,199
Why are you doing this?

4
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,159
I'm doing all this because I love you.

5
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,199
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
If I wasn't indecisive,

7
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,960
if I had been firm…

8
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,000
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

9
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
She didn't really love him.

10
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm just a product of their mistake.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Am I supposed to give up

12
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,400
and be a coward like you?

13
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,960
And behave immorally like you?

14
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,400
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

15
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,000
I already have plenty of friends.

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,159
But now,

17
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,240
I want you.

18
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,000
Happy birthday, Nut.

19
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,560
We made you a cake.

20
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,399
What decoration do you want
on your cake this year?

21
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I want a rainbow.

22
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
With these colors please, Mom.

23
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,079
That looks hard.

24
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,839
You need to help me then.

25
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,279
All right.

26
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,319
You are a boy.
You shouldn't like pastel rainbows.

27
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,959
It's silly.

28
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
You should teach him right from wrong.

29
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't spoil him.

30
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,399
Nut.

31
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,759
How about we pick a new pattern?

32
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,279
How about an ocean?

33
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,560
Nut.

34
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,959
What pattern would you like
on your birthday cake?

35
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,199
Anything is fine, Mom.

36
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,639
Can you put a piece in a box for me?

37
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,120
I want my friend to try it.

38
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,240
Sure.

39
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,399
Look at the activities you do.

40
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,199
Don't you know how to do
any manly activities?

41
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,319
It might be almost 20 years late.

42
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,600
But I still want to do this for you.

43
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,240
I may have made mistakes in the past.

44
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,319
But please know that…

45
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,360
you are not one of them.

46
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You are my gift.

47
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,000
Happy birthday.

48
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,279
I'm not too late, am I?

49
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Happy birthday, Nut.

50
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,759
I wish you happiness.

51
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Thank you.

52
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
-Sure.
-Let's go inside.

53
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,559
It might seem a little old,

54
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,840
but doesn't it look like
the teddy bear you lost?

55
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,639
Yes, it really does.

56
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I didn't think I would find a teddy bear

57
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,919
similar to your last one.

58
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,120
I was lucky, I guess.

59
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,120
Do you know

60
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
that I worked really hard to find it?

61
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,559
I put in a lot of effort.

62
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
The same goes for the feelings

63
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,840
that I have for you.

64
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,879
I know

65
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,039
that we haven't known
each other for so long.

66
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,759
It might be too early

67
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,279
for me to be saying this.

68
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,480
But I can't let any more time pass by.

69
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
On my first day at work,

70
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
you scolded those drunks for me.

71
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,879
You looked so damn cool.

72
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,879
I became your fan after that day.

73
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,039
Although you pretended not to care,

74
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,080
ignored me,

75
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,159
and had that confused look on your face,

76
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
your heart was filled with warmth

77
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,559
and I couldn't stop myself
from falling for you.

78
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,200
I didn't know

79
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
the best way to confess my feelings,

80
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,519
so I bought you this special gift.

81
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,759
Thank you so much

82
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,159
for this special gift, Prib.

83
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,360
However, no matter how similar
this teddy bear is to my old one,

84
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,240
I can't accept it.

85
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,159
Prib.

86
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,240
You know that I don't feel the same way.

87
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
I understand.

88
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,240
I know

89
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,159
that I can't change your mind.

90
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I just wanted to show you

91
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,279
how serious I am about you.

92
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,399
It's okay

93
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,720
if you feel differently.

94
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,519
It's okay

95
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
if you don't love me.

96
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm okay.

97
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,279
Prib.

98
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,919
I came to wish you a happy birthday.

99
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,399
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

100
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,759
Even though
I can't be that someone for you,

101
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,360
-we can still--
-Stop.

102
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,960
I know what you are going to say.

103
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,960
You're going to say

104
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,159
that I can be your sister, right?

105
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,600
Can you?

106
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm not ready right now.

107
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,039
But I will be.

108
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,600
Prib.

109
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Shall we go home?

110
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,840
It's okay.

111
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
I got here on my own.

112
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,279
I can go home alone as well.

113
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,799
I'll be all right.

114
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,639
Are you all right?

115
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
Yes.

116
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm okay.

117
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,000
You're not okay.

118
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,279
You're eating barbecue with a teddy bear.

119
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,720
Are you sure you're okay? Are you?

120
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm hungry.

121
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,320
And I'm sad.

122
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
I saw her holding the teddy bear

123
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,159
and tripping over

124
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
in front of the restaurant,

125
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
so I called you.

126
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,919
Prib.

127
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,600
What are you going to do
with that teddy bear?

128
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to donate it.

129
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Nut doesn't want it.

130
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,519
But I'm sure somebody
will want it one day.

131
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,320
All right then.

132
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,919
Cheer up. Somebody will want you
one day too.

133
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,559
Right?

134
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm beautiful, kind, and cute.

135
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,000
Plus, I've got time for him.

136
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,279
How can nobody want me?

137
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,320
Why am I so unlucky?

138
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,679
I always end up in the friend zone.

139
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,119
Prib, your soulmate might be a foreigner.

140
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,440
A foreign creature from another world.

141
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,079
Being his friend

142
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,880
is better than being a stranger.

143
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,839
That's right.

144
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,839
You are better off as his friend.

145
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,440
The bond will last longer.

146
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,799
Are you comforting me or rubbing it in?

147
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm comforting you.

148
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,279
I love you.

149
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,559
Eat this.

150
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,720
It will keep you quiet.

151
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,880
It's hot.

152
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,599
I love you too, mister.

153
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,799
Wait, what?

154
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,759
What a sneaky little bastard.

155
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
Stop.

156
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,240
You can drink,

157
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,960
but don't throw up like last time.

158
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,200
What are you doing, Nut?

159
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,640
Well…

160
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,960
I'm recording this moment like you do.

161
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,119
You're recording it?

162
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,480
Then I should be in it too.

163
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,839
Thank you

164
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,559
for throwing me a birthday party.

165
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,559
Do you like it?

166
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes.

167
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,599
Do you like the party

168
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,519
or me?

169
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,559
What a cheap shot.

170
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,599
Well…

171
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,519
I like both of them.

172
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,160
What about the teddy bear?

173
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,359
Did you not like it?

174
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
No.

175
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
It kind of freaked me out.

176
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,319
How could they look so similar?

177
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,359
But the truth is

178
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,559
their colors,

179
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,000
eyes,

180
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,559
and smells were different.

181
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,279
And most importantly,

182
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,400
it wasn't as warm to hug.

183
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,079
That's why you didn't like it.

184
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,680
Yes.

185
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,839
Despite their similarities,

186
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,039
the teddy bear is irreplaceable.

187
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
What if

188
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,640
it's me?

189
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,799
Am I good enough
to replace your teddy bear?

190
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,079
You are you.

191
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,119
You can't replace anyone.

192
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,319
When you asked me what I wanted

193
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,480
for my birthday

194
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,799
and I said nothing,

195
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,799
that's because

196
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,480
I already have you.

197
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,079
Stay by my side…

198
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,599
and don't go anywhere.

199
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,079
What did you do, Tofu?

200
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,680
It's how adults make promises.

201
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,319
I promise

202
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
to be with you forever.

203
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,559
In that case…

204
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,359
please stay

205
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
with me tonight.

206
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,759
What a wonderful night.

207
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,920
I've become Nut's special someone.

208
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,000
And I'm going back to Nut's room.

209
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,119
Hey.

210
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,039
You weren't sleeping.

211
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,039
I was curious to see

212
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,319
what you were going to do.

213
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,079
Why didn't you wake me up?

214
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,359
Well…

215
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
I wanted to stay like this.

216
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,519
Thank you

217
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
for coming here.

218
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,599
Thank you for caring about me.

219
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,480
Thank you for everything.

220
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,759
Without you,

221
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm not sure
if I would have gotten through it.

222
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,039
Your mom said

223
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,559
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

224
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,640
It's about putting your heart into it.

225
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,519
My heart is all yours.

226
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,240
Yes, I know.

227
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,160
I wish we could stay this way forever.

228
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,559
You smell nice.

229
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,319
So does your hair.

230
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,799
But I think

231
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,920
you stink.

232
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,640
It's your hair.

233
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Smell it.

234
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,119
It doesn't stink.

235
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,279
It stinks.

236
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,599
It doesn't.

237
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,039
Trust me. It stinks.

238
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,960
Go take a shower.

239
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,440
I'll wash your hair for you.

240
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,559
Kuenchai.

241
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Kuenchai.

242
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,440
Kuenchai, come eat.

243
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,799
I'm leaving, Mom.

244
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,440
Okay.

245
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,599
I'm leaving.

246
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
Did you forget something?

247
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,839
What?

248
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,079
Your lunchbox.

249
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,279
Thank you.

250
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,559
I'll get going then.

251
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,759
I realized

252
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
why people were yearning for love.

253
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,720
Love is a wonderful thing.

254
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,960
It's so wonderful that I don't want
to be a teddy bear again.

255
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,680
Prib, are you heartbroken again?

256
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,440
You're drawing men.

257
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,519
Yes, I'm permanently heartbroken.

258
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,240
Did you confess your feelings to that guy?

259
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,160
Yes, we talked it out.

260
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,279
Are you sad?

261
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:34,640
It's no use being sad.

262
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
I better put my time into something else.

263
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,759
I have an important mission.

264
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,480
What are you talking about?

265
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm going to find that person for Tarn.

266
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,839
Perhaps,

267
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,599
I was born for this.

268
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,440
You…

269
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,319
Kuenchai, come and eat.

270
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,440
You already gave him his food.

271
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,880
Did I?

272
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,279
When?

273
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,799
What's wrong, Tofu?

274
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,559
You were happy this morning.

275
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,759
It's Mrs. Na.

276
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,599
Lately,

277
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,359
she has been forgetful.

278
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,519
She forgot that she had fed Kuenchai
this morning.

279
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,440
And this book,

280
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,880
she has been reading the same page.

281
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,839
Maybe it's…

282
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,319
The medicine makes her…

283
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,279
Is everyone okay?

284
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,200
Well…

285
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,119
I'm sorry.

286
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,839
I guess I didn't get enough sleep.

287
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,119
I was going to say

288
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,359
maybe it's a side effect of her medicine.

289
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,400
The medicine makes her drowsy.

290
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,319
I guess so.

291
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,519
By the way,

292
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,200
are you sure you're okay?

293
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,880
I don't know.

294
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,039
I've been feeling sleepy.

295
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,720
I'm sleepy all the time.

296
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Sleepy?

297
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,440
Ms. Sofa.

298
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
Ms. Sofa.

299
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,559
Mr. Right Slipper.

300
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,359
Can you hear me?

301
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,039
Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper fell asleep

302
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,720
since the big fight.

303
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,559
I thought they were taking a nap.

304
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,880
But it has been too long.

305
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,279
We don't usually fall asleep
for more than two days

306
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,200
except…

307
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,200
Except what?

308
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,680
Except when we don't ever wake up again.

309
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,920
Don't wake up again?

310
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,359
Have there been pieces of furniture
that fell asleep

311
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,720
and not woken up again?

312
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Of course.

313
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,279
Mr. Sib's chair.

314
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,559
It happened after he died.

315
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,119
Mrs. Na and Nut barely spoke.

316
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,799
The house was quiet,

317
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,119
so were the pieces of furniture in it.

318
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,240
Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper

319
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,839
might not wake up again.

320
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,920
So, it might happen to me too, right?

321
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,519
What should I do?

322
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,039
Do you want to know
where I got the teddy bear?

323
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,199
Yes.

324
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,119
It's really important to me.

325
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,559
How did you get it?

326
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,400
I drew a sketch of the teddy bear
as you suggested

327
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
and posted it on Instagram.

328
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,760
After that, someone messaged me
saying she saw it at a store.

329
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,400
She sent me a photo
and I saw that it looked really similar.

330
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,519
So I reached out to the store's owner.

331
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,639
She said it was still available.

332
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,840
She gave me a special discount
because it was old.

333
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,840
I took the offer without even thinking.

334
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,159
After I transferred the money,
she shipped it.

335
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,559
By the way,

336
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,159
what's the name

337
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,360
of the store?

338
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,559
It's called "Beloved".

339
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,440
It's in an old mall near Nut's house.

340
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,079
That's right.

341
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,119
I was hiding from Nut here.

342
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
This is why everything feels
very familiar,

343
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,719
especially

344
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,280
this store.

345
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,960
Have I reached a dead end?

346
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
I must have come from this store,

347
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,840
just like the teddy bear Prib bought.

348
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
But…

349
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,599
It can't end like this.

350
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,800
BELOVED

351
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,840
The store is closed.

352
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,719
Yes, I heard.

353
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:17,000
I just called the owner.

354
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,840
She said she got two teddy bears
at the same time.

355
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,639
She sold one of them a long time ago.

356
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,519
I bought the last one.

357
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,199
Do you want one?

358
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,519
No.

359
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,000
Did she say

360
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,880
who bought the first one?

361
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,039
Yes.

362
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,679
She said it was a tall male student.

363
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Could it be the same teddy bear Nut lost?

364
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Yes.

365
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,400
It's the same one.

366
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,360
If I can't find that person,

367
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,719
I might fall asleep like Mr. Sib's chair,

368
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,039
Mr. Right Slipper,

369
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,360
and Ms. Sofa.

370
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
What should I do?

371
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,559
I don't want to leave Nut.

372
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,000
Here, boss.

373
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,880
It's lacking something.

374
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
I can't think of it.

375
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,079
It's at the tip of my tongue.

376
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,000
Is it character?

377
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes, it's lacking character.

378
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,880
We want to set up a scene like this.

379
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,039
This location won't do.

380
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,679
Are there other options?

381
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,199
Yes, there are two more.

382
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,119
Show me.

383
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,159
Hold on. Go back to the second last photo.

384
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,159
Okay.

385
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Yes.

386
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
I like it.

387
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,920
It's perfect for the storyline.

388
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,159
Will this place do, Nut?

389
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,559
Nut.

390
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,159
It's perfect for the script.

391
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,280
What do you think?

392
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,000
Nut!

393
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,440
Yes.

394
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,440
I asked, what do you think?

395
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,320
If everyone thinks it's a good location,

396
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,480
we can go with it.

397
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,719
Okay, contact the place
and check the price.

398
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,559
I just got off work.

399
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,639
Let's go out.

400
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,199
What's wrong?

401
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,360
Where are you now?

402
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,199
What?

403
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,239
Where?

404
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,320
What are you doing here?

405
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,760
I came to buy something for your mom,

406
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,920
then I realized that we had chased
each other here before.

407
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,320
Let's go somewhere else.

408
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
Nut.

409
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,440
Why didn't you

410
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,840
follow me inside back then?

411
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,880
Did you dislike something inside?

412
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,960
Why are you asking me that now?

413
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,639
Or were you

414
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,199
scared of something?

415
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,760
No.

416
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,599
Get in the car.

417
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,440
If Nut's special someone
bought the bear from that store,

418
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,519
why was Nut hesitant to go inside?

419
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:58,199
Did something happen in there?

420
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,320
Why didn't you

421
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,960
follow me inside back then?

422
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,719
Did you dislike something inside?

423
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:13,519
Or were you

424
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,719
scared of something?

425
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,000
Nut.

426
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,719
Nut, hurry up
or we will miss the trailers.

427
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:10,039
Wait a second.

428
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,559
Let me use the toilet first.

429
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,280
Fine.

430
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:33,679
It's cute.

431
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,760
It's as warm as a person.

432
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,599
It's warmer to hug a person.

433
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,360
Don't you need the toilet?

434
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,639
The movie is starting.

435
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,840
Let's go.

436
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,239
That scene really impressed me.

437
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,159
-Which scene?
-Take a guess.

438
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:27,360
-The book opening scene?
-Yes.

439
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,639
When the book was opened

440
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:30,960
and the music started,

441
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,000
I almost cried.

442
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:35,679
-Were you sucked in?
-Of course.

443
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,760
That person had a crush
on the other person for a long time

444
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,320
-but they had to say goodbye.
-Nut!

445
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:01,239
Nut.

446
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,760
You're right.

447
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,599
A lot of things happened there.

448
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,760
My best and worst memories

449
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,119
happened there at one point in my life.

450
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,519
I'll tell you about it

451
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,519
when I'm ready.

452
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,400
You went there with him,

453
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,679
didn't you?

454
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,119
Yes.

455
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,400
Are you jealous?

456
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,159
Can I be jealous?

457
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,480
You don't need my permission

458
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:54,119
to be jealous.

459
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,039
You shouldn't be jealous.

460
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,039
Right now,

461
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,480
you are my present.

462
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,599
Let's go.

463
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,400
Although Nut hasn't completely opened
his heart to me,

464
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:23,639
I will keep waiting.

465
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,760
Yes, Mom.

466
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,920
What?

467
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:39,840
We've run out of it again?

468
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,199
All right, Mom.

469
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:46,920
Let's go.

470
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,079
These three, please.

471
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,840
Didn't I just buy some last week?

472
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,599
Why have we run out?

473
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,920
Your mom has been feeding Kuenchai
a lot more often.

474
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,480
Some days she feeds him several times.

475
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,280
Nut.

476
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,880
Please send your mother my regards.

477
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,400
-It has been a while.
-I will.

478
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,320
Oh, my…

479
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
You're shopping together as a couple.

480
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,679
How adorable.

481
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,360
Who?

482
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,760
You and Tofu.

483
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,719
I mean, who asked you?

484
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,079
Come on, don't be shy. I understand.

485
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:54,679
The world has changed now.

486
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,280
You haven't changed one bit.

487
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,639
You're as nosy as always.

488
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,239
We aren't strangers.

489
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,000
You're like a nephew to me.

490
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:07,239
I need to watch over you
on your mom's behalf.

491
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,599
Since your mother is mentally unstable,

492
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:13,440
she doesn't have enough time.

493
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,920
By the way,

494
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,159
you've been living in that house
for months now.

495
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,880
When are you going to come out?

496
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,960
Does she know the status

497
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,800
Tofu is staying there as?

498
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,360
Her son-in-law or daughter-in-law?

499
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,400
His status in my house
does not concern you.

500
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,800
Don't walk away.
You can't even admit you are gay.

501
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,360
You're running away from the truth
just like your mom.

502
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,039
How are you involved with what happened

503
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,599
to Nut and his mother?

504
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,239
Don't pretend like you don't know.

505
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,280
I do know.

506
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,639
You're nosy because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

507
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,199
Why would I be jealous?

508
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,480
Well, everybody loves her.

509
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,239
This includes Mr. Saen too.

510
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,000
Am I wrong?

511
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:07,960
Is it because

512
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:09,920
you are unhappy?

513
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,960
You want other people to be unhappy too.

514
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,079
Am I right?

515
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,519
Tofu.

516
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:20,639
Let's go home.

517
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,280
Is the food ready?

518
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,639
Wait, Nut.

519
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,760
Why can't we hold hands?

520
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,880
We were holding hands before we saw Jan.

521
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,920
Nut.

522
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,480
Nut.

523
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,280
I hate being under the spotlight.

524
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,360
I don't want everybody talking.

525
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,119
You saw

526
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,440
what Jan could do just by herself.

527
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,480
What's wrong

528
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,440
with us holding hands,

529
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,519
living together,

530
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:10,519
and liking each other?

531
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,320
Is it illegal

532
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,199
for two men

533
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,639
to fall in love?

534
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,119
No.

535
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,199
If it's not illegal,

536
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,320
who is our love bothering?

537
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,199
Men are still human.

538
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:36,679
It's not wrong to fall in love.

539
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,920
I want to know why too.

540
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,360
I'm sorry

541
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,159
for hurting your feelings.

542
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,239
It wasn't your fault.

543
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,360
Don't blame yourself.

544
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,800
I know how you feel.

545
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:48,760
You're afraid to hurt your mom's feelings
if she finds out about us.

546
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:01,960
Nut.

547
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:05,840
It's not wrong to love somebody.

548
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,039
Love isn't at fault here.

549
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,559
You didn't do anything wrong.

550
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,280
I'm going to hold your hand like this…

551
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,960
until you stop brushing it off…

552
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,280
and until you feel comfortable
holding mine.

553
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,760
No matter what happens,

554
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,559
don't let go of my hand.

555
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,199
I'll never let go of your hand.

556
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,400
I promise.

557
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,119
Are you doing laundry?

558
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,159
Yes.

559
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,159
Do you know how?

560
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:19,119
Let me help you.

561
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,119
It's okay.

562
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:22,079
I can do it.

563
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:37,679
Kuenchai.

564
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:46,199
Kuenchai.

565
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,960
I'll help you.

566
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:01,239
It's okay.

567
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,159
It's not okay.

568
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,039
I'm partly the reason

569
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:07,679
you're doing laundry.

570
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,599
I can't let you do it alone.

571
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,639
We used it together,

572
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:16,840
so let's wash it together.

573
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:30,960
Press the button.

574
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,000
You don't even know how to do laundry.

575
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,840
I'm sorry.

576
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,119
-You're sorry?
-Nut.

577
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,039
-Nut.
-Tofu.

578
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,320
Tofu.

579
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,719
I have to shower again.

580
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,960
Ask Kuenchai who started the fight.

581
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:51,920
-Yes, Juea.
-I need your advice.

582
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,199
Don't ask questions. Come now.

583
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,840
All right.

584
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:00,920
I'm going to the office.

585
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,599
Okay.

586
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,199
Nut is so cute.

587
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,960
Mr. Rocking Chair.

588
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Ms. Sofa.

589
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,679
Ms. Phone.

590
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,400
Are you still sleeping?

591
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,800
I'm so sleepy.

592
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,840
I don't want to get up.

593
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,760
Ms. Phone.

594
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,480
Ms. Phone.

595
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,280
What are you doing?

596
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,239
It went off.

597
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,760
I was going to charge it.

598
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,239
I've been trying to charge it
since yesterday, but it won't work.

599
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,440
I guess it's broken.

600
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,159
Kuenchai.

601
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,199
He's digging again.

602
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,519
Is it possible

603
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,920
that Ms. Phone fell asleep too?

604
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:12,760
What about me?

605
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,920
How much time do I have left?

606
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,599
Kids are so rude these days.

607
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:30,559
Oh, my…

608
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:32,960
There must be a thunderstorm.

609
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,000
My niece is working early in the morn…

610
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,239
You're not working.

611
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,400
What are you looking at?

612
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,719
Doesn't the guy with the book

613
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,119
seem familiar to you?

614
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:51,159
No.

615
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:53,199
Look carefully.

616
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,800
Why do his nails, joints, and finger hair

617
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,280
look familiar to me?

618
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:02,360
These fingers definitely belong
to a handsome person.

619
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,679
How are the fingers of a handsome man
and an ugly man different?

620
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,599
Well…

621
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:09,480
This means

622
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,400
I am

623
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,880
really damn handsome.

624
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,000
Seriously?

625
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:18,280
They are so different.

626
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,039
Your fingers

627
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,239
-are so tanned.
-Prib.

628
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,159
Hey.

629
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Why is he covering his face with a book?

630
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,840
I don't know.

631
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,000
If I run into him,

632
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,880
I'll ask him why he's trying
to hide his face.

633
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,800
Instead of looking at his fingers,

634
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,039
why don't you ask
his friends or relatives?

635
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,519
Is it possible that he's an orphan?

636
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,039
He's an orphan with relatives.

637
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,719
I see.

638
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,559
That's right.

639
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:54,599
I'll ask his relatives.

640
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:56,440
Please move.

641
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,760
Aren't you going to work?

642
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:00,679
Gosh.

643
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:03,119
-Nut.
-Juea, hello.

644
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,119
Hello.

645
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,360
Can you give me
the location of the school?

646
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,480
And the mall

647
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,039
didn't give us their permission.

648
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:13,559
-Okay.
-Let's talk inside. Come on.

649
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,480
Wait.

650
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:19,840
-Juea.
-Hold on.

651
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,159
What are you doing?

652
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,119
All men's hands look the same.
I shouldn't suspect anything.

653
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:35,840
Come on, Nut.

654
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,440
Okay, Prib. I'll send it to you.

655
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:42,119
But I don't know how much
he knows about Tatarn.

656
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,199
As far as I know,
their relationship wasn't going well.

657
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,039
It's okay.

658
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,159
It's worth a shot.

659
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,360
Thank you, Mr. Anik.

660
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,039
You're welcome.

661
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,480
Let's go, Dad.

662
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,719
Let's go.

663
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,880
Where are we going?

664
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,360
I've booked us a table.

665
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,119
-Let's go.
-Yes.

666
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:10,800
Yes, Lieutenant Kong.

667
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,199
What?

668
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,480
You can go to work.

669
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:22,920
Don't worry about me.

670
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,199
I can go with a friend.

671
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,320
We can go next time.

672
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,199
I'm coming back next week.

673
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,360
Be honest with me.

674
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:36,840
Are you so involved in this case

675
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,679
because it's Neung's friend?

676
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:21,159
Mister.

677
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:22,079
Where are you?

678
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:24,239
I'm at the hospital.

679
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,840
What happened?

680
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,320
I'm fine.

681
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,679
Song.

682
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,719
Song.

683
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,639
Song.

684
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,599
Why are you at the hospital then?

685
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:47,840
I was selling an ad nearby,
so I came to visit my mom.

686
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,000
Is something wrong?

687
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,440
What's with you?

688
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
I prepared you very well.

689
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:02,199
How did this happen?

690
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,280
What did you say to your dad?

691
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,239
He ditched me for work

692
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,559
before I could say anything.

693
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:12,840
Don't be such a crybaby.

694
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,280
Your dad is a cop.

695
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,400
He had an urgent case.

696
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,159
You've been his son for 18 years.

697
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:20,880
You should get it by now.

698
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,840
I wouldn't mind
if he went to work on another case.

699
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,360
But the victim

700
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,920
is Neung's friend.

701
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:31,880
Neung always comes first for him.

702
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:35,719
That's crazy.

703
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,719
You think too much.

704
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:38,960
It's true.

705
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,599
Neung was his favorite

706
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:42,639
ever since I was a baby.

707
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,840
He was handsome, smart, athletic,

708
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,440
into music, popular,
and good at everything.

709
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,119
When Neung died,

710
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,400
Dad's hope died along with him.

711
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,760
I'm just someone

712
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,840
he neglects.

713
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,440
No matter how hard I try,

714
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,159
I can only be Neung's shadow.

715
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,480
All parents

716
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,440
love their children the same way.

717
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,360
That's not true.

718
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,239
Maybe they love their children equally,

719
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,519
but not in the same way.

720
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,960
I'm sorry for eavesdropping.

721
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,440
The conversation happens
to be about family,

722
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:49,559
so I'm hoping to give you
my opinion as a mother.

723
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,559
Parents can't love
their children the same way

724
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,320
because every child is different.

725
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,679
Some children who can take good care
of themselves

726
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,119
may be neglected by their parents.

727
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,000
But some children
who can't take care of themselves

728
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,599
require more attention from the parents.

729
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,440
Because parents treat them differently,

730
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,639
children tend to think that parents
love their children unequally.

731
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:22,400
The truth is

732
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,000
they just love and care about
their children in different ways.

733
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,239
That's right.

734
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,639
I express my love

735
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,000
towards my parents differently.

736
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,760
But I love both of them.

737
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:39,039
I talk to each of them

738
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,039
about certain things.

739
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:47,920
The fact that your father
gives you freedom

740
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,280
doesn't mean he doesn't love
or care about you.

741
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:55,159
It's because he trusts you.

742
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,360
Your father has stuff he needs to work on,

743
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:04,760
but you do too.

744
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,639
You always

745
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:14,320
compare yourself to your brother.

746
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,400
You want to be as good as him,

747
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,840
so your dad would praise you.

748
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,159
You don't need to be like anyone.

749
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:25,960
Just be yourself.

750
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,320
You are second to none.

751
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,440
Thank you

752
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,480
for reminding me.

753
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,320
You're welcome.

754
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,280
Can I

755
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,440
hug you?

756
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,039
I don't have a mother to hug.

757
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:50,519
Of course.

758
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:51,840
Gen's friends

759
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,119
are like my own children.

760
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,320
That's enough.

761
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,440
You sneaky punk.

762
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,920
He's being protective of me.

763
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,279
Mom, are you not coming home with me?

764
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,199
-I'm not going back to the office.
-I have to meet two more patients.

765
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,800
You can go home first.

766
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:27,439
I'll see you at home.

767
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,800
I need to check on my patients.

768
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,800
Go home safely, both of you. See you.

769
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,880
Mister, come have dinner with me.

770
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,159
I've booked a table.

771
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,039
Don't you have any friends

772
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:50,399
other than me?

773
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,359
You are not my friend.

774
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:57,680
Please, come on. Have dinner with me.

775
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,760
Please.

776
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,840
Where is it?

777
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,319
Wait, mister.

778
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,199
Ms. Phone has fallen asleep
along with Ms. Sofa and Mr. Right Slipper.

779
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Mr. Rocking Chair looks sleepy too.

780
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,159
Am I going to be next?

781
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,079
Maybe

782
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:32,239
only the furniture downstairs
is falling asleep.

783
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,960
The rest of us upstairs are fine.

784
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,920
But Mr. Right Slipper
followed Mrs. Na around the house.

785
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,960
He still fell asleep.

786
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:43,199
Teddy goes around the house too,

787
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,760
so he might fall asleep next.

788
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,840
We don't know why the furniture
is falling asleep.

789
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,560
And you don't know how you became a human.

790
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:54,680
I don't know if those two things
are related,

791
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,840
but you might be the only one
who can find the answer.

792
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,119
If you discover where you came from,

793
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:06,840
you might find a way to stay awake,
unlike the others.

794
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,840
Did you find any more clues yesterday?

795
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,439
Yes.

796
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,960
Yesterday, Prib said…

797
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,760
She said it was a tall male student.

798
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:21,039
After he bought me,

799
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,159
he put a bandana on me.

800
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,680
Excuse me.

801
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,680
I'll take these two items

802
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,319
and please swap the bow
for this pink bandana.

803
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,319
Don't you like the bow?

804
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:36,520
I want it to be special.

805
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,680
Plus, he likes the color pink.

806
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,399
-All right.
-Thank you.

807
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,560
You hid the teddy's scarf
in my room, didn't you?

808
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,760
Didn't you?

809
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,960
I didn't.

810
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,640
It had fallen, so I put it away.

811
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,880
Don't lie!

812
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:57,880
You were going through my personal stuff!

813
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,520
What do you want?

814
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:01,920
The scarf. The book.

815
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,479
Still think it's unrelated?

816
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:08,359
Could it be…

817
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,520
BE WITH YOU

818
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,079
BE WITH YOU

819
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,359
You're home early.

820
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:40,000
Yes.

821
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:42,119
I talked to Juea and had a meeting.

822
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:44,279
I have to write more scenes.

823
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:46,119
I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight.

824
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,600
He's writing about his life.

825
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,159
Even if it's a little sad,

826
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,079
that's okay,

827
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:00,479
because I'll add sweetness to his life,

828
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,680
There might be clues

829
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:07,239
about that man in the screenplay.

830
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,279
Then you should get writing.

831
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,039
What's with you?

832
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,359
You usually tell me to rest.

833
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,520
Well,

834
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,319
finish it so you can rest.

835
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,279
Keep on writing.

836
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:22,720
I'll give you a massage.

837
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:26,560
You're being weird today.

838
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,439
I might be weird,

839
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,680
but I look cute every day.

840
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,119
SCENE 14A. BASKETBALL CLUB.
HIGH SCHOOL. DAYTIME (CONTINUED).

841
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:11,159
The character Kawee

842
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,840
is sensitive,

843
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,960
not talkative,

844
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:15,920
introverted,

845
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,520
and not athletic.

846
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,239
That must be Nut.

847
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:41,239
Song

848
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:42,560
plays Nont,

849
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,960
the popular basketball player
whom Nut had a crush on.

850
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:47,319
He didn't like Nut back.

851
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,880
He's probably

852
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,199
Neung,

853
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,199
Song's brother.

854
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,079
The character Tonnam

855
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:53,039
is Nont's best friend.

856
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,159
Wow, that's beautiful.

857
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,039
Thank you.

858
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,119
Tonnam

859
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,800
is a young and confident thinker

860
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,560
who loves to read

861
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,600
and is obsessed with art.

862
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,840
There's only one moon.

863
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Right?

864
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:23,239
How about I draw another moon?

865
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,680
If you draw another moon,

866
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:29,760
the first moon will lose its meaning.

867
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,439
TONNAM

868
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,600
Tarn.

869
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,720
Why would you do that?

870
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,720
Why?

871
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,640
-Tarn.
-It's funny.

872
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,520
That hurts.

873
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,399
-My ear hurts.
-Did your ear explode?

874
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,159
This "T" guy

875
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,800
is definitely portrayed by Tonnam.

876
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,199
I need to find the person
the character Tonnam is based on.

877
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,680
BASKETBALL TEAM BATCH 128

878
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:48,680
What are you doing?

879
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:01,039
You…

880
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,319
Ma'am.

881
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:09,920
Ma'am.

882
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:11,800
Are you okay?

883
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,560
Ma'am.

884
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,600
Anont.

885
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,319
Are you still wandering here?

886
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,319
You should go to the light.

887
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:34,279
I'll make merit for you.

888
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,159
-Ma'am, I'm human.
-No…

889
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:43,760
You've been dead for ten years.

890
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,720
Don't you know?

891
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,880
Sathu.

892
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,239
Ma'am, my name is Tofu, not Anont.

893
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:55,079
I'm here to shoot the series.

894
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,079
Really?

895
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,000
Are you really human?

896
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:08,239
Yes.

897
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:14,800
My heart almost stopped.

898
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,840
Listen.

899
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:18,760
Peeranut told me

900
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,640
that the script
is based on his experience.

901
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,239
I never thought

902
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:29,720
he would find an actor
who looked so similar to his senior.

903
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,039
Do you know Nut?

904
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Of course.

905
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,439
Look.

906
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,640
I even know his parents,

907
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,520
let alone him.

908
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,520
I was afraid

909
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
his puppy love was going to stop him
from graduating.

910
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,319
Why? What happened?

911
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,479
He got a boyfriend.

912
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,279
Luckily, I stopped him in time.

913
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:59,119
Do you know his boyfriend?

914
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,960
Look.

915
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:04,159
I took care of Peeranut
as if he was my own son.

916
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,720
-What was his name?
-I…

917
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,680
He was Anont's best friend.

918
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,520
-His name was--
-Tofu.

919
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,279
You're here.

920
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,039
My goodness.

921
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,399
You interrupted our conversation.

922
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:23,359
Were you afraid I would say something?

923
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:25,199
No.

924
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:28,159
I just hate it when people talk
behind my back,

925
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,520
the way they used to.

926
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,079
Listen.

927
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:34,760
If that's your way
of calling me a busybody,

928
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,159
you should know that I meant well.

929
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,520
Are you sure

930
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,359
it wasn't for your own benefit?

931
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,000
Peeranut.

932
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,079
If you think badly of my goodwill,

933
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,159
I want you to think again.

934
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,960
You should realize
that you grew up with a good life

935
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,680
because I pulled you back on track.

936
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:00,439
Yes.

937
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:03,039
You are partly the reason

938
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,119
my life is like this.

939
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:08,680
Thank you so much.

940
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,840
Let's go, Tofu.

941
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,600
Nut.

942
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:24,600
Why did you go back to the club?

943
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,159
I forgot my phone.

944
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,239
What did she say to you?

945
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,199
Nothing much.

946
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:34,119
She asked why I look like Neung.

947
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:41,039
Don't listen

948
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:42,520
to anything she says.

949
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:47,520
She's a dictator

950
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,039
who thinks she's always right.

951
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:57,079
Go back to the shoot first.

952
01:22:57,159 --> 01:22:58,520
I'm going to the toilet.

953
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:15,520
It's okay. I'll ask Song myself.

954
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,279
Sir.

955
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,319
Song told me
he was shooting his series here.

956
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,279
Hey.

957
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:30,479
Can I ask you something?

958
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:34,039
Has Song complained
or come to you for advice?

959
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:38,560
No.

960
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:41,000
Song is a talented guy.

961
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:43,079
He's my hero.

962
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:46,239
If someone were to ask for advice,
it would be me.

963
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,680
Song used to call Neung his hero.

964
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:53,439
Today, someone who looks like Neung
is calling Song a hero.

965
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,680
It's a little weird to me.

966
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:59,159
But Song is really my hero.

967
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:01,720
Think about it.

968
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,399
How can someone be handsome,

969
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:04,439
hardworking,

970
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,119
smart,

971
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:07,720
talented,

972
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,880
good at basketball,

973
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:10,760
and good at riding a bike?

974
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,239
He's good at everything.

975
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:14,439
Is that so?

976
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,239
You might not realize how talented Song is

977
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,159
because you're busy
thinking about your dead child.

978
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:27,640
Maybe you're neglecting
the child you have left.

979
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:34,600
What part of your life
don't I take an interest in?

980
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:36,520
There's a lot.

981
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,640
You don't remember the food I like.

982
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,079
You don't even remember my birthday.

983
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,800
I wasn't the one who gave birth to you.

984
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,079
But you always remember Neung's birthday.

985
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,600
Even after he passed away,
you still remember.

986
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,840
Song never told me anything.

987
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,359
He's a strong person.

988
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,119
But every strong person

989
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,159
can get weak sometimes.

990
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,079
I'm a terrible father.

991
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,319
No.

992
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:18,359
No one's perfect.

993
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,279
And it's not wrong

994
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,800
to mourn and miss your dead child.

995
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,880
However, you can't neglect
the child you have left.

996
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,359
To be forgotten while you are still alive

997
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:38,000
hurts more than being separated by death.

998
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:45,960
Thank you.

999
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Study hard and take care of the club.

1000
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:06,119
Put this on me.

1001
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,600
Now, we have one each.

1002
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,840
That's it for today.

1003
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:41,159
-Thank you so much.
-The shoot is over.

1004
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,520
I said, the shoot is over.
Girls, the shoot is over.

1005
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,960
Congratulations.

1006
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:57,640
The shoot will be done soon.

1007
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,520
Does this mean I won't see you anymore?

1008
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,319
Yes.

1009
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:04,399
We're going separate ways.

1010
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:07,960
Can I live at your house then?

1011
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,359
My dad will ask for your hand.

1012
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:13,960
Jeez, as soon as your stress goes away,
you're here to annoy me.

1013
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,039
Have you talked to him?

1014
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,920
Not yet.

1015
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:23,439
What are you waiting for?

1016
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,760
Shall I talk to him?

1017
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,239
How will you introduce yourself to him?

1018
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,039
Well…

1019
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,159
I'll say I'm a senior who pities you.

1020
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,359
Have you heard of the phrase

1021
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,760
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

1022
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:47,439
No.

1023
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,079
I've only heard of sympathy.

1024
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:02,399
I wasn't expecting you.

1025
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,439
I came to support you.

1026
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,800
You've invited me many times,
but I never came.

1027
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,720
You didn't tell me

1028
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,359
it was a love story.

1029
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,079
You don't mind, do you?

1030
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,960
Of course not.

1031
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:24,239
It's just acting.

1032
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:27,720
You're not really gay.

1033
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:31,720
Are you?

1034
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:37,159
Song.

1035
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,560
I'm sorry.

1036
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,159
I keep breaking my promises.

1037
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,159
I flew here as soon as I finished working.

1038
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:50,359
Dad, don't worry.

1039
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,840
I know you are busy.

1040
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,840
Song.

1041
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,439
I'm not working hard

1042
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,159
because the victim is Neung's friend.

1043
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,319
I would do the same with any case.

1044
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:10,920
I'm sorry

1045
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,119
if I hurt your feelings.

1046
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,600
In the past,

1047
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,960
I've neglected you

1048
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:25,399
because I knew you could
take care of yourself.

1049
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,319
But the truth is, deep down,

1050
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,399
you're still a puppy

1051
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:33,159
who needs his daddy, aren't you?

1052
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:45,119
I will try

1053
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:47,439
to be here for you more.

1054
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:56,920
I'm sorry.

1055
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:02,760
It's my fault
for never telling you how I feel.

1056
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,199
We are going

1057
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:12,439
to be honest with each other

1058
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:15,880
to avoid any misunderstandings
in the future.

1059
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,439
We only have each other.

1060
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:24,119
You are my life and soul.

1061
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:30,800
I love you.

1062
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,279
I love you too.

1063
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,920
Come on.

1064
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,399
Let's give them some privacy.

1065
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,720
Tofu.

1066
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,399
Go get changed.

1067
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:01,000
I'll wait in the car.

1068
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:02,239
Okay.

1069
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:10,279
Sometimes,

1070
01:31:10,359 --> 01:31:12,960
we forget that we are still breathing.

1071
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,760
But it doesn't mean

1072
01:31:16,359 --> 01:31:17,880
that breathing isn't important,

1073
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,880
does it?

1074
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,159
Do you want to be gay?

1075
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,199
Don't you want to be a man?

1076
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:33,159
Are you and Nut in love?

1077
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:35,720
Yes.

1078
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:41,000
You can hate me all you want.

1079
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,479
But I will never be who you want me to be.

1080
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,840
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you

1081
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:48,640
from dating a younger man?

1082
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:53,600
Not all younger men are the same.
Don't generalize us.

1083
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:56,239
Don't you have confidence in me

1084
01:31:57,399 --> 01:31:59,079
when I'm with you at all?

1085
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:12,720
