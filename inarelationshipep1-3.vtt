00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
After two deaths,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.240
and one of them is in Bangkok.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.400
CCSA of Bangkok has released new measures.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.920
Since declaring 3 areas in Bangkok

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.720
to be highly restricted area ...

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.240
Finally, we are at the end of the game.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.960
After I got God Slayer,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.720
let's hit their base.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.200
Shit! I'm on the ground. 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.800
Don't worry, 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.880
I'm sure my friend, Porjade will finish this game with victory.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.120
There it is! Nice!

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
Nice! Hit it! Hit!

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.840
As you can see, 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.400
I've been winning 20 rounds in a row.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.280
I'm sure I will be invited to play in professional league soon.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.240
So wicked!

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.440
That was dench.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.800
Don't forget to press like, share and follow,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.280
and most importantly,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520
please don't forget to send me some stars.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.680
I don't think that it was good. He such a noob. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.000
He always got carried by his friend.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.640
What the heck?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
He always got carried by his friend.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.640
A famous guy.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560
How dare you?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
Is he messing with me?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840
Hello. What's up?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.240
Do I know you?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.760
I don't think so. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.840
So why did you post a comment like that.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680
You made me look bad.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.720
It's true, you're such a noob.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.600
Many people agree with me.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.160
He always got carried by his friend.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.960
But it's not a right thing 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.200
to post comments on my chat like that.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.840
What do you want me to do? 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.760
Delete it? 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.720
Isn't it too late?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.440
How about this?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
Let's do a match.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.440
What match?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.640
1 vs 1 match.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.760
If I win, 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760
you have to apologise to me in my live.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.560
Bring it on!

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.320
What if I win?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.200
So, you win. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.640
Nah.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.080
The winner can demand 3 things. Anything.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.000
Okay?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.000
Alright.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200
Shit! Did I just lose?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.880
Boss Bosso said that you are in a relationship. Review now.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.840
Accept or Decilne?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.920
What the heck? Are you insane?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600
Make your face link these emojis. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.640
Do it properly.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.200
This is the best I can do.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240
So it will look like the emojis.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.600
You look like a goby. 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.960
Are you bullying me?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.120
I won't do it anymore

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.160
I'm sorry.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.320
You're such a baby.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.120
Oh, don't forget to post the clip.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.560
I said I don't want to post it.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.200
You have to.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640
The first rule is we must post a clip together everyday.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.960
Fine.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.760
I don't want to do it again.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.440
My eyes got blurry.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.560
Looking at screen got your eyes blurred,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.960
but can I get your number from looking at your face?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200
Definitely not.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.840
Ask anything about me.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.600
What is your name?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.400
How old are you? 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.040
Are your single?
I'm not single.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.040
I'm seeing someone. 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.880
Such a cutie.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.680
867 comments

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.960
Who is this guy? Don't tell me it's Boss' boyfriend.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.360
Boss is showing his boyfriend off.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.840
Very cute.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.560
Why there are so many comments?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.480
Actually, it is a good thing.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.000
I might get famous and become a TikTok star.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.120
Or should I be an influencer?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.760
What?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.160
No. No. No. No.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.960
Did you like it?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.720
Nope

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
Who told you that we are seeing each other?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.120
We are nothing.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.360
You are making me sad.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.640
Whatever.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.720
Just say your last demand, quickly,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.320
so I can stop talking to you.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.720
Why are you so mean?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.920
I don't want to this since the beginning, do I?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.840
Another thing is I'm going to ...

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.000
wash my clothes.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.400
What? Who wash his clothes at this time?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.720
I have lots of clothes.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.400
Just let me know your demand later.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.440
Just a second.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.040
Accept this first, so we can go.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.600
Boss Bosso said that you are in a relationship.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.200
Accept or Decline?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.720
What the hack?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.400
Accpet or Decline?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.960
Are you insane?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.600
There's no way I'm accepting it.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.320
If you won't accept it,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.680
I guess we would have to keep talking like this.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.320
Oh, when you are sleeping,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.760
you have yo leave on our video call.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.680
According to the second rule.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360
What the heck?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.840
You awake, sleepyhead? 

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.000
Yeah

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.480
Sleeping without a shirt on,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.360
you might get pimples on your back.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.120
Little carp.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.760
What little carp?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.480
This is mackerel.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.240
Why did you call me?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.520
If it's a about that thing,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.120
there's no way I'm accepting it.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.200
Nah,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.920
I called for you to exercise with me.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.880
What exercise?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.400
Well, seeing your body today...

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.640
you shoud do some exercises.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.160
Let's go.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160
Stop showing off your body.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.840
I'm not showing off.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.240
I do this everyday.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.800
Do you exercise?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.160
Is your internet disconnected?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.680
Hello?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.160
Hello?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.040
Yeah.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.360
I'll go take a shower.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.520
Wait.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.600
Take the camera to the shower with you.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.520
You are sick!

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320
I like the moon I'm with you.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.200
What's wrong?

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.560
When will you do my last demand?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.800
Are you crazy?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.800
Seriously,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.560
Is it normal sending a relationship request to people?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.240
Also, forcing them to do a video call all the time?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.840
It's very creepy.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.280
Get up and talk to me.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.520
What's up? I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.520
Can we talk like this everyday?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.680
Why?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.280
I want to know you...

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.320
a little bit more?

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.480
Why do you want to know me?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.520
Well

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.280
I've a crush on you for so long.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.560
I'm still shaking from actually get to talk with you.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.760
Don't exaggerate.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.000
So... can we talk like this everyday?

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.560
Well.....

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.440
Okay.
