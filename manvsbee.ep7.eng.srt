Good morning, Sir.
Sorry to disturb you again.

Um, one of your neighbors reported
an unfamiliar car parked in Heath Grove,

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,640
and we've now traced it to the gang of
burglars I mentioned yesterday.

We're hoping somebody
might have seen something.

No. I haven't seen a thing.

And you're sure about that, Sir?

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,720
There are three suspects.
Two white males, one Black.

Sorry, officer. There's absolutely no one
in this house apart from me,

I can assure you.
