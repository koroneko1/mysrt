Nattanon Ratri

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.840
Who is this?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.560
Jade, I need your help.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.640
Ok, everyone...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.760
we will talk about the story of red thread,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.400
which come from China, can you still remember?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.280
It's about the god of love named,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.720
Yue Lao.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.760
Repeat after me, Yue Lao.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.440
Hello.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.520
What is it? I'm in class.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.800
I miss you.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
Hold on. Call me back during the break.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.280
Napat, did you forget to turn off your microphone?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.120
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.400
Who will do Miss Chutima's presentation?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.440
I'll do it.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.440
You won't be late again, right?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.400
Umm.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.200
Shit, this is a lot.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.560
When will I get to sleep?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.640
Hello.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.640
How are you? Tired?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080
Let me call you back.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.680
Are you okay? You can tell me.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.720
I need to do a presentation. I'm tired.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.880
You can get tired from studying,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.960
But you will get in love from learing about me.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.200
Not now, Boss.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.280
Now is a ' no'but it can be a 'maybe' in the future.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.200
Enough.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.000
What's wrong?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.680
Did I do something wrong?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.920
Don't be such a child now.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.800
It's annoying.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.320
Fine, I'll leave.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.680
I'm annoying you, right?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.960
Wait.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320
Boss.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.080
I've been having a bad day. I'm a bit stress.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.840
It's okay.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.720
How is it okay?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.600
If you did that to me,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.240
I'd be upset too.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.040
But whatever I do, you won't care anyway.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.320
I do care. I'm sorry.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.280
Umm. It's fine.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.720
I'm sorry for bothering you as well.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.360
It's okay.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.280
Can I have a hug?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
Hug? How?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.920
Raise your arms,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.080
spread them out.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.120
Boss,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.680
I..

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.000
trust you.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.400
Hey...

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800
when will you take the filter out?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.000
What if you're an A.I.?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.680
Hello, I am Mister R.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.000
You're silly. A ghost doll.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.560
PM Chadchart annouced the cancellation of the nation lockdown, starting tomorrow.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.080
Tono, have you seen the breaking news?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:07.000
That's great, shall we go to the mall tomorrow?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.520
Tomorrow?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.280
Yeah, I'm so bored staying at home.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.440
Also, I want to see you.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.800
Hello, Tono. It's me Ter.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.840
Oh, hi.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.800
Boss is a bit sick to day. He has headache and fever.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.800
I'll tell him to call you once he's better.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.200
Okay.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.920
Tono,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.080
I have something to tell you.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.120
What is it?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.400
Please stay calm.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.760
Tell me.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.720
This is Got, he is a senior of my girlfriend.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.520
It's such a small world.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.120
I asked him, whether he knows Boss.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.720
It turns out nobody know him.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.120
Are you okay?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
No.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.800
I am not okay at all.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.400
Shit.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.600
Why did he lie to me?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.360
Why doesn't he tell me the truth?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.280
Calm down. Let's listen to his reason first.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.240
He is calling me.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.880
Let me talk to him.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.720
Tono, I'm sorry. I got headache today so I couldn't go.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.760
Can you take the filter away?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.480
I want to see your face cleary.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.200
I want to know how are you doing?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.760
I'm like this.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.200
Even when I have fever, I can still make you love me.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.640
Hurry up.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960
Stop stalling.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.240
I want to keep it on, so you will miss me.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.080
Are you being serious?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.840
Are you hiding something?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.080
Seriously, why are you lying to me?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.360
What do you want? Why are you doing this?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.480
I...

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.520
The photo that you sent, isn't you, is it?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.880
Answer me, Boss.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.920
Why did you do it?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.960
Do I look that stupid?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.320
Do I look like a moron?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.440
That's not what I think of you.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.200
All this time, I've been trusting you.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.640
I started talking with you.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.640
I agreed to your stupid demands.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.280
But you destroy my trust like this?

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.720
Why did you do it?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.800
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean too.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.640
I'm just afraid.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.960
I'm afraid that you won't like my real face.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.600
Stop making excuses.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.640
I don't believe anything you say.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.600
Were there anything real?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.440
Fuck!

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.120
Goodbye.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.760
Don't call me again.
