1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:01,302
Why do we have to be in a relationship?

2
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:02,891
Because you're the air I breathe.

3
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:04,263
Can't we be friends?

4
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,493
I want only you.

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:07,872
Can.

6
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:09,113
Give him some time.

7
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,735
If he doesn't understand,

8
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,819
it doesn't mean he has no feelings.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,181
We practiced so hard.

10
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:19,417
We practiced every day.

11
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,636
I'm right here.

12
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm always right beside you.

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,393
I like you.

14
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,488
I like you too.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,700
Get home safe, guys.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,768
It's okay that we lost this time.

17
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,196
You guys still have another chance.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,271
Let's go back.

19
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,842
You should go back too, captain.

20
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,560
You did your best today.

21
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm so proud of you.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,717
Stop it, Champ.

23
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:30,841
You'll make me cry.

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,365
Techno! Technic told me that...

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,960
Can I comfort you?

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,360
I lost, Kla.

27
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,679
I lost.

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,340
I lost.

29
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,616
Don't cry.

30
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,931
I'm right here.

31
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:37,015
I love you.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,968
That's another story.

33
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,206
I'm still mad at you.

34
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,960
Thank you for comforting me.

35
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:04,860

59
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,680
Tin.

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,237
I'm upset.

61
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,779
Do you hear me that I'm upset?

62
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,957
I know.

63
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,054
But first, here.

64
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:40,492
You should eat.

65
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm still upset.

66
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,491
You're so messy.

67
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,073
Can.

68
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,556
Enough.

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,004
I'm still sad.

70
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,171
But before that,

71
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,119
swallow the food first.

72
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,640
You told me to do my best.

73
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,270
But I still lost.

74
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,935
You came to cheer me on, but I still lost.

75
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,006
I don't want to disappoint my team.

76
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,077
Also...

77
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,471
I don't want to disappoint you.

78
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,667
You never disappoint me.

79
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,667
Tin.

80
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,674
I don't want to eat anymore.

81
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,749
I'll pay the bill and send you home.

82
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,662
I don't want to go home.

83
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:38,495
I don't want Lay to tease me.

84
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:40,837
Okay.

85
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,805
Where do you want to go?

86
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:46,418
Your house.

87
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,579
Tin.

88
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,479
What's the matter?

89
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,639
What's wrong?

90
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:22,690
Can I sleep with you tonight?

91
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,877
Well...

92
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,167
I read it.

93
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,633
Men having sex together for the first time
will be painful.

94
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:34,028
It's going to hurt so much.
The pain will make me forget.

95
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,331
Well...

96
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,607
It might help me to forget
that I lost the match today.

97
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,178
You have to help me,
or I'll have a nightmare.

98
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,605
That's totally nonsense.

99
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:47,501
Why would you say that?

100
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:53,058
You want to sleep with me
just because you want to forget?

101
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:57,040
Are you saying that
you won't sleep with me?

102
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:58,994
I won't.

103
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,248
I don't want to just have sex with you.

104
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,905
Fine. I'll sleep with someone else.

105
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,742
Fine.

106
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,673
You'll probably find
a few man around here.

107
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,447
Tin!

108
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,645
I might be stupid,
but I won't have sex with random people.

109
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:21,082
Also, I hate it when you ignore me.

110
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,008
You won't pick up my call.
You won't text me back.

111
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:24,629
You're also with other girls.

112
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:25,930
I hate it all.

113
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,271
Anyway,
if I'm going to sleep with someone,

114
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,606
it has to be you only.

115
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,653
Are you done talking?

116
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:37,700
Then let's go.

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,649
Go where?

118
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,589
Get in the car.

119
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:46,806
Come on.

120
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,808
One.

121
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:49,770
Two.

122
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,822
-Three.
-Tin!

123
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,742
Can I buy something first?

124
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:56,742
What are you going to buy?

125
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:58,757
Well...

126
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,778
Some protection.

127
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,339
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

128
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,123
Can.

129
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:19,652
Take a shower first.

130
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,529
I don't mind.

131
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:24,175
But I do.

132
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,782
-We'll be dirty anyway.
-Can.

133
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,146
I know.

134
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:31,704
Why do you have to scold me?

135
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,215
I'll take a shower now.

136
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,443
I'll clean up nicely.

137
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,529
Wait for me.

138
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,285
Auntie Klin.

139
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,543
-Yes?
-Where's Phu?

140
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:05,513
He went to his grandmother's house
with Vadee.

141
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,709
I see.

142
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,345
Have you eaten yet?

143
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,582
Do you want me to cook anything for you?

144
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,500
I ate already.

145
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,797
You should take a rest.

146
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,898
I come back home quite late these days.

147
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,218
You don't have to wait for me.

148
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:23,025
It's my duty to take care of you.

149
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:27,281
If Gonhin is still here,
he will do the same thing.

150
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:31,261
Auntie.

151
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,311
How's Gonhin doing?

152
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,160
Tul.

153
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,923
Why did you come home so late?

154
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,222
I wanted to finish all the work first.

155
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,980
I didn't notice the time.

156
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,508
Really?

157
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:48,613
I feel like you always
come back home late these days.

158
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:49,895
Well...

159
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,476
Is there something wrong
between you and Vadee?

160
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,101
Nothing's wrong.

161
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,171
I should be the one who's worried.

162
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,840
Why are you still awake at this time?

163
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,843
I'm worried that you'll get sick.

164
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,613
My dear Tul.

165
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,964
You're always such a good boy.

166
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,397
Unlike Tin.

167
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:15,932
He brought someone home today.

168
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,433
I don't know his family background at all.

169
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,358
I don't know what kind of friend he has.

170
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,697
I hope that
he won't make the same mistake again.

171
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm so lucky that I still have you.

172
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,060
I can pin my hopes on you, right?

173
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,501
Yes, mom.

174
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:38,364
You can trust me.

175
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:59,679
He's stupid. He's crazy.

176
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:01,997
But he's so cute.

177
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,630
Tin.

178
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,941
I finished taking a shower.
Can I get into bed now?

179
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,259
I'm already clean.

180
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,551
I feel cold now.

181
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:15,926
Can I?

182
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,237
Sleep with me.

183
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,020
Just sleep, right?

184
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:32,464
Don't go back on your words.

185
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:35,398
You already made a promise
that we won't just sleep.

186
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,363
You're not afraid?

187
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,714
Why would I be afraid of you?

188
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,119
You said you want to feel the pain
so you can forget, right?

189
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,502
I'll make you happy
and forget about everything else instead.

190
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,070
Then do it.

191
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:42,379
What's wrong?

192
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,213
I'm upset.

193
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,618
I know.

194
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,158
I'm upset that
I don't understand my feelings...

195
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,240
...until I saw you with another girl.

196
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,423
Tin.

197
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,779
If you sleep with me,
don't sleep with someone else.

198
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,512
I promise.

199
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,656
You'll be the only one.

200
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,804
You can trust me.

201
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,725
But that doesn't mean
you'll get what you want.

202
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,981
There's nothing going on
between that girl and me.

203
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:21,820
But...

204
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,521
...I saw you two walked arm in arm.

205
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:31,207
I chased her away after that
because she annoyed me.

206
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,245
Dude.

207
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,855
You can't do that to a girl.

208
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:36,157
You will hurt her feelings.

209
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:38,616
What do you want me to do?

210
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,238
Why didn't you talk to her nicely?

211
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:42,452
Maybe she will understand.

212
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,624
What if I did,
but she wouldn't understand anyway?

213
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,855
What if she still bothers me?

214
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,971
No, I don't want that.

215
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,132
What I did is the best way out.

216
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,377
Whatever.

217
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:08,746
I don't want to think anymore.
It gives me headaches.

218
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,402
Anyway,

219
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,363
there's nothing going on
between you two, right?

220
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,402
I'm glad...

221
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:20,336
...that you get jealous.

222
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,185
I...

223
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:31,861
Trust me.

224
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:34,629
There's only you.

225
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,743
I trust you.

226
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,653
By the way...

227
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,067
Tin.

228
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,320
Can we do it again?

229
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,339
Tin!

230
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,903
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm asking for one more time.

231
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:04,728
Why are you pretending to be sleepy?

232
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,647
Please.

233
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,539
Cheers!

234
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:25,695
Come on, guys.

235
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:27,535
Let's celebrate for our loss.

236
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:29,447
But we'll never give up.

237
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,244
My energy is back.

238
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,935
I thought
you'd be sadder than this, Techno.

239
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:43,418
Come on.

240
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,051
We didn't win this year,

241
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,257
but there's still a chance next year.

242
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,609
But you won't be here next year.

243
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,506
Stop it.

244
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,407
It's not like I'm going to die.

245
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:56,758
I'll be around here.

246
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:04,959
I might not be with you all next year,

247
00:19:06,573 --> 00:19:09,572
but you guys are still here together.

248
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:11,626
Ae.

249
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:13,512
Next year,

250
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,553
you have to win the championship.

251
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,419
It's not just you who will be happy.

252
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:24,391
A senior like me will be very happy too.

253
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:27,794
I won't let you down.

254
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,817
I'm passing on the baton to you.

255
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,052
By the way, where's Can?

256
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,554
I haven't seen him.

257
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:39,802
Don't worry.

258
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,195
Tin won't hurt him.

259
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,108
That's good to hear.

260
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:48,846
Here's to us.

261
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,152
Cheers, guys!

262
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:56,911
Take a photo for me.

263
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,081
I'm leaving soon.

264
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,659
Let's take a photo.

265
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,573
Your camera is good.

266
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,636
-Great.
-You guys can do it.

267
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,889
You'll wait to see me
become successful, right?

268
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,111
Good morning.

269
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:13,509
Good morning.

270
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:18,305
What am I doing here?

271
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,602
Go take a shower.

272
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:27,435
What's wrong?

273
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,393
Nothing's wrong.

274
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:38,330
Then go take a shower.

275
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,220
You were so sweet last night.

276
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,126
Why are you so mean now?

277
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:53,729
It's called making love.

278
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:56,194
Huh?

279
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,097
What we did last night.

280
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:00,551
It wasn't just having sex.

281
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:02,209
It's called making love.

282
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,430
You should know that.

283
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,440
What's the difference?

284
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:14,815
For me,

285
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,648
I only make love to my lover.

286
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,374
It's time to take a shower.
I'll cook something for you.

287
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:26,865
What lover?

288
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:28,421
It gives me goosebumps.

289
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:11,015
Why do I feel like
there are spiders in my stomach?

290
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,196
About last night...

291
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:20,840
Last night didn't give me goosebumps
like when he called me his lover.

292
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:31,180
Why did I bring the blanket with me?

293
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,424
I'll take a shower now.

294
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:05,442
Tin.

295
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,800
You called me lover, right?

296
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,942
I can call you a lover,

297
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,108
boyfriend,

298
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,940
or wife.

299
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,648
Anything is fine.

300
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:25,208
Dude.

301
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:26,911
Can you not call me your wife?

302
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,209
It gives me goosebumps.

303
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,207
When will you be my boyfriend?

304
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,925
I'm sorry about that day.

305
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:47,855
Let's forget about it.

306
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,812
What about this time?

307
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,327
Dude.

308
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:54,633
I'm not handsome.

309
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,825
I can see that.

310
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:58,281
I'm not rich.

311
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,907
I know that.

312
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,940
You can just nod.
You don't have to say anything.

313
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,252
One more thing. I'm stupid.

314
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,715
There's nothing that I can compare
to a prince like you.

315
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,678
You should know that...

316
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,794
...I don't care about what you just said.

317
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:19,322
If I did,

318
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,888
I wouldn't approach you
since the beginning.

319
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,787
Well, then...

320
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,388
Well, then...?

321
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:36,305
Well...

322
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,242
Be my boyfriend, my spoiled prince.

323
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,959
Be my boyfriend, Cantaloupe.

324
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:30,615
Here.

325
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:35,300
Tin.

326
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,502
I'm hungry.

327
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:38,289
Let's make a deal.

328
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:41,189
What kind of deal?

329
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,576
I don't like it when you use swear words.

330
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:46,577
I don't like it
when you call me by my full name.

331
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,201
Cantaloupe.

332
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,511
Fine. Okay.

333
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,322
Do you want me to address you as "Mister"?

334
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,768
No.

335
00:27:04,263 --> 00:27:06,172
But shit,

336
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:08,942
fuck,

337
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,740
asshole,

338
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,989
or any other rude words
that you like to say.

339
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,635
I don't like it.

340
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,814
I know.

341
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:25,388
I'm used to saying those words,

342
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:27,929
but I'll try not to say them anymore.

343
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,350
That's it. Here.

344
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:39,163
You don't like it when I swear, right?

345
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,282
How about...

346
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,742
"Mr Tin!"

347
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,361
Again.

348
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:54,111
What?

349
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,900
Don't be stupid.

350
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,843
Why can't you just say that you like it?

351
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:02,760
Mr Tin.

352
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,498
Can is hungry now. Can wants to eat.

353
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,495
Stop it.

354
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:13,709
Or I won't be able to resist myself.

355
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:20,860
I'm crazy in love with you too.

356
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:30,543
Are you crazy now after losing the match?

357
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:33,205
My lovely sister.

358
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:34,523
I miss you so much.

359
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,387
Are you drunk?

360
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:42,408
Go away. You stink.

361
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,896
I'm not drunk.

362
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:46,504
I didn't even drink.

363
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,540
I went to Tin's house.

364
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,653
Really?

365
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,387
What is it like? Tell me about it.

366
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:54,360
His TV is so big.
It's much bigger than this.

367
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,198
His bathtub is so big
that you can swim in it.

368
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,660
His bed is so soft and comfy.

369
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,567
There's a swimming pool too.
Air conditioner is on all day.

370
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,853
It's cold everywhere, unlike our house.

371
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:05,144
Also, the food!
Everything is so delicious.

372
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:07,064
You won't feel full
no matter how much you eat.

373
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,647
That sounds great.

374
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,449
Tin is amazing.

375
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:17,287
Imagine a cute boy who has a tiny body
and pink lips by his side.

376
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:20,107
It must be perfect.

377
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,959
I don't understand
how he can be your friend.

378
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,508
Tin likes me.

379
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:28,244
He just feels sorry for you.

380
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:32,271
Whatever.

381
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,271
You can ship him with whoever you like.

382
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:37,814
I'm going to take a shower and sleep.
I didn't sleep much last night.

383
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:38,884
Don't touch me!

384
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,295
Can!

385
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,502
Tell me more about Tin!

386
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,287
What was he doing last night?

387
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,831
Why does she like to ship Tin
with someone else?

388
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,591
Tin is my boyfriend.

389
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,185
I can call him my husband now.

390
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:13,423
But that word got stuck in my throat.

391
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,369
"Imagine if he has a cute boy
by his side..."

392
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,694
He's my boyfriend.

393
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:44,860
I'm serious, Can. Someone likes Tin.

394
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:49,339
If he has a cute boy with fair skin...

395
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,534
...and red lips by his side,

396
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:54,972
it must be so adorable.

397
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:02,983
Did I say something wrong?

398
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,467
I'm serious, mom.

399
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:07,475
Tin is so handsome.

400
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,582
He's like an incarnated angel.

401
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:12,470
Imagine two male angels together.

402
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,219
It must be perfect.

403
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,450
A handsome angel
should be with a pretty angel.

404
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:24,250
Not always.

405
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,590
A male angel
can be with another male angel.

406
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:35,963
But I can't imagine Can with Tin at all.

407
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:37,928
It gives me the creeps.

408
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:39,627
That's right. That's creepy.

409
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,988
Can.

410
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,301
Can I ask you a favor?

411
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,694
Can you ask Tin for me
if he's dating someone?

412
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:59,647
No. I won't ask.

413
00:32:00,328 --> 00:32:01,876
Why not? Please.

414
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:05,422
Just ask him
if he has a girlfriend or a boyfriend.

415
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,518
If he has a boyfriend,

416
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,116
it will be perfect.

417
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,720
Can!

418
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,940
Can you ask him for me
if he has a boyfriend or not?

419
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,771
Why can't he do that for me?

420
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,439
I can't figure it out!

421
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,339
What's wrong with you again?

422
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,461
Are you still upset
about losing the match?

423
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,272
Job.

424
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,593
Does a handsome guy
have to be with another handsome guy?

425
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,953
Are you crazy?

426
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,077
A handsome guy
should be with a pretty girl.

427
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:58,414
Look at me.

428
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,325
I should be with that pretty nurse.

429
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:04,292
There should be a limit to your craziness.

430
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:09,054
It's so tiring
to have such a stupid friend.

431
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:12,072
Damn you. You're talking nonsense.

432
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:13,392
I'm not talking to you anymore.

433
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,323
The exam is coming soon.

434
00:33:15,403 --> 00:33:16,828
You're still going to skip class?

435
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,922
What took you so long?

436
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:44,713
What are you doing here?

437
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,674
English program students
are already on holiday.

438
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,030
I'm here to pick up my boyfriend
for lunch.

439
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,377
You say that word so often.

440
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:58,106
"I'm here to pick up my boyfriend
for lunch."

441
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,848
Can't you say another word?

442
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,387
Well, you are my boyfriend.

443
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,299
What are you thinking?

444
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:12,468
Well, I feel like I'm your sugar baby.

445
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:15,715
Huh?

446
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:17,798
Who's sugar baby? Who's sugar daddy?

447
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:19,839
Look at you.

448
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,526
You always treat me well
like a sugar daddy.

449
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:24,973
Should I call you daddy?

450
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:27,394
Like this. Daddy.

451
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:31,403
Other couples call each other like babe,
bae, or boo.

452
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,728
Should I call you daddy?

453
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:34,068
My daddy.

454
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:39,607
Let's go.

455
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,979
To where?

456
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,372
Eat lunch.

457
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,694
See!

458
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:48,120
You're acting like a sugar daddy.

459
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:53,250
Then let's go, my sugar baby.

460
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,050
You can start
pleasing your sugar daddy now.

461
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:00,085
Daddy, wait for me!

462
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:05,867
Come on, Tin.

463
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:07,361
Don't be grumpy.

464
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,654
It won't be too long.

465
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,362
I already made an appointment with you.

466
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,083
When did you do that?

467
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,880
You came to pick me up by yourself.

468
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,909
Also, I'm not here to play football.

469
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,986
I'm here to get my comics back from Pond.

470
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,202
Come on. It'll be quick.

471
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:24,842
I'll let you treat me a meal in return.

472
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,075
By the way.

473
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,669
My sister, Lay...

474
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:34,926
She likes to ship you
with other handsome guys.

475
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:37,599
So what?

476
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,889
I don't understand.

477
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:42,769
Why do all the girls think that
good looking people should be together?

478
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,339
Exactly.

479
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,076
Even a guy like me
can date a guy like you.

480
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,509
Why? What's wrong with a guy like me?

481
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:54,958
You're not handsome.

482
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,309
You're not rich.

483
00:36:01,134 --> 00:36:02,454
You're also stupid.

484
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:05,991
I didn't say all these words.

485
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:07,104
You said it yourself.

486
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:10,729
Then leave me and find someone else!

487
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,574
I won't go,
no matter how hard you push me away.

488
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,327
You're the only one for me.

489
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,322
You're crazy!

490
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:28,920
Lay.

491
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:36,621
I'm here to do a sister's duty.

492
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,274
Are you okay now?

493
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:39,552
Thank you.

494
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,326
I'm okay now.

495
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:44,006
I'm sorry for making you worry.

496
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:51,483
Lay.

497
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,489
Come here.

498
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:55,322
Can.

499
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:02,998
Can.

500
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,104
What are you doing here?

501
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,666
I'm here with Chompoo.

502
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:10,823
Just that?

503
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,137
That's right.

504
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,781
Hello.

505
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:19,360
Tin is so handsome.

506
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,965
If Pete is still here,

507
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:24,670
he and Tin will be a perfect match.

508
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,912
They won't!

509
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,498
Why are you so angry?

510
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,099
I don't know.

511
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:35,640
I'm off.

512
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,115
Tin, let's go.

513
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,851
Wait.

514
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:41,702
If you want to go, just go by yourself.
Why do you have to take Tin with you?

515
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,050
He just came here.

516
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:44,537
Well...

517
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:48,214
Well.

518
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,457
What is it?

519
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,654
Can and I...

520
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:53,691
We are...

521
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:01,118
What's going between you two?

522
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:02,869
Nothing.

523
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,213
Can!

524
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,848
Spill your secrets to me right now!

525
00:38:11,928 --> 00:38:14,030
I told you there's nothing to say!

526
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,270
I can tell from your voice
that you're lying.

527
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:20,306
What's going on?

528
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,433
Can!

529
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:26,516
Tell me now or open his mouth.

530
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,000
There's nothing going on.

531
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,356
-Can!
-I told you there's nothing!

532
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:32,639
Can!

533
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:34,801
You want to know, right?

534
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,130
Fine.

535
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,308
Watch this.

536
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,698
Do you know now who his boyfriend is?

537
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:05,246
♪I'll let you be my sky when I'm flying♪

538
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:10,656
♪I'll let you be my guiding star
when I lost my way♪

539
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:15,302
♪I wish you were here to hold me
through these cold nights♪

540
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:21,307
♪I wish that
you will be my everlasting love♪

541
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:23,112
Why Tul can do it but I can't?

542
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:26,139
Because he will be responsible
for everything after me.

543
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:27,867
What if I ask to live somewhere else?

544
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:29,938
Are you sure that you will buy a room
just because of that reason?

545
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:31,660
I also want freedom.

546
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,640
Don't forget to introduce me
to your friend.

547
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,038
Hey.

548
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:37,978
That's your asshole brother.

549
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,667
I'm glad that I finally get to meet
my brother's important person.

550
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,039
You're such a...

551
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:46,046
I want to know your master's weakness.

552
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:47,360
