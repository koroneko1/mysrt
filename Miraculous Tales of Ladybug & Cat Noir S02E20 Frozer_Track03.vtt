00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.380
&lrm;Hey, Marc! How's it going?
&lrm;Where's the rest of your class?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.940
&lrm;Oh, hey. We're done with classes.
&lrm;The others probably went home.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.780
&lrm;Perfect timing! Some of us
&lrm;are heading over to the art room.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.740
&lrm;-You should come check it out!
&lrm;-Sure. Why not?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.340
&lrm;Maybe you'll finally
&lrm;let me read your writing!

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.860
&lrm;-Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.
&lrm;-Awesome! See you later, then!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.540
&lrm;This is Ladybug and Mightyllustrator,
&lrm;fighting Queen Wasp together!

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.940
&lrm;-You mean Evillustrator?
&lrm;-He changed his name

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.500
&lrm;after Ladybug de-akumatised him.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.260
&lrm;A bad guy who comes over to the good side.
&lrm;Great idea!

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.300
&lrm;-You should make a comic book about that.
&lrm;-But I'm only good at drawing stories,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.180
&lrm;-not writing them.
&lrm;-Then team up with a creative writer.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.820
&lrm;Maybe, but I don't know
&lrm;anyone who's into that.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.020
&lrm;Don't worry. There has to be somebody
&lrm;just waiting to meet you. Red, please!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340
&lrm;Marc! You made it! Come meet everyone.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.860
&lrm;This is Marc, the boy I told you about.
&lrm;The one who's always writing!

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.220
&lrm;Uh... I'm sorry.
&lrm;I didn't want to disturb you.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.300
&lrm;Welcome to room 33.
&lrm;You're never disturbing anyone here!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.740
&lrm;You can come when you want,
&lrm;outside of class time or after school.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.380
&lrm;Everyone can create what they want.

&lrm;Rose is writing lyrics for her rock band.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.380
&lrm;Rose, I'd like you to meet Marc.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.180
&lrm;Hey, there! Nice to meet you, Marc!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.660
&lrm;Alix is our expert in street art.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.660
&lrm;-And Nathaniel...
&lrm;-Likes to draw people in skinny suits.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.820
&lrm;Welcome, Marc. The good thing about this
&lrm;place is you can say whatever you want,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.620
&lrm;no one will judge you,
&lrm;or only in good fun!

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.620
&lrm;I saw your drawings on the school website,
&lrm;but the real thing's better!

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.980
&lrm;The movement, the expressions,
&lrm;the attitudes. They're all so...

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100
&lrm;-Thanks. That's nice.
&lrm;-Uh...

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.900
&lrm;Sorry, but it's true.
&lrm;I've never seen drawings so--

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.820
&lrm;So messed up!
&lrm;All he ever draws any more is Ladybug,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.460
&lrm;since she de-akumatised him!

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.500
&lrm;As if Ladybug could care less
&lrm;about a guy like him. Ha, ha, ha!

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.660
&lrm;I've told you, if you have an art project
&lrm;you want to work on,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.940
&lrm;-you're welcome here. Otherwise...
&lrm;-I've got a project!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.660
&lrm;A masterpiece that'll revolutionise
&lrm;the art world.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420
&lrm;Nothing you'd have come up with!

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.340
&lrm;-Let me guess. Another collage of selfies?
&lrm;-[laughter]

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.420
&lrm;What? No! That's ridiculous!
&lrm;Utterly ridiculous!

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.020
&lrm;You don't deserve my art anyway!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.460
&lrm;Well, Alix,
&lrm;if Chloé did have an art project,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.940
&lrm;it's too bad we didn't give her a chance
&lrm;to tell us about it, isn't it?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.340
&lrm;Whatever.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.460
&lrm;By the way,
&lrm;you've shown up at the perfect time.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.980
&lrm;Marinette told us you're always writing
&lrm;and Nathaniel needs a scriptwriter!

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.780
&lrm;Me? A scriptwriter?
&lrm;I don't write that kind of stuff.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.700
&lrm;I don't write anything interesting.
&lrm;Sorry. Gotta go.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.260
&lrm;-Thanks for everything!
&lrm;-No, Marc!

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.100
&lrm;Hey, wait!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.700
&lrm;Marc!

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.940
&lrm;"Diary of... Ladybug?"

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.340
&lrm;"I saw The Evillustrator again today.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.580
&lrm;Now he's no longer
&lrm;controlled by Hawk Moth,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.380
&lrm;he's become a true superhero,
&lrm;like Cat Noir and me.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.700
&lrm;I'm sure he'd make an awesome partner,
&lrm;but I'm too shy to ask him.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.740
&lrm;I don't want to talk to Cat Noir about it,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.260
&lrm;because I'm worried he'll be jealous!"

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.660
&lrm;It's not exactly the truth,
&lrm;but it's definitely a fun read!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.940
&lrm;Do you realise, Marinette? Ladybug
&lrm;has become a source of inspiration.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.340
&lrm;You're a lucky charm
&lrm;for artists everywhere!

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.220
&lrm;Marc writes exactly the kind of stories
&lrm;that Nath draws!

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.900
&lrm;It's incredible!
&lrm;They're meant to work together!

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.740
&lrm;Looking for this?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.980
&lrm;Oh!

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.380
&lrm;-Did you read it?
&lrm;-Oh, no!

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.260
&lrm;Yeah. Sorry. It was too tempting.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.460
&lrm;Oh, how embarrassing! It's so, so lame!

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.220
&lrm;No, it's not!
&lrm;You should turn it into a comic book!

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.860
&lrm;-Why don't you team up with Nathaniel?
&lrm;-I'm sure he won't like it.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.580
&lrm;Have him read it
&lrm;before you jump to conclusions!

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.700
&lrm;But what if he doesn't like it?
&lrm;I'll be so embarrassed!

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.100
&lrm;I'll have to change schools
&lrm;not to run into him!

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.580
&lrm;Now you're being silly!
&lrm;Look, he draws Ladybug all the time

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.460
&lrm;and you write stories about her!
&lrm;Oh! I've got an idea!

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.820
&lrm;We won't tell him who wrote it!

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.700
&lrm;If he likes it, it's a win-win. If he
&lrm;doesn't... we just won't say anything!

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.580
&lrm;-Do you think it'll work?
&lrm;-Trust me on this.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.140
&lrm;Nath, someone gave me this for you.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.420
&lrm;-Who's "someone?"
&lrm;-I can't tell you. It's a secret!

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.580
&lrm;Read it, and then we'll talk!

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.940
&lrm;[gasps] "Diary of Ladybug?"

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.740
&lrm;Is this... for real?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.300
&lrm;"I call up my Lucky Charm
&lrm;while Cat Noir wields his Cataclysm,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.620
&lrm;and, together, we defeat
&lrm;The Evillustrator! Pound it!

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.820
&lrm;But even though we won this fight,
&lrm;something keeps bugging me.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.620
&lrm;I can't stop thinking about him.
&lrm;I know his real identity, so, sometimes,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.660
&lrm;I try to catch a glimpse of him
&lrm;when I fly over his school."

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.180
&lrm;-Do you think he likes it?
&lrm;-Look at his face! Of course he does!

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.820
&lrm;It's rude to spy on people!

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.900
&lrm;No! It's not what you think at all!
&lrm;It's just that... It's going to be...

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.820
&lrm;Nathaniel's birthday soon, and Marc and I
&lrm;wanted to give him a disguise.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.860
&lrm;-I mean, surprise!
&lrm;-Cool. Very typical of you, Marinette!

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.980
&lrm;-Well, if you need any help, let me know!
&lrm;-Sure won't!

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.420
&lrm;Sure will!

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.020
&lrm;-Oh...
&lrm;-You're just as shy as I am, aren't you?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.140
&lrm;Just do as I say, not as I do, OK?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.980
&lrm;How's it going?

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.260
&lrm;Nath? So? What did you think?

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.020
&lrm;It's seriously amazing!
&lrm;But how did you get hold of it?

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.420
&lrm;First, are you willing to meet the person
&lrm;who wrote it and entrusted it to me?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.020
&lrm;Is it... who I think it is?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.300
&lrm;I can't tell you anything.
&lrm;Please don't insist!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.660
&lrm;-Sure. Of course!
&lrm;-Awesome!

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.180
&lrm;You're gonna make someone very happy!

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.700
&lrm;You keep it. You can give it back
&lrm;to the "author" later today, in person.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.180
&lrm;It's my dream come true.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.460
&lrm;-This isn't some kind of prank, is it?
&lrm;-Meet in Place des Vosges. Trust me.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.220
&lrm;You will not be disappointed.

&lrm;-Final phase of Operation Comic Book.
&lrm;-This will better than a fairytale ending!

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.340
&lrm;-Ladybug?
&lrm;-Huh?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.180
&lrm;-What? You're not Ladybug!
&lrm;-Course I'm not! It's me... Marc.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.220
&lrm;-Didn't Marinette tell you?
&lrm;-Marinette?

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.300
&lrm;Uh, Operation Comic Book has hit a snag!

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.900
&lrm;You were trying to make a fool of me!

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.980
&lrm;-Think it's funny to toy with my feelings?
&lrm;-No, not at all.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.740
&lrm;I... I just want to make a comic book.
&lrm;If you want to, that is.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.100
&lrm;A comic book? Us? Together? Never!

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.220
&lrm;Oh, no!

&lrm;Fly away, my beautiful akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.300
&lrm;Reverser, I am Hawk Moth!

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.380
&lrm;You've been accused of pretending to be
&lrm;someone you're not!

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.940
&lrm;So, from now on,
&lrm;no one will be who they claim to be!

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.660
&lrm;I'm giving you the power to invert anyone.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.780
&lrm;The strong will become weak,
&lrm;the brave will become cowards,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.100
&lrm;and the kind will become mean!

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.500
&lrm;In return, you will seize Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculous for me!

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.060
&lrm;Nothing will be the same any more,
&lrm;Hawk Moth!

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.020
&lrm;Marc, what happened?

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.220
&lrm;I'm not Marc any more!

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.860
&lrm;you think you're the helpful girl,
&lrm;loved by everyone?

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.020
&lrm;Well, from now on, everyone will hate you!

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.060
&lrm;Ouch! What's happening to you,
&lrm;my little pigeons?

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.860
&lrm;Where are you going?
&lrm;Wait! Come back, please!

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.980
&lrm;But I don't get it.
&lrm;I really was trying to help you!

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.740
&lrm;Liar!
&lrm;You told Nathaniel I was someone else!

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.060
&lrm;Hey, you! What is this thing?
&lrm;Vehicle registration, please!

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.180
&lrm;You're all about law and order?
&lrm;Well, we're all done with that! Reversion!

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.980
&lrm;[laughs]

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.020
&lrm;Do whatever you want with that paper plane
&lrm;of yours! I've got other plans!

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.100
&lrm;Marinette!

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.300
&lrm;Where did Operation Comic Book go wrong?
&lrm;Let's find out.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.660
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.700
&lrm;Yeah!

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.900
&lrm;Stop, Reverser! We don't need to fight,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.900
&lrm;so please, make the right choice
&lrm;and give up, Reverser!

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.420
&lrm;You talk a lot, Ladybug. But what will
&lrm;you do without your powers? Reversion!

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.660
&lrm;You can't stay still, can you?
&lrm;Well, let's go for a ride!

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.060
&lrm;<i>As the mayor will talk about</i>
&lrm;<i>his Space Dumpster Program,</i>

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.700
&lrm;<i>protesters saying "Space is no Dump"</i>
&lrm;<i>are walking toward City Hall,</i>

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.460
&lrm;<i>causing traffic jams in the city.</i>

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.820
&lrm;Ha, ha! In the name of the law,
&lrm;do whatever you want!

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.660
&lrm;The bank! He robbed the bank!

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.300
&lrm;Aaah!

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.500
&lrm;I forgot my fencing gloves!
&lrm;Since traffic's so bad,

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.700
&lrm;I'll go get them and catch up with you!

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.620
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.580
&lrm;Be clever, Reverser!
&lrm;A writer must never be short of ideas!

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.100
&lrm;You used to be quick on your feet?
&lrm;Now, you've got two left feet! Reversion!

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.860
&lrm;-Oops!
&lrm;-Whoo! Sorry! How do I ride a bike? Aaah!

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.300
&lrm;Oh, no!

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.220
&lrm;Aaah!

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.980
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug!

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.740
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.340
&lrm;[evil laugh] How do you like
&lrm;your new role, Ladyklutz?

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.980
&lrm;Excellent work, Reverser!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.540
&lrm;Now that she's weakened,
&lrm;get hold of her Miraculous. Her earrings!

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.060
&lrm;-Your Miraculous are mine!
&lrm;-Awesome costume!

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.740
&lrm;-Too bad we'll have to tear it up!
&lrm;-Ugh!

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.020
&lrm;-Everything OK, Milady?
&lrm;-So you think you're brave, Cat Noir?

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.420
&lrm;-From puss to wuss! Reversion!
&lrm;-Oh, yeah, I'm so scared.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.500
&lrm;-Come on, Milady! Let's wrap this up!
&lrm;-Cat Noir, wait!

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.420
&lrm;Milady?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.940
&lrm;-Whoa!
&lrm;-What's up, kitty? Got vertigo?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.780
&lrm;Aaah!

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.980
&lrm;Locate them, Reverser!
&lrm;The Miraculous are so close!

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.620
&lrm;They are powerless now.
&lrm;We've got all the time in the world.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.340
&lrm;I'll take care of them as soon as
&lrm;I've inverted Marinette and Nathaniel!

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.220
&lrm;Fine! But hurry!
&lrm;I want my Miraculous!

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.020
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.220
&lrm;Hmm. Alix, your friend is here.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.300
&lrm;-Where are Nathaniel and Marinette?
&lrm;-That's a very creative costume.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.260
&lrm;-Would you like to join our workshop?
&lrm;-All I want is to know where they are!

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.300
&lrm;Right now!

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.420
&lrm;Even swimming is impossible
&lrm;with this curse!

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.260
&lrm;Atchoo! Great!
&lrm;Now I'm sure I'm gonna catch a cold!

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.900
&lrm;-How are we gonna defeat him?
&lrm;-What? You want to face him again?

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.380
&lrm;I really don't want to fight
&lrm;that bad guy! He looks so mean.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.300
&lrm;We don't have a choice, Cat Noir!
&lrm;Reverser is looking for Nathaniel.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.180
&lrm;We've got to find him before he does.
&lrm;I know where to look!

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.700
&lrm;I can't do it! The stairs are too high.
&lrm;It's making me dizzy.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.940
&lrm;[sighs] Come on, little kitty!
&lrm;Here, kitty kitty.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.700
&lrm;That's it. Very good.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.140
&lrm;See? You're gonna be just--

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.460
&lrm;Aaah!

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.940
&lrm;We're not out of the woods yet.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.340
&lrm;Tell me where Nath and Marinette are!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.020
&lrm;-Can't you see we're busy?
&lrm;-You're the meanest person alive,

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.740
&lrm;treating Sabrina like a slave!

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.140
&lrm;Reversion!

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.020
&lrm;Chloé, I want fresh strawberry juice,
&lrm;but pick out all of the seeds, first!

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.940
&lrm;Yes, Sabrina. Coming right up, Sabrina.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.900
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha!

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.100
&lrm;-Space is no dump!
&lrm;-Thanks to our "Space Dumpster Program,"

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.940
&lrm;all our trash is now stored
&lrm;in orbital dumpsters,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.260
&lrm;making Paris
&lrm;the cleanest city in the world!

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.580
&lrm;-Space is no dump!
&lrm;-Boo! Boo!

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.700
&lrm;Space is no dump!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.500
&lrm;Paris the "cleanest city?"
&lrm;We'll see about that! Reversion!

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.580
&lrm;I'm going to order our satellites
&lrm;to release all the dumpsters

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.740
&lrm;back down towards Paris,
&lrm;making our city

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.940
&lrm;the biggest trash heap in the world!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.460
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.580
&lrm;Aaah!

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.380
&lrm;Whoa! You drive like a maniac!

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.180
&lrm;Sorry about that.
&lrm;He's not quite himself right now.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.660
&lrm;Aaah!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.420
&lrm;Aaah!

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.860
&lrm;[groans]

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.780
&lrm;I hate art and music!
&lrm;Let's destroy it all!

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.420
&lrm;Reverser got here first!

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.700
&lrm;Look! The Louvre is in almost
&lrm;every single one of Nathaniel's drawings!

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.220
&lrm;Does this mean
&lrm;we'll have to take another cab?

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.300
&lrm;You should have given him
&lrm;a chance to explain.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.340
&lrm;What's the point? He wanted to tease me,
&lrm;like everybody else!

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.460
&lrm;It can't be because of Marinette.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.220
&lrm;It's not like her
&lrm;to make fun of other people.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.220
&lrm;-You think I jumped the gun a bit?
&lrm;-Nathaniel! We need you!

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.660
&lrm;It's an emergency! Ow!

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.700
&lrm;[gasps]

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.620
&lrm;This is getting tiring.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.220
&lrm;<i>It's been confirmed. 10,000 tons of</i>
&lrm;<i>garbage are about to rain down on Paris.</i>

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.340
&lrm;<i>Unless the mayor cancels the process,</i>
&lrm;<i>Paris will be under a mountain of trash!</i>

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.620
&lrm;<i>The man behind this chaos, Reverser,</i>
&lrm;<i>has given an ultimatum.</i>

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.140
&lrm;<i>Ladybug! Cat Noir!</i>

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.300
&lrm;<i>Deliver Nathaniel and Marinette to me</i>
&lrm;<i>right now!</i>

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.620
&lrm;<i>I also demand you hand over</i>
&lrm;<i>your Miraculous!</i>

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.820
&lrm;We have to try and talk to him.
&lrm;And we'll need you, Nathaniel.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.860
&lrm;-What about Marinette?
&lrm;-No time!

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.500
&lrm;Reverser will have to settle
&lrm;for just Nathaniel.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.500
&lrm;-I'm coming with you.
&lrm;-No way! It's too dangerous.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.020
&lrm;Actually, I'll just stay here, too,
&lrm;so I don't get in the way.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.940
&lrm;-Boo!
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.540
&lrm;[groans]

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.300
&lrm;It looks to me
&lrm;like you're going to need a helping hand.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.940
&lrm;You can never get too much help!

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.940
&lrm;Nathaniel is my friend.
&lrm;I'm not dropping him.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.180
&lrm;-You're a public health hazard!
&lrm;-I never even went over 15 miles an hour!

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.580
&lrm;That's strange, the stars are out early.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.780
&lrm;Those are not stars!
&lrm;The trash is entering the atmosphere.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.220
&lrm;In a few minutes,
&lrm;it'll be like a meteor shower,

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.380
&lrm;-except with dumpsters instead!
&lrm;-[fearful shivering]

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.380
&lrm;Don't be scared, Cat Noir. We can do this!

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.020
&lrm;You're right. Our powers may be screwed
&lrm;up, but we still make a great team!

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.460
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.060
&lrm;A bamboo roll?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.940
&lrm;Reverser! We're over here!
&lrm;I've got a deal for you.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.220
&lrm;I'm gonna hand Cat Noir over to you now!

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.180
&lrm;In exchange, you'll get the mayor
&lrm;to order the dumpsters back into space!

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.860
&lrm;Then I'll give you my Miraculous
&lrm;and Nathaniel.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.740
&lrm;I'll only reverse the mayor back
&lrm;if I have Cat Noir&lrm;<i> and</i>&lrm; Nathaniel!

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.420
&lrm;Then I'll reverse him and he'll have no
&lrm;choice but to make a comic book with me!

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.500
&lrm;OK!

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.460
&lrm;-Milady, I'm too scared!
&lrm;-And I don't want to be reversed!

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.060
&lrm;You have to trust me. This is gonna work!

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.460
&lrm;Cat Noir and Nathaniel are on their way!
&lrm;Stop the space dumpsters!

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.220
&lrm;If you try to trick me, it'll cost you!

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.100
&lrm;What trick do you actually think
&lrm;I could pull, Reverser?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.380
&lrm;With the scaredy cat and me, SuperKlutz,
&lrm;we don't stand a chance!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.300
&lrm;What?

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.300
&lrm;Go, Cat Noir!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.860
&lrm;Aaah!

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.180
&lrm;OK! Got it!

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.140
&lrm;Whoa!

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.180
&lrm;Stay still, you nasty flea bag!

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.900
&lrm;Now turn back...
&lrm;A little to the right, Alix.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.260
&lrm;Yes. Now a bit up...

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.460
&lrm;Cat Noir, now!

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.420
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.940
&lrm;Aaah!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.740
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.460
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;-Aaah!

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.460
&lrm;All right! Stunt time!

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.220
&lrm;Aaah!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.940
&lrm;Hey, Ladybug, you're gonna need this!

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.820
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.620
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.940
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.180
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.340
&lrm;Cool! Feels good to be ourselves again!

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.140
&lrm;My, my! I guess that space-dumpster thing
&lrm;was a bad idea, after all.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.940
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug and Cat Noir.
&lrm;You really keep this city clean!

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.540
&lrm;Marc and Nathaniel, by now you realise
&lrm;there was a big misunderstanding.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.300
&lrm;But if you give each other a chance,
&lrm;you'll find out

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.020
&lrm;how well you can work together.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.780
&lrm;A bit like you and me, Milady!

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.780
&lrm;Pound it!

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.660
&lrm;Some day soon, Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.940
&lrm;the order of things will reverse,
&lrm;and I will win!

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.980
&lrm;"Next, they team up with Mightyllustrator
&lrm;and de-akumatise Reverser.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.980
&lrm;-Then he joins the team."
&lrm;-Wow! Great job, boys!

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.500
&lrm;Ha, ha! Thanks.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.420
&lrm;-This wouldn't have happened without you.
&lrm;-I'm so relieved you're not mad at me.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.020
&lrm;In fact,
&lrm;we've dedicated our first issue to you!

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.420
&lrm;To Marinette,
&lrm;who would make a super superhero!

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.820
&lrm;[both] If she wasn't such a klutz!

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.100
