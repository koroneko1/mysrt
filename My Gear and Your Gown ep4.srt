Pure!

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,640
Why are you like this?

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,640
Like what?

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,120
You walk away from everyone.

6
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:31,441
Since I was born,

7
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,321
I've never walked away from anyone.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,041
Because you're a good person?

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,961
No.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
Because I've got nobody to walk away from.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,601
Come on.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Let's be serious.

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,160
Can you help me flirt with a girl?

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,321
Please teach me how.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,601
I want to feel the joy of love.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
All right. You're so naive.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,641
I'll pass on my knowledge to you.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,760
Do you have someone in mind
that you want to flirt with?

19
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,001
I want to flirt with...

35
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,800
There.

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,040
Stir it.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
It has to be green.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
-How are you?
-Shoot!

40
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,960
It's June!

41
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,520
June is super cute.

42
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
She is my first love, you know.

43
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,921
I've watched her get on the bus
since she was in the 8th grade.

44
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,161
Now she is in 10th grade,
and I can't say a word to her.

45
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,941
Can you teach me how to flirt with her?

46
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,581
I want her to be my girlfriend.

47
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,640
Now pay attention.

48
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,881
There are three steps to flirting.

49
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,401
One.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,000
Make eye contact.

51
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,201
Look at her.

52
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,800
This will send her a signal
that you're interested in her.

53
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,091
Make eye contact with her.

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,161
But don't ogle over her.

55
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,521
When she realizes you're looking at her...

56
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,920
...and looks back at you, smiling...

57
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,961
...go to the next step.

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,401
Hey.

59
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,440
I think there is a pervert in this place.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Right.

61
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,571
What on earth did you teach me?

62
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,211
It didn't work.

63
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,721
Do you really want to teach me?

64
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,841
All right, all right.

65
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,091
I will show you how it's done.

66
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,121
Don't blink.

67
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,141
Step one.

68
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,120
Make eye contact.

69
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,560
How's that?

70
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,961
Step two.

71
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,601
Introduce yourself.

72
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,201
Watch closely.

73
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,680
Hi. My name is Pure.

74
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,161
This is my first time coming here.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
Do you have any suggestions?

76
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,281
It looks like you come here often.

77
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,720
So what are your names?

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm June.

79
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm Pam.

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,601
Pam.

81
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,200
The last step is to compliment her.

82
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,601
Compliments rule the world.

83
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,240
That's a pretty name.

84
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,081
Is that all?

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,200
Yes.

86
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,000
Wait and see.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,081
She got up. She's coming this way.

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,801
Well, Pam wants your contact details,

89
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:34,321
but she is too shy to ask you.

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,641
But don't give her your contact.

91
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh...

92
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,480
Why not?

93
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
Well...

94
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,321
...it's because I want it too.

95
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,021
Why would I want her to have it?

96
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,301
Let's exchange contacts.

97
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,601
I'm sorry. I'm not interested in you.

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,521
Okay...

99
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,440
You could've gone for her.

100
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560
She seems to like you.

101
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,680
No.

102
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,800
Although I like to fool around...

103
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,120
...I won't take my friend's girl.

104
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,641
Even though you don't want her,
she still doesn't want me.

105
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,881
It's just one girl. Why do you care?

106
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,521
Let's go, man. Come with me.

107
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,480
I have 10 girls that you can choose from.

108
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,051
-Ten more?
-Yes.

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,320
-Are you sure you have 10?
-Don't worry. Yes.

110
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,921
I'll give you 20.

111
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,161
-Twenty?
-Yes.

112
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,261
You're always chatting with them.

113
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:56,821
Don't your fingers get tired?

114
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,171
Not really.

115
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,251
I'm used to it, I guess.

116
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
You're used to it...

117
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,920
By the way...

118
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,081
...don't you think
about getting a new lover?

119
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,120
Someone you're committed to.

120
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
Someone you would never cheat on.

121
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,881
I used to have one.

122
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,001
You used to have one...

123
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,680
Who was it?

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,371
It was my first love.

125
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,200
First love...

126
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,521
Wait, why did you break up?

127
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,520
Well, I wanted him,

128
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,761
but he didn't want me.

129
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,960
After that, I stopped caring about love.

130
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:51,251
Looks like you were so disappointed
by love...

131
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,881
...that you don't believe in it anymore.

132
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,761
If your girlfriend let you get beat up...

133
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,320
...would you still believe in love?

134
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,680
Get out of my sight!

135
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,960
Anyway, what did you do after that?

136
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:51,441
-I did nothing.
-Nothing?

137
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:54,240
It made me realize that love...

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,481
...is just a fantasy.

139
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,281
Only sex is real.

140
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,041
Only sex...

141
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,320
Tonight, buddy.

142
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,341
I will take you to see the real thing.

143
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,421
The real thing...

144
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,241
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

145
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,121
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

146
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,360
(Inappropriate behavior. Do not imitate.)

147
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,440
How's it going, guys?

148
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Hey.

149
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,121
How are you?

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,680
We've got all night.

151
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
-This is awesome.
-Do you like it?

152
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
-It's sick.
-I told you.

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
This private party is lit.

154
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,840
This is sick.

155
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,520
The real thing is right here.

156
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,641
Come on.

157
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,001
Waan, let's drink.

158
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,800
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Come on.

159
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,281
To our friendship.

160
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:01,600
Bottoms up.

161
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,041
-How's that?
-Whoa!

162
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,981
It's strong.

163
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,341
Let's do another shot.

164
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,720
-Another?
-Yes.

165
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:37,241
Are you all right?

166
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,840
I should ask you that.

167
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,120
Hey.

168
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,840
Hey.

169
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,121
Did I make you think about your ex?

170
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,401
Dude, did you know...

171
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,321
...that 99 percent
of first love relationships...

172
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,121
...eventually end in heartbreak?

173
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,521
Don't drown yourself in disappointment.

174
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,560
Move on.

175
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Yes.

176
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
You're right.

177
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,401
Take my mom as an example.

178
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,241
She had so many relationships...

179
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,121
...but they all failed.

180
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:37,800
Love doesn't exist.

181
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,560
Hey.

182
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,240
Are you stressed about your ex...

183
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,960
...or your mom?

184
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:50,840
Both.

185
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Heck!

186
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,081
You're depraved.

00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,101
You've infected my girlfriend with HIV.

188

190
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:43,481
How was your night?

191
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,521
It was a good night. I slept very well.

192
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:56,200
You don't have a fever,
and your blood pressure is normal.

193
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,401
Thank you.

194
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:00,760
-Last night...
-I'll tell him myself.

195
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,881
Okay.

196
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,761
What happened last night?

197
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,601
What could it be?

198
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,720
I just had a sweet dream.

199
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
What was it about?

200
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:37,640
That you got into university...

201
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,241
...had a good job,
and a good life ahead of you.

202
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,121
You have to make my dream come true, okay?

203
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:51,161
I want you to be happy every day.
Do you know that?

204
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,040
Of course I know.

205
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:59,881
I want to study,

206
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,801
go to a university,

207
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,521
and have a good job.

208
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll do it for you.

209
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,121
There he is.

210
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:37,280
The person who can help you
get into university is here.

211
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,081
-Hello.
-Hello.

212
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:05,680
You're not wearing your earring anymore?

213
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,381
No.

214
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:12,580
It hurts.

215
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,121
Let's call it a day. I've got to go.

216
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,571
Why?

217
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,061
The last exercise that I gave you...

218
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,341
...has already pushed you
to the average level.

219
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:59,491
If you can maintain it,
your GPA should get higher.

220
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,000
You're not normally like this.

221
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,051
What's wrong with you today?

222
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm fine.

223
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,480
Where are you?

as a thank you.

to noodles as a thank you.)

227

See you at the usual place.

(See you at the usual place.)

229
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,881
You already read the text.
Why won't you reply?

230
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:46,461
Are you just going to let me eat alone?

231
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,501
I didn't let you eat alone the other day.

232
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,280
I really can't go.

-A little bit.

235
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:45,921
-Have you already ordered?
-Not yet.

236
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,332
What do you want to have?

237
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,240
What do you want to have?

238
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,121
What's their signature dish?

239
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,261
-Let me order for you.
-Okay.

240
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:56,021
Mister, can we have two bowls
of noodles with meatballs?

241
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:56,960
Okay.

242

-He's a good cook.
-Really?

243
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,541
-See?
-Wow.

244
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,021
-It's so fast.
-Sure is.

245
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:09,341
Can you pass the chopsticks?

246
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,920
Chopsticks.

247
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,061
How did you know
that I don't eat vegetables?

248
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,061
Because I don't eat them either.

249
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,121
Chopsticks, please.

250
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,361
-All right.
-Here's your spoon.

251
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,021
Let's see if it's as delicious
as you say it is.

252

Go ahead.

253
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680

254
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,240
Here. The meatballs are dope.

255

Let's go.

256
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,761
I don't want to go home yet.

257

It's already late.

-Okay.
-Get in.

You just woke up. Don't move too fast.

266
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,601
What happened to me?

267
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,720
You were hit by a car,
but all your injuries are minor.

268
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,541
You must have been in shock.

269
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,302
You were unconscious all day.

270
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,401
I'm sorry.

271
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,961
It's okay.

272
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,361
You had a CT scan,
and the results are normal.

273
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,121
You have to be more careful, okay?

274
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,801
Take good care of yourself.

275
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,081
You have your entrance exam
for university this year.

for a long time to become a doctor.

Your phone.

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,841
You weren't using it
while crossing the street, were you?

282
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:55,960
You've never made us worry before.

283

I'm sorry.

284

Get some rest.

285
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,281
Does it still hurt?

286
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:12,401
Yes.

287
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,481
-Rest.
-Okay.

288
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,720

Where's my friend's mother?

294
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,800
She passed away last night.

295

And...

296
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,361
...what about my friend, Itt?

297
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,840
Who did he come here with?

298
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,840
He took care of everything by himself.

299
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,401
He seems very strong.

-Yes?

Is she getting worse?

303

Well...

304
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,680
If you force her too much,
she will feel uncomfortable.

There's nothing else you can do.

311

You're right.

312
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,321
I don't think
that there's anything else I can do.

313

I'm aware that she won't get better.

314
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,961
You don't think
that there's anything else you can do...

315
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,480
...because you've already done your best.
