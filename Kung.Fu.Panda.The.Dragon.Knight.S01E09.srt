I've underestimated Po.

Clearly, my best aren't up to the task.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,960
But if anyone can help me catch him…

00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,796
-It's you.
-[suspenseful music plays]

Never!

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,093
I refuse to give up information
on my beautiful boy.

I'd rather die!

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,475
Whoa! Hey. I was just gonna have you
send him a letter or something.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,144
You'd have to shoot me with your crossbow!

Whoa, there.

21
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,621
I didn't expect such a fight
from a common cook.

Common?

I'm telling you,
60% fail within the first year,

We caught Klaus and Veruca,

Uh… [chuckles awkwardly] Okay.

47
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,787
Kind of uncomfortable now.

48

So,

49
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,957
I suppose it's time for us to--

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,668
Do the secret handshake
we never came up with?

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,421
To part ways.

52
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,843
Partnerships end when the goal is met.
That's how these things work.

00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,557
Oh. Uh… [hesitates] Right.

54
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,687
What? What are you doing? What is that?

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,148
Bring it in. Hug time.

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,233
No, knights don't hug.

57
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,484
What? Wait a second.

58
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,113
You're telling me knights and squires
aren't constantly hugging?

59
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,197
Goodbye, Po.

60
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,742

I said I'd guide you through China,

and that means
all the way through to the docks.

68

Don't you need to return the gauntlet?

for one more day.

I'll head there after.

[male voice 2]
Good morning, Dragon Master.

179
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,416
Lovely day for a walk, isn't it?

180
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,003
Yes, there's nothing
quite like a lovely stroll

181
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,838
to get you where you want to be.

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,425
Shortcut?

183
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,344
-He's walking faster than we are!

184
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,098
[goat] Fine day, indeed.

185
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,977
[groans] That's it! We're getting out.

186
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,315
No, no, no. It's faster, Blade. I promise.

187
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,777
Pandas…

188
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,196
What are you gonna do? Am I right?

189
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,489
[chuckles]

[serene music plays]

191
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,712
Are we there yet?

192
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,881
We're almost there.

193
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,132
Maybe halfway.

194
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,635
But we're making great time.
[quietly] Probably.

195
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,971
Take your time,
Pandy Wandy Fuzzy Poppy Fluff!

196

[laughing, whooping]

200
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm so excited for the Moon Festival!

201
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,489
Yeah! The Moon Festival!

202
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,157
Moon Festival?

203
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,826
Moon Festival?!

204
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,745
Moon Festival…

205
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,082
-Moon Festival?
-[mystical music plays]

206
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,917
Wha-- What?

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,961
Who knew that the Moon Festival
would be on our shortcut?

208
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,922
[scoffs] Not this guy.

209
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,843
-It's the day of the Moon Festival.
-Yeah, the Moon Festival!

210
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,263
-The Moon Festival's upon us! Yay!
-Hooray for the Moon Festival!

211
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,351
-Yay! The Moon Festival's upon us!
-[grunts]

212
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,188
I'm so excited for the Moon Festival!

213
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,274
There's got to be a way through.
Try to pass that boat on the left.

214
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,484
No one's moving.

215
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,987
Can't use my powers
if we're stuck on the water.

216
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,447
Do something, would you?

217
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,867
Patience, Veruca.
Our opportunity will come.

218
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,703
How awfully confident
for someone who ain't got no plan.

219
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,914
Who says I don't have a plan?

220
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,792
[laughing]

221
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,670
Try to pass them on the right.

222
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,840
No, trust me,
we stay in the left lane, it's way faster.

223
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,882
Just do it!

224
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,345
Wait your turn!

225
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,181
-[grunts]
-Whoops! Oh, sorry!

226
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,102
Got distracted placing my drink
into this convenient cup holder.

227
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,187
Aw, man! Lucky.

228
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,565
[sighs] Let's walk the rest of the way.

229
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,024
Not a terrible idea.

230
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:18,112
Oh! Wouldn't mind
a stretch of the ol' legs, I wouldn't.

231
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,407
I don't know what mind tricks
you're trying to play, but quiet!

232
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,160
Hey, I know it's stressful,
but if we go with the flow,

233
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,746
we'll get through the festival and reach
the docks faster than if we'd walked.

234
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,458
In the meantime, just look around!

235
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,669
What better place to spend
your last day in China? It's fun.

236
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,718
I know, knights don't "fun."
Not even when they're surrounded by it.

237
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,261
But, come on!

238
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,221
They're tied up. Try to relax.

239
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,140
Knights don't relax, either.

240
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,478
Okay, let's compromise.

241
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,063
How about 50% relaxed, 50% vigilant?

242
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,233
How about 99% vigilant, 1% relaxed?

243
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,985
Deal. Wait…

244
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,197
Ninety-nine percent… Fifty-one… Aw…

247
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,919
You can't leave China
without learning to play erhu!

[plays, strums]

249
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,468
Yeah, I've never played it.
I'm more of a flute guy.

Blade! Look at this.

252
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,266
You can't leave China
without poking a mummy.

253
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,102
This is a Chinese cultural experience?

254
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,687
[chuckling] It should be.

00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,512
[sighs] Service is terrible here.

261
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,056
[chuckles] You don't go
to dim sum for the service.

262
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,267
You go for the taste. [snorts]

263

Mm, mm, mm.

Oh. Mm. [muffled] This is--

A little piece of heaven?

Mm, mm, mm.

267
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,657
You know, I have to admit,
today was pretty fun.

268
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,118
I guess it really is okay
to be 1% relaxed--

269
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,162

There he is! The Dragon Master!

272

Like I said, 1% relaxed is 1% too much.

Oh no! What are we gonna do?

274

What? No! That's not true.

00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,087
An erhu!
Not priceless, but it was up there.

292
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,925
They just took brushes from me,
but they had sentimental value.

Okay, that's ridiculous.
Where would I even put that stuff?

This is where our mission ends.

353
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,527
You don't even want me
to walk you to the docks?

354
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,363
I think I'll be better off on my own.

355
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
Goodbye, Po.

[gasps] Hey!

360
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,876
Hey, give that back, plant!

361
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,253
Not a plant.

Tell us where the whip is or
I'm turning the cute one into plant food.

I lied to you
because I wasn't ready to let go.

Don't let them

Klaus and Veruca are
on the way to the Emperor's palace.

406
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,868
That means the gauntlet
and the whip will be there.

407
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,412
And we're going to go get them.

You still owe me a shortcut,
but now we need it to meet the Emperor.

Come on, squire.
We still have a mission to finish.
