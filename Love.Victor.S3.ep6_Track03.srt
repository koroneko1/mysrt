And when you and Baba accepted me,

460
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,465
I finally believed
I could be all of those things.

461
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,635
For the first time in my life,

462
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,845
I was proud.

463
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,228
And then you made me hide again.

464
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,692
Never again.

465
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,655
- Never again.

466
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,120
That waiter you were talking
to was very handsome.

467
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,915
- Okay, no, I'm, I'm not doing
this with you right now.

00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,417

I told you your boy would come.

PILAR:
Hey.

471
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:19,895
- Hey.

472
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,689
Are you comin' to see me?

473
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:26,610
- I just wanted to let you know
that my dad and I made up.

474
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,403
He apologized and everything.

475
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,657
- [sighs] Okay. Oh my god.
All right, that is a relief.

476
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,245
All right, we can finally get back
to being normal... Unpause.

477
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,541
Okay, what-what's wrong?

478
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,127
- It was really easy for you
to pick my family over me.

479
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,423
- No. No, okay? You're wrong.
All right, that was not easy.

480
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,342
That was... brutal.

481
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,761
- Not brutal enough, I guess.

482
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,973
I could've never dropped you like that.

483
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,185
