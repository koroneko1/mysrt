1
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:34,847
Hyun-su, what condition are you in?

2
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:36,974
Did I win?

3
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:41,812
Hyun-su is okay.

4
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,942
That's unexpected.

5
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:53,282
Don't move.

6
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:57,536
Those things can't kill me.

7
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,497
Don't worry about that.

8
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,416
I'll find a way to kill you
when I need to.

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,794
Hyun-su… Are you okay?

10
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,712
Come over here quickly.

11
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:07,963
Come over.

12
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:15,805
Put that away.

13
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:18,516
He saved me.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,726
Think about what they did.

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,394
Hyun-su.

16
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:23,979
He killed his own team.

17
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,689
-Do you trust him?
-Do you trust me?

18
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:31,612
He's like me.

19
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,245
So put your guns down.

20
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,600
ORIGINAL STORYSWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

21
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:35,509
TEN

22
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,102
I did it.

23
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:49,190
I…

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,735
killed Ms. An.

25
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,866
I know you had no choice.

26
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,537
Don't give in until the end.

27
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,542
She would've wanted that.

28
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,730
I see how you've been.

29
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,443
What are you going to do from now on?

30
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:39,448
I'm going to find more that are like us.

31
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,954
When the hunt is over,

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,748
the hound dies.

33
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,167
It should live as a wolf.

34
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,755
Come with me.

35
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:05,766
Is he your friend?

36
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,686
Come here. It's okay.

37
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,444
Hyun-su. Have you seen Mr. Han?

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,446
No.

39
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,117
My T-Rex's leg is broken.

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,828
He said he'd fix it.

41
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,913
Do you know how to fix it?

42
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,458
No.

43
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:41,468
What about us?

44
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,763
Do you think we can be fixed?

45
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,599
I used to think so

46
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,601
because I thought it was a disease.

47
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,855
So I volunteered for the experiment.

48
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:58,569
They made every effort
to separate it from me.

49
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:01,488
They tried freezing, thawing,

50
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:04,033
sawing, piercing, and scorching.

51
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:07,328
What do you think happened in the end?
It never comes out!

52
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,247
Why not?

53
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:15,252
Because the monster isn't in me. It is me!

54
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,227
I realized then…

55
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,273
that this is an evolution!

56
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,276
That I was chosen!

57
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,908
Humans have failed.

58
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,536
Not only did they fail in experiments,

59
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:54,124
but they also failed
to be selected by nature.

60
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,423
Accept it.

61
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:05,594
Humans and we…

62
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,764
can't coexist anyway.

63
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,446
Mr. Han!

64
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,156
Hurry! Hurry over!

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,991
-Where are you going?
-Jeez!

66
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,412
Su-yeong, it's my friend.

67
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,039
It helped me.

68
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,083
No!

69
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,378
-Get out of the way!
-No!

70
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,380
-Get away.
-No!

71
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,799
-Stop!
-No!

72
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,843
-It won't attack us.
- Well, yes, but…

73
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,386
You don't know how it'll change!

74
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,221
Shoot it! It's a monster!

75
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:50,639
No!

76
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,933
Don't do it!

77
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,017
Damn it!

78
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,815
No!

79
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,733
Don't do it!

80
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,069
-No!
-Let's go.

81
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,510
I guess you're right.

82
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:32,181
Humans and monsters can't coexist.

83
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,101
It can't be helped.

84
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,442
-Don't cry.
-Get up.

85
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,365
Hey.

86
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,660
Even an outcast should be picky
when choosing friends.

87
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:06,924
You seem to have a lot of friends.

88
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,885
I have no such thing.

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,019
What is that jerk
trying to do with Hyun-su?

90
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:20,687
I don't know.

91
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,900
He's cooperative for now,
so provoking him won't do any good.

92
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,903
It's obvious that he's a psycho.

93
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,821
Anyway…

94
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,413
SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

95
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,375
What about it?

96
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,336
What do you want to do with it?

97
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,837
It's tempting, right?

98
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,090
It's a good deal.

99
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:51,760
So?

100
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,557
You want to sell Hyun-su out
so we can survive?

101
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,935
-Are you crazy?
-I never said that.

102
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,603
Do you really believe this?

103
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,606
Just be your twisted self.

104
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,900
-Exactly.
-What?

105
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,654
"Safety camp" sounds ridiculous.

106
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,991
You don't know
who'll turn into a monster when,

107
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,867
so how can they secure safety?

108
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:23,250
When someone is sure about keeping
a promise when it's hardly possible,

109
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,877
there's a good chance it's a lie.

110
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:32,009
So what will you do?

111
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,011
I'll go talk to Hyun-su first.

112
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:40,892
No.

113
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,936
-I just want to talk--
-I don't want to.

114
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,063
Nothing you said was ever good for me.

115
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,524
Hey, Hyun-su.

116
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:52,029
I'm not your hound, anymore.

117
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:02,789
Are you going to stay here?

118
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,418
Probably.

119
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,339
Not for long, though.

120
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,133
I'll leave soon.

121
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,013
Where were you before?

122
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:21,933
Do you know about the research facility?

123
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:25,270
You probably don't want to hear it.

124
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,609
Won't you report me?

125
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:33,278
I'm the skeptical type.

126
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:36,823
You're smart.

127
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,371
As an apology to the people here,

128
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:43,997
I'll tell you one thing.

129
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,958
Do you know about Operation Golden Hour?

130
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,502
What is that?

131
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,214
It's the military's final operation
to solve this situation.

132
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,049
I heard it from the soldiers.

133
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,261
"If we can't distinguish
between humans and monsters,

134
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:02,224
and if we can't predict when and
what kinds of monsters humans will become,

135
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,520
before the military
completely loses its function,

136
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,775
we'll sweep as many areas as possible."

137
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:15,946
No way.

138
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:19,157
The military's not going to rescue anyone.

139
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,535
They're going to destroy everything.

140
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,797
Survive on your own.

141
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,093
That's the only way now.

142
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,267
I have something to tell you.

143
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,980
-All right.
-Well…

144
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,733
There.

145
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:56,069
Hey, gold tooth.

146
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,030
You're dead if you step out.

147
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,867
I want to finish you off right now,
but I'm holding back.

148
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,785
You don't have the guts to do that.

149
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:04,703
What?

150
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,664
We've been here together for a while,
but you still don't know me.

151
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:10,041
I'm a man of action.

152
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,627
-You're all talk.
-Come on, woman.

153
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:13,962
Whatever.

154
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:16,882
Have you seen Bom?

155
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,092
Bom?

156
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:23,305
No, I didn't kill anyone.
I only ran some errands.

157
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:25,891
I committed financial crimes.
I'm the brain.

158
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,726
I've never killed anyone.

159
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:30,103
Throw him out.
Something will come and eat him.

160
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,899
-Where are you, Bom?
-Ui-myeong!

161
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,529
Please tell them about me.

162
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,788
Wait, Ui-myeong…

163
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,918
-What was that?
-We used to be close.

164
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,297
-Your foot.
-Okay. I'll put it back.

165
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,758
So, the soldiers will come
when you press this, right?

166
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:03,678
This is unfair.

167
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:06,473
I told you everything, but you haven't.

168
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,225
Because I didn't trust you.

169
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,018
Do you trust me now?

170
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,770
More than the military and that man.

171
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,271
Should I be happy?

172
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,650
What's your opinion?

173
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,903
I only heard about it.

174
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,074
Your opinion is important
since you've seen it.

175
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,889
I told you

176
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,017
I wasn't sure…

177
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,939
if I could protect the kids without you.

178
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,571
But…

179
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:06,616
I wanted to.

180
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:11,913
I really wanted to.

181
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,255
I'm scared.

182
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:23,633
What if…

183
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:30,098
I turn into something hideous?

184
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,478
I'm scared of that.

185
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:09,387
Poor things.

186
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:12,933
Even death couldn't get them out of here.

187
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:57,268
I can't die here.

188
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,415
What are you doing?

189
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,668
-Shoveling.
-I can see that.

190
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:24,629
Sir, you shouldn't overwork yourself.

191
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,924
This is nothing.

192
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:31,928
You'll end up digging a tunnel
while looking for one.

193
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:34,472
That'd be nice.

194
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,351
Sir, you're sick.

195
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,105
If you keep doing this, you'll--

196
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,106
I'll die?

197
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,234
Yes. That'd be all right, too.

198
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,528
You can just cover me with dirt.

199
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,594
Move away!

200
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,082
What's the matter?

201
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,587
-They were trying to leave.
-It doesn't matter.

202
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,256
If they report us, the soldiers will come.

203
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,425
We won't be here by then.

204
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,553
Because I'll leave here with you.

205
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,314
Why are you trying to go out?

206
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,546
Let them go.

207
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,260
They'll die, anyway.

208
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,642
-What the…
-Run!

209
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,495
Don't look back.

210
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:51,794
Okay.

211
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:54,005
Just a little more.

212
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:02,013
Hurry. Help him.

213
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:28,748
Damn it.

214
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,877
Byeong-il…

215
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,048
People like me die

216
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,343
when they do something
they don't usually do.

217
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:44,305
I told you.

218
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:47,850
I'm a man of action.

219
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:52,772
Now you know.

220
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:56,818
What should we do?

221
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:02,240
Oh, goodness.

222
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:03,658
Byeong-il.

223
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:06,119
Byeong-il.

224
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:14,210
Wake up!

225
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:17,547
Wake up. Byeong-il.

226
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,217
Byeong-il.

227
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,935
I should've known when you were bummed
after killing that woman.

228
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,022
Do you want to hear something funny?

229
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:36,858
To tell you the truth,
you didn't kill anyone.

230
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,158
Because that woman was actually me.

231
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,227
Nobody can leave.

232
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,041
GREEN HOME MANSION APARTMENT

233
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,803
-Let go.
-What are you doing?

234
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:31,139
-That's a monster.
-It's still Hyun-su.

235
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,751
It's still Hyun-su.

236
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:30,406
It's okay, Hyun-su.

237
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:32,783
It's okay.

238
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,535
It's not your fault.

239
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:37,872
It's okay, Hyun-su.

240
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:45,963
It's okay.

241
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,264
It's okay.

242
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:01,604
Hyun-su.

243
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:03,898
It's not your fault.

244
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:14,283
It's not your fault.

245
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:55,992
I killed a person.

246
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,248
No.

247
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:08,671
What you killed…

248
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:13,843
wasn't human.

249
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:17,763
I'm so scared…

250
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,518
it'll be my last memory.

251
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:32,778
Try to forget it.

252
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:40,953
Don't think about it.

253
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,250
You don't think about it either.

254
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,216
Okay.

255
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,379
I'll die?

256
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,924
Well, that's all right, too.

257
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:36,592
Just cover me with dirt.

258
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,066
Just cover with dirt…

259
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,427
Who is he?

260
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:06,932
Why am I crying?

261
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:10,978
My heart…

262
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:14,774
is breaking.

263
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:22,383
How is Hyun-su?

264
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,428
He doesn't remember any of it.

265
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,472
How much can he remember?

266
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:32,351
I'm not sure.

267
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:37,898
If he can't remember,

268
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:42,820
I want him to forget
all the bad memories, too.

269
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,532
AUGUST 25, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

270
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:00,963
Just go like this.

271
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,965
This is much better.

272
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:04,425
What?

273
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:06,886
Survive.

274
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:08,596
For yourself.

275
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,807
You just promised me.

276
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:15,185
And for the rest of us.

277
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,365
Yeong-su.

278
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:31,493
I told you not to go around alone.
I've been looking for you!

279
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:33,579
Go away! I hate you!

280
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:36,081
Why? Why do you hate me?

281
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,167
It could've been Dad!

282
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,920
It came to me because it missed me.

283
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:43,464
But you said it was a monster.

284
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,883
You told people to kill it!

285
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,134
It's not Dad.

286
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,845
Dad is dead.

287
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:51,972
Even if we sleep 10 nights, 100 nights,

288
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,266
we can never see him again.

289
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,435
No! You're stupid!

290
00:31:57,978 --> 00:31:59,146
You're stupid, too.

291
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:01,732
I'm not stupid!

292
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:04,026
You're mean to your sister,

293
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:05,694
so you're super stupid.

294
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:28,384
If you cry like that,

295
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,594
you'll be fired as a secret agent.

296
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:33,430
Santa Claus won't bring you a gift…

297
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:37,267
A gift?

298
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:45,818
What's this?

299
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:48,278
TWO DAYS AGO

300
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:49,863
Are you putting an old man to work?

301
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:51,657
Please do this for me.

302
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,456
Do you really have to go?

303
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:23,313
Du-sik left it with me.

304
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,566
It's a gift for you.

305
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,527
Ta-da.

306
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,405
This is something called a medal.

307
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:36,827
It's an award given to a person
who protected someone well.

308
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,207
KIM YEONG-SU

309
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:46,628
Here.

310
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:49,715
You've been awarded a medal,

311
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,592
so don't fight anymore.

312
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,762
You have to look after each other, okay?

313
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:24,541
Grandpa, wake up.

314
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,501
DAD, MOM, KAPO

315
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:28,796
Grandpa.

316
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:32,508
Grandpa?

317
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:38,764
Excuse me.

318
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,228
Grandpa is not waking up.

319
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,694
Sir.

320
00:34:57,449 --> 00:34:59,201
Grandpa, let's play.

321
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:18,720
Thank you.

322
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,681
Byeong-il.

323
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,519
What's this?

324
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:14,568
Mr. An found it in the end.

325
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:25,245
Now you can rest in peace.

326
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:27,789
It's snowing.

327
00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:26,223
You're all surrounded.

328
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:29,559
Surrender the infected immediately.

329
00:37:30,477 --> 00:37:34,648
Survivors will be transferred
to a safety camp.

330
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,984
You are completely surrounded.

331
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:40,487
Surrender the infected immediately.

332
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,032
Survivors will be transferred
to a safety camp.

333
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:32,831
Are you going somewhere?

334
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,712
Hyun-su, your hands are cold.

335
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,130
Are you cold?

336
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:49,848
I have to go outside.

337
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:56,897
It's not cold if we stay together.

338
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,318
Stay here.

339
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:04,988
Stay with us.

340
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:20,837
Shit.

341
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,888
Damn. Why is it blocked?

342
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,390
Damn it.

343
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:35,685
Shit.

344
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:39,398
I almost blew it up.

345
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:04,881
They seem to have weapons, sir.

346
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:22,732
What's going on?

347
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:28,488
Hurry.

348
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:35,263
Where are you going?

349
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,432
Hyun-su.

350
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:38,642
He's gone.

351
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,063
I'll go get him.

352
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:50,654
I'll come back.

353
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:54,032
Don't worry.

354
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:56,409
I'll come back safe.

355
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:58,954
You promise?

356
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:00,830
Yes.

357
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,264
I should've given this back.

358
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:06,021
It's not too late.

359
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,006
Something's moving in the building.

360
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:47,247
Come in quickly.

361
00:44:48,915 --> 00:44:50,500
Eun-hyeok isn't here yet.

362
00:44:51,793 --> 00:44:52,919
Neither is Hyun-su.

363
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,843
He promised me that he'd be back.

364
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:03,138
When someone is sure about keeping
a promise when it's hardly possible,

365
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:05,890
there's a good chance it's a lie.

366
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:08,351
I'll come back.

367
00:45:09,144 --> 00:45:10,395
Don't worry.

368
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:12,939
I'll come back safe.

369
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,694
No. Eun-hyeok!

370
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:20,363
Eun-hyeok!

371
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:23,032
No! Let go of me!

372
00:45:23,116 --> 00:45:25,702
No! Eun-hyeok!

373
00:45:25,785 --> 00:45:29,622
Eun-hyeok! No!

374
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:32,375
You promised to come back!

375
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,085
Eun-hyeok!

376
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:36,880
Eun-hyeok!

377
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:07,345
Doesn't it hurt?

378
00:47:08,096 --> 00:47:11,224
I don't know where you were hurt,
so stick these on yourself.

379
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:12,809
Make it obvious.

380
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:16,563
"I got hurt because of you.
It fucking hurts!"

381
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:17,856
Sorry.

382
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:19,816
We made things more difficult for you.

383
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:22,277
How did you bear it?

384
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,571
Thank you for saving us.

385
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:29,534
It's not your fault.

386
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:32,996
Live.

387
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:35,748
You can choose this time.

388
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:44,632
It makes me feel like I'm home.

389
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,138
Are you okay?

390
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:57,288
Are we going to die
wandering around here like this?

391
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:58,998
Don't say such an awful thing.

392
00:48:59,582 --> 00:49:02,377
I can't die here like this.

393
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:15,932
Bom.

394
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:19,352
Bom. Hey, sweetie.

395
00:49:21,145 --> 00:49:22,689
Where have you been?

396
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:27,944
Where have you been?

397
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:41,290
Bom.

398
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:52,510
Bom?

399
00:49:58,349 --> 00:49:59,976
Bom?

400
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:02,270
Bom.

401
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:22,206
We found it.

402
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:39,700
I pushed it.

403
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:42,328
Oh my goodness.

404
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,081
That means you didn't push it.

405
00:51:45,665 --> 00:51:48,626
Then don't you care
about Nam Sang-won anymore?

406
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,676
The deal isn't over yet.

407
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,572
Wait. Someone didn't get on yet.

408
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:20,241
We're waiting for one more person.

409
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,501
You must survive.

410
00:53:57,463 --> 00:53:58,589
Cha Hyun-su.

411
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:03,594
Cha Hyun-su.

412
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:22,571
Long time no see.

413
