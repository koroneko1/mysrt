1
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,160
[narrator] For 6,000 years, man has
accepted the finality of physical death,

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,679
and when it comes,
he goes to a familiar grave.

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,640
But today, for those who see
the prospect of immortality,

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,039
there's a new
and less permanent resting place.

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,679
The start of a silent revolution

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,879
which could affect
the future of the world.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,679
In those capsules,
people who determine to live twice,

8
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,560
who prefer the freezer to the grave.

9
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,399
The first of the
"die now, live later" group.

10
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,079
Men and women
frozen solid in their cylinders,

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,359
waiting for the future.

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,079
[metal scraping]

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,200
And, they believe, cheating death.

14
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,480
[announcer 1] Person placed in cryonic
suspension is probably...

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,280
without a doubt, it's the most sanitary,
and most scientific,

16
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,719
and perfect form of preservation
we can possibly imagine.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,599
[announcer 2]
Each individual on this planet

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
has one big overriding problem,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
his own death.

20
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,319
And it's a big problem
and no one has solved it yet.

21
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
[Sahatorn in Thai] It was morning when we
discovered the aquarium's oxygen pump,

22
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,640
which supplied air to the aquarium,
had broken overnight.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,039
Our mother announced,
"No school today. Save the goldfish!"

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,800
So we scooped out the floating fish

25
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,520
and put them in an ice bath.

26
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,759
Lowering their temperature
slowed down the death process.

27
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,719
And we found we could revive them later.

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,479
We were very successful.

29
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,360
More than 50% were revived.

30
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,759
[Nareerat] Come on. Let's go!

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
-Beep, beep.
-[Nareerat] Beep, beep!

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
Daddy.

33
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,039
[both chuckle]

34
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,840
We named our daughter Einz.

35
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,159
In Japanese and Chinese,
"Einz" means "love."

36
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,400
-[Sahatorn] What kind of bed is this?
-My sister's crib.

37
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,719
[Sahatorn] Yeah.

38
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,639
Are you doing this for your sister?
Or are you just following my orders?

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
For my sister!

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,599
-Do you really love your sister?
-Yes, really.

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
-Do you really want a sister?
-I haven't even met her yet.

42
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,000
-Do you really want her?
-Yes, I do.

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,039
If she watches this video later,
what would you like to tell her?

44
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,199
I love you, little sister.

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,199
-Hmm?
-I love you, little sister.

46
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,199
[Sahatorn] Einz was born out of
Matrix's wish for a sibling.

47
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,000
[Matrix] Hello. Today is March 2nd, 2012.

48
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,319
I've brought my sister to the mall.

49
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,839
It's the first time she's left the house.

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,160
[Sahatorn] He was an only child then.

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,959
[Matrix in English] When she was born...

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,000
I drew a little house, and a door,
and a countdown...

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,360
saying that,
"29 days until Einz arrives." [chuckles]

54
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,839
And I changed the date every day,
30, 29...

55
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,759
until...

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,120
until, uh, the day she was born.

57
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,480
I think I cried.

58
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,879
I was so happy.

59
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,959
[Nareerat in Thai] Why are you sitting
on the chair by yourself?

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Such a gifted child you are!

61
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,279
[Nareerat chuckles]

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
One, two, three!

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,519
[Sahatorn] Einz brought

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,920
the whole family together.

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Everyone had been waiting for her.

66
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,079
[woman] Here she comes!

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,040
[Nareerat] Daddy! Daddy! You're 40 now!

68
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,040
Today is Daddy's birthday.

69
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,920
And you have your new daughter with you.

70
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,600
[Nareerat] Our family today
includes my husband,

71
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Dr. Sahatorn, nicknamed "Top."

72
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,720
Then there's our eldest son, Matrix

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,439
and our daughter Matheryn, or Einz.

74
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
[Nareerat] Such a pretty dress.

75
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,120
[Sahatorn] My little Einz.

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,560
I think that for the bottom bit,
just drill a little and put this in there.

77
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,399
For the upper bit,
we'll clamp it until it's flush.

78
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,040
Just a little effort, and it should fuse.

79
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
In our family...

80
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,959
we place a lot of importance on science.

81
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,560
That means,
if we know something, we say we know.

82
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,920
If we do not know something,
we say we do not know.

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Just because we don't know something,
it doesn't mean it's not true.

84
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,639
My family knows that I always used

85
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,800
the scientific way of thinking
to solve problems.

86
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,120
[Nareerat] We have
a good head of the family.

87
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
I was once Sahatorn's student.

88
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,920
He is still my teacher.

89
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,759
A teacher for our children.

90
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
[Matrix in English] What I like
about science is that

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,800
most of the thing can be explained.

92
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,799
Everything is natural and unnatural
at the same time.

93
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,480
[professor] Just grab a pair of goggles.

94
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,000
We're talking about thermal physics,
which is all about particles, of course.

95
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,759
So, if you were able to see
those particles,

96
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,360
what would be different about them
as I'm heating it?

97
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,559
It would be vibrating at a frequency
of a certain color of the light.

98
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,360
[professor] Okay. You're absolutely right.
The frequency of the light.

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,679
[in Thai] This.

100
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,639
Haven't used this in a while.

101
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,639
[Matrix in English] When people talk
about my sister, they'll be like...

102
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,799
"Oh, I'm so sorry. But it's okay
if you don't wanna talk about it."

103
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
But...

104
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,159
I...

105
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,039
I don't want to forget...

106
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,960
the pain we've been through together.
I don't want to...

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
leave out the bad memories.

108
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,120
They're all memories
and I feel like I wanna keep all of them.

109
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,679
I don't wanna...
I don't want to ever forget them.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,519
[Sahatorn in Thai] What happened was...

111
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,759
We were working on a project
in another province.

112
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,759
Matrix, being in Bangkok,
was the one taking care of his sister.

113
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,320
I had this bad feeling. A nightmare.

114
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,120
So I phoned Matrix in the morning
and told him to go and wake Einz up.

115
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,000
But he couldn't wake her up.

116
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
[siren wailing]

117
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,799
[Nareerat] On that day, our daughter went
into a coma and was unable to wake up.

118
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,519
[Nareerat singing softly]

119
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,279
I wished I could take her place.

120
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,559
Take her pain away. Be the one who's sick.

121
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,240
I've always felt
nothing could happen to her

122
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,440
because her mother is here to protect her.

123
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,200
It's gonna be okay, honey. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

124
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,759
[Sahatorn] The neurosurgeon said
it is probably ependymoblastoma.

125
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,720
No one had ever survived it.

126
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,080
[Nareerat] Einz has the deadliest
brain cancer in the world.

127
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,240
Since the day she fell into a coma,
Einz underwent ten surgeries,

128
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
twelve rounds of chemo,
and 20 rounds of radiation.

129
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,120
She was in and out of comas.
Always in and out of the ICU and PICU.

130
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,799
But through it all,
she always woke with a smile.

131
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,080
Everyone waited for Einz's smile.

132
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,480
-[woman] Here comes Ei-Ei!
-[Sahatorn] Here comes Ei-Ei!

133
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,240
[woman] Yay!

134
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,639
[kissing]

135
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,120
[Sahatorn] My heart was rebelling.
Maybe there was a chance.

136
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,879
So we had to keep fighting
until we were sure there was no chance.

137
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,799
I didn't have the right to decide.

138
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,559
She did. She had the right to decide
whether she would keep fighting.

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,559
[Nareerat] I discovered
that my husband had this powerful love.

140
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,200
Throughout 100 days of illness,
he never got a full night's sleep,

141
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,080
because he was researching
the latest technology and treatments.

142
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:24,440
[Sahatorn] I've started collecting
her cancer cells from surgery to culture.

143
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:31,000
But I'm not an expert in this field
so I've experienced many obstacles.

144
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,519
But what's important
is that I don't give up.

145
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,759
Even if the chances of success are low,
I have to keep working on it.

146
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,600
[Matrix in English] My dad spent
nearly every day,

147
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:01,000
when my sister was sick,
at Chula to, um, test medicines...

148
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,200
on her cancer cells.

149
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,919
I personally think he's
one of the mad scientists.

150
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,320
But many things in the world
that have been invented...

151
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,600
were invented by mad scientists

152
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,120
because they were crazy enough
to think of something new.

153
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,360
[Sahatorn in Thai] I experimented
with around five kinds of chemicals

154
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,559
as well as other treatments

155
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,840
that had the possibility
of curing my baby.

156
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,200
You mean...

157
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,759
you will place this camera here
to observe the cell culture.

158
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,799
Yes, to see if the cells are normal.

159
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,679
Then when we're done,
we prepare the tissues here.

160
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,360
After that, we bring the different cells
to the hypoxia closet.

161
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,039
[Sahatorn] There's so much
suffering in life.

162
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,600
We are under so much pressure
as we fight this.

163
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,120
As scientists, we know the chances

164
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,799
of finding the right medicine in time
are slim.

165
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,039
I began to think,
what if the doctors can't find a cure?

166
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,399
Can't find a way. What should we do?

167
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,720
That's when cryonics entered my mind.

168
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,240
[narrator in English] It's a possibility
that's existed

169
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,799
in science fiction for years.

170
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,919
Two American corporations
now claim to offer it as a reality...

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,960
[man] It sounds like science fiction
but it's not.

172
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,639
[woman 1] I wanna live until tomorrow.

173
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,360
I wanna live forever and ever.
I love life.

174
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,279
-[woman 2] I wanna see the future.
-Death is an option.

175
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
The idea of reanimating
is wishful thinking.

176
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,240
I don't care if it's robotic.
I don't care what my body is.

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,360
[Sahatorn in Thai] I've always loved
this area of science since I was a kid.

178
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,279
I've always known what cryonics was.

179
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,039
Cryonics is a process

180
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,960
that preserves bodies of living things.

181
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,879
This was the way to keep her.
We must keep her.

182
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,320
[Matrix in English] After my dad noticed

183
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,080
that the cancer was growing way faster

184
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,480
and Einz
wouldn't probably be able to fight back,

185
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:57,279
he said that she might need to be frozen,
and then we're all like, "What?"

186
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,480
My auntie, my mother,
everyone was against it.

187
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
[in Thai] When everyone learned
about cryonics,

188
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,039
her grandparents wondered,
"Why we would do this? What is it?

189
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,799
That death is death.

190
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,160
What was the point of doing this?"

191
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,039
Can we stop the process of dying? Yes.

192
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,920
Can you believe that we can stop it?
This is what I have to show my family.

193
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,079
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,880
They asked, "Even if we can preserve her,
has anyone been brought back to life?"

195
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,880
[Nareerat speaking indistinctly]

196
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,799
[Sahatorn] Growing up in
an Asian family...

197
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,319
I believe we have souls.

198
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,680
There was conflict within me about that.

199
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,279
I do believe that our souls can be reborn.

200
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,920
But we all still disagreed
with one another.

201
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,079
[Nareerat] He said he wanted to give her

202
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,839
a chance at a life in the future.

203
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,960
[Sahatorn] I know in my heart
that she can be preserved.

204
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,559
[Nareerat] The way my husband told me...

205
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
showed clearly

206
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,960
that he was doing this
out of love for his daughter.

207
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,960
[Sahatorn] I spent many months trying
to persuade my wife until she agreed.

208
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:52,359
She said we could do this,
not because it might or might not work...

209
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,359
but we'd do it because I asked to.

210
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:06,519
The one thing that helped
even those who have no knowledge

211
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,839
of the technology to understand us
is our love for her.

212
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,039
He knew well
from looking at the medical reports.

213
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,759
We knew in our hearts
that she would pass away.

214
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,240
She'd gone as far as humanly possible.

215
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,960
The doctors admitted
that she would not survive.

216
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,359
PEDIATRICS 2

217
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,519
[Sahatorn] We have reached the end.

218
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,720
The end of what's medically,
humanly possible.

219
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,799
There's no more.
We have reached the limit.

220
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,680
[Nareerat] You are in our hearts, always.

221
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,119
[Sahatorn] If one day,
you wake up and watch this video,

222
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,799
maybe many hundreds of years from now,

223
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,200
we want you to know we love you.

224
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,400
[Nareerat] On her last day,
we were with her.

225
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Everyone in our family was with her.

226
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,839
We asked for Einz to die at home.

227
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,920
We prayed over her
and told her we loved her.

228
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,359
And prayed that we will see her again.

229
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,000
[woman 1] Dear all beings, our friends
in sin who are born, age, suffer and die.

230
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,319
May you find contentment.
May you find contentment.

231
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,720
May there be no bad fate.

232
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,599
May you find contentment,
have no pain in your body and your heart.

233
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,200
May you be content in body and mind.
Take care of your mind and soul.

234
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,640
Find contentment in both.
Forever and beyond.

235
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,440
[woman 2] May you find so much happiness.

236
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,960
-[woman 1] You can go now, little fighter.
-[woman 2 sniffles]

237
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,559
[Sahatorn] Matrix has described
that day as

238
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,839
being in slow motion.

239
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,799
Everything repeating itself,
creating a wound in his heart.

240
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,079
At the time that Einz passed,
the doctor examined her immediately...

241
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,160
and he pronounced her dead.

242
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,640
Then we began the cryonics process.

243
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,240
[Aaron Drake in English] As soon as
the heart stops beating,

244
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,000
we wanna start immediately.

245
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,359
Sixty seconds if possible.

246
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,720
Here we are with this family
and they're willing to be in the room.

247
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,440
To witness, to see, to help.

248
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:12,039
And this girl who just passed away
is being opened up, surgically.

249
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,160
I've just... I've never seen that before.

250
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,359
Okay, let's cut it.

251
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,759
To overcome that is true love,
in my opinion.

252
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,119
The fact that we were there in Thailand

253
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,440
and in place before she died
is very important.

254
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,400
The biggest fear is that we won't be there
when they die,

255
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,079
and will that prevent them
from being cryopreserved.

256
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,400
We're using cold,

257
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:52,440
profound hypothermia,
as a way to maintain cellular viability.

258
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,119
By doing that, as future sciences,
future technologies develop...

259
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,680
we may be able to come up with a cure
for what they died of.

260
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,359
[Sahatorn in Thai]
Einz's body temperature decreased...

261
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,960
until we closed the capsule
and sent her to America.

262
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,240
At that moment,
I was grieving beyond words.

263
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,359
I told her,
"Come back and be my daughter again.

264
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,839
Mommy loves you so much."

265
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,599
This is the dress my whole family loves,
especially her father.

266
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,319
When he saw it, he said right away
he wanted to buy it for Einz.

267
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
While awaiting her birth,
we named her Einz.

268
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,480
Einz was our beloved.

269
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,200
We bought this dress in two sizes.

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
A size for a one-year-old,
and a bigger one for a three-year-old.

271
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,160
Einz wore this white dress
even when it was too big for her.

272
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,839
She wore it nearly every day,
for every special occasion,

273
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:41,279
for her first and second birthdays.

274
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,440
But Einz didn't live long enough

275
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,799
to wear it on her third birthday.

276
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,559
On days we feel discouraged,

277
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,599
or exhausted and want to hug Einz...

278
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,079
we hug this white dress.

279
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,240
[voice breaking] Because it feels
like Einz is here.

280
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,839
[Sahatorn] In Buddhism, we believe
that when a body dies and disintegrates...

281
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,039
tangible elements will transform

282
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,599
into other things.

283
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,559
They are not permanent.

284
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,359
But there is the intangible.

285
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,039
It controls how things come to being.

286
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
Some call it the soul.

287
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,559
We cannot say Einz is truly dead,

288
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,519
but we now we have been parted...

289
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,119
and it will be very difficult
to meet again.

290
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,119
I told my son,
"Remember, your sister is there."

291
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,759
One day, technology will be able
to fix matter on a molecular level.

292
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,640
On that day,
Einz will have another chance.

293
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,599
[whimsical music playing]

294
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
[indistinct chatter]

295
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
-Did it hit the target yet?
-It has.

296
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,160
E and...

297
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,839
I haven't fixed it yet.

298
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,640
[Sahatorn] Go ahead and use one line
as the INT of the Y, okay?

299
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,640
And another line as the INT of motor X.

300
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,920
That way, you keep the code neat.

301
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,079
[Matrix in English] I have a passion
for science...

302
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,279
since I was the only child in my family.

303
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Most of the things...

304
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:24,200
scientific things I've done
have been triggered by my dad.

305
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,160
He asked me whether I'm interested
in this and that.

306
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,799
Then I'll be like, "Yeah, sure."
And then I do it.

307
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,519
[in Thai] This is test number seven.

308
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,720
It's not igniting.

309
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,880
Test number 11.

310
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,839
Test number 44.

311
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,240
Test number 50.

312
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,559
Success! Success!

313
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,920
[in English] My biggest motivation
in science is...

314
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,920
Right now, it's my sister.

315
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,720
[in Thai] I don't need to adjust
the focus or anything, just look?

316
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,839
[woman] That's right.

317
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,920
[Matrix in English] So,
to have my sister frozen,

318
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,880
it's like keeping her in a capsule
where the clock is not ticking.

319
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,240
So, it stopped right there...

320
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,920
and wait for the technology in the future
to bring her back.

321
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,599
[Max More] The inevitable question is,
"When will we bring our patients back?"

322
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,640
Um, I really can't answer that question.

323
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,559
The exact details of the revival process
are unknown to us.

324
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,759
We're clear on that when people
make arrangements to be cryopreserved.

325
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,359
We're set up as a non-profit,
tax-exempt organization.

326
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,960
Now, if you want to go as a whole body,
that's a minimum of $200,000.

327
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,440
If you want to just cryopreserve
the brain, that's only $80,000.

328
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,279
It's hard to say
we're exploiting people's grief because...

329
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,359
almost all our members sign up
for this process well ahead of need.

330
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
[Aaron] In order for cryonics to work,

331
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,960
you have to really look at what would be
the mechanism to make it work.

332
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,720
Some people are hopeful
that regenerative medicine,

333
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,319
three-dimensional printing,
stem cell seeding,

334
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
we could maybe regrow a whole new body.

335
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,519
Some people are looking at nanotechnology,

336
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,240
where they're going
and doing repair at the cellular level.

337
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,519
Some people are looking
at the connectome theory in neuroscience,

338
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,960
where if we can just preserve the brain,

339
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,720
once we have the ability
to 3D scan that brain,

340
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,960
we may be able to create
a whole new person.

341
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,799
Or this may never work.

342
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,559
[Max] This is just my guess,
but I'm imagining that

343
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,319
you might first be brought back
to consciousness in virtual reality.

344
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,920
To prevent you getting into trouble
in the real world,

345
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
like walking in front of a flying car
or who knows what.

346
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,359
In Matheryn's case, I hope her family
will be there and she'll recognize them.

347
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,839
Hopefully, they'll be around the same age

348
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,559
or younger than when she last saw them
because we'll solve the aging problem.

349
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,319
[Matrix] The technology
which will be able to bring her back

350
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,240
is not gonna be like anything we see today

351
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,160
and I couldn't imagine
what it would be like yet.

352
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,119
[Sahatorn in Thai] Our body is
like hardware.

353
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,839
And the soul is software.

354
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,599
It's like we had manufactured

355
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,559
a defective computer.

356
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,720
So we have to put it on hold.

357
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,440
We believe that
the computer could work again.

358
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,799
We know how to assemble the human genome,

359
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,400
assemble DNA.

360
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,559
That means we are bringing life
to something that wasn't alive.

361
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,559
For sure, we are heading towards...

362
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,920
deathlessness.

363
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
That will be Einz's time.

364
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,960
Einz will wake up in a world
without disease.

365
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,840
[Nareerat] For our journey to visit Einz
at Alcor, in Arizona,

366
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:45,519
we've prepared CDs,
all the memories of her.

367
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,719
Like her first baby outfit,
shoes, bedding...

368
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,239
all her stories, her toys, clothes.

369
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,400
If she wakes up one day,
she will see the things

370
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,079
we've prepared for her.

371
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,119
It will be kept at Alcor.

372
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,000
[Sahatorn] I've already seen
a lot of images

373
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,800
of the cryonic facility interior.

374
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,519
So, I think that,
through these images I've seen,

375
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,800
I have a vague idea
of how their facilities will look.

376
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,400
It's not a grave or burial place.

377
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,719
More like a place to have a rest.

378
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,000
We plan to visit her regularly.

379
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,480
We are lucky.

380
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,679
It's like fate. Right?

381
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,679
Because the facility where Einz is
and our close friend's house

382
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,400
are located close to each other.
Only 30 minutes away.

383
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,320
Tomorrow, if all goes according to plan,

384
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,159
we'll go to Alcor along with our friends.

385
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,760
You're heavy.

386
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
[indistinct chatter]

387
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,519
FOREVER WITH US
EINZ, THE LITTLE FIGHTER

388
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,119
Let me see. What are you writing?

389
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,679
-Heart.
-[Sahatorn] One heart.

390
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,199
[Nareerat] A heart. Draw a heart.

391
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,840
Do you want to wash it? Do you?

392
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,480
-[man in English] Hello.
-Hello.

393
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,599
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

394
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
So, what we'll show you today

395
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,679
is a little bit different
than what we did for Matheryn.

396
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,719
But this is more of
our standard sequence of procedures.

397
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
-Hello.
-Hello, there.

398
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,599
After we take the...
The patient's been legally pronounced,

399
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,760
the heart is stopped,

400
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,159
and the doctor has said
that they're clinically dead,

401
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,159
uh, we will move them off the hospital bed
and put them into this ice bath.

402
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,039
The next thing we wanna do

403
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,199
is we wanna
restore circulation of the blood.

404
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,960
In your case, we just did
compressions under the chest,

405
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,000
this would be way too big for her,
for an infant.

406
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,559
-But for an adult, this will compress...
-Yes.

407
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,000
...the heart between the sternum
and the spine.

408
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,000
And it will push the blood out
just as if the heart were contracting.

409
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
The next thing we wanna do
is we wanna get them into surgery.

410
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,039
So, we will fly the patient here
and we'll go into our surgery room

411
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,360
which is down the hall,
and I'll take you down there. Okay?

412
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,360
[in Thai] Matrix, did you take
photos of the parts

413
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
that interlock with each other yet?

414
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,199
Here.

415
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,119
These parts here. They're all important.

416
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,039
[Aaron in English] Some clients of ours
had decided to do a whole body.

417
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,159
This is our surgery table,
where we do our procedure.

418
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,199
Now, for those patients
who decide to do a neuro,

419
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,960
we've got a different container here,

420
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,239
where the head
will basically be surgically removed,

421
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
they'll be placed in here.

422
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,119
We'll put cannulas into the carotid artery
and we can flush basically in there.

423
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,679
So it's a little bit smaller container.

424
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,800
And, uh, this is, uh, how we--

425
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,920
[Sahatorn] Basically,
you separate the head

426
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,519
and put here, and connect the...

427
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,360
jugular veins.

428
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,119
-[Aaron] The carotid arteries.
-Uh-huh.

429
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,280
[Aaron] We push... The fluid goes in
and it comes out the jugular veins.

430
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,719
You're exactly right.

431
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,360
Just gets cooler and cooler
as we increase the concentration of fluid.

432
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,039
This is our patient care bay.

433
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,519
This is where
all 141 of our patients are stored.

434
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,400
So these are the dewars.

435
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,159
Uh, the dewars hold
any type of liquified gasses.

436
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,639
Liquid helium, liquid oxygen...
These hold liquid nitrogen.

437
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,400
Now, they don't require any power.

438
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,320
They're not plugged into the wall,
receiving electricity.

439
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,880
They're cold because
that's the temperature of liquid nitrogen.

440
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,079
Minus 196 degrees Celsius.

441
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,960
[in Thai] I still feel like a scientist.

442
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't feel like the father yet.
I'm still the scientist.

443
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,320
[in English] So, follow me in here,
into our patient care bay.

444
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,000
Um...

445
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,400
Most people think
it's gonna be really cold in here.

446
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,920
They think, "Liquid nitrogen,
minus 196 degrees Celsius...

447
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,159
It's gonna be cold."

448
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
-Let's see where Matheryn is.
-[Sahatorn] Yes.

449
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,119
Where is my baby?

450
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
[Aaron] This is Bigfoot 17, right here.

451
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,320
It holds our most recent patients.

452
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
So we talked about
there were five neuropods.

453
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,000
There's one at the very bottom.

454
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,800
There's one above that. She's in that one.

455
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,360
[Sahatorn] That means she is...
The level she is at is around here?

456
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,559
-[Aaron] No, right here.
-Around here?

457
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,719
[Aaron] Mmm-hmm.

458
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:26,960
[in Thai] Okay, everyone, come hold this.

459
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,880
Here's Einz's dress.

460
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,519
[sniffles] Let's put her photo here.

461
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,880
[Sahatorn] We had thought that sending her
to America was the last of it.

462
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,679
We would return to school, return to work.

463
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,920
Alcor wanted us to tell this success story

464
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
of the cryonics process for a child
far away in Asia,

465
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
the first time in the world.

466
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,480
Our friends called us from abroad

467
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,599
to say our story had made headlines
in their country.

468
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:49,760
We were shocked
to see how quickly it spread.

469
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:53,320
Hundreds of outlets published the story.

470
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,639
It became global news.

471
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,480
For us,

472
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,760
we had no idea this would happen.

473
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,159
The program welcomes Dr. Sahatorn.

474
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,599
Welcome to our show.

475
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,119
Say hello to Dr. Sahatorn Naovaratpong.

476
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,440
Oh, dear, you froze her body?

477
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:21,880
And you sent her whole body overseas?
That can't be.

478
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,679
Please explain to us

479
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,480
what this is all about
and why you're doing this.

480
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,199
Cryonics is a process
that freezes you, right?

481
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,119
We don't usually freeze the human body.

482
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,920
[interviewer] Let me ask you
this straight. Forgive me.

483
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,280
Does she know
her father's done this for her?

484
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,239
She was the first in Asia?

485
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,239
She was the first in Asia
and the youngest in the world.

486
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,559
If Einz is revived, she'll have no one.

487
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,639
What will it be like?
Do you think about that?

488
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,039
[Nareerat] We just say,

489
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,360
please see from the point of view
of a scientific family

490
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,840
who loves their daughter
with all their heart.

491
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,320
Twelve!
Twelve operations on a two-year-old!

492
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,360
Freezing her corpse...
Freezing her brain, or whatever it is...

493
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,480
Can you please explain this a bit more?

494
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:13,039
There's a human that's frozen

495
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,039
and that person will be thawed
in the future.

496
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,800
Is this something that can happen now?

497
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,119
This was really big news

498
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,480
that there was this father
who chose to freeze his own daughter.

499
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,440
The head in particular.

500
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,920
[interviewer] Actually, you also work
with cancer, right?

501
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And you've also given
to various foundations

502
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:36,920
or funds for genetic research.

503
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,239
Publicizing the research in this area
and how you can contribute to this fund

504
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,119
are why I'm happy to be interviewed today.

505
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:48,239
The reason behind all of this...

506
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,000
is to preserve the parts
of Einz's soulless body

507
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,079
that would help her in the future.

508
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:59,679
Then there's all the critics
in Thai society asking,

509
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,320
"Are you keeping her soul
from resting in peace?"

510
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,000
[Matrix in English] People that really
believe in the idea

511
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:08,639
of reincarnation would say that

512
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,440
we are trapping her soul.

513
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,360
[in Thai] Don't you feel like it's going
against fate, against destiny or karma?

514
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,360
Some might think,
and pardon me for saying this,

515
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,280
you are imprisoning her,
according to Buddhism.

516
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,599
Imprisoning her soul.

517
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:32,199
If they are just keeping her head
and don't cremate it with her body,

518
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,000
many will believe she left
to the next world incomplete.

519
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,440
She is still tied to this world.

520
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,400
Her parents haven't allowed her
to leave without worry.

521
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,039
So, I accept that
I have not been able to let go.

522
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,639
I don't care that people think
we cannot let go

523
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:55,440
and that we still hold on to her.

524
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,559
This is who I am. I can't let go.

525
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,679
She is in a refrigerator
where the temperature is -192 °C.

526
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,159
[interviewer] So she's still alive?

527
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,880
She's alive.

528
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,840
But without biological activity.

529
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,119
[interviewer] On the cellular level.

530
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:10,280
So you won't see her again?

531
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,880
If I only wanted to see her, it'd mean
I'm only doing this for selfish reasons.

532
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,800
But if you want
to give your child a chance,

533
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,920
to give life is to give opportunity.

534
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,960
Without life, you have no opportunity.

535
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,800
And that's why I'm giving her this.

536
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,760
[Sahatorn] What I return to is...

537
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,280
thinking about her body.

538
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,440
I refuse to believe that
I have the ability to trap her soul.

539
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,559
When I look at video clips
of Einz playing,

540
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:59,440
part of her soul is in there.

541
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,320
It's in the photons bouncing off her
into the camera through some process.

542
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,679
She's saved in there...

543
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,159
and in every atom
that has come into contact with Einz.

544
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:22,119
That's why I believe her soul is intact.
Her software is intact.

545
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,400
And she may come back
when those particles take a new form.

546
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,320
If she comes back to her old self,
is that reincarnation?

547
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,880
That's how science would explain it.

548
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:48,920
It would be her rebirth.

549
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:06,039
Actually, our minds must be unwell.

550
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:12,559
The minds of everyone
in our family are unwell.

551
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,079
But we willingly submerge

552
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,679
ourselves in our pain

553
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,559
so we can feel that

554
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,280
we still have her in our minds.

555
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,199
[Matrix in Thai] Today, I'm ordaining
as a novice monk.

556
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,199
When my sister was sick,
I promised her I would ordain for her.

557
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:46,760
I haven't decided for how long yet.
I'm thinking two weeks.

558
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,039
Please take care of Matrix.

559
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,880
[Phra Kitiwimonmaytee]
Let him go while he's here.

560
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,679
Matrix will cut out any longing.

561
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,719
He will share his problems with me only.

562
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,760
He can't call home and ask for things.

563
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,440
He will live like a novice monk.

564
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,679
[Matrix] I'm hoping that, by ordaining,

565
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,079
I will be able to send protection
to my sister in the afterlife.

566
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,480
So I can find some peace of mind.

567
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:28,440
On this day,

568
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:36,199
I give you my blessing, grandson,
that you will have luck,

569
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,920
be rid of sadness,
of disease and depression.

570
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,880
Okay?

571
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,199
My dear son,

572
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,079
I hope that you find happiness.

573
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,199
I'm so proud to be your mother.

574
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,679
[Phra] When we lose, we weep.
We weep because we have lost.

575
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,920
Because we haven't accepted the truth.

576
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,599
Our minds haven't opened wide enough
to accept the real truth.

577
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,760
All life experiences
aging, suffering, and death.

578
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,519
There's no way to calculate

579
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,920
when or where you will die.

580
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,400
When they accept this truth,
their sadness will wane.

581
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,719
They will be able to turn that sadness
into strength.

582
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,159
[indistinct chatter]

583
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,440
[man laughing]

584
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,400
[Matrix] I do miss my sister.
I'm sad because I miss her.

585
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,159
I miss...

586
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
the songs she sings.

587
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,920
I miss her crying.

588
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,440
I miss the sound of her
calling our names. Calling my name.

589
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,519
[monks chanting]

590
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,000
Ordaining these two weeks means
I can think less about the outside world.

591
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,519
It also gives my family some relief.

592
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,440
So...

593
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,840
it will help calm my mind down.

594
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
[chanting continues]

595
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,599
[chanting continues]

596
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:06,719
[Sahatorn] I've only dreamed of Einz once
since she died.

597
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,440
I'm at this place where

598
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:15,639
the scientists there told me...

599
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,360
Einz's repairs are about to be done.

600
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:26,679
I walked over to her.

601
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,960
And I asked the scientists,

602
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,880
"Will she hear me, if I speak?"

603
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,079
They told me,

604
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,440
"She can sense that you are here."

605
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,360
So I went over
and called her name, "My little Einz..."

606
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,760
She moved a little.

607
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,320
Then I had this feeling.

608
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
This isn't real.

609
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
I know very well
the technology is not here yet.

610
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,039
[Matrix in English] My parents,
especially my dad...

611
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,800
he thinks that he wouldn't
be able to live up

612
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,000
until the point where my sister
could be brought back.

613
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,679
So he passed on the dream
of bringing her back,

614
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,880
which was originally his dream,

615
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,920
but now I felt like
it's a part of my dream now

616
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,840
and I really want to bring her back.

617
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:11,559
Uh, right there,
there's my dad's liquid nitrogen tank,

618
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,440
which is used to store my sister's cells.

619
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,920
In the future, I might use those cells,

620
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,840
grow it, so I can have more of it,
and test medicines on it.

621
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:43,760
Well, I dreamt about it several times.

622
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,679
About her.

623
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,000
Two years old,
with an older version of me.

624
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,840
[chuckles] I don't even know,
50, 60 years old.

625
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:00,119
To have her back,

626
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:07,800
well, would be the greatest achievement
of my life.

627
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,239
The old "brain in a vat"
just got an upgrade.

628
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,079
In a first, California-based
research group 21st Century Medicine

629
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:26,519
successfully froze and then thawed
the brain of a mammal, a rabbit.

630
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,800
Researchers have thawed out a rabbit brain
from cryogenic stage

631
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,400
and done it completely successfully
without damaging the brain.

632
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,679
This is a huge breakthrough, Margaret,
and this has gotten them an award

633
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,440
from the Brain Preservation Foundation.

634
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:45,519
[Molly] The foundation said,
"It is the first demonstration

635
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,280
that near perfect long-term
structural preservation

636
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,079
of an intact mammalian brain
is achievable."

637
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:54,559
[Mark] Obviously, this is in research
towards the goal

638
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:59,199
of cryogenically freezing humans
and bringing them back.

639
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,800
The neuroscience community
is in love with the idea

640
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,400
that they can finally map out,
in three dimensions,

641
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,920
the precise neural circuitry of brains.

642
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,400
It's the first time you have
a brain-banking technique

643
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,400
that can preserve an entire connectome
in a brain, uh, for at least 100 years.

644
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,079
[Kenneth] All right, so let's review
what we've got here.

645
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:27,360
[Robert] The connectome at a real general
level is how is the brain wired together.

646
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,320
Um, what neurons are connected
to what other neurons.

647
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,280
[man] And I like this image the most.

648
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:39,760
[Kenneth] In the future, you would do
a full scan of that human brain,

649
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,719
uh, so that you can map out each
and every synaptic connection,

650
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,119
understand those connections,
and simulate them in a computer

651
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,159
to bring the person
back to life digitally.

652
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,039
So I think this is
a synaptic junction right there.

653
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:01,960
I would say, in my expert opinion,

654
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:06,880
that, uh, people can trace
the synaptic connectivity

655
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,480
of this preserved pig brain.

656
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:12,840
So, definitely, in the very near future,

657
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,840
I'm hoping to preserve
a whole human connectome

658
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,559
and demonstrate that all
of the connections are still there

659
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,639
the same way I did for the rabbit brain.

660
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,519
[Matrix] To hear that he could preserve
a rabbit's brain

661
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,639
and maintain the structure
of the connectome of the brain

662
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,119
makes me think that bringing
my sister back is not that far away,

663
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,440
and it might happen
in couple of decades, maybe.

664
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,920
My parents, especially my dad,

665
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:12,199
he asked me whether I'll be interested
in meeting the scientist.

666
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,880
Well, the answer was a definite yes.

667
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,079
The technology there, in the US,

668
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:32,360
would get me closer
to bringing my sister back.

669
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,760
[Sahatorn in Thai] He is sort of like...

670
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,239
in the category of a genius.

671
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,159
And his thinking is very different.

672
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,360
It looks like he's not that old.

673
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,639
[Matrix] That's right.

674
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,440
He's not even 30 yet.

675
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:55,800
Not even 30. Really?
This Robert McIntyre...

676
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,199
-Really?
-Yeah, I think he's only 28.

677
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,880
[Matrix in English] I think he just
asked me to, like...

678
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,840
to show me how one scientist
could make change

679
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,400
and that I might be able to be the one.

680
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
[in Thai] Matrix, sit up straight
and stretch your spine.

681
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,480
Otherwise, I can't cut properly.

682
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,000
So what do you want out of this?

683
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,159
When you go to America,
it is an investment.

684
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:30,719
And, in a sense,

685
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:38,079
it is... a trip

686
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,559
to develop yourself.

687
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:41,480
Okay?

688
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,920
In this self-development trip,

689
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,639
Robert is presenting you
with an opportunity.

690
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:58,000
Since he's giving you this opportunity,
you need to make some plans.

691
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,559
What will you ask him?

692
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,280
These questions...

693
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:05,400
When I read them,

694
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,760
I might say, "Oh, this question...

695
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,000
is it worth the journey all the way
over there to ask him?"

696
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,800
But Papa will not come up
with the questions for you.

697
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,480
Why? Because this is your duty.

698
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
[Matrix] Can you make the front
a bit shorter?

699
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:31,440
Maybe cut it all off.

700
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,880
-Really?
-[Matrix chuckles] Yes.

701
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,320
When I don't comb it...
it falls in my face.

702
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,480
Then I break out.

703
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,760
Well, if we cut it so short in front,
it will look a bit nerdy.

704
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,199
All right. Look in the mirror.

705
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,840
[Matrix in English] His method of doing it
is totally different.

706
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,400
He won the prize because
no one could do it before.

707
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,360
To be able to bring the same person
back from the dead,

708
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:13,360
you need her body,
her personalities, her memories.

709
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,880
And, uh, personalities and memories is...

710
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,000
what make that person that person.

711
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:30,440
[laptop chiming]

712
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,679
[Sahatorn in Thai] Can you see us, Matrix?

713
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,280
I see you but the video is frozen.

714
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,599
-[Sahatorn] Is the image quality bad?
-Yes. Very bad.

715
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,039
[laptop chimes]

716
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,360
-Hello, Dad.
-[Sahatorn] This works.

717
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,280
When you call, it works.
When I call, it doesn't.

718
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,760
Mmm.

719
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:57,519
[Sahatorn] Try not to make your face
so wide in front of the camera.

720
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,159
Maybe today is not good for this.

721
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,840
Why is your hair so messy?

722
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,239
Okay. Let's try tomorrow.

723
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,400
I love you, Mom and Dad.

724
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,239
[Sahatorn] Try and look
more handsome, okay?

725
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,719
We love you, Matrix.

726
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,320
Okay. Bye, Dad.

727
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:34,800
[in English] The biggest question
I would like to ask is...

728
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,519
how close are we to bringing her back?

729
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
[Robert] Well, welcome to my humble lab.

730
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:53,079
All right, so, anyways.

731
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,719
We're gonna make some washout solution,

732
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,800
and we're gonna make our osmium tetroxide
and, uh, it's gonna be awesome.

733
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,400
So this is a piece of brain tissue,
like, from the slices, tiny little bit.

734
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:11,079
[Matrix] The tiny, white...

735
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,320
That black thing.
Plus, see how thin it is?

736
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,320
Oh, the black thing on top?

737
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,199
Yeah. And then, you cut even more
insanely tiny little bits off,

738
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,440
with this ultramicrotome.

739
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,199
What do you think of that? [chuckles]

740
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,000
Whoa.

741
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:35,480
All right, you wanna
try your hand at cutting it?

742
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:39,840
So, uh, this knob moves this thing
forward a little bit.

743
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,239
So, twist it a tiny little bit forward,
like that much, okay?

744
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,119
And then you smoothly and slowly
go down like that.

745
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,760
Not bad.

746
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,840
But it's on the downstroke that... Yeah.

747
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,239
Uh, good luck. [chuckles]
And if you break it, that's okay.

748
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,760
That's fine.

749
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,480
I've always been interested
in how the brain works

750
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,719
and preserving memories.

751
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,280
All of the things that enable you
to be yourself,

752
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,239
not just knowledge
or previous experiences,

753
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,960
but also your particular approach
and your personality,

754
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,840
those are all ultimately memories.

755
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,719
And so, if you're not preserving
the connectome,

756
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,679
if your preservation technique just
destroys all the synapses, for example,

757
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,280
then almost certainly,
it's not preserving memory.

758
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,239
I think, ultimately,

759
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,719
our memories and our
individual perspectives on the world

760
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,199
are worth preserving.

761
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,920
Um, they're incredibly valuable.

762
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,280
So you gotta get the cryoprotectant in
as fast as possible, right?

763
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,000
Um, but...

764
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,639
To avoid toxicity, right?

765
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:51,440
Um, and you gotta do it
at lower temperatures

766
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:54,719
because that's also
gonna decrease toxicity.

767
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,639
But if you put the cryoprotectant in
too quickly, it dehydrates the brain.

768
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,000
Pulls all the water out of it
and it damages the structures.

769
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:08,280
I decided to stay in the, uh, room

770
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,159
where the procedure was being done

771
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:18,960
and, uh, I saw her face and her eyeballs
just got sucked in.

772
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:23,560
-Mmm-hmm.
-So I didn't understand what happened,

773
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,520
then my dad told me
that she's being dehydrated.

774
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,840
And so, her brain...

775
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:41,079
with the water being replaced with
cryoprotectant to prevent ice crystals,

776
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:45,000
now that she's dehydrated,
and her brain is dehydrated,

777
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,159
so her brain's shrunken?

778
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,039
Oh. So the structure of the neurons
wouldn't be the same.

779
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:57,000
There's no answers to that right now.

780
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,199
Um...

781
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:04,119
My estimate is 0.1% chance

782
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,600
that the current techniques
that we have actually work.

783
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,560
So bringing them back
would be really hard because

784
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,000
the structure would likely be destroyed?

785
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:24,199
I think that it's important to focus
on connectome preservation.

786
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:29,520
But you also can't say that, for sure,
all that data is gone.

787
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,439
The question is how much damage
can you do to that

788
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,840
for the search process
to find the original connectome.

789
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,199
Either can't find it,
or the search base is so huge

790
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,479
that it would take forever
to find it, right?

791
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,760
I kind of have to think about that.

792
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:51,000
'Cause being brought back
without memories is...

793
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,079
not actually being brought back.

[Matrix in Thai] Hello, Dad and Mom.

796
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,159
Hi, Matrix. How are you?

797
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:32,399
I'm doing pretty well.
I went to meet Robert.

798
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:41,079
-Did you ask him any questions?
-Well, I had prepared questions for him.

799
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:42,039
But...

800
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:45,000
-But you didn't ask him any?
-I did.

801
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,640
But I didn't ask all the questions.

802
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:52,560
However, my perspective
has shifted a little.

803
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,039
-How did it change?
-It changed...

804
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:59,479
The question I prepared was...

805
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:05,079
"How close are we to bringing Einz back?"

806
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,760
But after talking to him,

807
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,920
I found out that he believed
in cryonics when he was younger.

808
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,119
He was sure it would work, 100%.

809
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:21,039
But now that he works in this field,
and tried using the standard methods,

810
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,479
he found out that, uh...

811
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:32,920
even though some cells are alive
and can function as cells...

812
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,840
Well, they've been dehydrated,

813
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,159
so the conditions of the synapses

814
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:44,399
and the connectome are broken.

815
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,640
Like a building...

816
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:53,159
that's been demolished.

817
01:11:53,239 --> 01:12:00,199
Making the preservation of the memories

818
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,279
a very difficult thing.

819
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:08,399
For him, this means the probability
that we can bring a person back,

820
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:13,239
with all their memories intact,
is only 0.1%.

821
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:16,119
Well...

822
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,479
when he said that
the chance of bringing a person back

823
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:29,199
with their memories is only 0.1%,
I felt a bit disappointed.

824
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,640
[Sahatorn] There has to be
a reconnection process.

825
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,560
Yes.

826
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,640
[Sahatorn] We have to wait for better
technology to reconnect everything.

827
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,560
Right.

828
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,119
[Sahatorn] Better technology.

829
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,560
It's a step further from just freezing.

830
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:53,119
Yes, Robert told me that it won't be easy.

831
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,880
Just for her to be thawed

832
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,319
at the right pace
for detoxification, it isn't enough.

833
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:08,279
They have to rehydrate the brain,
since it has been dehydrated.

834
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:11,479
And they have to reconnect everything.

835
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,319
Then, they have to give her a body
and cure the cancer.

836
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:18,560
It is difficult. Especially difficult.

837
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,720
He said that it might not be accomplished

838
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,000
within our lifetime.

839
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,399
Don't think too hard about this.

840
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,000
If you believe humans
will one day travel the universe,

841
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:31,680
then this won't be a problem.

842
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,920
Right.

843
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,920
[Sahatorn] It won't be a problem.

844
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,840
It's okay. We can be patient.
We can wait a thousand years.

maybe time machines will exist then.

So that when you grow up,

you can't say, "Mommy doesn't love me!"
