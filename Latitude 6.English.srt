1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,375
This movie was made to create an
understanding of differences that exist.

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,708
The content in the film does not intend
to insult or refer to anyone.

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:23,833
It's fictional.

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,041
All humans, Allah created humans,
both male and female,

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,916
divided into nations, various groups,
in order to get to know each other.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,125
And God is the expert,

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,916
according to Quran Al-Hujurat verse 13.

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,875
In the morning,
four more explosions occurred

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,291
in the area of Sateng Nok Sub-district,
Capital District, Yala Province.

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,208
Initially, two people were injured.

11
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,833
Officials have checked in
and collected evidence.

12
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,125
They believe that
it is creating a continuous situation...

13
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,375
After that there was a bomb...

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,916
-Uncle Ton.
-Yes?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,583
Your phone is ringing.

16
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,041
There are both Thai Buddhists
and Thai Muslims...

17
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,166
Hello?

18
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,333
Are you leaving?

19
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,958
I'm taking off now.

20
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,125
And don't forget. If we get signed,
you'll have to come for rehearsal.

21
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,291
Just set up a system, be back in no time.

22
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,666
Bro, stop here.

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
-Here, here.
-Get off, get off.

24
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,458
-Come on.
-Teacher!

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,416
-What?
-The tickets?

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,625
Shit, I forgot to think about them.

27
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,000
-Wait.
-Where are they?

28
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,375
One, two, three, four, five.

29
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,541
Uncle Ton, hurry up! The train is leaving.

30
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,875
-Over there.
-Go, go, go.

31
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,041
-Which one?
-Hurry, hurry.

32
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry.

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,666
Sharif, come here.

34
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,791
Uncle Ton! Uncle Ton!

35
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,916
Yes, sweetie.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are you going?

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,666
Our bogie is here.

38
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,166
Well...

39
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,416
Let's go.

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,250
SUNGAI KOLOK

41
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,625
LATITUDE 6

42
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,125
Bao Won, are you ready?

43
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,083
Three, two, one.

44
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,416
Hello our beloved Pattani!

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,291
I'm Salinee Panyarachun. I'm here to
welcome you to the beautiful morning.

46
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,666
This is a handsome man.
I can't be here without him.

47
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,458
Thank you, Earng.

48
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,125
Hello to all girls and guys.

49
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,833
Wow! Love that energy.

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,458
-Thai Christian, Buddhist, Muslim...
-Where are you going?

51
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,875
Reen!

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,041
Reen!

53
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,833
Where are you going?

54
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,875
-Fern, Sharif is back.
-Really?

55
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,541
Wait up.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,375
-Korsem, Korsem.
-Reen.

57
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,166
What's up?

58
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,000
Sharif is back.

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,625
Did he win?

60
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,125
Hello.

61
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,833
Mom, Sharif is back.

62
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,250
-Pa, I'll be back.
-Yeah.

63
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,041
Sem, did you run away again?

64
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,958
Who's going to help Papa here?

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,708
Hello!

66
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,333
Welcome you to "Latitude 6"

67
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,583
the happy latitude
of little note with me, Fern.

68
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:32,125
Well, let's start with the first tune
this morning, here we go.

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,875
Arsem, have you checked your stuff?

70
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,041
-Did you forget anything?
-No, but I'm aching.

71
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,000
-Yeah. All set.
-How about you two?

72
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,208
Uncle Ton.

73
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,041
Uncle Ton.

74
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,583
Let's go.

75
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,458
Better go a bit further up,
might be there.

76
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,125
Pa.

77
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,166
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-Walaikum Assalam.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,250
Sharif is back.

79
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,083
And he lost again.

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Assalamu Alaikum.

81
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,541
Hassan,
how is it going with fixing the Masjid?

82
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,500
We put it on hold for now.

83
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,916
I'm fundraising
for more budget on construction.

84
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,375
I need a cooperation from everyone.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,500
-You only come to see Papa.
-You are stupid.

86
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,125
There's nobody here.

87
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,125
Uncle Ton.

88
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,625
Hey!

89
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,083
Excuse me.

90
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,916
TON

91
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,375
Excuse me.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,041
Allah!

93
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,000
Allah!

94
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,666
I was just having a good sleep.

95
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,666
Are you Ton?

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
-Yes.
-Sorry, I was napping a bit too long.

97
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,541
Welcome to Pattani.

98
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,375
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-Hello.

99
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,000
It's hello for Muslim.

100
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,166
Yes.

101
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,875
-It's so beautiful.
-It's a clock tower.

102
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,458
Its engine is powerful.

103
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,250
We live in the country,
it got to be powerful.

104
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,500
-Yeah?
-Yes.

105
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,666
-Assalamu Alaikum, Bung Aoh.
-Walaikum Assalam.

106
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
How are you?

107
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,541
-I'm good.
-Good. Have you eaten?

108
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,208
Yes, how about you?

109
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,291
Not yet, since the morning.

110
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,166
Since you are here.

111
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,083
-Ton, this is Bung Aoh.
-Hello.

112
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,916
He owns this place.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,041
You will stay on second floor
while you work here.

114
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,875
And...

115
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,166
-Do I have no choice?
-Ton.

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,708
Don't worry.
Bung Aoh is like my big brother.

117
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,833
-Bung Aoh.
-Yeah?

118
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,833
Please take care of Ton.

119
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,875
I'll run some errands with the guys.

120
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,958
See you later, Faifoo.
Make yourself at home.

121
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,625
Uncle Ton.

122
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,583
Your vehicle is so cute.

123
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,000
Fatima.

124
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,041
Assalamu Alaikum.

125
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,541
Walaikum Assalam.

126
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,500
Fatima.

127
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,583
Why do you dressed like this?

128
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,250
There is nothing wrong with it.

129
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,041
Muslim girls dress up properly.

130
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,166
My daughter is a teacher.

131
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,791
She sets a good example for others.

132
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Remember that.

133
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,000
I know.

134
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,583
And you leave me, leave home.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,916
Don't you think of coming back at all?

136
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,916
Do you want to live in Bangkok forever?

137
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,916
I never think of leaving you here alone.

138
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,583
I'm waiting for my job in Bangkok.

139
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,541
It should be ready in a few months.

140
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,958
I'm here this time,
to ask you to live with me there.

141
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,333
I'm not going anywhere.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,833
Pa, if you are still here,
you know I'll be worried about you.

143
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,791
If Mama was alive,
she would want you to move.

144
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,041
Let's not talk about this.

145
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,708
Go unpack your stuff and take a shower.

146
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,125
You're free now.
You just take care of me here.

147
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,708
You know,
they are short of teachers at school.

148
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,666
I have arranged
with the principle already.

149
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,541
Are you used to it now, bro Rif?

150
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,666
-What do you mean?
-I mean to lose.

151
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,166
You rascal!

152
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,583
It's called an experience.

153
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,166
At least I know one more way to lose.

154
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
Isn't that too many already?

155
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,166
Don't you want to know how to win?

156
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,541
Do you want a fight? You rascal!

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,750
Sharif.

158
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,916
You should focus on study.

159
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,583
Stop playing around.

160
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,625
Think about your future.

161
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,958
Come on, let's eat, Pa.

162
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,583
Have your meal, son.

163
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,708
-Make sure you lock the door.
-Yes, good night.

164
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,916
Bye bye.

165
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,458
Dad.

166
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,958
Sharif and the boys have come back.

167
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,833
They lost again.

168
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,416
Aren't they tired of it?

169
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:31,875
But maybe, they'll take back
the championship next time.

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,708
Mom is coming, I gotta go.

171
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
Fern.

172
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,708
-Fern.
-Yes?

173
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,000
What a hard worker you are.

174
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,166
Do you really want to get the top score?

175
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,083
Come on, Mom.

176
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,666
Systematic development together.

177
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,750
The government is committed
to resolve the problems.

178
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,625
In accordance
with the needs of the people,

179
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,916
introduce sufficiency economy philosophy
as a guideline for development...

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,875
Hello, ma'am.

181
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,458
Hello, Sharif.

182
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,666
-Is Fern here?
-She is upstairs.

183
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,958
Fern.

184
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,583
Fern.

185
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,291
What's up? How come you are so early?

186
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,875
Don't you normally wake up late?

187
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,291
My papa woke me up.

188
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,166
But it's good, I can do the warm up early.

189
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,375
Like you are so physically fit.

190
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,416
How about we go for bicycle race?

191
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,333
See who will get to school first.

192
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
The loser gives a treat, okay?

193
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,916
How gentleman of you!

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,166
Uncle Ton,

195
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,375
you are late since the first day.

196
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,791
-Hurry up. It's hot now.
-Coming.

197
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,583
-Uncle Ton.
-I'm ready!

198
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,208
I think Uncle Moustache looks so kind.

199
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,375
Yes, but...

200
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,125
I think we should not bother him.

201
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,375
Why?

202
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,291
It's nothing.

203
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,375
-I'm only worried about you.
-Okay.

204
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,083
But don't forget my parents' memorial day.

205
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,583
I want to make a merit for them.

206
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,291
Of course, I won't forget.

207
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,625
-Do you really study?
-Sharif.

208
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,583
Don't forget our deal.
Give me some treats.

209
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,666
How did you get here before me?

210
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,000
How come?

211
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,208
Hey, Rif.

212
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,166
You know,

213
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,916
I had a girl on my bike this morning.

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,083
-What a sore loser!
-Who?

215
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,916
Bai Fern.

216
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,125
Here we go, hurry up.

217
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,708
We are late already.

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,125
-I'm sorry, hurry up.
-It's my first day.

219
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,166
Attention, please!

220
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,625
Where are you from?

221
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,750
I haven't seen you before.

222
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,208
I've just moved in from Bangkok.

223
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,916
Great!

224
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,458
What a great looking guy.
I wonder which hospital you'd end up.

225
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,833
I'm kidding.

226
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
And what are you doing here?

227
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,208
I'm here to take care of you.

228
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,500
Hurry up! They are all in the class now.

229
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,625
-Go.
-Don't be late again.

230
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,625
Yes.

231
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,000
-Excuse me.
-What now?

232
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
Where is the Principal's office?

233
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,166
Go straight to seven,

234
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,750
turn right at five, then cut off at three,

235
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,750
that's it.

236
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,958
-Quickly, she's gonna be late.
-Okay.

237
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,333
-Don't be late tomorrow.
-Yes.

238
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,041
You should learn to be in time.

239
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,625
Hello, I'm Faifoo.

240
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,125
Or Chanaree Sookcharoen.

241
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,708
Everybody take care of her, all right?

242
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,041
I will take care of her.

243
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,750
Thank you, Yasat.

244
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,166
-You can take a seat over there.
-All right.

245
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,500
Have you done your homework?

246
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,208
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,750
The fees and the registration
are all done.

248
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,583
-Yes.
-So...

249
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
The only thing you are missing is...

250
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,208
where do you live, get the address

251
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,375
-and the phone number.
-Okay, got it.

252
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,000
That's Fa.

253
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,166
Fa?

254
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,625
Do you know her?

255
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,708
-No, I don't.
-Fa?

256
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,000
-Fa, is it?
-Yes.

257
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,166
I don't know her.

258
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,958
Aren't you in a hurry to go to work?

259
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,041
Yes.

260
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,458
Yes, I have to go.

261
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,916
-Good bye, sir.
-Bye.

262
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,833
Faifoo, isn't Bangkok good?
Why do you move here?

263
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,916
It's not like that.
It's just my uncle comes to work here.

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,833
So I have to come with him.

265
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,708
Wow, that's beautiful.

266
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,541
Who is this?

267
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,208
They are my parents and this is my uncle.

268
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,416
-What is your name?
-My name is Reen.

269
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,208
Hello, my name is Yasat.

270
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,708
What are you doing, Yasat?

271
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,125
I only want to get to know Faifoo.

272
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:30,916
Hey, hey, hey!

273
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,625
What are you doing, Yasat?

274
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,083
Go get your friends to the class.
It's time.

275
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,625
-Yes.
-No, you go alone. Hurry up. Run.

276
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,958
It's five minutes late already, always.

277
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,208
So here it is, you'll be
the class instructor for these kids.

278
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,583
All right?

279
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,125
Hello, kids. I'm Teacher Fa.

280
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,625
Yes, Teacher Fwa.

281
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,833
-Fa.
-Yes, Fwa.

282
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,958
All right.

283
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,083
ISLAMIC BANK

284
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,250
Everybody,

285
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,166
this is Ton.
He'll take care of the IT system for us.

286
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,250
Please take care of him.

287
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

288
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,333
My friend, my friend.

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,958
I picked him up from the train station.

290
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,166
Let us know if you need anything.
We are all brothers here.

291
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,250
Okay, thank you.

292
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,583
I heard Musa said you have a daughter.

293
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,458
No, she is my niece. I don't have a kid.

294
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,750
-I see, so you are single?
-Yes.

295
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,458
Nobody picks you up yet?

296
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:36,291
No, Uncle Ton is always like this.

297
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,291
-Ma'am, hello.
-Hello.

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,166
Uncle Ton, you are late again.

299
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,875
I'm sorry, I got lost.

300
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,208
Come on. Come here.

301
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,458
She is just upset.
I saw her waiting alone for a while.

302
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,875
Thank you for taking care of her.

303
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,250
You're welcome.

304
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,916
Is she your daughter or niece?

305
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
My niece, sir.

306
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,583
A playboy always talks like this.

307
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,416
Come on, Fa. I'll take you home.

308
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,666
Yes.

309
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,416
Good bye.

310
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,625
-Good bye, Miss Fa.
-Good bye.

311
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,875
Don't you smile!

312
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,208
-Good luck, sweetie.
-Good bye.

313
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,125
Uncle Ton.

314
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,416
Yes.

315
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,625
Miss Fa is still single.

316
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,750
How do you know?

317
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,250
I don't see the ring on her finger.

318
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,125
You nosy little thing.

319
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,250
Don't you try to hide it. I know.

320
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,291
Here, eat it up.

321
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,916
-Just keep your mouth busy.
-Uncle Ton.

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,833
Do you want Miss Fa's number?

323
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,125
Just in case you come to pick me up late,

324
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,875
so you can call her and ask where I am.

325
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,166
Do you want it?

326
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,916
Do you want some fish?

327
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,666
That's a nice guitar, Ton.

328
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,375
-I'm so in the mood.
-Thank you.

329
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,208
Did you have a band?

330
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,875
Yes, with my friends.

331
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,416
But we were going nowhere,

332
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,541
-it was difficult.
-I...

333
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,750
used to have a band.

334
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,125
-Really?
-Yes.

335
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:27,458
-But not anymore.
-Really?

336
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,916
Did you go separate ways?

337
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,083
It always happens. That's normal.

338
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,291
-Can I play a bit?
-Of course, go ahead.

339
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,083
Here, here, here. Full on.

340
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,875
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-Walaikum Assalam.

341
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,333
How is it going? Is everything okay?

342
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,041
It shouldn't be a problem.

343
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,333
Everything is all right.

344
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,625
Sorry.

345
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,041
Bersedia.

346
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,750
Mulai.

347
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,583
Faster.

348
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,125
-Don't hit so hard.
-Hey.

349
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,708
Do you know you have radio interview
tomorrow morning?

350
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,333
I know. It's eight o'clock. So early.

351
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,125
Are you going to go?

352
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,958
Of course.

353
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,916
Fern always reminds me that.

354
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,833
-What's wrong with you?
-Well...

355
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,875
-You seem weird.
-Well...

356
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,250
I want you to help me with something.

357
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,291
Why is Sharif not here yet?

358
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,625
He might wake up late.

359
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,458
I told him yesterday not to be late.

360
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,500
He didn’t answer the phone.

361
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,583
Come on.

362
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,958
So after the interview,...

363
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,833
we should go to get something to eat.

364
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,708
-Korsem.
-Yes, Uncle.

365
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,666
Come here.

366
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,291
We should go to get something to eat.

367
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,166
Isn't that lame?

368
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,958
Yes.

369
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,416
-Don't do this again.
-Yes.

370
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,875
-Fern.
-Yes.

371
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,208
Come in and start the program,
it's the third song already.

372
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,416
Okay.

373
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,791
-Why don't you come in?
-Okay, Uncle.

374
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,625
Come on.

375
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,375
We won't wait any longer.

376
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,125
-Come in.
-Yes.

377
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,541
I got it all ready.

378
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,791
Okay.

379
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:33,500
-Ten more seconds, Korsem.
-Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,583
Oh, hey.

381
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,666
Sharif?

382
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,125
-Hello, Uncle.
-What are you doing here?

383
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,541
-I'm waiting for my friends.
-Waiting or sneaking up on them?

384
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,708
So?

385
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,333
I bought something for you.

386
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,833
I told you not to.

387
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,375
I'm not eating it.
I give it all to the kids.

388
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,666
Those two are cute, don't you think?

389
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,541
-Yes?
-I mean those two.

390
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,875
I saw them talking to each other.

391
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,958
I heard they will go out for a meal.

392
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,500
I guess they are couple.

393
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,291
No, they are not.

394
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,416
They will be soon.

395
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,083
Young love is always like this.

396
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,416
Yes.

397
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,416
Reen.

398
00:26:58,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Faifoo.

399
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,875
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-Walaikum Assalam.

400
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,916
Hello.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

402
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,750
-Yes.
-Mama, this is Uncle Ton,

403
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,750
Faifoo's Uncle.

404
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,666
-My new friend that I told you about.
-All right.

405
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,000
They have just moved from Bangkok.

406
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,375
-I'd like to show them Dikir Hulu.
-Do you know Dikir Hulu?

407
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,416
I don't, but I have heard about it.

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,458
I'd like to show them upstairs.

409
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,750
-Okay, please.
-Thank you.

410
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,000
-Can you please take care of her?
-Sure.

411
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,291
It has been really far from the south

412
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,000
But in hopes of study

413
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,750
But I speak Jawi

414
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,458
So my friends don't understand

415
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,125
I have to explain what is that word means

416
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,208
Fa.

417
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,375
Hi.

418
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,750
Hi, Ton. Hi there.

419
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,500
Assalamu Alaikum.

420
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,833
Walaikum Assalam.

421
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,833
-Assalamu Alaikum
-Do you have time for rehearsal today?

422
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:10,291
I brought along my friend, Ton.

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,125
-Also my colleague.
-Hello.

424
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,916
His niece want to meet Ireen.

425
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,625
-And I'd like to show him Dikir.
-That's good.

426
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,666
Please.

427
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,125
But I speak Jawi
So my friend don't understand

428
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,458
Ton is the guardian of Faifoo, my student.

429
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,583
Is he your Dad? Hello.

430
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,458
I'll wait downstairs.

431
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,416
-See you there soon.
-Okay.

432
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,541
-Take your time.
-See you, Bro.

433
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,833
Ton, this is my friend.

434
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,958
-Yameenah.
-Yameenah.

435
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,166
-Hello.
-Yes, Ton.

436
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,333
You can call me Ya.

437
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:55,500
It's shorter, easier and closer.

438
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,708
Assalamu Alaikum.

439
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,541
Walaikum Assalam.

440
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,250
-What's your name again?
-Ya.

441
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,458
-This is Miss Fa.
-Miss Fa?

442
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:05,625
Yes.

443
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,875
I see.

444
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,583
Class dismissed.

445
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,708
-Thank you, Miss.
-Thank you, Miss.

446
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,416
Let's go.

447
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,875
Rif, let's go eat.

448
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,166
You go ahead, I'll catch up.

449
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,875
Wait for a moment.

450
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,750
-Come here, here.
-Catch up soon, okay?

451
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,083
Yeah.

452
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,875
Hey, Rif.

453
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,166
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

454
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,125
I'm all right.

455
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:39,833
Here.

456
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,208
I know you haven't finished it.

457
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:48,333
It's okay, I can do it myself.
I'm almost done.

458
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,958
Don't forget to have lunch.

459
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,166
What's wrong?

460
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,541
You seem distracted.

461
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,750
I just have something to think about.

462
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,875
What's that?

463
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,041
My Pa said I spend too much time
on Pencak Silat

464
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,500
and don't pay attention in class.

465
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,083
He wants me to study to be a teacher.

466
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,875
What do you think? Are you going to quit?

467
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,750
I don't know.
Let's see the result at the next event.

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,416
But what do I have to change?

469
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:07,958
Your mind.

470
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:25,958
-Thank you.
-Bye.

471
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,666
Datuk Hassan.

472
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,500
What?

473
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,458
Pa said that...

474
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:56,833
we will have a meeting
with lmam at masjid tomorrow.

475
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:03,916
Reen.

476
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,583
Do you grow up here?

477
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,333
Yes, I've lived here since I was born

478
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,625
until high school
then I moved to Bangkok to study.

479
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,916
Actually, I want to find a job
and live there.

480
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:40,166
How about you, Ton?
It's been a while, still scared?

481
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:48,291
Sometimes.
I think I'm just not used to it yet.

482
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,875
It's not like in the news.

483
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,625
I'm not surprised
that you are not used to it.

484
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:00,375
I'm from here, I was born here.

485
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,875
I'm still not used to it
after I came back.

486
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,541
It looks like you don't like
living here, do you?

487
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,958
It's not like that.

488
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:18,250
I just feel like the rhythm of life
is different between here and there.

489
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,875
If I was not here this time,
I wouldn't feel it.

490
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,875
I guess I prefer the rhythm of Bangkok.

491
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,125
Like I told you.

492
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,166
I come back to take my Pa
move there with me.

493
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,666
Quickly!

494
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,041
Don't panic, Ton.

495
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:43,916
People are like this around here.

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,833
They might be loud or look angry.

497
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,458
But there is nothing. They are very kind.

498
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,000
I think people here are lovely.

499
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,833
Yes, lovely.

500
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,500
What?

501
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,708
Faifoo told me you are a musician.

502
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,916
Yes, he sings and writes good songs.

503
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,916
He is about to have an album released.

504
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,916
Really?

505
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,458
Not really.

506
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,583
It's just a dream.

507
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:39,333
I sent a demo
to the record company, but...

508
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,250
if they don't sign me this time,
I'll have to stop.

509
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,208
I've got to find something else.

510
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,583
But don't we all live for the dreams?

511
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,416
That's true.

512
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,541
Can you sing for me?

513
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,958
Come on, Uncle.

514
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,458
-Come on.
-No!

515
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:07,208
I'm a song writer.
I'm not very good at singing.

516
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,708
Hope I will hear your songs someday.

517
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,125
Thank you.

518
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:36,250
Pa, why are you not in bed yet? It's late.

519
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,208
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-Walaikum Assalam.

520
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:47,291
How is the masjid reconstruction?

521
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm not sure if we can finish in time.

522
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,291
I saw that you are quite close
to that man.

523
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:04,791
Just a friend, Pa. There's nothing.

524
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,458
Why don't you tell me?

525
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,166
I have to hear it from others.

526
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,333
I'm not mad at you.

527
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,583
You are a grown-up woman.

528
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,375
I just want you to be careful.

529
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,083
Yes.

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,208
I'll go to bed then.

531
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,250
It has been really far from the south

532
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,875
But in hopes of study

533
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,500
But I speak Jawi

534
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,833
-So my friend don't understand
-They are cute.

535
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:00,750
It's fun.

536
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,041
-I have to explain
-The kids are great.

537
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:07,875
What is that word means? What should I do?

538
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,291
I'm hungry. Lapanasi. I say no.

539
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,000
I heard a van was bombed nearby.

540
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:15,291
-Exactly where?
-It's around here.

541
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,250
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

542
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:22,041
Seems like you understand
But you really don't

543
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,958
Datuk Hassan.

544
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:29,041
The Dikir Hulu champion that you asked,
I have talked to them,...

545
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,625
and they are willing to cooperate.

546
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,083
-Assalamu Alaikum.
-You can't go out now. The van's ruined.

547
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,833
-What?
-Hello?

548
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,500
-What?
-The van's ruined.

549
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,041
-Yameenah?
-A van was bombed.

550
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,208
-Yameenah?
-I can't go.

551
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,083
What is it? Yameenah?

552
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,250
What was that, Yameenah?

553
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,875
You are quite something.

554
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,375
-Did you invite her here?
-Something like that.

555
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,041
-When is she coming?
-I can't quite catch it.

556
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,833
The signal was broken up.

557
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,458
-It's like that.
-She ditches you.

558
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,208
I suppose so. Here we go again.

559
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:07,541
Don't give up.

560
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:11,375
But the last bit she said,
something about a van,

561
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,875
about Fa.

562
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,875
Always like this.

563
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,916
-Yameenah.
-Ton?

564
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,125
Is Miss Fa alright?

565
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:48,708
Ton.

566
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,125
Ton! Your arm!

567
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,041
You shouldn't have rushed.

568
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,541
Now you got hurt because of me.

569
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,708
It'll be better in a few days.

570
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,250
I'm more worried about you.

571
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,708
Well, my sister...

572
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,916
and my mom,

573
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
including Faifoo's dad...

574
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,500
passed away because of an accident.

575
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,666
I have become more cautious
about this thing.

576
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,208
I'm sorry to hear that.

577
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,708
Thank you.

578
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,916
-What's that?
-It looks like everybody loves you.

579
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,416
I just try to...

580
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,250
get all the words

581
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,833
from everyone around me.

582
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,500
Can you write me something?

583
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,791
-What should I write?
-Anything.

584
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,375
It could be in Jawi.

585
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,666
I better not.

586
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,333
I'm sorry. Is it a taboo?

587
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,958
-It's not like that.
-You can't?

588
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,291
I can. But even if I write it,
you won't understand anyway.

589
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,583
I can keep it as a souvenir.

590
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,208
And you are right.

591
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,500
I don't understand. What does it mean?

592
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,000
One day you will know.

593
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,250
What do you think about us, Muslims?

594
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,541
I used to have a lot of questions.

595
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,708
But now that I'm here,...

596
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,000
I understand more.

597
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,583
Muslim people are disciplined.

598
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,416
But it's a good thing.

599
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,208
Actually, all religions teach us
to have faith.

600
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,833
But sometimes I'm not sure that...

601
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:38,125
what I'm doing or trying to do
is the right thing.

602
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:45,125
It sounds like you doubt your faith.

603
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,500
If you forget the words in it,...

604
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,625
that means you forget yourself.

605
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:50,916
Find sometimes to read it.

606
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,750
Don't focus only on work.

607
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,833
It's just a passage.

608
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:01,166
At last,
you can't bring anything with you.

609
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,666
Ton, Ton. I need a favour.

610
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,208
Can you swing by Miss Fa's home?

611
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,375
-Miss Fa?
-Yes.

612
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:14,791
Pass this to Datuk Hassan.

613
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,125
-Datuk Hassan?
-Yes.

614
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,666
-Sure.
-Okay?

615
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,000
Yes.

616
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,000
Thank you so much.

617
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,958
I couldn't have done it by myself.

618
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,083
Thank you, everyone. Now we can finish it.

619
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,041
Ton.

620
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,166
I just love kids.

621
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,250
Uncle, what's wrong?

622
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,541
I miss you badly.

623
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,833
Thank you for your help.

624
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,250
You are welcome. Our bank is supportive.

625
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,000
Why did you move here?

626
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,291
The headquarter
sent me to set up the system here.

627
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,166
Are you not afraid?

628
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,875
There are only old people here.

629
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,375
Most of the young ones moved out.

630
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,166
Only you moved in.

631
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,291
I can't say that I'm not afraid.

632
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,833
But when I'm here,
things are not what I thought.

633
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,875
I just want to do my best.

634
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:14,083
And that means,
when everything is in place,...

635
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,291
you will move back to Bangkok, right?

636
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,500
I suppose so.

637
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,666
If nothing changes my mind.

638
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,500
You should know, for us Muslims,

639
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,375
there are other factors.

640
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,250
She is my only daughter.

641
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,250
I don't want to see her upset.

642
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:48,583
I'd like her to have a good Muslim life...

643
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,458
and follow Muslim tradition,...

644
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,375
that includes her spouse.

645
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,708
Hey, I've booked your flight.

646
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,250
Better be back for rehearsal.

647
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,250
Let me clear things and I'll catch up.

648
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,541
-See you.
-Bye.

649
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,333
Why do you make a face like that?

650
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,125
What face? Like this?

651
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:22,875
Well...

652
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,291
It's nothing much.
I think I can work on my songs.

653
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:31,791
-Why don't you seem happy?
-Of course, I am happy.

654
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,666
I'm only worried about you.

655
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,125
If I have to go back to Bangkok,

656
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,833
who will you be with?

657
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,875
Or bring you with me?

658
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:44,625
I can be with anyone.

659
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,708
But you must hurry back, okay?

660
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,500
Okay, I promise.

661
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:53,875
Now, go to sleep.

662
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,000
Close your eyes.

663
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,250
Dad.

664
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,083
Mom wants me to study in Bangkok.

665
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,958
I don't know what to do.

666
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:14,458
There will be a trial
for Pencak Silat soon.

667
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,958
I don't know if Sharif will win.

668
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,708
He has been acting weird lately.

669
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,083
I don't know what's wrong with him.

670
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,583
It's late now. I better go to bed.

671
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,208
Good night.

672
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:05,750
Sharif.

673
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,500
I've made a decision.

674
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,250
I will send you to study religion
with your brothers.

675
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,500
Be prepared at the end of this semester.

676
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,583
Pa!

677
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,583
I have told you.

678
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,541
I'll take the athlete quotas

679
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,250
for university entrance.

680
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,458
I don't think this is for you.
You better focus on religion.

681
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,500
Pa, listen...

682
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:45,875
I'm not for a religion teacher
like you expected.

683
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,125
Don't you have a brain?

684
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,500
I only want to give you the best,
and you turn it down.

685
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:53,625
Why are you obsessed
with that stupid sport?

686
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,708
And what's so good about your Dikir Hulu?

687
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,458
It's just a tradition thing
that nobody cares.

688
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,666
The kids that study with you,

689
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,500
they will do something else
when they grow up.

690
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,166
If you think this way,

691
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,000
the things our ancestors have built...

692
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,000
will be all gone
because of your generation.

693
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,083
Bung Aoh, I have something to discuss.

694
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:48,875
I have to go to work on my music
in Bangkok.

695
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,791
If I leave Faifoo with you,
will it be okay?

696
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,708
Musa will also help.

697
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,458
Of course, I'll take care of her.

698
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,541
-Thank you very much.
-Do you want some tea?

699
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,416
Yes, please.

700
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:10,666
Thank you.

701
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,958
It's so good. Is it Muslim tea?

702
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,750
Chinese tea.

703
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,208
Uncle Ton!

704
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,708
-Can I have your phone?
-Did you finish your homework?

705
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,125
Yes, I did.

706
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:56,500
-Are you playing games again?
-Not at all.

707
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,875
-Are you sure home work is done?
-Yes.

708
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,166
Hello, Miss Fa.

709
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,833
-Hi, Faifoo.
-Hey, hey, hey.

710
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,208
-Miss Fa.
-Yes?

711
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,583
Uncle Ton will go to Bangkok tomorrow.

712
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,916
One moment, he wants to talk to you.

713
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,333
Faifoo!

714
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,666
Hello?

715
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,833
-I'm going to bed.
-Hello, Ton.

716
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,083
Yes, yes.

717
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,416
That's cute.

718
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,041
Have a nice trip.

719
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,583
Why do birds fly away?

720
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:47,375
Don't be scared. Touch it.

721
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,625
You see?

722
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:10,625
I like it.

723
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,625
-Yes!
-Awesome!

724
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,166
-How about the lyrics?
-It's ready, almost done.

725
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,250
Long time ago.

726
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,916
Allah created the first men.

727
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
They were Adam and Eva.

728
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,916
And he told the Angel in heaven that

729
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,958
from now on,
you'll respect these humans too.

730
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,041
But there is one who denied, that's lblis.

731
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,791
Iblis said that Adam and Eva
were created from earth,

732
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,166
but he was created from fire.

733
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,541
So fire is higher than earth
and he won't respect them.

734
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:48,708
He then was expelled from heaven to earth.

735
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,416
He became very angry.

736
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,250
So he tricked Adam and Eva
to eat some forbidden fruits.

737
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:59,166
And swore that from then,
he will haunt Adam and Eva's offspring.

738
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,875
And he meant humans like us,
to commit sins,

739
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,458
to make us bad people.

740
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:07,500
Eventually he became Shaitan or the Devil.

741
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,750
Have you ever seen him?

742
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:16,083
Nobody has.
Because he will come into our heart.

743
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,375
To control our mind,
to trick us to be a bad person.

744
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:22,250
If you don't want to see him,
be a good girl.

745
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,750
-Yes.
-You too, Yasat.

746
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:24,750
Yes.

747
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:26,708
Let's continue drawing.

748
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,291
-Show me when you finish.
-Yes.

749
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,083
From what I heard...

750
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,291
I think you have a feeling for her.

751
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,791
And... What do you think?

752
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,625
Will it be just for this moment, or...?

753
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,916
I don't think so.

754
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,083
We are all grown-ups.

755
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:10,875
Love, or lust. I think you can tell.

756
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,750
The important thing is,
this is about your life and future.

757
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,458
Ma'am.

758
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,916
-Sharif.
-Ma'am, hello.

759
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,250
Hi.

760
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:53,083
-My Mama wants to give this to you.
-Thank you.

761
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,791
-Say thank you for me, okay?
-Okay.

762
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:58,916
Is Fern here?

763
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,833
-She is reading a book upstairs.
-I see.

764
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,125
Dad.

765
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,625
I'm confused lately.

766
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,416
I don't know if it's about study...

767
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,416
or about Korsem and Sharif.

768
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:30,583
How about you? How are you?

769
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:33,250
I miss you so much.

770
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:39,041
Why didn't you tell me
when Dad was leaving?

771
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,333
Where are you going?

772
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,750
I'll go to see Dad.

773
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,041
Be careful, dear.

774
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,791
Sharif, let's go to see my Dad.

775
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,583
Hurry up, Sharif. We won't be in time.

776
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,916
Hurry up.

777
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,125
Uncle.

778
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,750
-Uncle, hello.
-Hello, sweetie.

779
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,500
Dad! Dad!

780
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:23,166
Dad, I got your present!

781
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:26,208
Follow your dream, honey.

782
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,916
Dad!

783
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,708
Dad!

784
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,666
Dad!

785
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,583
-Dad! I'm going to see my dad!
-You can't get in.

786
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:30,833
Dad!

787
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:32,750
Dad!

788
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,208
How's Fern? Is she asleep?

789
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,583
I don't want to disturb her.

790
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,416
Time really flies, don't you think?

791
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,125
Back in the days, look at this.

792
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,000
You were so small.

793
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,000
And look at you now...

794
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,000
You are so tall. Taller than me.

795
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:01,708
Yes,

796
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:04,666
he always made the marks to see

797
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,958
who is taller between Fern and me.

798
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:13,791
Unfortunately...

799
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:19,208
he didn't live to see...

800
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:22,625
how grown up...

801
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,791
you both...

802
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,791
have become.

803
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,208
Are you leaving?

804
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:09,541
Yes,

805
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,000
everything seems to be in place.

806
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,791
I have a dream to follow with my friends.

807
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,208
We see where to go now.

808
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
What a pity.

809
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:29,583
Excuse me?

810
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:35,000
Your eyes,

811
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:37,125
they seem to change.

812
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:50,750
Fern,

813
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,750
I'll take you home today.

814
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:57,416
It's okay. My mom will pick me up.

815
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:25,833
Try it.

816
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:27,625
Hey.

817
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:31,041
What with that? Shout it out!
It has to be powerful,

818
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,416
to scare your opponent.

819
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,333
Shout it out.

820
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:35,250
-Hey!
-Yeah.

821
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:38,333
And look right in the eyes.

822
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,833
-Do you get that? You'll look great.
-Yes, sir.

823
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,916
COME GET ME DON'T BE LATE

824
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,958
Try it.

825
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:49,750
Good. Make it strong.

826
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,125
All right,
now we have come to the last break.

827
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,541
From all requests you have called in,

828
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:00,250
I'll play four to five songs for you.

829
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,416
I'll get back to you after the break.

830
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,791
-Fern.
-What?

831
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,833
Why do you go home alone today?

832
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,791
I actually don't have to.

833
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,208
But I don't want Korsem to wait for me.

834
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:26,208
Right,

835
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:29,583
you practice so hard recently, don't you?

836
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,208
You never pick up my call.

837
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,000
It's the last chance.

838
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,208
This time,

839
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,750
I'll try to win over Korsem.

840
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,958
Come on.

841
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,791
Can you really take championship from him?

842
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,083
Let me ask something.

843
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,833
If you really get to the final
with Korsem,

844
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,208
how confident are you?

845
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,375
If it's really happening,

846
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,083
I think

847
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,375
Korsem has a better chance.

848
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,000
I have to admit that...

849
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:08,958
but I won't give up.

850
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:21,125
By the way,

851
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,625
about you and Sem, how is it going?

852
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,625
You guys seem very close

853
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:28,541
and hang out together a lot.

854
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,125
Hey!

855
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,958
You are quiet. Is something going on?

856
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,208
Do you have a crush on my friend?

857
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,583
No!

858
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,041
Korsem!

859
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:23,750
Korsem!

860
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,875
That looks suspicious.

861
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,833
You guys have argument, Rif?

862
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,791
-No.
-Come on, run.

863
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:43,500
I have come so far with one faithful heart

864
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:48,166
On the road laid out with thorns

865
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,666
It was painful

866
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,791
Until I can't take it anymore

867
01:07:56,875 --> 01:08:00,708
Why is life so difficult

868
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:04,916
No matter how much energy I have left

869
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,416
My heart will

870
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,666
Continue fighting

871
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:18,041
In the darkest night

872
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:21,041
My heart will go on

873
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:24,958
Love is the light

874
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:30,458
That finds me the way

875
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,041
It's your decision, Ton.

876
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,875
Time never stop moving

877
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:38,958
Thank you.

878
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:42,791
We have to continue moving along

879
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:47,708
Take all the mistakes

880
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,833
As lessons we learned

881
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:55,500
Life starts with fighting

882
01:08:55,583 --> 01:09:00,000
We only have to stay strong

883
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:04,666
It's our lives

884
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,208
We will make it meaningful

885
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:13,250
In the darkest night

886
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,708
My heart will go on

887
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:19,625
Love is the light

888
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:23,958
That finds me the way

889
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:28,166
The dreams are my best friends

890
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:32,375
Life is full of purpose

891
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:36,875
As long as there is the silver lining

892
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:42,708
I'll go until the last light

893
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,416
Uncle Ton!

894
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,000
Uncle Ton.

895
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,000
Wake up.

896
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:55,833
In accordance
with the needs of the people,

897
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,875
introduce sufficiency economy philosophy

898
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,875
as a guideline
for development and resolution.

899
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,750
Focus on holistic development

900
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,125
that integrates all dimensions.

901
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,916
Based on diversity of ideas and culture...

902
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,625
Faifoo.

903
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:21,208
Faifoo.

904
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:28,583
UNCLE TON PROMISE THAT
HE WILL BRING ME TO VISIT PARENTS ON 25th

905
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,791
-Bung Aoh, have you seen Faifoo?
-No.

906
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,208
-Miss Fa.
-Yes, Ton?

907
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,625
Is Faifoo with you?

908
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,416
Faifoo, Reen.

909
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,625
Faifoo! Reen!

910
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:08,416
Faifoo! Reen!

911
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,708
Faifoo! Reen!

912
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,708
Fern, have you seen them?

913
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,208
No, how about you?

914
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:18,875
Not at all.

915
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,833
-I'll go to that way then.
-Okay.

916
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:30,208
-How is it going, Ton?
-I have looked everywhere.

917
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,333
I can't find her.

918
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,625
How about Bung Aoh?

919
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,458
He hasn't been back yet.

920
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,625
I think he is still looking.

921
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:43,041
It looks like Faifoo has gone with Reen.

922
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:46,416
I asked Sharif to look at the playground.

923
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Reen!

924
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,208
Ireen!

925
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,416
Reen! Faifoo!

926
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,208
Faifoo!

927
01:11:58,916 --> 01:11:59,875
Reen!

928
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,666
Why has the train not arrived yet?

929
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:15,791
Is it far, Faifoo?

930
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,833
It's not very far.

931
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,416
I remember

932
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:23,583
when I came, it was only one nap long.

933
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:37,791
Calm down.

934
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:40,000
Bung Aoh hasn't been back yet.

935
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:42,833
Maybe we will hear good news from him.

936
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,625
All right, get down, little girl.

937
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,833
-Sharif.
-Reen!

938
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:15,000
Where have you been?

939
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,291
-Why didn't you tell me where you go?
-Faifoo!

940
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:20,708
Where have you been?

941
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,458
Tell me now!

942
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:25,791
Why do you make me worried?
Everybody is worried. Where have you been?

943
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:26,958
Where have you been?

944
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,458
Do you know how worried I am?

945
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,208
Tell me where you have been.

946
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:32,750
Tell me!

947
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:34,625
Tell me now!

948
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:39,166
I want to make a merit for my parents.

949
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,791
You only cared about work.

950
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,416
You didn't care about me.

951
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:53,208
I'm sorry.

952
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,916
I miss my Dad.

953
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,208
I miss my Mom.

954
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:08,375
Uncle Ton, I'm sorry.

955
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,291
I'm sorry, too.

956
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,416
I love you, all right?

957
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,291
I'm sorry.

958
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,208
Let's go.

959
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,083
Ireen.

960
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,000
Do you know you are wrong?

961
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

962
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:17,833
Don't do this again,

963
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:19,666
or I will punish you.

964
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,750
Yes.

965
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:21,833
Come here.

966
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,208
Sharif.

967
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:30,208
Your papa want to talk to you.

968
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:36,708
You'll have a competition tomorrow, right?

969
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,125
Yes.

970
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,333
I might have forgotten that

971
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,000
you have grown up.

972
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,416
I just keep thinking for you.

973
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,833
Do your best.

974
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,416
So it's worth time you practiced.

975
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:56,000
Your papa and I always support you.

976
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,166
Take your sister to bed.

977
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:02,583
All right.

978
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:07,208
Thank you.

979
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,875
Let's go.

980
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,833
Thank you for taking me here.

981
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,000
No, I have to thank you.

982
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,000
It's been a chaotic day.

983
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,833
That's nothing.

984
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:25,583
I think you should go back
to be with Faifoo.

985
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:33,791
Hey, Miss Fa.

986
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:39,875
I might have to move back to Bangkok soon.

987
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:44,791
And...

988
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:46,666
will you...

989
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,833
go back to work in Bangkok?

990
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,625
I'm still worried about my dad.

991
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,375
When will you leave?

992
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,416
Maybe in a few days.

993
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:18,708
I will feel empty.

994
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,791
I'm getting used to it here...

995
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:26,666
then I have to leave.

996
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:33,791
I think you have so many things to do.

997
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:36,208
In no time...

998
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,791
you will forget this place

999
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:40,333
I don't think so.

1000
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,333
I won't forget so easily.

1001
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,500
I think you should go home.

1002
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:57,208
Drive safely.

1003
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,375
Okay.

1004
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:27,500
Why are you so stubborn?

1005
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,583
Do I mean anything to you?

1006
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,750
Why don't you listen to me?

1007
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,916
Or do I have to do something else?

1008
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,416
You are not reasonable.

1009
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:44,000
Ton and I are good friends.

1010
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:54,000
And if I want to think of him
more than just a friend,

1011
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:56,583
is it wrong?

1012
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,166
Won't you give him a chance?

1013
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,208
It's not about the chance.

1014
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,708
In reality, it's almost impossible.

1015
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:06,625
I have seen a lot.

1016
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,625
You only see ones that fail.

1017
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,750
There are successful couples,
why don't you see them?

1018
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,416
Even mom can be converted to Muslim.

1019
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:26,750
Leave your mom out of this.

1020
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,000
Fatima, are you arguing with me...

1021
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,208
because of this man?

1022
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,208
You are not reasonable.

1023
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,125
I just think that you don't like him.

1024
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,333
But your wish will come true soon.

1025
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,416
He is moving back to Bangkok.

1026
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,791
Isn't that because of you...

1027
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,416
that I have to stay here?

1028
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,791
Why?

1029
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,791
Why don't you want to move out?

1030
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,750
It's dangerous here,

1031
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,208
everybody has left.

1032
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,666
Why do you stick around?

1033
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:17,791
I was born here.

1034
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,791
And when I die,

1035
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:23,000
I will die here.

1036
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:25,791
Do you really believe

1037
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:28,500
you'll be successful
in what you are doing?

1038
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,791
About masjid,

1039
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,958
I've seen you try for a decade,
but it's still not finished.

1040
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,208
And the problems here...

1041
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:48,791
everything will be back in peace
as you expected?

1042
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:58,208
If we don't have faith in what we do...

1043
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,750
nothing is possible.

1044
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:09,583
And the faith we are having right now...

1045
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,250
I don't see
how it helps anything to be better.

1046
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:18,625
Even for Mom.

1047
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,625
She died because of you.

1048
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,000
Because you believe
it's safe here, don't you?

1049
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,625
-Fern.
-Oh, hey.

1050
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,208
The competition is coming.

1051
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,416
Just don't finish last again.

1052
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:51,000
I'll be there to cheer you.

1053
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,625
See you.

1054
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,208
If you finish early,
don't forget to go support me.

1055
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,416
Good luck, son.

1056
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:08,625
You are going to the competition,
don't you want to eat?

1057
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:11,583
Don't lose.

1058
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,833
Don't you want me to do this, do you?

1059
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,416
I don't,
but I also don't want you to lose.

1060
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:20,250
See you later, Pa.

1061
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,791
IPESK

1062
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,500
-Okay.
-Keep fighting! Be aggressive.

1063
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,916
-Full on fighting mode.
-Yes.

1064
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:32,625
Go get him, go.

1065
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:23,375
Keep fighting! Get in.

1066
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,333
Get up, get up.

1067
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,458
Fern.

1068
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,625
Listen,

1069
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,208
I have something to tell you.

1070
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,291
What's up?

1071
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,208
I like you.

1072
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:52,791
You are crazy!

1073
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:54,625
Are you crazy?

1074
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,583
I meant it.

1075
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:58,416
I like you all along.

1076
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,000
But we are good as friends.

1077
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:06,625
Or you have someone in your mind?

1078
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,708
Why don't you tell Fern how you feel?

1079
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,791
Just tell her.

1080
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:54,625
-Have you got a crush on my friend?
-No!

1081
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,916
He is not my type.

1082
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,000
So,

1083
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,875
what is your type?

1084
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:03,916
It's...

1085
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,583
someone

1086
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,416
who promised to take care of me.

1087
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:21,791
No!

1088
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:28,000
From now on, I will take care of you.

1089
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,208
I promise.

1090
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,208
Thank you.

1091
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:47,375
Miss Fa?

1092
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,208
Ton.

1093
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:54,416
Good morning.

1094
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,833
I got to go.

1095
01:30:57,416 --> 01:30:58,291
Pa!

1096
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:00,000
Miss Fa!

1097
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,333
Miss Fa!

1098
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:18,916
Pa!

1099
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,666
-Pa!
-Miss Fa!

1100
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:27,083
Pa!

1101
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,208
Pa!

1102
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,208
Pa...

1103
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,541
Pa, please help Mom.

1104
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,000
Pa...

1105
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:49,833
please help Mom.

1106
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:52,416
Pa, please help Mom.

1107
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,458
Mom...

1108
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:56,041
Mom...

1109
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:01,416
Mom...

1110
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:03,791
Mom...

1111
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,208
Mom!

1112
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:11,833
Mom!

1113
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,041
Pa!

1114
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,208
Pa!

1115
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:19,250
Pa!

1116
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:22,125
Pa! Pa!

1117
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:24,666
Pa, please don't leave me.

1118
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,583
Pa! Pa!

1119
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:28,791
Pa, please don't leave me!

1120
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,000
Pa, wake up.

1121
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:43,541
Pa!

1122
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,500
Pa!

1123
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:45,833
Pa!

1124
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,416
Pa, wake up.

1125
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,083
Pa!

1126
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:57,625
Pa, wake up.

1127
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:08,208
Allah said that...

1128
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:12,000
I created you from earth.

1129
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:16,208
And sent you...

1130
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,333
back to earth.

1131
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,625
Death is the Allah's will.

1132
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,166
We are always aware of that.

1133
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:39,208
Pa, wake up.

1134
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,000
Pa...

1135
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:43,625
don't die.

1136
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:45,416
Pa!

1137
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:00,625
Help!

1138
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,166
Help, please!

1139
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,458
Help!

1140
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:09,416
Pa, don't leave me.

1141
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:11,375
Pa, don't leave me.

1142
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:14,125
-Pa!
-Datuk Hassan!

1143
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:17,083
Ton.

1144
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:19,625
Ton.

1145
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:22,333
Please help him. He doesn't wake up.

1146
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:23,416
Help him.

1147
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:03,708
If we don't have faith in what we do...

1148
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:08,583
nothing is possible.

1149
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:32,583
Ton.

1150
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:36,000
If I make a wish like you do...

1151
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,583
you think my Pa would wake up?

1152
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,291
Just follow me this way.

1153
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,416
Fa is here.

1154
01:37:14,833 --> 01:37:15,791
Fa.

1155
01:37:26,625 --> 01:37:28,000
Thank you, Ton.

1156
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,750
You are crying again.

1157
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,000
Hang in there.

1158
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:43,625
Thank you.

1159
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,000
Let's hold on together.

1160
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:49,041
Assalamu alaikum.

1161
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:50,625
Thank you.

1162
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,416
-Thank you, sergeant.
-I'm with you.

1163
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,125
May Allah help your dad
for speed recovery.

1164
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,416
Assalamu alaikum.

1165
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:01,708
I hope your dad gets better soon.
May Allah be with him.

1166
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:57,125

01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:06,666
This is the blue print
of the additional construction.

1168
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,000
We have to be hurry.

1169
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:11,416
Yes.

1170
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,625
During the time
that Datuk Hassan is unwell,

1171
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:18,625
I will do my best.

1172
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,500
Thank you for helping us.

1173
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:19,708
Pa.

1174
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:22,833
Pa.

1175
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:27,250
Pa.

1176
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:38,000
Pa.

1177
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:50,458
I have to go now.

1178
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,625
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.

1179
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:55,958
What's up?

1180
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:58,666
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Walaikum assalam.

1181
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:00,208
-Good bye.
-Bye.

1182
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:02,458
May Allah be with you.

1183
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:04,166
Uncle Ton.

1184
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,583
It doesn't take long
to fly back here, right?

1185
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:08,750
That's right.

1186
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,541
Good.

1187
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:13,791
Can you take me back often?

1188
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:17,416
Because I will miss Miss Fa and Reen.

1189
01:41:37,416 --> 01:41:40,833
Fasten your seatbelt
and turn on flight mode on your phone.

1190
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,958
Okay.

1191
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:17,000
Not so long

1192
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,875
Think of the first day

1193
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:44,000
The clock that is ticking

1194
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:47,416
So slowly everyday

1195
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:56,208
Remind me to think of

1196
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:00,875
The first day I've met you

1197
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:06,750
WITHOUT YOU

1198
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:30,208
Allahu Akbar.

1199
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:43,333
Commander of the Fourth Army Region,
Maj. Gen Prakarn Cholayuth

1200
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:46,000
revealed that the situation
as of now is under control.

1201
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:47,708
No death report,

1202
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:50,208
12 people got injured.

1203
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:53,000
All of them were delivered to hospital.

1204
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:57,625
It was caused by the bomb incident...

1205
01:44:11,791 --> 01:44:15,083
Right, and this is my last break.

1206
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:19,375
But before we say good bye,
I'd like to give you one last song.

1207
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:22,208
It's beautiful song from a new artist.

1208
01:44:22,291 --> 01:44:25,375
The singer and song writer

1209
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:27,041
wrote this song for a woman

1210
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:29,541
who lives so far away from him.

1211
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:32,041
He might want

1212
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:37,208
to tell her something through this song.

1213
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:42,375
And this might be the last song
that I play

1214
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:46,791
in this radio show, Latitude 6.

1215
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:50,625
But I promise that I will be back.

1216
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,291
It won't be long.

1217
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,416
Don't forget to miss me.

1218
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:15,000
Still remember the days we held hands

1219
01:45:22,208 --> 01:45:25,541
There are thousand stories

1220
01:45:25,625 --> 01:45:27,666
Of our days

1221
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm getting used to it here,
then I have to leave.

1222
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,791
In no time,

1223
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:35,250
you will forget this place.

1224
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:39,000
Stars that used to shine bright

1225
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,791
Your smile

1226
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:45,791
Won't fade away

1227
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:49,000
Keep them that way

1228
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:55,000
The only light has left

1229
01:45:55,291 --> 01:45:58,458
It seems flickered

1230
01:45:58,541 --> 01:45:59,958
You should know.

1231
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,416
For us Muslims,

1232
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,000
there are other factors.

1233
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:08,333
Only days and night

1234
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:11,416
The dream goes dark

1235
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:18,875
It hurts

1236
01:46:18,958 --> 01:46:22,208
as I keep thinking about it

1237
01:46:22,291 --> 01:46:25,541
Destiny

1238
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:28,416
Seems so cruel

1239
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:31,583
And at last

1240
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:35,916
The one and only...

1241
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,208
One day when you have enough faith,

1242
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:39,708
you will understand.

1243
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:44,000
At the horizon

1244
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:50,625
Tears that fall

1245
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,166
Feel so empty

1246
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:58,458
It's meaningless

1247
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:04,833
It feels like hell without you.

1248
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:19,208
-Sharif.
-What?

1249
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:23,000
When I leave...

1250
01:47:25,041 --> 01:47:26,208
will you be lonely?

1251
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:36,416
Reminds me of the day I first met you

1252
01:47:37,791 --> 01:47:38,791
I won't.

1253
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:43,416
Tee and Anwar will keep me busy enough.

1254
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:47,625
Won't fade away

1255
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:51,041
The rainbow

1256
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:54,250
Won't hurt me

1257
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:57,208
And...

1258
01:47:57,875 --> 01:47:59,208
the day I leave...

1259
01:48:00,916 --> 01:48:02,208
will you be there to send me off?

1260
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:09,583
So far away.

1261
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:16,416
Tears that fall

1262
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,500
Feel so empty

1263
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:22,250
It's meaningless

1264
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:23,208
I don't know.

1265
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,833
It feels like hell without you

1266
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,000
Good bye...

1267
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,208
Latitude 6.

1268
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:40,458
Do your best.

1269
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:43,250
When you arrive Bangkok,
tell your aunt to call me.

1270
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:45,375
-So I don't have to worry about you.
-Okay.

1271
01:48:48,416 --> 01:48:51,000
-Take care, Mom.
-Will do.

1272
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:55,750
I'll call you every day.

1273
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,000
-Fern! Fern!
-Fern!

1274
01:49:09,083 --> 01:49:11,416
-Fern!
-Fern!

1275
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,333
-Fern!
-Fern!

1276
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:15,125
-Fern!
-Fern!

1277
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Fern!

1278
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,041
Fern!

1279
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Ma'am.

1280
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:25,041
Is someone calling your name?

1281
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:27,833
Fern!

1282
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:31,875
Fern!

1283
01:49:31,958 --> 01:49:33,625
Fern!

1284
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,250
Fern!

1285
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,708
Fern!

1286
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:37,875
Fern!

1287
01:49:38,416 --> 01:49:39,625
Fern!

1288
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:41,250
Fern!

1289
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:42,583
Rif, Rif!

1290
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:44,458
-Fern!
-Fern!

1291
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:45,791
Fern!

1292
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:47,250
Rif has something to tell you!

1293
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:49,166
-Fern!
-Fern!

1294
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:52,791
Fern!

1295
01:49:53,541 --> 01:49:54,625
Fern!

1296
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,833
Fern!

1297
01:49:58,916 --> 01:50:01,000
-Sharif!
-Rif has something to tell you.

1298
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:05,583
Fern!

1299
01:50:06,416 --> 01:50:07,916
Take care of yourself.

1300
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,541
I'm waiting for you here.

1301
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:11,625
Please get back during the school break.

1302
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,833
Get back soon, Fern!

1303
01:50:14,833 --> 01:50:17,208
I will come back.

1304
01:50:17,583 --> 01:50:19,041
Good luck!

1305
01:50:54,916 --> 01:50:57,000
Here is the outfit you asked me to make.

1306
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:03,791
If Pa saw this, he would be happy.

1307
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,416
Let's go, Pa.

1308
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,208
The event has begun.

1309
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:15,791
Are there a lot of people?

1310
01:51:16,625 --> 01:51:17,583
Yes.

1311
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:57,250
Hey.

1312
01:51:57,333 --> 01:51:58,625
Rif, Rif, Rif.

1313
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:47,416
It's been a long time away from my home

1314
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:52,791
I want you to know, my home is the best

1315
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:58,000
Missing me, missing him, missing who?

1316
01:52:58,916 --> 01:53:03,416
The happiness is always at home

1317
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:08,416
Oh, the windy beach

1318
01:53:09,416 --> 01:53:14,000
Oh, what a life of fishermen!

1319
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:19,208
I heard gori sound

1320
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:24,416
It means I miss you

1321
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:39,333
When you're far from home

1322
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:42,375
Just think of my home

1323
01:53:42,458 --> 01:53:45,708
As time goes by, my heart is trembling

1324
01:53:45,791 --> 01:53:48,791
But happiness is at home

1325
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:17,500
We have been through a lot together.

1326
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:22,791
Many things here...

1327
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:25,416
were so bad,

1328
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:28,416
but it gradually changes from before.

1329
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:31,625
Because we believe.

1330
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:35,041
We believe,

1331
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:37,625
believe that one day,

1332
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:40,791
everything will be better.

1333
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:44,625
Believe that one day,

1334
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:48,208
everything will be the same.

1335
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:53,416
Although today is not good yet,

1336
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:56,791
we believe that tomorrow

1337
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:59,416
will be better than today.

1338
01:55:01,791 --> 01:55:03,000
We just have to believe.

1339
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:10,625
Miss Fa.

1340
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:15,416
Faifoo, how do you get here?

1341
01:55:15,916 --> 01:55:17,833
Someone misses you.

1342
01:55:54,708 --> 01:55:56,625
In memory of Imam Yakoop Rai Manee.

1343
01:55:56,708 --> 01:55:59,708
Thank you to Imam of Masjid in Pattani
who gave us some advice while filming.

1344
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:01,916
Arts and culture was created
by our ancestors.

1345
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,791
If we don't carry them on,
they will fade away.

1346
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:09,083
Sport teaches us
about the word "sportsmanship".

1347
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:11,583
Sport doesn't teach us to cheat
in order to win,

1348
01:56:11,666 --> 01:56:14,250
but teaches us to follow the rules.

1349
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:15,791
To live together in harmony,

1350
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:18,208
we must base our lives
around "sportsmanship".

1351
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:56,916
