&lrm;Grounded? For what?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.180
&lrm;Let's jog your memory.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.420
&lrm;Monday morning,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.580
&lrm;absent from PE.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.140
&lrm;[she giggles]

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.820
&lrm;I was in study hall.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.700
&lrm;Friday evening,
&lrm;absent from study hall.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.140
&lrm;[worried sigh]

&lrm;[meowing]

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.380
&lrm;I was at PE.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.700
&lrm;You're never where
&lrm;you're supposed to be.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.020
&lrm;The only to keep track of you
&lrm;is by grounding you.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.980
&lrm;But I was invited.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.420
&lrm;Nino's my friend.
&lrm;He was counting on me.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.660
<i>&lrm;So the challenge</i>
<i>&lrm;our viewers have chosen is...</i>

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.940
<i>&lrm;to get the mayor of Paris,</i>
<i>&lrm;Andre Bourgeois to dance!</i>

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.460
<i>&lrm;Thank you for agreeing</i>
<i>&lrm;to play with us.</i>

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.660
<i>&lrm;What are Nino's chances?</i>

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.780
<i>&lrm;Zero, I despise dancing.</i>

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.340
<i>&lrm;The last time I danced,</i>
<i>&lrm;Madonna was in kindergarten.</i>

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.060
&lrm;I know Nino's your friend

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.100
&lrm;but until your unexcused absences
&lrm;come to an end,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.740
&lrm;that's the way it is.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.940
&lrm;Awesome.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.500
&lrm;[mysterious music]

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.980
&lrm;[frustrated groan]

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.300
&lrm;Can you blame them?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.540
&lrm;How are they supposed to know
&lrm;you miss class to save the world?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.940
&lrm;I guess being grounded comes
&lrm;with being a top-secret superhero.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.340
&lrm;It doesn't seem fair.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.620
&lrm;It's not.
&lrm;But hey, if Nino wins,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.740
&lrm;you're not grounded next week,
&lrm;you can go then.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.180
&lrm;Yeah, but Adrien was there today.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.900
&lrm;A challenge...

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.820
&lrm;What an interesting concept.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.340
&lrm;A TV show with such potential
&lrm;for negative emotion.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.220
&lrm;Oh, the destructive mayhem
&lrm;we could cause.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.980
&lrm;Seriously? How can you say that?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.060
<i>&lrm;Sorry, but I get your dad.</i>

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.260
<i>&lrm;You're never where you say,</i>
<i>&lrm;being late, splitting mysteriously.</i>

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.140
<i>&lrm;I'd expect you to be leading...</i>
<i>&lrm;a double life.</i>

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.620
&lrm;Gimme a break,
&lrm;you're being ridiculous.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.340
&lrm;Just wait here.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.540

<i>&lrm;You moved to the beat Major,</i>
<i>&lrm;that counts as dancing.</i>

<i>&lrm;What? That's not true.</i>

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.340
<i>&lrm;My neck was itching, that's all.</i>

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.980
<i>&lrm;Relieving an itch to the beat</i>
<i>&lrm;counts as dancing too.</i>

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.180
<i>&lrm;Nino, congratulations.</i>

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.300
<i>&lrm;You'll return in one week</i>
<i>&lrm;for your next challenge.</i>

<i>&lrm;And now for our next contestant,</i>
<i>&lrm;welcome Simon Grimault.</i>

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.580
&lrm;Awesome, dude.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.660
&lrm;[Alec] Mr. Grimault,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.980
<i>&lrm;You're a hypnotist,</i>

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.140
<i>&lrm;You hypnotise people</i>
<i>&lrm;to get what you want.</i>

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.380
<i>&lrm;Well... yes,</i>
<i>&lrm;I'm a hypnotist but</i>

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.100
<i>&lrm;I don't use my skills</i>
<i>&lrm;to get anything.</i>

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.300
<i>&lrm;So, your challenge</i>
<i>&lrm;is to use your talents</i>

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.340
<i>&lrm;to bring a very elusive celebrity</i>
<i>&lrm;to our TV set.</i>

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.020
<i>&lrm;Give it for the King of Fashion</i>

<i>&lrm;What is this show?</i>
<i>&lrm;I was told this was an interview.</i>

<i>&lrm;Mr. Agreste here with your powers.</i>

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.660
<i>&lrm;I told you,</i>
<i>&lrm;I don't make p...</i>

<i>&lrm;How funny is that, Gabriel?</i>

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.620
<i>&lrm;Hilarious, your show is pathetic.</i>

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.540

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.380
&lrm;Hey, you OK?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.820
&lrm;I'm fine but my boy Adrien
&lrm;is still here.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.700
&lrm;Don't worry, we'll find him.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.580
&lrm;I quit karate.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.460
&lrm;[lift beeps]

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.780
&lrm;Hey, there, Ladybug.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.260
&lrm;[groaning]

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.100
&lrm;[struggling]

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.180
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Enough already.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.300
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.140
&lrm;[lively music]

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.340
&lrm;[growling]

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.580
&lrm;[yelling]

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.660
&lrm;[yelling fades]

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.140
&lrm;Nice seeing you too, Cat Noir.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.340
&lrm;Sorry. I thought
&lrm;you were Simon Says.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.580
&lrm;I saw him.
&lrm;He's got a whole army.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.820
&lrm;[Cat Noir] He's looking

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.780
&lrm;for Gabriel Agreste.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.180
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;We'd better get to him fast.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.700
&lrm;You're about to change back.
&lrm;I'll have a look

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.900
&lrm;[Ladybug] for Nino's friend.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.780
&lrm;Forget it. He's probably hypnotised.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.780
&lrm;But he's my buddy.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.380
&lrm;You're right. Maybe he's hiding.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.020
&lrm;I'll leave you to look for him.
&lrm;Let's meet

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.660
&lrm;at Gabriel Agreste's place.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.100
&lrm;[confused sighs]

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.740
&lrm;Finding Adrien will be a piece of cake.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.900
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.580
&lrm;Plagg, hide.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.220
&lrm;[lively music]

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.820
&lrm;Nino.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.060
&lrm;Adrien!

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.980
&lrm;Dude, you OK?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.260
&lrm;I'm fine.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.900
&lrm;[nervously] Hello.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.540
&lrm;[nervous stuttering]
&lrm;H-H-Hello.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.860
&lrm;You sure you're OK.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.180
&lrm;I'm fine, really.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.660
&lrm;But we must get to my house
&lrm;my father's in danger.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.500
&lrm;Let's go.
&lrm;Cat Noir will meet us there.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.140
&lrm;Nathalie, where's father?
&lrm;He's in danger.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.460
&lrm;He knows already.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.180
&lrm;Good evening, Ladybug.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.100
&lrm;Father, you've gotta get out of here.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.740
&lrm;Simon Says is coming after you.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.900
&lrm;What? And be dictated
&lrm;by a madman? Certainly not.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.460
&lrm;But he's dangerous.
&lrm;Who knows what he'll do?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.740
&lrm;Go up to your room.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.940
&lrm;You've had enough excitement for today.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.180
&lrm;Nathalie, make sure they stay there.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.260
&lrm;I have to apologise for my son.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.340
&lrm;He's like his mother,
&lrm;too overly dramatic.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.900
&lrm;But he's right.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.700
&lrm;Simon Says is a real threat.
&lrm;You're in danger.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.860
&lrm;What could possibly happen to me

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.220
&lrm;with you here to protect me?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.860
&lrm;You sure your old man isn't a robot?

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.220
&lrm;Where my father is concerned
&lrm;I'm never sure.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.340
&lrm;[gasping]

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.340
&lrm;Dude, I've seen stadiums
&lrm;tinier than your room.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.340
&lrm;Make yourself at home.
&lrm;I'll take a shower.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.260
&lrm;Now?

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.660
&lrm;What can I say?
&lrm;It's the model in me.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.180
&lrm;Why doesn't my father listen to me?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.980
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.060
&lrm;[lively music]

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.220
&lrm;[panting]

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.540
&lrm;[dreamy music]

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.140
&lrm;Isn't he flawless?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.220
&lrm;[nervously] Wh-What? Flaw what?

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.580
&lrm;Adrien, my son.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.780
&lrm;He's the image of perfection, isn't he?

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.460
&lrm;[in admiration] Yes, he's perfect.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.340
&lrm;I mean... I don't know him but he seems...

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.060
&lrm;I've never noticed your earrings before.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.700
&lrm;They are quite unique.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.420
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;May I?

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.660
&lrm;Excuse me.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.220
&lrm;Cat Noir, where were you?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.100
&lrm;I was keeping Simon Says at bay.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.340
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;And?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.180

<i>&lrm;Cat Noir,</i>

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.500
&lrm;I couldn't keep him away.
&lrm;He's coming. He's got company.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.060
&lrm;[moaning]

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.780
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Close all exits.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.820
&lrm;They're coming from everywhere.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.740
&lrm;Engage the defence system,
&lrm;total lockdown.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.100

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.180
&lrm;How do you know about the system?

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.980
&lrm;In a house like this it's a given.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.020
&lrm;They won't get in.
&lrm;This house is a fortress.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.580
&lrm;[moaning]

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.260

&lrm;[alarm rings]
<i>&lrm;Emergency power on.</i>

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.500
&lrm;There are too many of them.
&lrm;Your defence system is failing.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.340
&lrm;Adrien and Nino...
&lrm;I'd better go get them

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.100
&lrm;Nathalie, take the controls

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.780
&lrm;to unlock any exits.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.460
&lrm;She's coming with you.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.420
&lrm;I'll reinforce the defences.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.500
&lrm;Hide in the atrium.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.860
&lrm;No-one tells me what to do,
&lrm;not even you.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.180
&lrm;You're in danger.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.660
&lrm;Just do as I tell you to.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.740
&lrm;[gasping]

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.420
&lrm;Quite a temper,
&lrm;you remind me of someone.

&lrm;[cackling]

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.780
&lrm;I don't think
&lrm;that's a good idea, Simon Says.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.860
&lrm;Gabriel is here!

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.940
&lrm;Yes but don't forget our deal.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.860
&lrm;I feel Ladybug and Cat Noir nearby.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.580
&lrm;Once they're in front of you,
&lrm;you can honour our agreement.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.260
&lrm;Just take their jewels, the Miraculouses.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.420
&lrm;It's as good as done.
&lrm;Simon Says we'll defeat them.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.980
&lrm;[gasping]

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.860
&lrm;Ladybug, What's going on?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.180
&lrm;We need to get to safety.
&lrm;Where's Adrien?

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.180
&lrm;-Taking a shower.
&lrm;-Now?

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.700
&lrm;It's the model in him.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.940
&lrm;Go to the atrium. I'll get Adrien.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.100
&lrm;Leave the control with me.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.540
&lrm;Adrien?

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.020
&lrm;[Ladybug] Adrien?

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.380
&lrm;Adrien?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.540
&lrm;Yeah?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.500
&lrm;Can I get dressed?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.700
&lrm;Sure... if you must.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.300
&lrm;I mean... of course you can.

<i>&lrm;Welcome to another exciting hour</i>
<i>&lrm;of The Challenge.</i>

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.300
<i>&lrm;Good evening again from Simon Says.</i>

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.340
<i>&lrm;Viewers, I've kept my promise.</i>

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.740
<i>&lrm;Here's Gabriel.</i>

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.980
&lrm;[he snarls]

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.340
<i>&lrm;Simon Says</i>

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.620
<i>&lrm;you are a butterfly.</i>

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.060
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.540
&lrm;[Gabriel]
<i>&lrm;Flap, flap, flutter, flutter...</i>

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.820
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;We've gotta save Mr. Agreste.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.180
<i>&lrm;Tomorrow, butterfly,</i>
<i>&lrm;you will be no more.</i>

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.620
&lrm;The Akuma's gotta be in one of the cards.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.580
&lrm;But which one? There are so many.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.700
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.220
&lrm;[she yells]

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.820
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.020
&lrm;to save him, give me your Miraculouses.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.380
&lrm;Do the right thing.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.420
&lrm;In your dreams.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.420
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.540
&lrm;[lively music]

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.940
&lrm;A regular yoyo?
&lrm;But you've got a magic one.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.780
&lrm;I'll figure it out later.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.380
&lrm;[whizzing]

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.780
&lrm;Simon Says your yoyo is useless.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.420
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.220
&lrm;Simon Says your stick is...

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.700
&lrm;Useless? I don't think so.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.980
&lrm;I'm not gonna let you
&lrm;get a word in.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.460
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.740
&lrm;Simon Says...

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.020
&lrm;[noisy chanting]

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.260
&lrm;It doesn't matter if you can hear me.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.980
&lrm;All that's important is what Simon Says.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.260
&lrm;Simon Says give me you Miraculous.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.700
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.860
&lrm;[Cat Noir chuckles]

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.860
&lrm;[Gabriel] Flutter, flutter...

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.820
&lrm;Simon Says take off, little airplane.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.020
&lrm;[rasping]

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.420
&lrm;He's gone to the roof.
&lrm;We have to stop him.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.180
&lrm;This is the last chance
&lrm;and I can't do it alone.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.060
&lrm;If we free Simon Says,
&lrm;we free Mr. Agreste too.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.500
&lrm;Let's not waste a minute.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.100
&lrm;How will you defeat me
&lrm;without your yoyo?

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.740
&lrm;[rasping]

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.940
&lrm;Simon Says... it's over.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.660
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.820
&lrm;Follow my lead.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.100
&lrm;[she yells]

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.060
&lrm;[gasping] Simon Says...

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.180
&lrm;[she yells]

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.620
&lrm;[slow motion yelling]

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.300
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.700
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460
&lrm;[fluttering]

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.460
&lrm;That's not possible.
&lrm;I made your yoyo useless.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.020
&lrm;This one yes, but not that one.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.180
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.500
&lrm;[twinkling]

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.740

&lrm;[whooshing]

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.980
&lrm;My yoyo.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.500
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.140
&lrm;[lively music]

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.340
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.060
&lrm;[lively music]

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.540
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.460
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.500
&lrm;[gasping]

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.340
&lrm;POUND IT!

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.380
&lrm;Your flight's been cancelled, sir.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.540
&lrm;-You?
&lrm;-Prefer Ladybug?

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.380
&lrm;[bleeping] Can't say I blame you.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.860
&lrm;Cat Noir, your ring. You'd better go.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.420
&lrm;Like a cat on a hot tin roof.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.420
&lrm;See you again soon, Mr. Agreste.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:47.420
&lrm;[mysterious music]

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.300
&lrm;And you, milady.

&lrm;I've never noticed your ring before.

&lrm;That's the only thing
&lrm;you've never noticed?

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.660
&lrm;I'm glad everything worked out.

<i>&lrm;Last week,</i>

<i>&lrm;So let's welcome him back again.</i>

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.620

&lrm;you weren't absent or late all week.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.420
&lrm;Excellent news, Marinette.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.980
&lrm;You can go join your friends on the set.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.460
&lrm;I think I'd rather watch it with you.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.460
&lrm;That's if you and mom would like that.

<i>&lrm;So we've upped</i>
<i>&lrm;the challenge tonight, Nino.</i>

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.220
<i>&lrm;You have to get 2 celebrities</i>
<i>&lrm;dancing instead of one.</i>

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.100
<i>&lrm;But this time,</i>
<i>&lrm;you can choose your opponents.</i>

&lrm;On second thoughts,
&lrm;I'm gonna take a nap.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.860
&lrm;Don't want to be late for school,

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.300
&lrm;and mess up that perfect school record.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.580
&lrm;Tell me what happens.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.900
&lrm;-Sure.
&lrm;-Of course, honey.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.860
&lrm;Sometimes,
&lrm;I just can't figure that girl out.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.500
&lrm;Give her a break.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.020
&lrm;You know there's nothing more demanding
