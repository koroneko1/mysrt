1
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,625
Minimalism is like...

2
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,791
a Buddhist philosophy.

3
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,500
Okay.

4
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,833
It's about letting go.

5
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,625
I see.

6
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,958
When I was working in Sweden,
I really liked this style.

7
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,375
When I moved back,
I wanted to apply it to this place.

8
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,458
What was this place before?

9
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,875
-A home.
-I see.

10
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,000
My mom and brother are living upstairs.

11
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,416
-I turned downstairs into an office.
-I see.

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,375
Yes.

13
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,333
What did you do with your stuff?

14
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,583
I threw them away.

15
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,166
-Everything?
-Yes.

16
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,041
Don't you feel attached to them?

17
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,833
Personally, I feel that things
we no longer use are unnecessary.

18
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,000
So we should throw them away.

19
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,208
As for things I have use for
and are in good condition,

20
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,000
I think...

21
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,708
they will be here.
They're not going anywhere.

22
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,708
I see.

23
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,583
Then...

24
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,250
Can you give us some tips
on how to get rid of things?

25
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,875
Excuse me.

26
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,083
Come on, you cheap ass.

27
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,583
Are you for real?

28
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,333
I only need three pages.
Will they sell me three pages?

29
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,291
This isn't a damn library.

30
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,458
Don't be stingy.

31
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,375
I'm designing a minimalist house.

32
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,500
Why should I buy books on minimalism?

33
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,125
It's the era of cloud storage.

34
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,541
You don't need to spend minimally
on a minimalist house.

35
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,500
Let's go.

36
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,166
Hey, won't it be easier to rent
an office space?

37
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,708
Do you have the money?

38
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,458
This is actually a nice area.

39
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,541
You can take the Skytrain
when you're in a rush.

40
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,375
That's true.

41
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,708
If clients come here for meetings,

42
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,583
there are parking spaces in the daytime.

43
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,666
It's quite spacious.

44
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,500
-They can park in the alley.
-I see.

45
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,583
We're here. This is my home.

46
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,833
I think it can be turned into an office.

47
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,083
-Definitely.
-For sure.

48
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,250
Let's have a look.

49
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,166
I'll walk you through.

50
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,041
Close the door.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,791
My house used to be
an instrument repair shop.

52
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,166
My dad also ran a music school.

53
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,833
Mom, my friend's here.

54
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,375
Mom.

55
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,416
Hello.

56
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,666
Can you turn it down?
I need to talk business.

57
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,625
Okay.

58
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,958
I think I'll get rid
of everything downstairs

59
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,666
and turn it into the main office.

60
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,375
Take a look.

61
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,666
My house gets lots of sunlight,
but it's blocked by all these walls.

62
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,666
There is too much wood.

63
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,125
I want to make it more minimalistic.

64
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
Why do you keep this bumper?

65
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,166
Go ask my mom.

66
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,291
Stop taking photos.

67
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,250
I think we have to tear down some walls.

68
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,416
This is Jay, my brother.

69
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,375
-This is Pink.
-Hi.

70
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,333
Hi.

71
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,291
Right.

72
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,666
I will turn this room
into your home studio.

73
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,583
What studio?

74
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,375
Your own home studio, you know?

75
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,166
My home studio?

76
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,625
Does your mom sing one song all day?

77
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,833
You need to put in
lots of soundproofing for me.

78
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,000
You want a minimalist home,

79
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,458
but this clutter in this place
is the fucking opposite.

80
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,166
Can you do it?

81
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
I can fix up the house.

82
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,125
What I can't do for you
is to talk to your family.

83
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,333
-Your brother doesn't even know...
-I know.

84
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,916
-his room will be gone.
-I know.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,250
Have you told your mom?

86
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,083
I will.

87
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,250
You'd better, Jean.

88
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,333
I've seen this before.

89
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,416
You'll get a broken home
before you get a new house.

90
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,375
You'll be wiping out your whole history.

91
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,291
You want a minimalist Stockholm house.

92
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,208
Have you asked your family here?

93
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,416
I wouldn't have come back
if I had a choice.

94
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,333
I don't care. Just be nice.

95
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,625
From the timeline you sent me,

96
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,750
you need to send me references and
clear everything out before New Year's.

97
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,458
We can start working after the holidays.

98
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,041
Okay.

99
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,916
Minimalism is like a Buddhist philosophy.

100
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,916
It's about letting go.

101
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,500
Are you nuts? You want an empty house?

102
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,250
Things will be more organized.

103
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,416
Let's start over.

104
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,166
Take this room, for example.

105
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,500
It's so cluttered with stuff, right?

106
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:28,750
We'll clear out what we don't need
and we'll have more space.

107
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,833
Our lives will be greatly improved.

108
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,416
And when people come in,

109
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,791
-they will see...
-Where will the living room be?

110
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,375
It will be on the second floor.

111
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,500
You can sing your heart out all day.

112
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,541
-I'll turn it into a karaoke room.
-Not the second floor. No.

113
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,583
-Why not?
-I don't want the second floor.

114
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,750
The first floor will be my office.
You have to move.

115
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,750
I don't want to.

116
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,000
-It's so messy here.
-No.

117
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,500
-I'm always here.
-We'll all move.

118
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,000
You will have your own room.

119
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,625
Just tell me what you want.

120
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,333
-You name it.
-You go. I won't.

121
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,666
Are you going to sleep on the chair?

122
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,583
You can't. It's weird.

123
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,875
How is that weird?

124
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,250
I always sleep here.

125
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,958
-You can't.
-Why not?

126
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,500
I've done it for years.

127
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,000
Doesn't it give you a backache?
You can't sleep here.

128
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,416
It's because of my shoes.

129
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,791
What does that have to do with it?

130
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,958
You're not listening to me.

131
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Do what you want,
but the living room must stay.

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,208
It can't. It's not minimalistic.

133
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,625
Minimal what? This is my house.

134
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,833
Jean, don't do it.

135
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,666
-What?
-It's too much of a hassle.

136
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,333
Jay, we've lived here since we were ten.

137
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,583
We're almost 30.
Everything is too small now.

138
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,958
What about your online clothing shop?

139
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,875
Don't you want storage space
for your clothes?

140
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,291
Damn.

141
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,708
It feels so cramped here
now that you said it.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,166
I felt fine before.

143
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,500
Well, take a look around.

144
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,583
This belongs to the previous generation.

145
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,541
Everything is out of date.

146
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,833
Why are old people afraid of change?

147
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,958
I don't get it.

148
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,791
This is our time.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,416
Yes, you have a point.

150
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,875
The floor plan is set.

151
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,958
We can't change anything.

152
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,333
We're so used to it
that we don't think about it.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,541
That's what I'm saying.

154
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,208
This is our time.

155
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,958
It's our generation's time.

156
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,250
HOW TO DUMP
STEP 1

157
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,875
SET YOUR GOALS AND FIND INSPIRATIONS

158
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,791
Your office is amazing.

159
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,250
Thank you.

160
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,708
If you have questions, feel free to ask.

161
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,375
Sure. I'm a fan of your work.

162
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,791
Thank you so much.

163
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,500
Yes, I can.

164
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,375
Actually, it's being built right now.

165
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,666
I hope it will be finished by next month.

166
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,166
I guess it will have to be.

167
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,416
Well...

168
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,500
I hope we'll get to work together.

169
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,625
Excuse me.

170
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,000
Are there more garbage bags?

171
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,875
There's no more on the shelf.

172
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,916
We're out if the shelf's empty.

173
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,791
Isn't this enough?

174
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,583
The world is campaigning against plastic.

175
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,250
Trust me. It's worth it.

176
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,250
What are you getting?

177
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,833
Cleaning supplies.

178
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,208
What's that book?

179
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know.
It's a Japanese book. It's funny.

180
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,708
She says tidying up the house once
will set you free.

181
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,583
It's a best seller. It might help.

182
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,458
Just download a PDF file.
Books take up space.

183
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,541
No. PDF files hurt my eyes.

184
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,291
Let's go.

185
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,250
All right.

186
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,750
I've been waiting to do this.

187

HOW TO DUMP
STEP 2

188
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,500
DON'T REMINISCE THE PAST

189
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,541
Publishing is dead.

190
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,666
It's the era of Apple Music and Spotify.

191
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,250
God! This was before cell phones.

192
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,250
A VHS tape rewinder.

193
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,583
I haven't heard that word in ages.

194
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,375
Do you want this pencil case?

195
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,458
Toss it.

196
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,916
Shit. Good old days.

197
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,375
Shit. Did you steal this from a temple?

198
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,583
You did. Don't blame it on me, Jean.

199
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,833
The Shang Dynasty invented it.

200
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,000
You're throwing things away mindlessly.

201
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,541
Don't throw away important documents.

202
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,375
THAI-CHINESE DICTIONARY
THAI FOR BEGINNERS

REPORT CARD

204
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,625
THOUGH JEAN IS A STUBBORN KID AT HOME,

205
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,083
SHE'S KIND AND SHE LOVES TREES.

206
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,458
SECOND SEMESTER, JEAN READS MORE

207
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,833
ERIC LIU - PARENT

208
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,666
Why are you tossing stuff so fast?

209
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,250
Did you throw away your report card?

210
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,291
That's sad.

211
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,833
That's the use of garbage bags.

212
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Think about it.

213
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,416
Do you remember
what you've thrown into the bags?

214
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,625
Garbage bags are like black holes.

215
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,500
When you throw things in, they're gone.

216
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,666
Out of sight, out of mind.

217
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,458
It's so damn easy.

218
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,750
It's a done deal.

219
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,000
How will you fit the piano in the bag?

220
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,250
Are you really okay
with me throwing it away?

221
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,333
Toss it out. It takes up space.

222
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,875
It doesn't.

223
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,708
It does, Mom.

224
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,541
No one plays it anymore. Do you?

225
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,083
I do. Okay?

226
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,333
It's not yours.

227
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,500
Are we clear?

228
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,500
Don't meddle with other people's things.

229
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,333
Dad isn't here anymore. It isn't anyone's.

230
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,583
Take it easy, Jean.

231
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,541
We can clean up our rooms first.

232
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,250
It's easy to throw away everyday stuff.
Personal items are hard.

233
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,916
I'll help.

234
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,166
You're all so emotional.

235
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,875
What are you watching?

236
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,416
It's the lady who wrote about tidying up.

237
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,416
I want to see what she looks like.

238
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,458
She's a devil in angel's clothing.

239
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,208
Isn't she right though?

240
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,916
It's good you're watching it.

241
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:34,916
I don't know.

242
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,916
Everything I touch sparks joy.

243
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I tried.

244
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,041
Do you want my help?

245
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,708
I'll snap my fingers
and everything will disappear.

246
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,875
No, thanks. Are you Thanos?

247
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,291
Look at this.

248
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,500
I can't throw out any of these.

249
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,708
These souvenirs are so tacky

250
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,541
and so touristy,

251
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,375
but it's the thought that counts.

252
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,875
Just toss them out.

253
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,000
Being emotional only brings trouble.

254
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:24,958

CONGRATS ON YOUR GRADUATION.
TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT. - CHERRIE

258
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,833
Should I throw out the computer boxes
in your office?

259
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,083
Yes.

260

BLANK ALBUMS - TRASH

261
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,500
Hey, is this yours?

262
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,625
Shit.

263
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,708
Did you really throw everything out?

264
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,958
Are you that clean-freak lady's fan?

265
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:18,583
It's a lifelong collection from the past.
It's full of germs.

266
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,458
This isn't all. There's more.

267
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,416
Look.

268
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,625
Damn, that's scary.

269
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,875
Here, I brought you more references.

270
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,208
I marked the ones I think you would like.

271
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,375
Thanks a lot.

272
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,500
What clutter.

273
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,125
You're right.

274
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,916
Wow. Are you throwing all this away?

275
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,333
They're still in good condition.

276
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,666
Look. This is a cute vase.

277
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,708
Why don't you donate it
or sell it as second-hand?

278
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,166
Turn your past into money.

279
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,500
No. I'm tired.

280
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,500
If I throw it out today,
it will be gone today.

281
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,250
It's such a waste.

282
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,000
Pink.

283
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:02,958
Yes?

284
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,291
Can you get me more references?

285
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,958
These are almost right.

286
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:13,375
But I once saw a reference
that's exactly what I wanted.

287
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,041
I can't remember where I saw it.

288
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,083
Are you tossing this out too?

289
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,833
No one uses CDs anymore.

290
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,541
Keep it if you want. It's useless.

291
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,458
What?

292
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,333
FOR JEAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

293
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:35,125
YOU WANTED IT, SO I GOT IT FOR YOU - PINK

294
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,166
Doesn't my gift spark joy anymore?

295
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,666
Wait. Hold on.

296
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:51,541
The thing is, you see
how cluttered my house is.

297
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:56,500
I can't keep more stuff.
I have to get rid of them.

298
00:24:56,791 --> 00:25:00,500
It's impossible to keep everything
people give you.

299
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,916
You have to throw things away
eventually, Pink.

300
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,833
You have a point there.

301
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,041
You're absolutely right.

302
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,291
It's my fault. I'm being too emotional.

303
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,625
Do you understand what I said?

304
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,958
What's with you?

305
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,375
If you don't want it anymore,

306
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,250
and you're brave enough
to return it to me,

307
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,250
I might just feel sad.

308
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,833
I wouldn't be mad.

309
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,875
Okay. How about this?

310
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:32,833
If one day you have to throw stuff out
and you find something from me,

311
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,833
you can toss it out. I won't be mad.

312
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,083
You're not mad because you don't care.

313
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,791
If you don't want this CD, I'll take it.

314
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,166
I'll take it back.

315
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,166
Pink.

316
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:45,958
Pink.

317
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,625
Hello, Pink.

318
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,291
Are you free tomorrow?

319
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,000
Do you want to grab some food?

320
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,416
Do you realize you've never changed?

321
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,208
You pretend like nothing has happened.

322
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,750
Have you ever asked anyone
if they can let go like you?

323
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,041
What do you want me to do?

324
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,208
You know what you have to say,

325
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,041
but you won't say it.

326
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,250
Learn to have compassion, will you?

327
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,291
Say it now, asshole!

328
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,625
Okay. I'm sorry.

329
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,291
Good. That's all.

330
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:34,208
Some things won't go away just because
you pretend to forget all about it.

331
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,333
It has to come from both sides
for it to be over.

332
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,083
HOW TO DUMP
STEP 4

333
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:52,166
DON'T WAVER. BE HEARTLESS.

334
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,333
Think about what I said.

335
00:27:58,708 --> 00:27:59,625
Bye.

336
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,958
Sure. Okay.

337
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:55,500
I'll give you 200 baht for all of this.

338
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,250
It looks like there are more.

339
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,750
I'll come back later.

340
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,666
Mister!

341
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:32,875
Mister!

342
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,666
Stop!

343
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,500
Damn it, Jean. What's with you?

344
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,833
Why did you bring them back?

345
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,291
I'm not sure.

346
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,166
I suddenly feel guilty.

347
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,625
I feel like I'm throwing too much away.

348
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,875
Thanos took off the gauntlet.

349
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,458
What's gotten into you?

350
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,916
Sorry.

351
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,625
Damn it.

352
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,625
It does hurt when it happens to me.

353
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,750
I thanked it before throwing it out.

354
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,041
I just didn't thank you
for knitting it for me.

355
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,000
It's all right.

356
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,250
Thank you for making me understand.

357
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:26,041
Do you have Pin's, Toey's,
and Bam's number?

358
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,375
I just want to return some things to them.

359
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,583
GENG, SUN, JOMJAM, PLOY

360
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:36,625
TOEY, TEN, PIN, AOM

361
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,333
Holy shit.

362
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,083
Is this what you wanted to give me?

363
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,041
Is it mine?

364
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,166
Yes, it's yours.

365
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,208
I totally forgot about it.

366
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,125
You didn't have to do this.
It's no big deal.

367
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,791
I found it while cleaning the house.

368
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,750
I remember it's yours.

369
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,666
I have to return what I borrowed.

370
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,666
How could you remember?

371
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,291
Thanks, anyway.

372
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,666
You're such a good person.

373
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,208
GOOD PEOPLE WILL BE FORGIVEN

374
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:07,791
Jean!

375
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,916
This is yours, Toey.

376
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,291
Holy shit.

377
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,666
I asked you to get this from Japan
in freshman year,

378
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,666
but you said it was sold out. Remember?

379
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,333
Yes. That's why I'm bringing it to you.

380
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,958
I looked everywhere and couldn't find it.

381
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,541
BAM

382
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:36,583
What do you want?

383
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,500
Nothing.

384
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm just returning your double bass.

385
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,250
You asked me to repair...

386
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,958
You didn't have to return it.

387
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,916
Just throw it out.

388
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,875
That day you didn't wait for me,

389
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,000
you had no idea what I had to deal with.

390
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,250
Just leave it there. You can go.

391
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:46,041
Customer number 175,

392
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,291
please go to counter five.

393
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:54,708
EMS REGISTERED MAIL

394
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,666
TO AIM

395
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,083
Mail it, please.

396
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,125
This address is just next door.

397
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,208
You can walk there.

398
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,250
Mail it.

399
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,833
Mail it?

400
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,541
Mail it.

401
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,541
Are you sure?

402
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,333
Excuse me.

403
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,625
Is this your car?

404
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,625
Yes. Am I blocking you?

405
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,750
Does the stuff in the car belong to you?

406
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:19,958
Why?

407
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,166
I'm Noon.

408
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm an antique collector and buyer,
but I'm not a dealer.

409
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,625
Are you interested in selling them to me?

410
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:34,291
I'm about to return those things.

411
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,791
They're not for sale.
I'm returning them all to my friends.

412
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,458
Too bad.

413
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,291
How about this?

414
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,750
I'll leave you my name card.

415
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,458
If you change your mind and want
to sell them, contact me anytime.

416
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,708
It's not often I come across good stuff.

417
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,083
Don't worry about the price.

418
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,250
I'm open to negotiation.

419
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,541
Okay. Thank you.

420
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,625
I'll call you if there's anything.

421
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,583
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

422
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,708
Hey, where have you been?

423
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,750
I went to do good deeds.

424
00:37:54,041 --> 00:38:00,041
PACKAGE REFUSED BY RECIPIENT

425
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,208
Well? Is that the top dog?

426
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,541
I'm exhausted, Pink.

427
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,166
You said returning stuff
would solve things.

428
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,250
When was the last time you spoke to him?

429
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:31,375
Three years ago,
before I boarded the plane to Sweden.

430
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,500
I told him...

431
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,958
I would see him soon,

432
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,041
and I never contacted him since.

433
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:44,375
That's how I dumped him,
like tossing things in a garbage bag.

434
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
Jean...

435
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,375
Dumping a person
isn't like dumping things.

436
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,583
It will all be over
if I throw it away now.

437
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,708
I have no reason to go see him.

438
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:12,916
Why should I look for trouble?

439
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:20,625
Shouldn't we get on
with renovating my house and office?

440
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,291
Problem solved.

441
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,250
I don't have to care about anything.

442
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,041
If you didn't care,

443
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,458
you wouldn't be in this situation.

444
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,375
Your things would be
with the junk collector.

445
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:52,208
TO AIM

446
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:37,958
Jean.

447
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,541
I happened to pass by.

448
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,208
I wanted to return your camera.

449
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,791
I just want to say that, Aim,

450
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,375
I'm sorry I've been gone.

451
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,791
You really don't have to say it.

452
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,875
-Please let me finish.
-It's really fine.

453
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,791
-It's all right.
-I've waited so long for this chance.

454
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,083
Let me finish.

455
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:19,083
I'm sorry for disappearing
after I moved there.

456
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,541
When you e-mailed me,

457
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,708
I saw your e-mail, but...

458
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,000
I didn't want to reply.

459
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,083
I didn't want to know
what would happen next.

460
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,583
So I blocked and unfriended you.

461
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,208
I...

462
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,541
At the time, I thought...

463
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,833
since I felt that you weren't the one,

464
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,291
that was on you.

465
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,750
It wasn't my problem.

466
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:58,750
Why should I be responsible
for other people's feelings?

467
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,958
I was just...

468
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:08,166
choosing what was best for me.

469
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:14,916
But you know what?

470
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,708
When I went to the city,

471
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,833
you asked me to take photos
with your camera,

472
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,833
I felt guilty.

473
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,250
I didn't even bring your camera.

474
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,083
I hid it in a box at home,

475
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:39,166
hoping it would get tossed out
when someone cleaned my room.

476
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,541
I came here to tell you that...

477
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,708
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye.

478
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,166
I'm sorry for never getting
in touch with you.

479
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,291
I'm sorry I never asked about your life.

480
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,958
I'm sorry I'm like this.

481
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:16,916
I'm sorry for never saying sorry.

482
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,541
Can you yell at me?

483
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,333
I feel worse when you say nothing.

484
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,500
I'm happy to see you.
How can I yell at you?

485
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,125
How about this?

486
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,416
Make me some corn soup.

487
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,500
It's been so long. I miss it.

488
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,333
Make yourself at home.

489
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,708
I'll get the ingredients.

490
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,541
Isn't your mom home?

491
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,416
No.

492
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,958
What about your aunt? Is she here?

493
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:57,125
She moved out last year
to stay with her kid in the South.

494
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,166
Why are you taking photos?

495
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,291
Why can't I?

496
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,083
It's a home, not a museum.

497
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,125
I love flipping through that magazine.

498
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,833
Jean, that's Mi.

499
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,458
Glad to meet you.

500
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,666
Aim talks about you all the time.

501
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,208
It's like I'm meeting a historical figure.

502
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:25,583
I see.

503
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,000
I must be from his Dark Age.

504
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,083
I'm making soup.

505
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,958
Join us.

506
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:34,833
Sure.

507
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,583
Thanks.

508
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,583
It's good.

509
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,958
You can't find it anywhere else.

510
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,375
You are exaggerating.

511
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,416
Thanks for taking care of my bonsai.

512
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,458
It's pretty. It's not about you.

513
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,291
Thanks, anyway.

514
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,708
Are you relieved?

515
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,041
Don't be a know-it-all.

516
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,416
I have to go.

517
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:48,916
Okay.

518
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:50,500
Good luck.

519
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,375
Let's have a meal sometime.

520
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:26,833
How was it?

521
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,958
I felt relieved. It's over.

522
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,208
He's moved on.

523
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,083
But actually...

524
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,208
when I was standing there,

525
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,875
I kept beating myself up.

526
00:50:58,208 --> 00:50:59,208
Hey.

527
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,708
I'm not heartless anymore, right?

528
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,166
That's why I feel like this.

529
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,416
All these emotions are tiring.

530
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:11,250
Come on. You returned everything.

531
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,708
It's finally over.

532
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,541
You should be relieved.

533
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,375
Yes, you're right.

534
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,458
But I don't think
I'll keep in touch with him,

535
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,000
so I stole something of his.

536
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:24,958
What?

537
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,291
What did you steal?

538
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,416
PRETTY, I LIKE IT.

539
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:33,291
The reference that I told you I loved.

540
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:34,375
What?

541
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,625
It's from a magazine
I used to read at his house.

542
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,166
Shit. It's like in Inception.

543
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,500
He planted it in your head.

544
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:45,708
I don't know. I feel like...

545
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,541
lots of things that I like,
they are all from him.

546
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:59,583
Well, seeing him was worth the trip.

547
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,416
I can get back to work.

548
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:08,916
As for the rest of your stuff,
hurry up and return them.

549
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,041
So you can move on to other things.

550
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,375
He was the hardest one, right?

551
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,750
It's good. This can finally be over.

552
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,666
The rest should be easy.

553
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:57,916
Hello?

554
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,458
Jean, it's Korn.

555
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:02,500
Korn?

556
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,416
What's up, Korn?

557
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,166
I just heard you're back.

558
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,333
I'm getting married...

559
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:11,916
to Yok.

560
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,708
Little Yok?

561
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,375
Did you get back together?

562
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,458
Yes.

563
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,541
I saw from Toey's posts

564
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:23,125
how you've been returning
old things to people.

565
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:27,875
I remember you still have a photo of mine.

566
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,416
It's a photo of me and Yok.

567
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
A photo?

568
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,041
Which one?

569
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:34,583
Did I take it?

570
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,250
Yes, you did. I remember.

571
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,583
It was our first photo together.

572
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,958
I want it for the wedding.

573
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,000
Shit.

574
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,250
It's been ten years.

575
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,333
I don't know if I still have it.

576
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,500
Well, can you find it for me?

577
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:02,625
Okay. I'll try.

578
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:30,416
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
I THREW EVERYTHING AWAY.

579
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,958
KORN, I'M SORRY.

580
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,750
AIM

581
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,000
Hello, Jean. This is Aim.

582
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,083
Hello.

583
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,500
Are you free tomorrow? Let's have dinner.

584
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,750
Mi is coming too.

585
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,208
I can go.

586
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,291
I can make it.

587
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:17,875
Hey.

588
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:24,083
It's been ages.

589
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:25,333
The place hasn't changed.

590
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,458
Yes, it's still the same.

591
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,583
What's that?

592
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,416
It's the stuff you left at my house.

593
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,791
I want to give them back.

594
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,416
These are your clothes.

595
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,583
These are your other personal items.
I separated them.

596
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,708
HOW TO DUMP
STEP 5

597
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:56,375
DON'T ADD MORE THINGS

598
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,208
Thanks a lot.

599
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,750
You aren't mad, right?

600
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,000
Not at all. I understand.

601
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,250
I'm clearing out my house too.

602
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,125
We should get rid of things we don't need.

603
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:18,083
We must learn to throw stuff out

604
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,000
and keep only what's important.

605
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,708
Have a drink while we wait.

606
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,750
We ate all the appetizers.

607
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:50,583
It's like we're just here for water.

608
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,833
It's always like this.

609
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,541
We always wait at least an hour.

610
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,041
I don't know how we could wait.

611
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,208
I thought that too
the first time you took me here.

612
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,708
But it's worth the wait.

613
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,791
I really like their braised beef.

614
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:17,500
Aim takes me here all the time.

615
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:39,583
You complain about this mess,
yet you bring more stuff in.

616
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,416
I know. I'm throwing it away.

617
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,791
Like hell you are. It's in your room.

618
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:05,375
Throw it out. Don't open it.

619
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:12,000
BONSAI FOR BEGINNERS

620
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:30,416
JEAN'S PLAYLIST FOR AIM

621
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,833
HAPPY NEW YEAR, DEAR.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

622
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:53,125
COME HOME SOON SO WE CAN HANG OUT AGAIN.

623
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,666
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2017 - MOM

624
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,916
Aim, is your mom home?

625
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,250
Can I talk to her?

626
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,541
I want to thank her for the card.

627
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,166
Jean...

628
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,958
My mom passed away last year.

629
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:40,958
Why didn't you tell me that day?

630
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,208
YEAR 2017 - MOM

631
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,208
Take me to her right now.

632
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:11,083
MRS. NITRA THAMRONGKUL
DIED JUNE 20, 2018

633
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,625
Tell me about her last day.

634
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,250
Do you really want to know?

635
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:26,541
You don't have to know.

636
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,250
Just tell me.

637
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,666
Okay.

638
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,958
I kind of knew it was her last day.

639
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,500
I stayed with her
at the hospital since early morning.

640
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:52,291
I got her everything she wanted
to eat or have.

641
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,291
Towards the end, she wanted to eat...

642
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,375
your soup.

643
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:03,791
It was late at night...

644
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,083
when she passed away.

645
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,166
That's all.

646
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:13,541
Why didn't you contact me?

647
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,583
I had to move on.

648
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,125
I had to do it on my own.

649
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,833
I wasn't supposed to contact you.

650
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,208
When I had good news,

651
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,041
I was dying to call you, but I couldn't.

652
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,708
When I had bad news
and I had no one to turn to...

653
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,125
I couldn't call you either.

654
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:49,458
The New Year card Mom wrote you...

655
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,375
I couldn't send it to you
and I couldn't throw it away.

656
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:57,750
I had to keep it in a drawer.

657
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,083
I felt so alone.

658
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:06,958
All I could think of
was that I had to move on.

659
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:25,250
I have to move on by myself.

660
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,041
This is the end of the road.

661
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,500
I'm really sorry.

662
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:39,208
If there is anything that I can...

663
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:41,333
help you with...

664
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,000
you can always call me.

665
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,541
I'm here now.

666
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,458
I'll be right back.

667
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,333
Mi, I didn't mean anything by that.

668
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,750
I don't want you to...

669
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,458
Hey, I understand.

670
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,916
No worries.

671
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,208
But...

672
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,291
it's like I don't know him.

673
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,125
I didn't know some of the stuff
you were talking about.

674
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,375
When he said he felt alone,

675
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,083
it makes me feel like

676
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,416
I can't help him at all.

677
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,166
But I understand.

678
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,208
Everyone has a past.

679
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:08,791
He has one.

680
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:09,958
I have one.

681
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,166
You do too.

682
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,458
Hello, Korn?

683
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:32,750
Hi, Jean.

684
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,333
Did you find the photo?

685
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,333
I've gone through half of it.

686
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,750
Just wait.

687
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,666
You need it by next Saturday, right?

688
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,708
Actually, it's this Saturday.

689
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:58,625
You know, I already asked you once
for this photo,

690
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,875
but you never gave it to me.

691
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:05,250
I'm begging you.

692
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,916
I need it now. Please find it for me.

693
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,291
It should be in here.

694
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:26,000
Those photos should be with you
if they're not with me.

695
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,458
-Can I?
-Sure.

696
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:14,166
It's like taking a time machine.

697
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,583
I've never seen these before.

698
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:49,208
I'll sneak a peek later.

699
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,208
I'm kidding. Take your time.

700
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:03,250
I'd better find it and leave.

701
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,500
I'll let you two be.

702
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:08,916
Actually...

703
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,000
just copy any files you need.

704
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,125
I'm moving to Singapore soon.

705
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,250
Moving...

706
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,166
permanently?

707
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,083
Yes.

708
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:24,833
Why?

709
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:26,458
It's nothing.

710
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,625
Brian has been asking me.

711
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:31,208
The timing was right,
so I accepted his offer.

712
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,500
What about Mi?

713
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,583
She's going too.

714
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,000
I found it.

715
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:51,000
These two were always
on and off back then.

716
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:53,541
I never thought they would get married.

717
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,958
What a surprise.

718
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:58,500
It seemed like an ordinary photo.

719
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,583
Now, it's priceless.

720
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,916
It's good that I kept it.

721
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,708
I'm done. Thanks.

722
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,166
Why don't you take all of them?

723
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,583
It's okay.

724
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,333
I'll do it later. You hold on to them.

725
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,500
You're good at keeping things.

726
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:25,666
Mi.

727
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,166
Mi!

728
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:28,750
Bye.

729
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,791
Thanks.

730
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:32,750
Sure.

731
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:52,541
Dude, thank you so much
for keeping the photo.

732
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:56,333
I never thought I would get to use it.

733
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:59,291
Thank you for finding it for us.

734
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,208
I'm glad to see you happy.

735
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,583
It makes me happy too.

736
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,833
Congratulations.

737
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:09,125
Okay. If we're done here, I have to go.

738
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,291
I have to work.

739
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,625
-See you at the wedding.
-Sure.

740
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:35,666
The past is our enemy.
It's the hardest thing to let go.

741
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,583
My advice is

742
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:43,125
try to forget it and let it go
if you have no use for it anymore.

743
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,125
Lady, please stop talking.

744
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,500
Houses here are much bigger
than Japanese houses.

745
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,750
We have no earthquakes.

746
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:53,083
Don't throw everything out.
We can keep some.

747
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,416
She's just doing this for the show.

748
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,708
You're a damn traitor.

749
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,541
-When did you become like this?
-What?

750
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,541
Fuck.

751
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,791
-What?
-You were such a big fan.

752
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:03,916
Now, you hate her.

753
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So? I want to be a better person.

754
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:09,041
Can't I change?

755
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,500
Are you calling yourself good?

756
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:13,458
Man...

757
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,708
Right. I found this photo
behind the cabinet.

758
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,000
It sparks joy.

759
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,958
I'll keep it.
It doesn't take up much space.

760
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,250
When was this taken?

761
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:38,625
Can't you remember?

762
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,458
I still remember that day.

763
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,291
It was your birthday.

764
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,833
Dad played "Happy Birthday" and you sang.

765
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,583
Auntie took the photo.

766
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,916
Was there this much love in our family?

767
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:55,958
I forgot about it all.

768
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:58,958
Come on.

769
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:01,708
At least it's a good memory.

770
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,833
But I think if we had remembered this

771
01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:11,833
when our family were fighting,

772
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,458
we wouldn't have fought so much.

773
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,250
Seeing this photo makes me think...

774
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,583
Dad wasn't so bad.

775
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,041
We just forgot about this.

776
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,208
Some days, I sit staring at the piano.

777
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,916
I think I miss him.

778
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:49,625
Will you really throw the piano away?

779
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:10,208
HOW TO DUMP
STEP 6

780
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:17,208
DON'T LOOK BACK

781
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:23,708
Well, if we keep it,
it will look like this.

782
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,750
It will clash a bit.

783
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,833
Damn it. It really isn't nice.

784
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,541
It will take up a whole room.

785
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,416
What should I do?

786
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,041
Well...

787
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,625
it's up to you.

788
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,666
Anyway,

789
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,208
I think you have to cut down the cost.

790
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,958
Your spending is off the roof.

791
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,833
I've tried to stay within the budget.

792
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,166
Pink.

793
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:02,250
Don't underspend on a house.

794
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:07,125
It's a big deal.
We might as well go all out.

795
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,791
I'll take care of the money.

796
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,250
Your dad has good taste.

797
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,875
This is great stuff.

798
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:24,125
I'll take that one too.

799
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,541
I wired you the money.

800
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:39,125
TRANSACTION COMPLETED
150,000 BAHT

801
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,333
Excuse me.

802
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,666
Is that for sale?

803
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:57,625
I think... I won't be selling that.

804
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,333
I'm keeping it for now.

805
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,125
Do you still play?

806
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,875
No, it belongs to my dad.

807
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:05,541
I see...

808
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,750
I like it very much.

809
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:12,958
If you change your mind, let me know.

810
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:16,083
Since it's your father's,
I'll give you a good price.

811
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:18,083
Sure.

812
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:20,291
Thank you.

813
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,375
TRANSACTION COMPLETED
150,000 BAHT

814
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,791
Should I call him?

815
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,166
It's okay. I should do it.

816
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,750
If not, I'll have to keep running away.

817
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:49,791
It's Jean.

818
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,958
I'm just calling to ask
if you still want your piano?

819
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:17,333
If not, I'm going to sell it.

820
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:59,333
Goodbye then.

821
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,666
He left us like...

822
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,291
he didn't have to think twice.

823
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,666
If I had sold the damn piano,

824
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:30,541
it wouldn't have hurt this bad.

825
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,291
I called Dad last night.

826
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,125
Stop talking.

827
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,083
-He didn't recognize my voice.
-Stop.

828
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,291
Jean, stop talking.

829
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,958
-He said the piano...
-Jean!

830
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:31,708
He said we could sell the piano.

831
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:34,416
-He's not coming back.
-I said stop talking.

832
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,583
-Just throw it away.
-Watch it!

833
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,416
Why do you want to keep it?
No one plays it anymore.

834
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,583
-Dad isn't coming back.
-Don't say that.

835
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,583
-Dad isn't coming back!
-Shut up!

836
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:49,083
-Do you hear me?
-Sell the damn thing!

837
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:50,625
He's not coming back!

838
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:55,291
Why do you want to keep it?
No one plays it!

839
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,458
I still play it!

840
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,166
I play it!

841
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,500
I play...

842
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:22,625
I was minding my own business.

843
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:26,083
Why did you have to bring this up?

844
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:29,833
What if I forget him?

845
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,208
Will you be responsible?

846
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:41,166
I don't want to see you
going around in circles like this.

847
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,500
Mom.

848
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,333
If we don't try to forget,

849
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,375
we will never do.

850
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,000
Stop being selfish.

851
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,875
If you want to forget, go ahead.

852
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,583
Why are you forcing me to?

853
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:17,958
Do you know
you're being selfish right now?

854
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,833
If you want to remember,
do it on your own.

855
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,750
Jay and I don't want to remember.

856
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,916
Stop bossing people around.

857
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:12,291
Hello, Jean? This is Nao.

858
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:14,666
I just met up with Korn.

859
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:18,083
He said you found a photo for him. Right?

860
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:21,916
It reminded me
that you still have my belt.

861
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Really?

862
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,833
Which one?

863
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:05,083
What brings you here, Mi?

864
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,875
Is something wrong?

865
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,250
We might not see each other again.

866
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,666
I want to return this to you.

867
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,666
I saw the photos saved in the hard disk.

868
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,958
I didn't know it was your shirt.

869
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,625
I think I should return it.

870
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:43,375
Aim never told me.

871
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,083
I'm sorry.

872
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,166
It's all right.

873
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,416
You knew...

874
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:56,708
since the first time we met, didn't you?

875
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:14,250
But I understand.

876
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:15,958
It must be hard to say.

877
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:21,916
I'm sorry.

878
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:29,541
Come on.

879
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,791
Singapore isn't that far.

880
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:34,125
If you're back, just give me a call.

881
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,500
We're friends now.

882
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,250
Sure.

883
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:41,083
Well...

884
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:44,125
I'm not going to Singapore.

885
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,375
Mi, I'm sorry.

886
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,625
I didn't want it to be like this.

887
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:09,875
I'm really sorry.

888
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:12,458
Should I call him and talk to him?

889
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,541
It isn't your fault.

890
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:23,083
Actually...

891
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,625
if I hadn't refused the parcel you sent...

892
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,416
you wouldn't have to come yourself.

893
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,791
Things would've been different.

894
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:46,916
Deep down, I was afraid
you would come back.

895
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,000
That's why I did that.

896
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:56,708
Damn it.

897
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,333
I made it worse.

898
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,833
I really want to hate both of you,

899
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:16,000
but I don't have any reason to do that.

900
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,500
You just wanted to apologize to him.

901
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:21,083
I understand.

902
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,291
Aim was being honest with me.

903
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,125
He did the right thing.

904
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,291
We have to choose
what's best for ourselves.

905
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,250
I really get it.

906
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,541
Mi.

907
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,500
I am...

908
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:47,583
I'm really sorry.

909
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:51,708
Hey.

910
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:53,500
I'm truly sorry.

911
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:55,958
It's okay.

912
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,875
This shirt was the last thing
of yours in his house.

913
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,541
He returned everything to you.

914
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:18,666
Goodbye.

915
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,458
It's Mi's stuff.

916
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:09,083
She may come back for them.

917
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:16,791
Why are you doing this?

918
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,708
You said it yourself.

919
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,333
Let go of everything
that you don't need anymore.

920
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:26,333
I did exactly what you told me.

921
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:30,291
You're actually right.

922
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,000
Just keep what's best for you.

923
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:44,125
Don't you know you're throwing away
what's best for you?

924
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:45,500
I tried. It isn't right.

925
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:46,500
Call Mi now.

926
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:47,875
-I'll help.
-You're wasting time.

927
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,166
I'm doing this for you.

928
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,541
You're doing it for you.

929
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:57,208
You returned my stuff to me for yourself.

930
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:00,333
You apologized to me for yourself.

931
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:03,875
You're helping me with Mi for yourself,

932
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,458
so you can dump me with no guilt.

933
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:13,416
Jean, seriously...

934
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,416
when you came to apologize,

935
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:19,791
I was mad.

936
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,125
It was like...

937
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,458
you were off the hook
after you apologized.

938
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,458
So I had to forgive you, right?

939
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,083
If I don't forgive you, it's my problem.

940
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:34,958
It's no longer your problem.

941
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:37,583
It was like...

942
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,416
you took all your guilt

943
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,375
and dumped it on me.

944
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,208
Then you just left.

945
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,666
I just wanted to apologize
because I really care about you.

946
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:49,958
Then don't apologize.

947
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,958
Live with your guilt.

948
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,833
Don't run away. Can you do it?

949
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,250
I...

950
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,750
Everything is already in the past.

951
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:11,833
Can't you let it go?

952
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,833
If you ever truly loved someone,

953
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:19,291
you would know it's easier said than done.

954
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,875
Have you ever truly loved anyone?

955
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,208
I really shouldn't have come back.

956
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,000
Jean.

957
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:02,708
Just admit that you're selfish

958
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:05,250
and move on with your life. That's all.

959
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:10,416
You don't have to worry.
Everyone is like this.

960
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,958
They have to choose
what's best for themselves.

961
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:21,666
We see what we want to see.

962
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,208
We remember what we choose to.

963
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,333
That's all there is.

964
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,208
Just get on with your life.

965
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:39,041
But I said I was sorry, Aim.

966
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,333
I said I was sorry.

967
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:44,416
I said sorry. Damn it!

968
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,916
What are you doing here?

969
01:35:34,291 --> 01:35:35,875
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

970
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:39,583
Yes.

971
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:42,916
Can you take Mom out?

972
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,791
Are you really going to do it?

973
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,791
No one knows how to play it, anyway.

974
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,166
Why should we keep it?

975
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:01,208
Aren't you coming?

976
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,416
I have work.

977
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,708
Do you want anything for dinner?

978
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:09,791
No.

979
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,583
Thank you so much.

980
01:38:54,666 --> 01:38:57,500
When you finish renovating,
please let me know.

981
01:38:57,583 --> 01:38:58,791
I would like to check it out.

982
01:38:58,875 --> 01:39:00,000
Take care.

983
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,333
Jean!

984
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,041
Open the door and talk to me!

985
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:32,041
Jean!

986
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,791
Where's the piano?

987
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:37,833
Bring it back!

988
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:42,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

989
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:45,750
Do you think I'm stupid
tricking me like this?

990
01:39:45,916 --> 01:39:47,250
How could you?

991
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,250
Open the door and talk to me!

992
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,541
Why are you like this?

993
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:05,708
You're selfish like your father.

994
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,166
Do you know that?

995
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:12,000
Do you know that you're selfish?

996
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,416
Bring back the piano!

997
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,666
Pink, I want the original plan
for the office.

998
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,041
I sold the piano.

999
01:41:02,208 --> 01:41:04,625
Sorry about that. Thanks a lot.

1000
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:11,458
What's up?

1001
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:17,416
Jay, I'm going away.
Can you clear out my room?

1002
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,875
How am I supposed to know
what you want to keep?

1003
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,875
TEE, TUM, OAK, POM

1004
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:35,416
JEAN'S PLAYLIST FOR AIM

1005
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,958
Toss everything out.

1006
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:39,000
It's too much trouble. I can't do it.

1007
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:44,166
I put the important stuff
in my luggage already.

1008
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:48,416
Sure. I'll take care of it.

1009
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,708
Right.

1010
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:59,000
Don't bother calling me.

1011
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,291
Throw everything out.

1012
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:01,750
Snap your fingers for me.

1013
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:03,583
I'll come back after New Year's.

1014
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:41,458
FRIENDS

1015
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:46,583
UNFRIEND

1016
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:50,000
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO UNFRIEND AIM THANA?

1017
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:51,083
CONFIRM

1018
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:05,958
Damn, Jean. I'm happy for you.

1019
01:45:06,041 --> 01:45:07,416
You did it.

1020
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:11,916
Once you've decluttered your house,
it's really spacious.

1021
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,250
You can do a lot with it.

1022
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,666
Anyway, how are things with Aim?

1023
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,875
Is everything okay?

1024
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:26,291
Well...

1025
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,333
I...

1026
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:32,166
I think he really got over me.

1027
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:36,791
The last time I talked to him,

1028
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:39,750
we talked normally.

1029
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:41,458
I think we can be friends.

1030
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:43,875
I guess...

1031
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,625
we all have to move on.

1032
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:51,500
Also, he's moving to Singapore soon

1033
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:54,375
with his new girlfriend for work.

1034
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,041
That's cool.

1035
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,958
Are you glad? I'm happy for you.

1036
01:53:07,583 --> 01:53:09,958
