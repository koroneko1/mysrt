00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,799
Mate. See that number 14, yeah?

327
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,160
He definitely has something for you, mate.

328
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,039
A crush or something, mate.

329
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,000
[Tao] Is Harry Green picking on Charlie?

330
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,440
[Elle] Maybe they're friends.

331
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,599
[Tao] That's even worse.

332
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,000
Next, Charlie will be bringing
the whole rugby team

333
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,720
to our film night
and making us watch Avengers or something.

334
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,680
Is that your nightmare scenario?

335
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,920
Watching a movie you hate
with people you don't like very much?

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,119
Charlie's befriending bullies,
and our friendship group is falling apart.

337
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,880
-Take this seriously.
-Hey.

338
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,200
I didn't come to risk seeing
all the Truham Boys who used to pick on me

339
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,319
just for you to tell me
our friendship group's falling apart.

340
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Go after him, mate. 100%.

341
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,960
All right. Boys, set up. Set up.

342
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,799
Go on, mate.

343
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,319
Keep your head up, Charlie.

344
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
-[coach] Hang in there, boys.
-[Nick] Come on!

345
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,640
[thunder rumbling]

346
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,759
[breathing heavily]

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,240
[Charlie grunts]

348
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,319
-Charlie!
-[whistle blows]

349
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,039
[Nick] Is it okay if we, like…

350
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,160
Keep this a secret?

351
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,079
[Nick] Yeah.

352
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:16,160
[coach] Okay, that's it, I'm calling it.
This rain is too dangerous!

353
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
Match is over! Everyone off the pitch!

354
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,119
[breathing heavily]

355
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,920
[knock at door]

356
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey.

357
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,559
Hey.

358
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,480
Is your nose okay?

359
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,400
I don't know.

360
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,559
Let me see.

361
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,079
It looks fine.

362
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,640
Cool.

363
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
You've got some mud on your face though.

364
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,440
[soft music playing]

365
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,680
Um, sorry… [chuckles nervously]

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,839
What?

367
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm really sorry
for being all clingy and annoying.

368
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,799
I'm making this so awkward.

369
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,519
You wanted to keep us a secret
and I'm messing it up.

370
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm the one who should be saying sorry.

371
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
[Isaac] Uh…

372
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,079
Sorry…

373
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,640
for, um…

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,720
interrupting, but Ms. Singh told me
to give you some… antiseptic wipes.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay.

376
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
[door opens and closes]

377
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Um… [clears throat]

378
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,319
I'd better go.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay.

380
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,160
Isaac won't say anything.

381
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:10,880
Yeah.

382
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Okay.

383
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
[door closes]

384
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,480
Charlie's not going to give up
on Nick Nelson, is he?

385
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,440
Highly doubt it.

386
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,480
[scoffs]

387
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
Maybe we should
just stop getting involved.

388
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,440
I can't believe
you just actually suggested that.

389
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,160
You, Tao Xu,
King of Getting Involved. [giggles]

390
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
Shut up.

391
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,039
-It was nice meeting your friends though.
-Yeah?

392
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,319
Yeah.

393
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,559
They seem cool.

394
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,519
They are.

395
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,960
Have they replaced us?

396
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,599
As if anyone could replace

397
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,839
your incredibly annoying,
loud presence in my life.

398
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,680
-[in deep voice] How dare you?
-[chuckles]

399
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,480
[Harry] Who you waiting for?

400
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
[Imogen] I was just waiting to see Nick.

401
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,359
-Oh. Finally ready to make a move?
-[girl] I know…

402
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,880
-Just piss off, Harry.
-[boys] Ooh!

403
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Okay, fine. If you're gonna be
a coward about it.

404
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,000
[boys chuckling]

405
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,160
[boy] Ooh, feisty.

406
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
Oh. Hey.

407
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,599
Hey!

408
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
What's up?

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,119
You did so good.

410
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Uh, I mean, the match was cancelled
and we were losing anyway, but…

411
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,440
Thanks.

412
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,400
So what's going on?

413
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,799
[Imogen] I…

414
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
[boys shushing]

415
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,839
I…

416
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,559
wanted to ask you if, um…

417
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,720
Like, this is really random.
[laughs nervously]

418
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,039
But maybe we could,
like… go out somewhere.

419
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,799
-[students exclaiming]
-Together.

420
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,119
Like, I guess sort of a… date.

421
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,559
Or something.

422
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,359
Oh. Um…

423
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,640
[Harry] Go on, Nick.

424
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,079
[all chuckling]

425
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,319
Yeah. I guess so, sure.

426
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
[Harry laughing] Yes, lad.

427
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,519
Lads, let's get out of here.

428
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
[Imogen giggles]

429
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,839
[peppy music playing]
