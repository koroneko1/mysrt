&lrm;-Master, are you ok?
&lrm;-She's here.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.140
&lrm;Hello, Ladybug.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.220
&lrm;I know you never wanted me
&lrm;to bring her here again,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.260
&lrm;but you must see what she discovered!

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.740
&lrm;-Show him, Marinette!
&lrm;-I've been here.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.220
&lrm;I've met you before.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.500
&lrm;You're the healer
&lrm;that cured Tikki when you was sick!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.060
&lrm;So, I'm guessing you're not really a vet?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.540
&lrm;Not really.
&lrm;That was your first day of school.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.460
&lrm;It wasn't a chance meeting either.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.460
&lrm;Marinette,
&lrm;you're always ready to help others!

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.420
&lrm;I knew that day, that very moment,
&lrm;that you'd make a fantastic Ladybug.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.580
&lrm;But... who are you?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.940
&lrm;Master Fu is the last known member
&lrm;of the Order of the Guardians!

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.020
&lrm;Guardians of the Miraculous.
&lrm;I'm Wayzz, Master Fu's Kwami.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.980
&lrm;It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.340
&lrm;Uh... you too.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.060
&lrm;We are responsible for protecting
&lrm;and distributing the Miraculous,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.820
&lrm;for the good of all humanity.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.980
&lrm;We are chosen in childhood
&lrm;and trained for years,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500
&lrm;<i>specially for this mission.</i>

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.100
&lrm;<i>When we were much, much younger,</i>
&lrm;<i>we... I made a mistake.</i>

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.980
&lrm;<i>The Guardians' Temple was destroyed,</i>

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.020
&lrm;all because of me.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.460
&lrm;Two of the Miraculous were lost that day,
&lrm;the butterfly and the peacock.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.620
&lrm;Also gone forever
&lrm;was the ancient spell book.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.020
&lrm;But all it has
&lrm;are drawings of old superheroes

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.060
&lrm;and a bunch of strange symbols!

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.500
&lrm;Not strange to a Guardian.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.820
&lrm;Back in the days, I was never given
&lrm;the opportunity to even have a look at it.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.500
&lrm;But I've been taught enough to be able
&lrm;to partially decipher the code.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.460
&lrm;These pages contain various spells
&lrm;capable of giving Ladybug and Cat Noir

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.100
&lrm;special abilities
&lrm;we haven't known about until now.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.980
&lrm;Obviously, this book is invaluable.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.940
&lrm;-Why did you take the book?
&lrm;-I... I just wanted to know

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.260
&lrm;what you were hiding
&lrm;that was so important.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.260
&lrm;You... you never told me
&lrm;about those things.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.180
&lrm;I was intending to give it back to you,
&lrm;I swear, but then... I lost it.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.420
&lrm;How can I possibly trust you again,
&lrm;Adrien?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.660
&lrm;-I'm sorry. I'll get you another copy.
&lrm;-It's one of a kind!

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.260
&lrm;The book's the source of my inspiration.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.620
&lrm;I didn't know that. I hardly know
&lrm;anything about you, Father.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.460
&lrm;You won't be returning to school.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.700
&lrm;You'll be homeschooled again,
&lrm;with Nathalie.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420
&lrm;I've always believed that
&lrm;whoever possessed this spell book

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.700
&lrm;must also have the peacock
&lrm;and the butterfly Miraculous.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.220
&lrm;Wait a sec. You mean, whoever owned
&lrm;the spell book could be Hawk Moth?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.580
&lrm;How did you discover this book, Marinette?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.500
&lrm;I... uh...

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.380
&lrm;I found it lying on a bench in a park,
&lrm;close to... close to the school.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.780
&lrm;-You didn't see who it belonged to, then?
&lrm;-No. No, I didn't.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.100
&lrm;What a shame.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.500
&lrm;I thought we were about to discover
&lrm;the identity of Hawk Moth!

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.980
&lrm;-We'd have had a chance to defeat him.
&lrm;-Uh...

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.660
&lrm;I could investigate if you want.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.460
&lrm;But you must be very careful, Marinette.
&lrm;If you succeed,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.260
&lrm;you may well find yourself
&lrm;face to face with Hawk Moth.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.420
&lrm;I'll be very careful, I promise.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.020
&lrm;-Why did you lie to Master Fu?
&lrm;-I couldn't tell him Adrien

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.260
&lrm;was the one who had the book.
&lrm;Adrien can't be Hawk Moth!

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.740
&lrm;But what if he is? It would mean
&lrm;I'm crazy in love with a supervillain!

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.500
&lrm;I can't be in love with a villain!
&lrm;I'd have to fight him!

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.060
&lrm;Calm down, Marinette.
&lrm;I'm sure there is an explanation.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.860
&lrm;I need to get to the bottom of this.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.540
&lrm;Do you know where to find Adrien?

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.700
&lrm;I know that boy's schedule by heart!

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.260
&lrm;Let's go!

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.940
&lrm;I don't see him. Something's up!
&lrm;Adrien never misses his fencing lessons.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.380
&lrm;Oh, no! This is a terrible tragedy!

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.460
&lrm;-What's up with her?
&lrm;-Adrien's never coming back to school,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.540
&lrm;ever!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.340
&lrm;[sobs]

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.020
&lrm;-His dad grounded him!
&lrm;-For life.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.420
&lrm;-What? Why?
&lrm;-Something about losing

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.500
&lrm;this book that belongs to his dad.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620
&lrm;His dad? Ha! Phew!

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.460
&lrm;-Phew?
&lrm;-Phew... 'cause I...

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.300
&lrm;I was scared it was super serious!
&lrm;I mean, yeah, sure, it really is serious,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.060
&lrm;but it's not like he's sick or anything.
&lrm;Surely we can fix this, right?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.740
&lrm;We won't just stand by
&lrm;and let this happen!

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.940
&lrm;So it wasn't Adrien's book.
&lrm;It was his father's!

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.380
&lrm;Adrien isn't Hawk Moth! Oh, I knew it!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.020
&lrm;Adrien doesn't have
&lrm;an evil bone in his body!

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.140
&lrm;Except Adrien did take the book
&lrm;without his father's permission!

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.100
&lrm;Well, he must have had
&lrm;a good reason to do it.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.500
&lrm;You realise, based on Master Fu's theory,
&lrm;Adrien's father could be Hawk Moth.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.380
&lrm;No way! It couldn't be!

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.540
&lrm;Hmm... An eccentric artist,
&lrm;who never leaves his home.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.020
&lrm;Mysterious, very intelligent, but cold,
&lrm;even with his own son.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.660
&lrm;[gasps]
&lrm;This is a very strong lead, Tikki!

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.100
&lrm;-Please be careful, Marinette.
&lrm;-I will.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.340
&lrm;Tikki... spots on! Ha!

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.980
&lrm;<i>Has the cat got your tongue?</i>
&lrm;<i>Leave a message!</i>

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.260
&lrm;Cat Noir, I think I know who Hawk Moth is!
&lrm;Get your whiskers over here fast!

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.540
&lrm;What will you do without the book?

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.980
&lrm;You know where this goes.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.220
&lrm;Hmm.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.380
&lrm;[crashing continues]

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.660
&lrm;[music playing]

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.220
&lrm;Look on the bright side. Your father
&lrm;could have found out about me!

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.220
&lrm;It's a good thing
&lrm;we Kwamis can never be photographed!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.980
&lrm;Photographers have no idea
&lrm;what they're missing!

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.660
&lrm;I must find that book or I'll never
&lrm;be allowed to return to school.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.060
&lrm;Return to school? Are you crazy?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.460
&lrm;No more homework, no more alarm clocks!

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.300
&lrm;We should be celebrating! Hey, I know...

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.020
&lrm;I named this piece&lrm;<i> El Plaggo.</i>
&lrm;It's been maturing for 999 days.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.540
&lrm;[crashing sounds]
&lrm;Oh!

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.060
&lrm;What was that?

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.380
&lrm;Your father is very busy.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.340
&lrm;Shouldn't Adrien be practising
&lrm;his piano right now?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.420
&lrm;I feel the wrath of a father
&lrm;betrayed by his son!

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.700
&lrm;What perfect prey for my akuma!

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.980
&lrm;Stay close, my little akuma.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.100
&lrm;Dark wings fall!

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.580
&lrm;Uh... Why is the akuma still here?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.500
&lrm;I must become someone else
&lrm;to lead them astray.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.420
&lrm;I don't understand, Master.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.780
&lrm;Nooroo, I renounce you.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.900
&lrm;What?

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.860
&lrm;Temporarily.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.740
&lrm;Come to me, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise me!

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.860
&lrm;I am now... The Collector!

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.380
&lrm;My book of inspiration
&lrm;has been taken from me.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.780
&lrm;So I shall build a new one

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.260
&lrm;and perhaps pick up
&lrm;a Miraculous or two while I'm at it.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.180
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.940
&lrm;My father is angry because of me.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.060
&lrm;He won't forgive me till I find that book.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.900
&lrm;May I remind you
&lrm;that you are actually grounded?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.580
&lrm;Adrien is, but Cat Noir isn't.
&lrm;Plagg... claws out!

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.420
&lrm;Oh, my!

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.540
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir, I think I know who Hawk Moth is!</i>
&lrm;<i>Get your whiskers over here fast!</i>

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.460
&lrm;Wow! I guess the spell book
&lrm;will have to wait a bit longer!

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.060
&lrm;Nathalie, you will be the first
&lrm;of my many inspirations to come.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.300
&lrm;-Mister Agreste?
&lrm;-You will call me The Collector!

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.060
&lrm;Adrien, I have a great collection
&lrm;I want to show you.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.580
&lrm;Grr!

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.100
&lrm;Cheese!

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.620
&lrm;[screaming]

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.340
&lrm;<i>Show me the news. It's just the news!</i>
&lrm;<i>I'm Nadja Chamack--</i>

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.940
&lrm;Since the book
&lrm;that filled my life is gone,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.260
&lrm;I'm going to use your life
&lrm;to fill up this new one!

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.540
&lrm;<i>People of Paris...</i>

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.540
&lrm;Nothing could inspire me more

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.220
&lrm;than imprisoning Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;in these pages forever!

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.420
&lrm;[groans]

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.140
&lrm;Cat Noir, what did you do?

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.300
&lrm;Cat Noir, did you get my messages?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.740
&lrm;Yeah. And I can't wait to know more,
&lrm;M'ladytective! So, who's the suspect?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.700
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste.
&lrm;You know, the fashion designer.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.900
&lrm;-You got proof?
&lrm;-Uh... Um... I can't tell you.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.380
&lrm;So, I'm supposed to just accept that?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.220
&lrm;You must trust me on this.
&lrm;But it all makes sense!

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.060
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste is a secretive man
&lrm;and he never leaves his house.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.220
&lrm;And get this. Check out his brand's logo.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.660
&lrm;A butterfly?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.140
&lrm;You OK, Cat Noir?

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.780
&lrm;It's time to get to the bottom of this.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.980
&lrm;My plan is working perfectly.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.860
&lrm;Whoa! What happened here? Looks like
&lrm;somebody had a little tantrum!

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.300
&lrm;Are you sure you're OK?

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.460
&lrm;Yeah. Yeah, let's keep going.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.380
&lrm;Ah! He's got a son! Let's check his room,
&lrm;make sure nothing's happened to him!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.740
&lrm;-Where's Gabriel?
&lrm;-There is no more Gabriel!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.980
&lrm;There is only... The Collector!

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.500
&lrm;You won't be able to escape!

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.380
&lrm;Wait!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.380
&lrm;Nice piece, wouldn't you agree?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.340
&lrm;The akuma's gotta be in that book!

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.340
&lrm;Yeah, but if we touch it, we'll disappear!

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.020
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.660
&lrm;A pedal?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.420
&lrm;I have no idea what to do with this!
&lrm;We need to stall him.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.260
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,
&lrm;you shall be the masterpieces

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.180
&lrm;in my new book of inspiration!

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.860
&lrm;-My collection's growing!
&lrm;-No!

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.180
&lrm;So that must mean Gabriel Agreste
&lrm;can't possibly be Hawk Moth.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.340
&lrm;-He's been akumatized.
&lrm;-You call Agreste

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.580
&lrm;turning into The Collector good news?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.220
&lrm;-Gabriel Agreste's son isn't at home?
&lrm;-Maybe he's already captured him!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.420
&lrm;You think he'd take it out on his own son?

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.100
&lrm;-Uh...
&lrm;-You cannot escape from me!

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.500
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.820
&lrm;What if he has no pages left in this book?

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.300
&lrm;But before I immortalise you, allow me
&lrm;to seize your Miraculous for Hawk Moth!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.940
&lrm;-Cat Noir, I need ammunition!
&lrm;-You need... what?

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.700
&lrm;We are going to complete his collection!

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.580
&lrm;-Very smart, milady! Quite ingenious!
&lrm;-Less talking, more doing!

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.260
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.620
&lrm;-Ready, Cat Noir?
&lrm;-I'm always ready for you, milady!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.980
&lrm;Come on, come on.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.340
&lrm;No more ammo!

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.900
&lrm;It's already full!

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.620
&lrm;My book! No!

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.260
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.620
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.260
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.780
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.100
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.460
&lrm;Pound?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.620
&lrm;Are you OK, Fa... Sir?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.140
&lrm;Cat Noir? Ladybug? What happened to me?

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.820
&lrm;You were akumatized by Hawk Moth.
&lrm;But don't worry. It's over now.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.060
&lrm;Thank you. Thank you, both of you.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.300
&lrm;[gasps]

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.500
&lrm;Adrien! Where is my son?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.700
&lrm;He must be hiding.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.180
&lrm;Cat Noir's right. Otherwise
&lrm;he'd have reappeared right here.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.980
&lrm;Nothing must happen to him.
&lrm;He's too precious to me.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.420
&lrm;We're about to transform back! Goodbye.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.420
&lrm;Don't worry, sir.
&lrm;I'm sure your son is safe and sound.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.540
&lrm;See you very soon.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.660
&lrm;So, since Gabriel Agreste was akumatized,
&lrm;he can't possibly be Hawk Moth, right?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.340
&lrm;That's very probable, but how
&lrm;did you find out that Gabriel Agreste

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.740
&lrm;was the owner of the spell book?

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.660
&lrm;At first, I thought it belonged

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.140
&lrm;to Gabriel Agreste's son, Adrien,
&lrm;'cause I saw him with it at school,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.100
&lrm;before it was stolen by a girl
&lrm;and before Tikki got it back.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.340
&lrm;And I'd only just met you, so
&lrm;I didn't know if I could tell you that.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.860
&lrm;So, yeah.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.220
&lrm;You were afraid in case the one
&lrm;you love turned out to be Hawk Moth.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.940
&lrm;What? Uh, no! Er, how did you know
&lrm;that? I mean, I don't love him at all.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.540
&lrm;[nervous laugh]

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.140
&lrm;Oh, all right! Yes! Adrien is amazing.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.140
&lrm;I couldn't stand the thought
&lrm;of him being a supervillain!

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.460
&lrm;You know, if we want to be
&lrm;stronger than Hawk Moth,

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.020
&lrm;we have to trust each other.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.460
&lrm;I know.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.060
&lrm;But now Adrien will never
&lrm;come back to school

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.100
&lrm;because I can't give him that book back!
&lrm;I'll never, ever see him again!

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.100
&lrm;[sobs]

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.460
&lrm;There isn't a single problem
&lrm;that can't be solved, Marinette.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.500
&lrm;These modern inventions
&lrm;really are quite incredible. Hmm.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.260
&lrm;So, when Adrien put the book down and
&lrm;walked away, I wanted to take a peek.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.620
&lrm;See, I thought it was a portfolio with
&lrm;pictures of him, 'cause he's so cute!

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.300
&lrm;Er, but you already knew that.
&lrm;Anyway, um, when he came back,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.540
&lrm;I was scared he'd see me staring at it,
&lrm;so I hid it in my backpack.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.780
&lrm;And I know it was a dumb thing to do.
&lrm;I'm really, really sorry.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.180
&lrm;I see. So, you're one of his admirers?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.340
&lrm;Admirers, yeah, that's the word.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.820
&lrm;You won't say anything to him?

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.100
&lrm;Will you let Adrien come back to school?

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.940
&lrm;Well, considering he didn't lose my book,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.780
&lrm;as it was borrowed by you, yes, I will.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.620
&lrm;Thank you!

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.660
&lrm;Can I ask you a question?

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.460
&lrm;I flipped through the book
&lrm;and it looked really awesome.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.340
&lrm;Those illustrations of legendary heroes
&lrm;are super... inspiring.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.820
&lrm;-Where did you get it?
&lrm;-I found it while on a trip overseas.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.140
&lrm;I've never seen another copy of it.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.780
&lrm;Well, then you're very lucky to own it.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.140
&lrm;That was really brave, what you just did.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.060
&lrm;Thanks. All that matters is for Adrien
&lrm;to be allowed out of the house again.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.340
&lrm;I'm sorry I became so furious over a book.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.900
&lrm;I shouldn't have taken it without asking.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.580
&lrm;That book was the very last gift
&lrm;your mother gave to me before...

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.620
&lrm;before she disappeared. All I have left
&lrm;of her is this book... and you.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.260
&lrm;But I know I can't keep the book,
&lrm;or you, locked up forever.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.140
&lrm;Does that mean
&lrm;you'll let me go back to school then?

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.220
&lrm;Thank you, Father!

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.900
&lrm;So, then, if you already had
&lrm;a copy of the book,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.020
&lrm;why did you go through all that trouble?

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.980
&lrm;I did what I had to do to keep my secret.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.620
&lrm;-Happy to see me again?
&lrm;-At your service, Master!

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.980
&lrm;Nooroo, dark wings rise!

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.940
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir!
&lrm;You almost managed to find out who I am,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.020
&lrm;but now I am more above suspicion
&lrm;than I've ever been.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.940
&lrm;As of today, nothing will prevent me
&lrm;from getting your Miraculous,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.300
&lrm;and making my greatest wish come true!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.860
&lrm;All I need to do now
&lrm;is wait for my next prey.
