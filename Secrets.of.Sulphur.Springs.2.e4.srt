1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:01,294
Harper:
Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,171
Oh, no!

3
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,798
There used to be
a crystal here.

4
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:06,675
It's gone.
Until we find it,

5
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,301
you're stuck here
being Harper.

6
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,178
Whatever you normally do,
Harper will cover for you

7
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,221
until you guys switch back.

8
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,889
Harper, are you feeling okay?

9
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,849
Yes. I think I'm just...

10
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:15,809
Having a rough day?

11
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:16,685
What game are you playing?

12
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:17,978
It's a spirit board.

13
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:19,187
We're trying
to contact the ghost

14
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,313
who pulled down
the wallpaper.

15
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,898
‐Wyatt: It's her!
‐Zoey: The ghost.

16
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:23,358
The lady we saw
through the window.

17
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,568
Her name is Mrs. Barker.

18
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:25,944
She's definitely not a ghost.

19
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,654
My friend Savannah
just sent me a picture

20
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,072
and I need you
to take a look at it.

21
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,283
It's the maintenance man
at the hotel in 1962.

22
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:32,325
His name is Sam.

23
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,536
"Help. Stuck in 1930."

24
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,204
Hang on, Harper. I'm coming.

25
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,206
‐Who said
you could touch that?
‐Sam.

26
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,709
What if somehow
he's the key to all of this?

27
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:44,212
Nooo!

28
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,841
(screaming)

29
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,684
I'm sorry, okay?

30
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,145
I never should've
taken that thing.

31
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,522
I was gonna put it back.
I swear!

32
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:03,898
(thunder rumbling)

33
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,150
Forget this!

34
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,867
(shimmering)

35
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,954
(bubbling)

36
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:25,587
(theme music playing)

37
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:53,865
Daisy,
there might be a way

38
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,408
we could get the portal
working again.

39
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,993
A way that involves
your brother.

40
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,329
How?
Sam is only a child,

41
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,164
or he was
when I last saw him.

42
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,332
Yeah,
but when he grows up,

43
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,625
he turns the radio
into a time machine.

44
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,834
I‐‐ I'm sure of it.

45
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,461
We just need
to find out how he did it.

46
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,671
Do you remember him
working on anything like that?

47
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,924
He showed me sketches
of all his contraptions, but‐‐

48
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,133
Could you recreate them?

49
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,135
I don't know.

50
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,845
Even if I remember
the images correctly,

51
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,348
I could never put together
how Sam's invention works.

52
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,475
He's the genius,
not me.

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,312
I'm gonna be
stuck here forever, aren't I?

54
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,897
No. We'll get you back,
Daisy.

55
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,691
One way or another.

56
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,192
How can you be
so certain?

57
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,193
Because if we don't,

58
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,277
then you'll never
grow up in the '30s

59
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,237
like you're supposed to.

60
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,113
You'll never have kids.

61
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,447
Harper will never be born.

62
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,783
Just trust me, we can't
mess with time like that.

63
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,493
And besides,
there's no way
I'm leaving Harper

64
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,036
stranded all alone
back there.

65
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,455
You really care for her,
don't you?

66
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah.

67
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,630
(leaves rustling)

68
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,231
It has to be here somewhere.

69
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,446
You are not
supposed to be here.

70
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:16,740
You built this?

71
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,534
Oh, my gosh,
I have so many questions!

72
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,369
‐This radio‐‐
‐Is an old piece of junk.

73
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,163
Just like everything else
in this basement.

74
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,789
It is not a toy.

75
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,749
Well, trust me,
I know that, but‐‐

76
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,710
No, but‐‐ No!
What you've been doing
is you've been snooping.

77
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,879
I've seen you follow me
around the hotel.

78
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,173
Well, I haven't been snooping.

79
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:38,094
Okay, well, maybe I have,
but can you blame me?

80
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,889
I saw you coming out
of a secret room

81
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,266
and then collecting
all those cables in the barn.

82
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,394
I thought you're
up to something,
and I was right.

83
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,146
You're building
a time machine.

84
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:56,946
That's a good one!

85
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,909
You know, I think you're reading
a little too much H. G. Wells.

86
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,786
Now, I love a good story.

87
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,789
It's not a story.
You don't have to lie, Sam.

88
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,082
Not to me.

89
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,834
I know what this radio
really is.

90
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:11,753
Or at least what it will be.

91
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,755
I've used it.

92
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:16,549
(scoffs)

93
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,053
Who put you up to this?

94
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,931
Another counselor?
A camper?

95
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,475
I've heard
what they call me.

96
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,392
Moss Man.

97
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,938
You know, I guess
I'm just a perfect target

98
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,189
for this kind of prank.

99
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,693
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have real work to do.

100
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,364
‐But‐‐
‐Go on.

101
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,463
Thanks.

102
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,720
He didn't even go inside.

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,722
It's almost like
he doesn't want the job.

104
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,349
I don't think he does.

105
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,687
Whoa! All this
just to replace
a few leaky pipes?

106
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:12,814
There's gotta be
another plumber in town
we can call.

107
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,608
None that'll come out here.
(scoffs)

108
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,193
I mean, as soon as they heard
the word "Tremont,"

109
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,987
it's like they couldn't get
off the phone quick enough.

110
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,323
You know,
once we fix it up,

111
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,200
people will
change their minds
about the hotel.

112
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,869
We just need the chance.

113
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,246
(people laughing)

114
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,372
You hear that?

115
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,336
♪

116
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,883
(woman laughing)
Hey, stop.

117
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,802
What's going on?

118
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,471
Oh, sorry.
Is this your land?

119
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,015
We didn't mean
to bother anyone.

120
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,016
woman: We were
just hiking past

121
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,142
and saw the water here.

122
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,768
Looked too good
to pass up.

123
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,605
The springs.

124
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,065
They're back!

125
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,233
woman: We'll just get
out of your way.

126
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,943
You don't think
all the rain from last night

127
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,236
could've done this, do you?

128
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,404
No.

129
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,116
It makes no sense,
but...

130
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,078
You know what this means?

131
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,707
This means business,
tourists, profit.

132
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,585
This means our luck
is changing.

133
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:18,004
(water running)

134
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,843
(knock on door)

135
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,804
Topher, Mother instructed me
to tell you

136
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,222
to get dressed for school,

137
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,601
but you cannot wear
your man‐spider shirt
because it's...

138
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,022
Did you go out
in the storm last night?

139
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,067
Oh, I, uh...

140
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,902
must've been sleepwalking.

141
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,072
Probably all those
gummy worms I ate
before bed.

142
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,240
Messed with my REM.

143
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,451
Look, don't tell Mom, okay?

144
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,953
Jess:
Harper! Topher!

145
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,955
We're running late,

146
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,248
and if you don't get
your butts in the car

147
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,167
in the next two minutes,
you can walk to school.

148
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,460
Uh...

149
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,544
I don't mind walking.

150
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,712
You don't?

151
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,590
I mean, uh, me neither.

152
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,177
Okay, what's up
with you two? Hmm?

153
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,639
Topher, you've got that
"I'm hiding something" look
on your face.

154
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,183
He overslept,
but don't worry,

155
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,185
I'll make sure he gets
to school on time.

156
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,438
Fine, but get a move on.

157
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,733
Have I ever told you

158
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,652
you're the best
big sister ever?

159
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,868
Come on, do something!

160
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:35,248
radio announcer:
...so delicious, you'll swear
it came from Grandma's kitchen.

161
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,459
And stick around
for your favorite serial
and mine,

162
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,087
"The Man Out of Time,"
with Dutch Kelley.

163
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,257
Thought you hated
this program.

164
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,342
It's about time travel?

165
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,678
It's about an adventurer

166
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,346
who journeys
along the timeline

167
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,223
to prevent the world
from ending.

168
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,516
Does he use a portal?

169
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,977
And does he ever get,
you know, stuck?

170
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,938
Weird question,
I know.

171
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:03,443
Sorry. It's just interesting,
all this science fiction stuff.

172
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,027
Time travel and visions...

173
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,029
The visions
aren't science fiction.

174
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,531
Right, right. Of course.

175
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:12,118
But, um,
are there rules for them?

176
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,786
Do they just
pop up randomly or‐‐

177
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,247
Have you forgotten
everything
Mother taught us?

178
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,751
Uh... No.
No, I remember, yeah.

179
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:23,671
Sorry, I must be overtired
or something.

180
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,173
Out late last night?

181
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,175
More like
up early this morning.

182
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,843
5:00 a. m. with the hens.

183
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,678
I'll never take an omelet
for granted again.

184
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,846
(chuckles)

185
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,892
Anyway, um,
enjoy the show.

186
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:36,684
(clears throat)

187
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,358
(indistinct screaming)

188
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,069
Is that supposed
to be scary?

189
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,570
It's sad, I know.

190
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,197
But this is
one of the best
ghost sites

191
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,198
on the Internet.

192
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,575
If we want
more information
on ectoplasm

193
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,285
or whatever
caused this,

194
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,079
then we need
to find experts.

195
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,873
Especially now that Topher's
ghosting us for some reason.

196
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,583
Maybe he saw a ghost
in the basement,

197
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,585
and he's too freaked out
to come back here.

198
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,212
Wish we could see
a real ghost,

199
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,881
and not just some
confused old lady
wandering around the yard.

200
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,466
Just because
we were wrong about her

201
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,551
doesn't mean we're wrong
about The Tremont
being haunted.

202
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,429
But this site doesn't have
the info we need.

203
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,515
It'd be faster
if we start our own page.

204
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,558
Then we can post
all the ghostly activity
we see,

205
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,268
and the experts
would come to us.

206
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,603
That's a great idea!

207
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,939
We'll get way more views
than the time we tried
the dance video.

208
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,566
I thought we agreed
to never talk
about that again.

209
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,777
Sarah:
What are you kids doing?

210
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,320
You should be halfway
to school by now.

211
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,530
To be continued.

212
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,659
Griffin:
There you are!

213
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,618
I stayed up half the night

214
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,786
searching the hotel
for the crystal,

215
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,204
but no luck.

216
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,373
Are you ready
for today?

217
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,333
Truthfully, no.

218
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,793
It's a lot to ask,

219
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,586
but until we find
that thing,

220
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,755
you have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

221
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,757
I mean, you've been
pulling it off so far.

222
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,969
Mrs. Dunn and Topher
still believe
you're her, right?

223
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,262
I think so.

224
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,722
Though Topher was acting
a little strange today.

225
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,100
Said he was sleepwalking
outside last night.

226
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,976
In a storm?

227
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,438
Hey, Daisy. It's okay.

228
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,232
I mean, it's just school.

229
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,609
Couldn't have changed
that much in 90 years.

230
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,405
Look, just... sit in class.

231
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,614
Don't talk back.

232
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,991
Maybe don't talk
at all.

233
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,577
I don't know
if I can do this.

234
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,328
Just think of it
as an adventure.

235
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,663
That's how
Harper will look at it.

236
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,541
But I'm not Harper!
That's the problem.

237
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,667
I know you want me
to be her,

238
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,127
but this is all
so much.

239
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,587
My brother invented
a time machine.

240
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,213
My mother's
potentially a ghost.

241
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,590
I'm stuck in the future.

242
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,759
Everything here
is so fast and bright,

243
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,887
and there's so much
beeping everywhere.

244
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,638
I've done everything
you've asked, Griffin,

245
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,182
but I'm still not her.

246
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,642
‐(school bell rings)
‐I don't know how much longer
I can pretend.

247
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,685
But you have to!

248
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,687
Harper's whole life
is at stake.

249
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,397
Look, I'll handle
everything else

250
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,732
if you could just
get through today.

251
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,526
One day.
You can do that, can't you?

252
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,702
(indistinct chatter)

253
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,761
You're in my seat.

254
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:19,013
Oh, um, sorry.

255
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,434
Everyone all settled?

256
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,895
Good.

257
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,897
We're starting today
with a pop quiz...

258
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:29,649
(students groaning)

259
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,734
...on the material
we covered last week,

260
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,905
particularly the events
leading up to the start
of World War II.

261
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,782
There was a Second World War?

262
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,242
(students laughing)

263
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,878
♪

264
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,719
(birds chirping)

265
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,023
Hello?

266
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,078
Oh! Who are you?

267
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,454
How did you get in here?

268
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,623
Uh, the front door.

269
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,250
Isn't this a hotel?

270
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,253
Oh. Y‐‐ Yes,
but we're not open yet.

271
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,214
Ah. Um, my apologies.

272
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,925
Allison Carter,
"The Sulphur Springs Siren."

273
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,260
Nice to meet you.

274
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,596
You're the new owners
of The Tremont, correct?

275
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,141
Word is the springs
have come back to life.

276
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,684
Very exciting.

277
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,269
We think so.

278
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,604
Those springs have
a long history in this town.

279
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,814
Practically legend.

280
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,317
Everyone's clamoring
to know...

281
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,321
When are you planning
on reopening to the public?

282
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,534
I, uh, well, we‐‐
we have some work left
to do here still, so...

283
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,953
Uh, Allison, I would love
to set up a time

284
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,831
for a more formal interview
at some point.

285
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,791
Uh, we can answer
all of your questions,

286
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,461
even give you a tour
of the hotel when it's ready.

287
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,297
And how soon
would that be, exactly?

288
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,300
I've heard from
a few contractors in town

289
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,136
there might be some issues.

290
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,431
Uh, just a couple hiccups,
like with any renovation,

291
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,808
but we plan
on opening real soon.

292
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,978
Shouldn't be having
any more surprises.

293
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,691
Dad?

294
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,199
Okay, let's try this again.

295
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,287
(distortion)

296
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,247
(light flashing)

297
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,384
(chickens clucking)

298
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,931
(goat bleats)

299
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,120
Judge, what brings you by?

300
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,249
I was hoping I could
talk you into reconsidering
my offer, Elijah.

301
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,001
I know the amount of work
Grace put into this place.

302
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,879
Since she passed,
rest her soul,

303
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,050
you can't deny
things have been... slipping.

304
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,178
All farms go through
a little struggle
from time to time.

305
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,639
No, this is more
than a little struggle,
and you know it.

306
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,184
But I have the resources
to give this land
the care it deserves.

307
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,061
So you're really
doing it, then?

308
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,230
‐You're selling the farm?
‐But you can't!

309
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,231
Elijah:
No need to holler.

310
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,774
No one's selling anything
right this second.

311
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,571
You gotta understand,
this farm is theirs
as much as mine.

312
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,490
I want this place
to always be here for 'em.

313
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,950
For their children too.

314
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,160
I understand.

315
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,163
What if I buy half the property?
The farm and the springs.

316
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,831
You keep the house.

317
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,293
You and your family
can stay on the land,
on my word.

318
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,961
I need time to think.

319
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,421
Not too much, I hope.

320
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,924
You know how quickly
things can go wrong on a farm.

321
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,967
One bad season.

322
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,677
Heck, one bad accident,

323
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,096
and all you'll leave
your children with
is a mountain of debt.

324
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,348
Hope to hear your answer soon.

325
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,775
We can't sell the land,
even if we get
to keep the house.

326
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,278
It's not right.
What would Mother say?

327
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,530
Wish I knew.

328
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,825
Sam, do you trust that man?

329
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,287
Sometimes, I don't know
who to trust.

330
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,502
(sander whirring)

331
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,258
You get settled in
okay upstairs?

332
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,470
Uh, yes, thank you.

333
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:13,098
I'm sorry I interrupted
your meeting with that reporter.

334
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,183
Hopefully, she'll come back

335
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,227
when we're actually ready
for the publicity.

336
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:19,188
She will. It's impressive,
what you're doing here.

337
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,192
I didn't expect
to hear that,

338
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,486
considering how you felt
on your last visit.

339
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,071
I know.

340
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,698
I'm sorry for
what I said then, Bennett.

341
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,077
And since you told me
what really happened
to Savannah,

342
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,662
I, um...

343
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,082
Well, I've been
reevaluating some things.

344
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,585
And I don't think
I've always been the father

345
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,920
that you've needed me to be.

346
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:48,259
And I'd like to
make up for my last visit.

347
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,678
But more than that,

348
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,846
I want to help you
bring this place
back to life.

349
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,764
I...

350
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,685
I‐‐ I don't know
what to say.

351
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,645
Say you'll accept my help.

352
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,565
The springs coming back,
that changes things.

353
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,151
And with the right
amount of attention,

354
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,445
this... this place
could actually be

355
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,905
a real investment opportunity.

356
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,448
Ah!

357
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,201
Shoulda guessed.

358
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,579
I appreciate the offer,
Dad, but‐‐

359
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,916
Sarah:
It's definitely something
for us to discuss.

360
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,251
What's to discuss?

361
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,377
With just a few phone calls,

362
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,628
I'll have a dozen workers over.

363
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:25,796
(sander powers up)

364
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,800
Sarah:
Are‐‐ Are you okay?

365
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,262
Ben: Huh! Must've been
an electrical surge
or something.

366
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,888
Dad, you're sure
you're all right?

367
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,349
‐That was no electrical surge.
‐No way!

368
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,602
I think
our ghost is getting
really ticked off.

369
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,607
You wanted to see me
after school, ma'am?

370
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,734
Harper, yes.
Thank you for coming.

371
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,652
Have a seat.

372
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,451
Anything you would like
to share with me?

373
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:56,452
What?

374
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,581
You got every single question
on the quiz wrong,

375
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,791
the ones you bothered
to fill in, that is.

376
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,627
It's not like you
at all!

377
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,922
Uh, I know it's not.
Am I in trouble?

378
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,758
Mrs. Roth:
You're not here
for punishment, Harper.

379
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,384
You're here
because I'm concerned.

380
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,179
Are you...
having trouble with school?

381
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,639
Or at home?

382
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,142
If you tell me,
I might be able to help.

383
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,520
You could help me?

384
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,230
Really?

385
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,983
‐Mrs. Roth: Of course.
‐Harper: Okay.

386
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,945
The truth is,
I'm not who you think I am.

387
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,956
(tsks)

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,293
Sam, there you are.

389
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,461
I've been looking
all over for you.

390
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,380
Look, I don't have time
for more nonsense.

391
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,464
You have
plenty of time.

392
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,924
You have
a whole time machine.

393
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,300
Oh, and I need you
to finish building it,

394
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,259
like, right now.

395
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,427
My friend's trapped
in 1930,

396
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,470
and she needs my help.

397
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,596
Okay. Okay.

398
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,266
You've quite the imagination.
I give you that, but‐‐

399
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,602
No! You have to listen!

400
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,312
I've been trying to think

401
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,398
how I can prove to you
I've traveled through time,

402
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,608
but all I have is this.

403
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,994
"Guys, help.
I'm stuck in 1930
and the hatch is gone.

404
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,538
"I'm trying my best
pretending to be...

405
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,624
Daisy."

406
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,460
Daisy's my sister's name.

407
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,671
Yeah, Harper,

408
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,173
my friend,
looks just like her.

409
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,842
She's related to you,
actually.

410
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,719
So you should care
about saving her too.

411
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,223
Pretending to be Daisy.

412
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,184
I know, um,
it‐‐ it's confusing, but‐‐

413
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,060
No, no. This...

414
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,021
This might actually answer
some questions.

415
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,527
Questions I've had
for a very long, long time.

416
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,240
(chickens clucking)

417
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,369
Grace?

418
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,748
I could really use
another message.

419
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,667
I think I know
why you sent me here now.

420
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,961
Does it have something to do
with what I saw in my visions

421
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,671
or maybe that judge guy?

422
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,049
(knocking)
Are you there?

423
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,843
Or am I literally just
talking to myself?

424
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,846
(sighs)

425
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,434
(shimmering)

426
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,855
What're you doing
in here?

427
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,817
Sam, you scared me.
I'm just‐‐

428
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,487
I'm, uh...

429
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,782
Coming up
with another lie?

430
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,951
You've been acting
so strange lately,

431
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,120
not knowing things
you're supposed to,

432
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,371
saying funny words,

433
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,374
and now barely caring
that Papa might sell the farm.

434
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,542
Sam...

435
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,628
And I saw you digging
in the clearing last night.

436
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,088
I don't know
what you were up to,

437
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,673
but I do know
one thing for sure.

438
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,927
You're not my sister.

439
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,014
So who are you
and where did you come from?

440
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,939
(water running)

441
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,632
(mysterious music playing)

442
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,307
Zoey:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

443
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,560
We both used your machine.
Daisy too.

444
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,228
I think I have an idea
to get it up and running.

445
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,354
It's some kind of weird rock.

446
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,814
Why don't you guys
do some research?

447
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,232
Wyatt:
Oh, no! We broke it.

448
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,693
Let's work together.
Save your sweet mother's farm.

449
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,028
Everything you just said
is right here.

450
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,406
What do you mean?
You're not who I think you are?

451
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,991
Bennet, Sr.:
Once this hotel is done,

452
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,868
everyone in town will forget
all about that ghost business.

453
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,369
‐(bulbs bursting)
‐Oh!

454
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,829
Topher told you
he was sleepwalking?

455
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,122
He's gotta be
hiding something.

456
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,164
Hello?

457
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,207
(screams)
