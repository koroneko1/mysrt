00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.190
let's continue on chapter 3.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.590
As for chapter 2,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.230
there are still people who hasn't hand in their homework.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.230
That person is Wipapron. Please hand it in.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.110
"I'm sorry"

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.390
Are you still mad at Boss?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.510
Yes.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.030
I don't like liar.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.030
Looking pass the fact the he lied to you.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.030
From what you've told me,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.470
I think he loves you a lot.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.510
But if he loves me,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.310
why did he lie to me?

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.470
But sometimes... because he really loves you,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.150
he has to lie to you.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.470
No.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.590
I don't get it.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.510
5 days later.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.470
It's been 5 days,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.270
and you're still mad?

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.910
I'm a guy of my world.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.070
You're so stubborn.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.390
I'll go get some food now.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.190
Boss Bosso is live now [Live] To Tono.. From Boss

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.590
Hi.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.030
I'm Boss. Methapat Dulyanurak.

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:20.710
This is the real me.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.030
Everyone must be very disappoint that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.510
I'm not who you are expected.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.110
Once, I decided to meet my boyfriend for the first time.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.910
We met in Pattaya.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.710
After we met,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830
he didn't even look into my eyes.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.070
What happened that day,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.710
made me lost confidence about how I look.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.030
I had to lie to Tono,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.270
because I was afraid.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.830
I was afraid of losing him.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.470
Everything that I did,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.990
I really like Tono

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.550
I really miss him.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.190
And I really love him.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.710
Hello.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.710
I... watched your live.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.070
Hm.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.550
I'm really sorry.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.710
I think, I don't look good enough...

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.790
to talk to you.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.950
Please don't think for me.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.030
Have I ever say that to you?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.110
It's not wrong,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.990
for you to look down on yourself.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.510
But...

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.110
please don't underrate my love for you.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.190
I'm not like your ex, 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.910
who would judge you from the outside.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.110
So...

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.430
do you still love me?

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.950
I can't answer that right now.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.590
But...

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.870
you have to follow my 3 rules first.

00:06:36.702 --> 00:06:38.030
First rule,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.070
Do not lie. Tell me everything.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.750
Because I don't like liar.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.430
Second,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.910
If you feel insecure by the pimples,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.910
go for a treatment.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.750
Third,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.630
Come to see me in person,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.190
right now.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.870
Then I can give you an answer, whether

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.350
I still love you.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.070
What's wrong, you crybaby?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.990
Are you coming?

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.390
Sure.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.590
So...

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.990
where should we go?

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.550
Hm.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.190
How about Pho restaurant?

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.350
At Prachachuen 54.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.310
It's near my place.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.110
Sure, so...

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.830

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.950
Yes... come quickly.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.510
I've seen you for so long. I miss you.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.470
Thank you all the love in my life.. that started this work.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.710
I believe that love is a beautiful thing and it is the light of life.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.830
Please listen and stay with each other.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.310
Support each other through everything.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.950
Just like Boss and Tono :)

00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:29.640
Felt it when I heard you call my name

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.950
Where I belong

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.270
How life’s gonna change

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.990
Mornings waking up I wonder why

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.150
The lost and unknown

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.350
Makes me feel so alive

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.350
Sometimes we feel alone

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.630
Never know where

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.424
Which path we are going

00:09:56.424 --> 00:09:59.990
Just knowing every step you’re here with me

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.670
With you by my side

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.310
I can do anything

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.830
Just know that every moment ahead

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.670
I just want to thank you

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.630
For being part of my life

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.670
Here through all the good times

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.230
Through the tears that I've cried

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.195
I want to thank you

00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:26.270
For being here by my side

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.950
You see the better side of me

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.910
Give me strength to be fine

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.630
Cause

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.918
 		You know when It’s so lonely

00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:37.230
Moments when your free falling

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.390
You find that light deep inside

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.494
Just want to thank you

00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:47.150
