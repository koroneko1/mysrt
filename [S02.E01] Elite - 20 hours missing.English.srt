1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
He disappeared last night.

2
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,399
He is 17 years of age.

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,119
20 HOURS MISSING

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,039
He was wearing his Las Encinas uniform
when he disappeared.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,119
Maroon pants.

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
White shirt, gray or blue blazer
with a red trim on the lapel.

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
You know these first few hours
are really important.

8
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
So let's get back to work, team.

9
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,519
THREE MONTHS EARLIER

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,599
Did you get my present?

11
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,359
What is it?

12
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,480
Some cheese.

13
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,519
It's meant to be the shit.

14
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,439
Or at least expensive shit.

15
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,439
You can stick it up your ass, Christian.

16
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,199
Did you have fun on your holidays
with the marchioness?

17
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,439
I'm sorry, Nano.

18
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,360
-I should have come sooner.
-You know what?

19
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,280
Marina had that watch on her.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
However, when I arrived,

21
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,439
it was gone.

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
Maybe your girlfriend
had something to do with it.

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Maybe she even did it.

24
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,080
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,080
But of course...

26
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,879
as long as your holidays,

27
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,599
seafood and watches are paid for...

28
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,759
-none of that matters to you, does it?
-No.

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,719
It does matter.

30
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,759
-It was a shitty holiday.
-Sure.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm going to the pool.

32
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,360
Call me when we have to leave.

33
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
Hi, darling!

34
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,159
I'm here
to show the girl around the house.

35
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
What?

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,920
What do you say?

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,399
It looked uglier in the photo.

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,759
Don't start, huh?

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,920
The painting needs to be done,
some decoration needs to be done, too...

40
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,439
You'll see how good it looks.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
It's going to be awesome here.

42
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,920
Yes! Yes!

43
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,399
Here we go again.

44
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,600
It's 8:00 a.m., Valerio.

45
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day. Want some?

46
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,439
No, I don't eat breakfast.

47
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,759
Ander!

48
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,040
Hi, gorgeous!

49
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Did you want me to give up
on the first day of school?

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm on fire now.

51
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,040
I see. I thought boarding school
had changed you.

52
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,040
It doesn't seem that way.
It's made you even more ridiculous.

53
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,959
Thanks for that.

54
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,959
If I were you,
I would try and pass this year.

55
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Otherwise, Mom and Dad will cut you off.
And you weren't born to be poor.

56
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm not worried.
Whatever happens, I'll always have you.

57
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm being serious. Thank you...

58
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,839
You're the only one that still bothers
to have a go at me. Yay!

59
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
It's my penance as your sister.

60
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,040
Half-sister, gorgeous.

61
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,319
Hi, baby!

62
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,399
We could go to your house after class.

63
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
...if you don't get distracted.

64
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,199
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

65
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,000
WE LOVE YOU, MARINA

66
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,720
WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU

67
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,360
They could have thrown
all this trash away.

68
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,759
What happened to the watch?

69
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
What's wrong, don't you like it?

70
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,639
We can go and exchange it.

71
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,399
How are you?

72
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,480
How was Croatia? Did Christian like it?

73
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,000
Polo, we need to talk.

74
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,799
What's wrong?

75
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,679
I think Christian went to see Nano and--

76
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,039
I'm going to see the others.
We'll talk later.

77
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,960
By the way...
I'm really glad to see you this happy.

78
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,919
For real.

79
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,240
How are you? Long time no see.

80
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
-Hey.
-How are you doing?

81
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,120
-You didn't post a single photo.
-There's barely any signal

82
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,039
at his grandparents' house in Asturias.

83
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
A cow is a cow, regardless
of how many filters you put on it.

84
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,679
But it was very relaxing.
Like a chill out...

85
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,399
What are you doing here?

86
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,879
I have just as much right as you
to be here.

87
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,159
-Don't!
-Stop!

88
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,240
Azucena!

89
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,399
Get the fuck out of it!

90
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
-Don't!
-Stop, stop!

91
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,720
Stop now!

92
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,159
-Stop!
-Guzmán! Get off of him!

93
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,399
-Stop!
-Guzmán, that's enough!

94
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,919
The wound that Marina's death
has left in all of us

95
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
will take a long time to heal.

96
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I need your help to achieve it.

97
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,759
From all of you.

98
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,559
Guzmán,

99
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,799
I can't even begin to imagine
what you are going through.

100
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,000
No, you can't.

101
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,679
And now imagine

102
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,879
that you had to bump into
the one to blame for all that pain

103
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,879
in the halls all the time.

104
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,360
Samuel isn't the one to blame.

105
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
If Samuel hadn't come to this school...

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,799
If him and his fucking brother had stayed

107
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,440
in their shitty little village,
none of this would ever have happened.

108
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,240
-Your father got him the scholarship.
-You're the one that renewed it. Why?

109
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
He's a good student. It wouldn't be fair.

110
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,840
Fair?

111
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
Marina is dead.

112
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,279
My sister...

113
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
is dead at 16 years old.

114
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
Is that fair?

115
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not going to argue with you.

116
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,559
From now on, just so you know, if you talk
to that vermin, you are dead to me!

117
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,759
If you're with him, you're against me.

118
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,879
This is not about taking sides.

119
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes, it is.

120
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,200
And you have already chosen yours.

121
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,919
Please, one question.

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,960
Valerio...

123
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,919
-Is it important?
-Sure.

124
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,759
Isn't there supposed to be a welcome party
or something here?

125
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,320
Do you think
we're in the mood for partying?

126
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,519
Haven't you seen those faces?

127
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,720
It's precisely after something
as awful as this that these people need...

128
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,159
to have fun.

129
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,480
To have fun, dance, drink...

130
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,879
Why didn't he go back with his mother?

131
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,879
Because she doesn't know
what to do with him.

132
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,879
She packs him off to our Dad,
until a few months have gone by,

133
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,720
and he gets fed up and sends him back.
It's been this way for years.

134
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,519
It must be tough.

135
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,080
When your parents are divorced
and they send you back and forth

136
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,000
over the Atlantic like a tennis ball.

137
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,679
Yeah, sure. It's the first day of term
and the guy already wants to party.

138
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,399
I'm going.

139
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,720
Someone has to make sure that
when he passes out in a drunken coma,

140
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,600
he at least has a cushion to fall onto,

141
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,159
and his wallet in his pocket
the next morning.

142
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,879
Now you're the big sister?

143
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,120
With Valerio? She always has been.

144
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,720
Remember how jealous I used to get
about all the time they spent together?

145
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,799
What for? He's hopeless.

146
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,960
Look at him...

147
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,480
-Everyone to the track.
-Better put your phone away.

148
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,559
If you get caught using it,
they'll confiscate it.

149
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,039
Are you a scholarship student?

150
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,480
See this? Pure gold, kid.

151
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,840
You must be rich,
but you aren't like all the rest.

152
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,799
And proud of it.
You got a problem with that?

153
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,120
It was a compliment.

154
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,519
Everyone get in!

155
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,399
Rebeka.

156
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,679
With a "k".

157
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,120
-But my friends call me Rebe.
-Samuel.

158
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,399
Get into groups of five
with both boys and girls.

159
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
We're going to start with dynamics.

160
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,440
Hey, girl, come here!

161
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,879
Hey, girl. I'm Rebe.

162
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,799
Don't worry. I get on fine with Muslims.

163
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,320
In my neighborhood, I've screwed them all.

164
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,519
Let's warm up! Take your time.

165
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,320
We need two more over here.

166
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,879
You two, get over there.

167
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,840
Second group, get ready.

168
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,240
Hey, Samu. Greetings from your brother.

169
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,759
Was it too much trouble
for you to go see him?

170
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,279
I was too busy working all summer, trying
to save the money for his fucking bail.

171
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,279
And what about you?

172
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,799
Cruise with your girlfriend
on your private yacht, was it?

173
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,039
One...

174
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
two...

175
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,039
three...

176
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,879
He will blab everything.

177
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,240
He has barely spoken for a month.

178
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,279
As though he was afraid

179
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,759
that if one word slipped out of his mouth,
the whole truth would follow it.

180
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,159
And then what?

181
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
What?

182
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,000
That's fucking intense.

183
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Do you need another holiday?

184
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,080
Relax. He knows what's good for him.

185
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,799
Are you going out tonight?

186
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,279
-Polo, are you all right?
-Me?

187
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,679
Better than ever!

188
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,919
Why did you snitch?

189
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,279
I thought you were my friend.

190
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,320
So did I,

191
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,919
but you got a girlfriend
and you stopped answering my messages.

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,039
Got a girlfriend?

193
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,080
Lu has been by my side all summer.

194
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Do you know why I'm with her?

195
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,120
Because she always supports me.

196
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,919
Unconditionally.

197
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
That is not love.

198
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,879
It's devotion,

199
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
like you would have to a God.

200
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,200
The people that love you
will tell you the truth.

201
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,639
And the truth is, Marina's death won't
justify you acting wild for much longer.

202
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,759
Do you know
that you're at this school thanks to me?

203
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,440
I made a pact with your father.

204
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,799
I would stop talking to you
and he would let you stay.

205
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,360
That's why I didn't answer your messages.

206
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You're welcome.

207
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,159
I had a hard time convincing him
to let me come back.

208
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,159
I'm not a princess
who needs to be rescued,

209
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
and you're not a prince either.

210
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,879
I don't need you.

211
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,840
You want a picture or what?

212
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
I'd go back to my neighborhood right now.

213
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,159
Why did you leave?

214
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
We won the lottery.

215
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,440
Shit...

216
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
What a bummer.

217
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,159
Are you going to that club?

218
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,399
I don't think I'd be very welcome.

219
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,480
Are you going to let them decide for you?

220
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm going.

221
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,079
You're actually going to a club
of your own accord and free will?

222
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,920
Why not?

223
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm up for it.

224
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,680
Fuck those posh twats, right?

225
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Omar.

226
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,799
Where are you going?

227
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,279
Won't you help me with these boxes?

228
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,200
I've arranged to meet Samuel
for a quick coffee.

229
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,519
Only 15 minutes, please.

230
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:43,960
Where's Nadia?

231
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,480
She went to study at a friend's house.
Some girl called Rebeka.

232
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,200
Go.

233
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
The club is fucking sweet.

234
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,799
And we're going to have a VIP area
reserved for us.

235
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,599
What's wrong, don't you want to be a VIP?

236
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,119
Ten minutes a day every afternoon...
It's not enough, Omar.

237
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,359
I know.

238
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,160
Everybody knows each other here.

239
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
Everybody knows your father.

240
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,359
When the fuck
are you going to talk to him?

241
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
I already talked to mine.

242
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,079
Are you going to compare our families?

243
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,200
No, your father is a dictator.

244
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,160
That's why you have to stand up to him.

245
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,680
How are you going to tell him
that you like guys

246
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,839
or to let you out of the house

247
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,759
if you don't even dare ask him
if you can go out tonight?

248
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,400
But why are you so insistent
that I go out tonight?

249
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,240
Because I want to kiss you in a club
in front of people, like everyone else.

250
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,119
I want to stop looking over my shoulder
every time I go near you.

251
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,680
I want to feel free around you,
for fuck's sake.

252
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,200
This whole forbidden love thing was fun
for a while, but I'm tired of it.

253
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,119
What time?

254
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,119
Dad?

255
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,000
Dad?

256
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,119
Dad! Dad!

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Dad!

258
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,920
BARCELÓ THEATRE

259
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,880
Nadia.

260
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,359
How is it going?

261
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,240
-Have you been waiting for long?
-Twenty minutes and we're not moving.

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,559
Check out the outfit.
Do you know that you look like a pharaoh?

263
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,799
Let's go.

264
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,480
Enjoy the queue, guys.

265
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,680
Good night, gentleman.

266
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,720
We're on the list of...

267
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,559
What was his name?

268
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Valerio.

269
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,400
Come on, let's get a drink now!

270
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,039
What are you doing here?

271
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,640
Let's get you out.

272
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
Relax.

273
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,920
Let's talk about this like adults.

274
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
Or at least over a drink. Follow me.

275
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,839
You can see the bar is huge.
You can order whatever you want.

276
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,839
They know who I am.

277
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Let him order downstairs,
where I can't see him!

278
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,839
-Guzmán!
-Do you think I want to look at your face?

279
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,720
-What was that? I must have misheard you.
-So let's see if you hear this right.

280
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm not to blame for Marina's death!
Because my brother did not kill her.

281
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,640
Really? So who did?

282
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,319
Dazzle us with your foresight.
Who killed her?

283
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't fucking know! I'm not a detective,
but at least I'm trying to find out!

284
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,079
And do you know who is a detective?

285
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,440
The one that put your brother in prison,
where he'll rot for the rest of his life.

286
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,480
I hope they crack his head open,
so he knows what it feels like.

287
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,839
-Guzmán!
-That's enough.

288
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,079
Fucking hell, Ander!

289
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,319
Valerio, could you please
take care of this?

290
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,960
-Leave him alone. He's a good kid.
-Sure! He's your boyfriend's little pal.

291
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,680
How brave you've become.

292
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,759
You're taking his side, right?

293
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,519
Guzmán, you're my best friend.
Here's a word of advice:

294
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,680
stop forcing people to take sides.
You'll end up finding yourself alone.

295
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,680
23 HOURS MISSING

296
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,039
Inspector.

297
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,960
Excuse me.

298
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,480
Why are we looking here?

299
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,960
We know that he left
the party around 10:00,

300
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,319
he took this road,
and that was the last time he was seen.

301
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,240
Inspector! This way!

302
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,119
We found something!

303
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,079
-I don't like seeing you like this.
-Well...

304
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,720
Let's see if you can pull a few strings
and make me smile.

305
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,519
That's why you want me
by your side, right?

306
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
So you can play me like a puppet.

307
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,559
Christian, I'm not with you
because of what happened.

308
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,839
Before that day, I had already kissed you,

309
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,319
fucked you

310
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,559
and laughed at all your bad jokes.

311
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,799
I already really liked you.

312
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,200
Why can't we go back
to the way we were before?

313
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,799
Because Nano wasn't in prison
because of me before.

314
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,160
They have no evidence against him.

315
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,319
He will most likely be released.

316
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,799
Bullshit.

317
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,920
Prison is full of people like Nano.

318
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,720
His only crime is not having the dough
to hire a hotshot lawyer.

319
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,839
So what about you?

320
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,480
Do you want to end up like him?

321
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,119
Because if you admit that you lied,
you will be an accomplice to murder.

322
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,279
You know that, right?

323
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,200
Why throw it all away?

324
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,720
You have such a great future ahead of you.

325
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,000
He was thinking
of telling you himself, but...

326
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,640
My father has got you a place

327
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,319
at one of the best universities
in the United States,

328
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,880
in New York.

329
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,640
You won't need to worry about your grades.

330
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,559
It's the chance of a lifetime.

331
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,920
Life is a real bitch...

332
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,680
if I have to betray my brother
in order to achieve that.

333
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,559
That's not life, it's nothing.

334
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,839
I ignored the fact that you had him
as your boy toy for the summer...

335
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,400
But how long is this joke about dating
that Neanderthal going to last?

336
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,720
It's over.

337
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
MOM

338
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,359
That ain't your color.

339
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,160
I've got one that could look
totally Gucci on you. Here.

340
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,480
Relax. Not the one I'm wearing.
Not everyone can pull this off.

341
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,359
I guess it will sound ridiculous to you,

342
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
but I feel
as though I'm doing something I shouldn't.

343
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,319
I know.

344
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,920
Doesn't it feel good?

345
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:12,880
What?

346
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm not paying an arm and a leg
for a rum and coke.

347
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,839
I might be rich, but I'm not an idiot.

348
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,720
They don't give it a rest.

349
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,039
And it's never to your face,
always behind your back.

350
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,079
If it was behind my back, I'd be happy.

351
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,319
When are you going to answer him
with a good slap?

352
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,680
What should I do,
sign up for tae kwon do classes?

353
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,480
I'd need to win the lottery, too.

354
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,079
I will teach you how to box.

355
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,200
Boxing? You?

356
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,319
What does he think?

357
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,960
-Come here, you smartass.
-What are you doing?

358
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,359
What you mean "what am I doing"?
I'm going to teach you.

359
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,960
-I even have a punching bag for training.
-Where?

360
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,559
In the basement at home.

361
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,079
I'll think about it.

362
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,680
Sure...

363
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,599
My house is haunted, right?

364
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Dad, I don't know what to do.
I think he's going to blab.

365
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,880
Don't worry, darling,
enjoy your night out.

366
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,279
The VIP area is here.

367
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,799
I don't need that shit.

368
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,880
Are you sure?

369
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,880
I think you're the one
that needs it the most.

370
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,240
What do you know?

371
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,960
Look, Guzmán.

372
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,960
The way I see it,
you have two options tonight.

373
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,920
You can be you...

374
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,640
or you can be happy.

375
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,319
Listen, I'd screw that guy
after four beers.

376
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,319
That one, after two.

377
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,960
That one... Wow, I’d do him
after an alcohol-free beer.

378
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,720
I would even after a Diet Coke.

379
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,799
What about you?

380
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,079
I don't drink.
I wouldn't know how to play.

381
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,279
It's your loss.

382
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,720
What's in it?

383
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,119
-A bottle of whiskey!
-On the rocks!

384
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,920
Sorry! I'm really sorry.

385
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, my!

386
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,599
Maybe it's a sign from above.

387
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,519
Well, he doesn't exactly look like
an angel sent from Heaven, if you ask me.

388
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,880
Tonight, I'll be anything you want.

389
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,880
An angel...

390
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,960
A demon... Anything you want.

391
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,519
-Wow, he's talking to me and everything.
-Why wouldn't I?

392
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,880
For the same reason as your friends.

393
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,519
Because of where I'm from,
the way I look...

394
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,119
I don't care about where you're from,
how you dress or whatever...

395
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm not that superficial.
Who do you think I am?

396
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,279
The only thing that matters
to me is how hot you are.

397
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,039
Hi! We haven't been introduced.

398
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,519
I'm Lu, Valerio's sister.

399
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,839
Don't even listen. Half-sister.

400
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,559
Nadia, would you excuse us a moment?

401
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,799
Bye.

402
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
I need to talk to him for a second.
Let's go.

403
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,839
I'll see you later.

404
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,039
Yeah, go talk to him away from here.
Can't let him get contaminated.

405
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,359
Wait for me at the bar, brother.

406
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,279
Do you think you can fool me?

407
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,119
Excuse me?

408
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,880
I've met people like you before.

409
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,240
-Have you?
-Yes.

410
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,960
They come from nothing,
suddenly they make a fortune

411
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,240
and buy a mansion...

412
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,319
They show up at school in a car with
blacked-out windows and 24k gold earrings.

413
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Just like you.

414
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,519
Because their family earned their money
through some shady business.

415
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,200
Practically always drugs.

416
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,319
Is this all because we ended up
with your boyfriend's house?

417
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,559
Maybe if they hadn't got
into "shady business,"

418
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
they wouldn't have had to sell it.

419
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,920
Look, I'm not going
to give you any advice, gorgeous...

420
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,079
Don't go near my brother.

421
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,119
Of course... You people are against drugs.

422
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,599
So when you go to the toilet in threes,
it's a social gathering, right?

423
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,119
Of course.

424
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,480
We're the hypocrites,
that's what we are really good at.

425
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,000
Because you're proud of your family.
That's why you go around saying

426
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,079
that you won the lottery.

427
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,359
That's just classic.

428
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Welcome.

429
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,319
How are you feeling?

430
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,440
Fine.

431
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,599
My parents are getting a divorce.
I think it's my fault.

432
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,400
What?

433
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,599
Forget it.
I'm really glad to see you like this.

434
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,720
Fuck, yeah! The three of us all together!

435
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,359
Where are you going?

436
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,680
To do what I should have done
three months ago.

437
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,160
And what about me?
You don't care about me anymore?

438
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,160
You?

439
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,000
Get back with him.

440
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,519
You two are made for each other.

441
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,680
You're not coming, are you?
Fine, I'll find somebody else to kiss.

442
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,279
What did you give Guzmán?

443
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,319
Happiness.

444
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
You want some?

445
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,319
All you do is give me a headache, Valerio.

446
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,359
Don't even think about
doing something like this again.

447
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,800
What happened to you?

448
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,440
We used to have such a good time.

449
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,880
Did you forget about it all?

450
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
Christian!

451
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,519
Christian.

452
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,320
He has had a severe stroke.

453
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
It will take time for him
to get back to normal.

454
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,719
Where were you?

455
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,679
Why was your phone off?

456
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,119
I was studying.

457
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,079
With a girl from school, wasn't it?

458
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,400
Who is this boy?

459
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,239
What were you doing?

460
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,039
No, I... Don't worry. I'm not into girls.

461
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,840
But who are you?

462
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,280
-I'm a friend of...
-Nadia's.

463
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,840
He's a friend of Nadia's.

464
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,880
From school.

465
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,800
What's that smell?

466
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,719
Mom, I haven't been drinking.

467
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,159
Yes, I did go to a club,

468
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,480
but somebody spilled their drink on me.

469
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,159
Why don't you stop lying once and for all?

470
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,400
Anyway, it's no big deal
if she did have a drink, right?

471
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,920
You'd think she was a terrorist?

472
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,559
Sorry.

473
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,840
I mean... I have Muslim friends.

474
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,199
Fuck, shit, sorry.

475
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,840
-I shouldn't say swear words either...
-You should go.

476
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,599
Please.

477
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,639
-Omar, I just wanted--
-Get out of here!

478
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,199
I can't!

479
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,519
Finally!

480
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,519
This feels good.

481
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,880
Look.

482
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,320
I lost a sock.

483
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,920
Who loses a sock that easily?

484
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,360
I left the house with two,
now I only have one.

485
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,400
How do you even go about losing a sock?

486
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,079
-Very easily.
-For real?

487
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:16,360
I can tell you a really good story.

488
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,000
-I know a girl who went out on her own.
-I wasn't on my own.

489
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,800
-I wasn't on my own.
-I'm the one telling this story.

490
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,320
She went out on her own

491
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,559
wearing a beautiful black lace bra.

492
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,679
Where did I put it?

493
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,159
When she got back home,
she wasn't wearing it anymore.

494
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,079
No, no. She wasn't wearing it
because you were wearing it!

495
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,039
-In fact...
-It looked fucking good on me!

496
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,559
You're crazy!

497
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,480
I missed this.

498
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,519
I missed you.

499
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:09,960
Really?

500
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,280
Always?

501
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,719
We said
that this would never happen again.

502
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I'm your sister, Valerio.

503
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,239
Half-sister.

504
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,920
Why don't you reply?

505
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,679
Let's go back to yesterday's subject.

506
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,360
Open your books to page 104, please.

507
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,679
Excuse me for a second.

508
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,920
Your classmate Christian...
had a motorbike accident last night.

509
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,519
What kind of accident?

510
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,239
It seems that he had been drinking
and he hit another vehicle.

511
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,519
The car fled from the scene.

512
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,960
Did they say how he's doing?

513
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,079
Only that he's in critical condition.

514
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,920
He's been in surgery all night.

515
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,239
What are you doing here?

516
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,840
My father has been admitted.

517
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,360
Luckily, it was just a scare.

518
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,280
Do you know anything? About Christian?

519
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,079
The doctor just came.

520
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,000
He's alive.

521
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,920
Which is a miracle, apparently,
given how badly he was hit.

522
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,440
So will he be all right?

523
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,800
I don't know, Samuel.

524
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,599
Doctors say it's not looking good.

525
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,239
What?

526
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,079
He definitely won't walk again.

527
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,760
I don't know anything about this, Polo.

528
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,239
It must have been an accident.

529
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,960
He was drunk.
Anyone could have run him over.

530
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Are you still there?

531
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,519
Anyone...

532
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,639
Polo.

533
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,800
What are you doing?

534
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,480
Are you all right?

535
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,440
Relax, man.

536
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,320
What's wrong?

537
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,519
Polo?

538
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,039
Polo, what the fuck? Polo!

539
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:54,960
Polo.

540
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,719
In the backpack.

541
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,159
-What's with the backpack?
-In the backpack.

542
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,320
What's in the backpack?

543
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
-My pills.
-Where?

544
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,360
Where are the fucking pills?

545
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,400
Why do you have these?

546
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,239
How long have you been taking them?

547
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,400
How many?

548
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,199
Dad! What are you doing here?

549
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,840
I've come to see Christian.

550
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,199
They told us that they won't tell us
anything new till tomorrow.

551
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,039
You must have spoken to the wrong person.

552
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,719
I'm going to have to talk to him alone.

553
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,559
I think I can help him.

554
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,440
His parents have agreed.

555
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,599
-You--
-Can we go in after?

556
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,000
It'll be a long conversation
and it's late.

557
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:47,519
-Why don't you guys go home to rest?
-I'm not tired.

558
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,000
Would you prefer
to be tired in class tomorrow?

559
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,960
I'm saying it for your own good.
And Christian's.

560
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,840
He and I have important things
to discuss that might help him.

561
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,320
Get some rest.

562
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm not moving from here
until I can see Christian.

563
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:05,639
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear enough, kid.

564
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:07,519
Come back tomorrow.

565
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,559
Listen, you must have
a lot of friends here,

566
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,239
but you don't own this hospital.

567
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Not yet.

568
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,199
You don't decide
who can stay and who can leave.

569
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,360
And I'm staying.

570
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,800
Did I make myself clear enough?

571
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,320
I'm staying, too.

572
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:27,559
All of us.

573
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,159
And so am I...

574
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,320
I suppose.

575
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,480
What are they talking about?

576
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,239
Switzerland?

577
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,079
One of the best hospitals in the world.

578
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:11,639
They will operate on him tomorrow,

579
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,760
and then he will undergo
a few months of intensive rehabilitation.

580
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,920
Who knows?

581
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,119
So, is there a chance
that he will be able to walk again?

582
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,320
There always is.

583
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,239
Where there's a will, there's a way.

584
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,760
And where there's money.

585
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,119
Because that place is super expensive.

586
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,039
How will you afford it?

587
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,199
I see...

588
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,119
I wish I had in-laws like that.

589
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,719
His parents are happy.

590
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,840
What about you?

591
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,400
How are you?

592
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,639
How do you think I am, Samu?

593
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,280
What the fuck do you want me to do?

594
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,719
What other option do I have?

595
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,880
Guys, it's very late.

596
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,800
And Christian has
an early flight tomorrow.

597
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,239
It's time to say goodbye.

598
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,559
As soon as he's feeling better,

599
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,039
we'll get you a couple of plane tickets
so you can visit him.

600
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Champion.

601
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,800
Look after Samu for me, okay?

602
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,039
Don't worry about me.

603
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,760
I will.

604
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,400
Miss Acapulco...

605
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,639
I know you were crazy about me
from the start.

606
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,559
I'll give it to you when I get back.

607
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,079
Sooner or later, you will fall.

608
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,360
Someone will bring you down.

609
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,880
I hope I'll be well enough by then
to dance on your fucking grave.

610
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:53,119
It was all very strange.

611
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,280
Christian knew something.

612
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,920
I think so, too.

613
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,519
They've bought his silence
with the clinic. I knew it!

614
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,960
It was all because of the marchioness and
that fucking watch with the red strap...

615
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:05,159
It was nothing to do with me.

616
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,679
Nothing!

617
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Do you believe me now?

618
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,480
I never thought it was you, Nano.

619
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,480
So why didn't you come and see me before?

620
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,719
Because Guzmán is right.

621
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,800
Even if you didn't hit Marina,

622
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,400
they killed her for that watch.
They killed her because of you.

623
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,719
Because you stole it.

624
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,519
You decided to blackmail those people.

625
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,480
You gave it to Marina.

626
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,519
That's why I will never forgive you.

627
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,079
And you'll let me rot in here
for 20 years, right?

628
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,280
No, I won't.

629
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,119
I'm going to do everything I can
to get you out of here.

630
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,280
And I'm not just talking
about paying bail.

631
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,039
I'm going to do everything in my hands...

632
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,159
to make those people pay
for what they have done.

633
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,360
I swear I will see it through to the end.

634
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,280
Whatever it costs.

635
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,159
Whoever falls.

636
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,360
Here!

637
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,199
Samuel!

638
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,000
-Samu!
-Samuel!

639
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,280
MISSING
SAMUEL GARCÍA DOMÍNGUEZ

640
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,280
Samuel!

641
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
Samu!

642
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
