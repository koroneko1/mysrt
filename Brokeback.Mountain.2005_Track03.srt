1
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,872
Shit.

2
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,809
You pair of deuces
lookin' for work...

3
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:31,248
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here pronto.

4
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,859
Up on Brokeback...

5
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,696
the Forest Service has got
designated campsites...

6
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,429
on the allotments.

7
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:54,496
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles
from where we pasture
the woollies.

8
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:58,032
Bad predator loss
if there's nobody
lookin' after 'em at night.

9
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,808
Now, what I want
is a camp tender...

10
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:06,181
to stay in
the main camp, where
the Forest Service says.

11
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,880
But the herder...

12
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,990
he's gonna pitch a pup tent
on the QT with the sheep...

13
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,116
and he's gonna sleep there.

14
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:15,957
You eat your supper
and breakfast in camp...

15
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,055
but you sleep
with the sheep 100%.

16
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,224
No fire, don't leave no sign.

17
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,459
You roll up that tent
every mornin'...

18
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:25,970
in case Forest Service
snoops around.

19
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,233
Yeah?

20
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,135
No.

21
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,503
No!

22
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,074
Not on your fuckin' life.

23
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:46,888
You got your dogs,
your .30-30, you sleep there.

24
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,554
Last summer I had
goddamn near 25% loss.
I don't want that again.

25
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,155
You.

26
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,430
Fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge...

27
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:00,236
with your grocery list
and mules...

28
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:04,003
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.

29
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,944
Tomorrow mornin' we'll
truck you up to the jump-off.

30
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,971
Jack Twist.
Ennis.

31
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:45,679
Your folks
just stop at Ennis?
Del Mar.

32
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,616
Well, nice to know you,
Ennis Del Mar.

33
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,939
My second year up here.

34
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,474
Last year, one storm,
the lightnin'
killed 42 sheep.

35
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,274
Thought I'd asphyxiate
from the smell.

36
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:23,086
Aguirre got all over my ass,
like I was supposed to
control the weather.

37
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:27,384
But beats workin' for
my old man. Can't please
my old man, no way.

38
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:32,756
That's why I took
to rodeoin'. You ever rodeo?

39
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:37,199
You know, I mean,
once in a while.

40
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,460
When I got the entry fee
in my pocket.

41
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:41,630
Yeah.

42
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,065
Are you from ranch people?

43
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,608
Yeah, I was.

44
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,246
Your folks run you off?

45
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,214
No, they run themselves off.
There was...

46
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,952
one curve in the road in
43 miles, and they miss it.

47
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,422
So the bank took the ranch...

48
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:06,587
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.

49
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,594
Shit, that's hard.

50
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,105
Can I? Thank you.

51
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:40,590
Don't let them stray.

52
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,598
Joe will have your ass
if you do.

53
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,294
Only thing,
don't never order soup.

54
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,202
Them soup boxes
are hard to pack.

55
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,605
Well, I don't eat soup.

56
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,576
You wanna watch it there.
That horse has
a low startle point.

57
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,812
Doubt there's a filly
that could throw me.

58
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,149
Let's git,
unless you wanna sit around
tyin' knots all day.

59
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,409
Oh, shit.

60
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,481
Can't wait till I get
my own spread...

61
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:56,818
and I won't have
to put up with
Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

62
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,621
I'm savin' for
a place myself.

63
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:06,028
Alma and me, we're gonna
get married when I come
down off this mountain.

64
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,296
Shit,
that stay with the sheep,
no fire bullshit.

65
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,605
Aguirre got no right
makin' us do somethin'
against the rules.

66
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,446
No more beans.

67
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,720
Damn. Shit!

68
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:47,724
I don't know.
Something wrong?

69
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,227
Yeah, so what...

70
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,929
Why didn't we get
the powdered milk
and the spuds?

71
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,494
That's all we got.

72
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,334
Well...

73
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:58,870
Here's next week's.

74
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,837
Thought you didn't eat soup.
Yeah, well,
I'm sick of beans.

75
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,817
Too early in the summer
to be sick of beans.

76
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,816
Come on.

77
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:36,270
Come on. Come on.

78
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,286
Hold on. Whoa, whoa!

79
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:53,919
Shit.

80
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:57,023
Whoa. Come back here!

81
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,029
Whoa there, whoa.

82
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:38,937
All right. Fuck it.

83
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,310
Okay, you bastard.

84
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,082
Where the hell you been?

85
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,641
Been up with the sheep
all day, I get down here
hungry as hell...

86
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,654
and all I find is beans.

87
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,254
What in the hell happened,
Ennis?

88
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,928
I come on a bear
is what happened.

89
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,461
Goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off...

90
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,466
and scattered food
everywhere.

91
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:09,801
Beans is about
all we got left.
Got whiskey or somethin'?

92
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:16,801
Dumb-ass mule.

93
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:24,948
I can't believe that.
God damn.

94
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,147
Let me see.

95
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,222
Shit.

96
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:39,223
Well, we gotta do somethin'
about this food situation.

97
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:42,103
Maybe I'll shoot
one of the sheep.

98
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,839
Yeah, what if
Aguirre finds out, huh?

99
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,875
We're supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat 'em.

100
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:50,401
What's the matter with you?
There are a thousand of 'em.

101
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,412
I'll stick with beans.

102
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,208
Well, I won't.

103
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,124
Yeah!

104
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,828
Gettin' tired
of your dumb-ass missin'.

105
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,503
Let's get a move on.

106
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,540
Don't want the Game and Fish
to catch us with no elk.

107
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:46,527
Come on. Shit.

108
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,100
Yeah, I'm commutin'
four hours a day.

109
00:17:56,945 --> 00:18:00,039
I come in for breakfast,
I go back to the sheep.

110
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,542
Evenin',
get 'em bedded down.

111
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,381
Come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

112
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,481
Spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes.

113
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,919
Aguirre got no right
to make me do this.

114
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,028
You wanna switch?
I wouldn't mind
sleepin' out there.

115
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,933
That ain't the point.
The point is, we both
ought to be in this camp.

116
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,864
Goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.

117
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,972
I wouldn't mind
bein' out there.

118
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,644
Well, I'm happy
to switch with you...

119
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,309
but I warn you,
I can't cook worth a damn.

120
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,751
I am pretty good
with a can opener, though.

121
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,146
You can't be no worse
than me, then.

122
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,424
Here you go.

123
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,869
You won't get much sleep,
I'll tell you that.

124
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,668
Yup. Come on.

125
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,362
Shot a coyote up there.

126
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:26,994
It's a big son of a bitch.
He had balls on him
the size of apples.

127
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,835
He looked like
he could eat himself a camel.

128
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,636
You want
some of this hot water?

129
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,868
It's all yours.

130
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,331
Mmm.

131
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,042
I don't rodeo much myself.

132
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:22,981
I mean,
what's the point...

133
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,717
of ridin' some piece of stock
for eight seconds?

134
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,817
Money's a good point.
True enough.

135
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,992
If you don't get stomped
winnin' it, huh?

136
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,224
Yeah.

137
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,096
Well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.

138
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,170
Thank you.

139
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,136
Pretty well-known in his day.

140
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,138
Though he kept his secrets
to himself.

141
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,075
Never taught me a thing,
never once come
to see me ride.

142
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,325
Your brother and sister
do right by you?

143
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,402
They did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

144
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,104
Considerin' they didn't
leave us nothin'...

145
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,534
but $24 in a coffee can.

146
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,477
I got me
a year of high school.

147
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,445
That was before
the transmission went
on the pickup.

148
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,918
And then my sis left.
She married a roughneck,
moved to Casper.

149
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,788
And me and my brother...

150
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,387
we went and got ourselves
some work on a ranch
up near Worland.

151
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,399
Till I was 19.
Then he got married.

152
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:46,970
And no more room for me.

153
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,003
That's how come
me end up here.

154
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:05,280
What?

155
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:10,993
Man, that's more words
than you've spoke
in the past two weeks.

156
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:14,695
Hell, that's the most
I've spoke in a year.

157
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:23,003
But my dad,
he was a fine roper.

158
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,405
Didn't rodeo much, though.

159
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:28,070
He thought rodeo cowboys
was all fuck-ups.

160
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,642
The hell they are.

161
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:35,546
Well...

162
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,686
There you go.

163
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:48,261
I'm spurrin' his guts out!
Wavin' to the girls
in the stands!

164
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:51,893
He's kickin' me to
high heaven, but he don't
jackboard me! No!

165
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:58,097
I think my dad was right.

166
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,184
Tent don't look right.

167
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:48,721
Well, it ain't
goin' nowhere. Let it be.

168
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,128
That harmonica don't sound
quite right either.

169
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:56,632
That's 'cause
it got kind of flattened
when that mare threw me.

170
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,291
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

171
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:01,802
I thought you said
that mare couldn't throw you.

172
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:03,361
She got lucky.

173
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:08,334
Yeah, well, if I got lucky,
that harmonica
would've broke in two.

174
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:16,045
# I know I shall meet you
on that final day #

175
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:21,612
# Water-walking Jesus,
take me away! ##

176
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,919
Very good.
Oh, yeah.

177
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:29,222
My mama, she believes
in the Pentecost.

178
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:30,559
Oh, yeah?

179
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:34,702
What exactly
is the Pentecost?

180
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,534
I mean, my folks,
they was Methodist.

181
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:40,464
The Pentecost.

182
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:43,267
I don't know, I don't know
what the Pentecost is.

183
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:47,805
Mom never explained it to me.
I guess it's when
the world ends...

184
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:51,043
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.

185
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,812
Speak for yourself.

186
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:57,416
You may be a sinner,
but I ain't yet had
the opportunity.

187
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,359
Thank you.

188
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,132
Shit!

189
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,969
I'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.

190
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:11,528
Give 'em hell.

191
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,169
No, I'm...

192
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:24,842
You can hardly stand.
It's too late to go
to them sheep.

193
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:30,613
Well, you got
an extra blanket?

194
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:34,592
I'll just roll up out here,
grab 40 winks...

195
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:37,395
and I'll ride out
at first light.

196
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:44,131
You'll freeze your ass off
when that fire dies down.

197
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:45,502
Oh, that's good.

198
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:47,541
You're better off
sleepin' in the tent.

199
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:48,700
Yeah.

200
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:51,708
All right.

201
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:30,446
Ennis!
What?

202
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:33,814
Just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!

203
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:37,275
Come on, come on.

204
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:48,254
What are you doin'?

205
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,980
See you for supper.

206
00:29:58,388 --> 00:29:59,878
Yeah. Come on.

207
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,189
Come on.

208
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,912
This is a one-shot thing
we got goin' on here.

209
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,585
It's nobody's business
but ours.

210
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,190
You know I ain't queer.

211
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,625
Me, neither.

212
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:36,799
I'm sorry.

213
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,495
It's all right.

214
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,198
It's all right.

215
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,335
Lie back. Come on.

216
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:49,667
Twist.

217
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,073
Your Uncle Harold's in
the hospital with pneumonia.

218
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,443
Docs don't expect
he'll make it.

219
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:59,476
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so here I am.

220
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:03,883
Bad news.

221
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:08,386
There ain't nothin' I can do
about it up here, I guess.

222
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,021
There's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.

223
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,234
Not unless you can
cure pneumonia.

224
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:52,531
God damn! Jesus!

225
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:55,504
Them sheep will drift
if I don't get back
up there tonight!

226
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,565
You'll get
pitched off your mount
in a storm like this.

227
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:00,941
You'll wish
you hadn't tried it!

228
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:03,646
It's too cold! Close it up!

229
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:15,949
What are we
supposed to do now, huh?

230
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:20,326
Get on in there and
untangle 'em Chilean sheep
out of ours, I guess.

231
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,861
Oh, where is it? Shit!

232
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:31,269
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

233
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:36,475
We gotta try.
The least we can do is get
the count right for Aguirre.

234
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:39,345
Fuck Aguirre!
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

235
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:42,351
What if we need to
work for him again?
You think of that?

236
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,650
We gotta
stick this out, Jack.

237
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:04,031
You'll run them
sheep off again
if you don't quiet down.

238
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,239
What are you doing?

239
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,378
Aguirre came by again.

240
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:48,350
Says my uncle didn't die
after all.

241
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,747
Says bring 'em down.

242
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,914
Bring 'em down, why?
It's the middle of August.

243
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:57,354
Says there's a storm comin',
movin' in from the Pacific.

244
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:59,190
Worse than this one.

245
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:03,194
That snow barely
stuck an hour. Huh?

246
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:08,835
Besides, that son of a bitch,
he's cuttin' us out
a whole month's pay.

247
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,303
It ain't right.

248
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,736
Well...

249
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:16,703
I can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.

250
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:18,644
Give it to you
when we get to Signal.

251
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,705
I don't need your money, huh?

252
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,211
You know, I ain't in
the poorhouse. Shit!

253
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,286
All right.

254
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:02,414
Time to get goin', cowboy.

255
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,964
Come here!
This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

256
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,337
Oh, shit!

257
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,026
Ennis. Ennis.

258
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,768
Come here. You okay?

259
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,000
You okay?
Yeah.

260
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,693
Some of these never went
up there with you.

261
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,361
Count ain't what
I'd hoped for, neither.

262
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:59,568
You ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.

263
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:16,588
Wanna give it some gas?

264
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:28,624
I can't believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

265
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:31,828
Yeah.

266
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,733
You gonna do this again
next summer?

267
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,174
Well, maybe not.

268
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:42,347
Like I said, me and Alma is
gettin' married in November.

269
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,541
So...

270
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:47,113
I'll try to get somethin'
on a ranch, I guess.

271
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,448
And you?

272
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:55,357
Might go up to my daddy's
place and give him
a hand through the winter.

273
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:58,521
I might be back.

274
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:01,356
If the Army don't get me.

275
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:09,673
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

276
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:11,869
Right.

277
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:25,607
What the fuck
are you lookin' at? Huh?

278
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:35,851
<i>"And forgive us
our trespasses...</i>

279
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:38,691
<i>"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

280
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:42,199
"Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

281
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,600
"For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
forever. Amen."

282
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,936
Under the powers
vested in me...

283
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:52,601
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

284
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:56,911
You may kiss the bride.
And if you don't, I will.

285
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:17,200
You all right?
No.

286
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:22,363
Stop!

287
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:24,905
No, please don't!

288
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,509
My old lady's tryin' to
get me to quit this job.

289
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:37,384
She says I'm gettin' too old
to be breakin' my back
shovelin' asphalt.

290
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:41,151
I told her strong backs
and weak minds
runs in the family.

291
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:44,226
She didn't think
that was too funny.

292
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:46,387
I told her it keeps me fit.

293
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:51,665
<i>Mornin'.
Mornin'.</i>

294
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:56,969
<i>Pulled in last night.
Didn't want to wake you up.</i>

295
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:59,038
<i>Oh, no, I was just...</i>

296
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,108
<i>I thought I'd tell you
before the Sergeant
showed up.</i>

297
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:05,443
<i>Parking this trailer
on the beach is illegal.</i>

298
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,692
Yeah!

299
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,134
Well,
look what the wind blew in.

300
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,434
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

301
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:39,640
I was wonderin' if you was
needin' any help this summer.

302
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,945
You're wastin'
your time here.

303
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:45,212
What, you ain't got nothin'?

304
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:48,824
Nothin' up on Brokeback?

305
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:52,820
I ain't got no work for you.

306
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:04,167
Ennis Del Mar
ain't been around, has he?

307
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:10,903
You boys sure found a way
to make the time pass
up there.

308
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:14,375
Twist...

309
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:17,818
you guys wasn't gettin' paid
to leave the dogs
baby-sit the sheep...

310
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:19,979
while you stemmed the rose.

311
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:28,118
Now get the hell
out of my trailer.

312
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:15,737
How my girls doing?

313
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,911
All right. Jenny's still
got a runny nose.

314
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:45,831
Ennis, could you wipe
Alma Jr.'s nose?

315
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:48,536
If I had three hands,
I could.

316
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,878
Come here. Come here. Oh!

317
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,102
Girls all right?

318
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:24,941
Yeah.
Jenny stopped her coughin'.

319
00:48:26,747 --> 00:48:29,112
I think I should take
the girls into town
this weekend.

320
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:32,618
Get 'em an ice cream.
Somethin'.

321
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:38,721
Can't we move to town?

322
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,322
I'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.

323
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,490
No one's around
for Junior to play with.

324
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,461
Besides,
I'm scared for Jenny...

325
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:52,368
scared if she has another one
of 'em bad asthma spells.

326
00:48:52,438 --> 00:48:54,633
No, rent in town
is too high.

327
00:48:58,277 --> 00:49:01,735
There's a cheap place
in Riverton,
over the Laundromat.

328
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,749
I bet I could
fix it up real nice.

329
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,215
I bet you could fix
this place up real nice
if you wanted to.

330
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:09,686
Ennis.
Hmm?

331
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,056
I know you'd like it, too.

332
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:18,690
Real home, other kids
for the girls to play with.

333
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:24,392
Not so lonely
like you were raised.

334
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:28,603
You don't want 'em
to be so lonely, do you?

335
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,039
Yeah.

336
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:37,779
Come here.

337
00:49:43,555 --> 00:49:45,785
It ain't so lonely now,
is it?

338
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,660
Are you sure
the girls are asleep?
Yeah.

339
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:07,942
Come here.

340
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:21,085
Ennis.

341
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,756
<i>Let 'er rip and snort, boys!</i>

342
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,355
<i>Jack Twist,
hangin' on for dear life!</i>

343
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,534
<i>And down he goes!
Watch out there, fella!</i>

344
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:35,334
<i>He's comin' for you.
Send in the clowns!</i>

345
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:39,071
<i>Okay, a fine ride
by Mr. Twist.
Shit!</i>

346
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:40,668
<i>Four seconds for him.</i>

347
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,377
<i>Give 'em a hand, folks,
our very own rodeo clowns!</i>

348
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:50,343
Give us a beer, Doug.

349
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,101
I'd like to buy
Jimbo here a beer.

350
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:10,839
Best damn rodeo clown
I've ever worked with.

351
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:14,608
No thanks, cowboy.

352
00:51:14,678 --> 00:51:17,044
If I was to let
every rodeo hand
I pulled a bull off of...

353
00:51:17,114 --> 00:51:20,015
buy me liquor, I'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.

354
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:29,520
Pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job.

355
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,125
So save your money for
your next entry fee, cowboy.

356
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,470
You ever try calf ropin'?

357
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:58,116
Do I look like I can afford
a fuckin' ropin' horse?

358
00:52:14,203 --> 00:52:15,932
Shouldn't we move
a little closer?

359
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:19,736
No. Come on, let's don't.
Jenny'll get scared.

360
00:52:24,847 --> 00:52:26,610
Look at this crowd!

361
00:52:27,016 --> 00:52:30,452
Bound to be a lot of
pussy on the hoof
in a crowd like this.

362
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,454
All swelled up
with patriotic feeling...

363
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:34,285
and ready to be
humped like a frog.

364
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:36,825
So, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?

365
00:52:36,893 --> 00:52:38,554
Las Vegas or California?

366
00:52:38,628 --> 00:52:39,856
Hell, I don't know...

367
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,864
but if you make it
between Montana and Wyoming,
I'd take Wyoming...

368
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:46,766
Hey! You might
want to keep it down,
I got two little girls here.

369
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:49,805
Fuck you. Asshole.

370
00:52:50,273 --> 00:52:53,401
Probably quit
givin' it to his wife
after his kids was born.

371
00:52:53,476 --> 00:52:55,944
You know what that's like.
Yeah.

372
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:01,444
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

373
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,247
Now, I don't want
any trouble from you.

374
00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:09,449
You need to shut your
slop-bucket mouths,
you hear me?

375
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:11,287
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then.

376
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,192
Is that right?
Yeah. Move somewhere else.

377
00:53:15,597 --> 00:53:18,930
What about it?
You wanna lose about half
your fuckin' teeth, huh?

378
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,594
Not tonight, bud.
I'd sure rather not.

379
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,510
<i>Here she comes,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

380
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,883
<i>Oh, boy, look at her fly!</i>

381
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:38,886
<i>This is Lureen Newsome
from right here
in Childress, Texas!</i>

382
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:42,151
<i>Come on, folks,
she's gotta hear it,
let's give her a big hand!</i>

383
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,748
<i>She's turnin' on two!</i>

384
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,653
<i>She's around three!</i>

385
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:49,492
<i>Come on, folks!
Help her home!</i>

386
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:51,998
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

387
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:55,901
<i>And the time is 16 and 9!</i>

388
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:03,810
<i>Here's Cheyenne Hodson
from Cody, Wyoming!</i>

389
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,503
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

390
00:54:08,884 --> 00:54:10,852
<i>She's headed around two!</i>

391
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:13,681
<i>Is there anybody here
from Wyoming?
Ma'am.</i>

392
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:15,483
<i>How about it, folks?</i>

393
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,450
<i>Come on, Cheyenne!</i>

394
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:24,396
<i>And her time is 17 and 2!</i>

395
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:29,394
<i>Here comes Scotty Griffiths,
out of Lubbock, Texas.</i>

396
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,028
<i>Come on, Scotty!</i>

397
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:34,539
<i>Damn it!
Let's give Scotty Griffiths
a big hand, folks.</i>

398
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:36,743
<i>Better luck next time,
cowboy.</i>

399
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,870
<i>Boy, I tell you, folks,
what a heck of a way
to make a living!</i>

400
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,915
<i>Next up is an up-and-comer!</i>

401
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:46,919
<i>Jack Twist from
all the way up
in Lightning Flat, Wyoming.</i>

402
00:54:47,188 --> 00:54:51,625
<i>He's onboard Sleepy today!
Let's hope he's not!</i>

403
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:52,781
<i>Okay!</i>

404
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,021
<i>There they go, folks!
And look at Sleepy go, boy!</i>

405
00:54:57,097 --> 00:55:01,727
<i>He's broke free today, folks!
Come on,
spin and spin and spin!</i>

406
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:07,106
<i>Oh, boy! Good ride, cowboy!
Well, let's see what
the judges say!</i>

407
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:11,210
<i>I tell you, folks,
that sure looked like
the winnin' ride to me!</i>

408
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:31,491
You know that girl?

409
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:34,391
I sure do. Lureen Newsome.

410
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:37,964
Her dad sells farm equipment.
I mean, big farm equipment.

411
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:40,835
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

412
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:57,581
What are you waitin' for,
cowboy? A matin' call?

413
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:06,093
<i># No one's gonna love you
like me #</i>

414
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,003
<i># No one else,
can't you see? #</i>

415
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:16,640
<i># No one's gonna love you
like me #</i>

416
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:21,780
<i># No one, no one #</i>

417
00:56:29,322 --> 00:56:33,690
<i># No one else,
can't you see? #</i>

418
00:56:34,693 --> 00:56:38,686
<i># No one's gonna love you
like me #</i>

419
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:44,091
<i># No one, no one #</i>

420
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:50,403
<i># I know
sometimes you felt #</i>

421
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:54,411
<i># So lonely #</i>

422
00:56:56,682 --> 00:56:58,650
<i># I know #</i>

423
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:02,949
<i># You felt so sad and blue ##</i>

424
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,990
##

425
00:57:33,385 --> 00:57:35,012
Oh, wait, hold on.

426
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:39,780
You don't think
I'm too fast, do you?

427
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:42,526
Maybe we should
put the brakes on?

428
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,493
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you're goin'.

429
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,840
You are in a hurry.
My daddy's the hurry.

430
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,640
He expects me home
with the car by midnight.

431
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,315
Come here, come here.

432
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:17,989
Hi, Monroe.
Hey, Ennis.

433
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,051
Is Alma here?

434
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,495
Yeah, she's in
the condiments aisle.

435
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:22,327
The what?
Ketchup.

436
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,927
Thanks.

437
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:25,825
Your boy gonna play
again this year?

438
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,393
Excuse us!
Yeah, excuse me.

439
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:30,167
Hey, honey. Honey,
what are y'all doing here?

440
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:31,532
Big hurry.

441
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,544
My boss called and,
well, he wants me to
go up to the ranch.

442
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:35,601
Mama.

443
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,271
I guess all the heifers
must've decided...

444
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:38,872
To calve at the same time.

445
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,917
I figured I could
drop the girls off with you.

446
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,418
Ennis, well...

447
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:45,114
I got a million things
I gotta do here
before I can leave.

448
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,747
I don't get off
for another three hours.

449
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:49,793
Mama, I need crayons.
Not now, Alma.

450
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,787
Ennis, please, you promised
you'd take them tonight.

451
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,626
Alma, I can't afford
not to be there
when the heifers calve.

452
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,666
Right, it'd be my job
if I lose any of 'em.

453
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,395
What about my job?

454
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,071
Okay, all right,
I'll call my sister.

455
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,541
I'll see if she can take 'em.
All right. All right.

456
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,737
You be a good girl
for your mama, all right?

457
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:11,144
I'll be half the night.

458
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,148
Bring home some ground steaks
if you think of it.

459
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,583
Come here. Oh, Alma, please!

460
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,151
Oh, boy.

461
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,688
Okay.
Monroe, I'm so sorry.

462
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,853
It's okay. It's okay, Alma.

463
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,495
I'll clean this up
just as soon as
I call my sister...

464
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,691
to come get the girls.

465
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,166
Really, Alma, it's okay.
I'll get it.

466
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,829
Alma, come with me.
Watch your feet.

467
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,130
Alma.

468
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,105
It's just like my hand.

469
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,336
Honey,
got a surprise for you.

470
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,971
Hey.

471
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,811
I got two whole boxes
of formula for you.

472
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:48,908
You did?

473
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,954
120 cans.
120?

474
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,511
L.D., where did you put 'em?

475
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,525
Oh, hell,
back seat of the car,
where I left 'em.

476
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,324
Rodeo can get 'em.

477
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:07,000
L.D., I can already see
who little Bobby looks like.

478
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:08,262
Good job, little girl.

479
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:10,965
He's the spittin' image
of his grandpa.

480
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,034
Isn't he just the spittin'
image of his grandpa?

481
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:18,771
Yeah.

482
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,380
Look at those eyes.

483
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:50,135
Hey.

484
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:54,179
Hey, honey.

485
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,983
Hey, Ennis, you know
somebody, name of Jack?

486
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:05,624
Maybe. Why?

487
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:08,662
'Cause you got a postcard.
It come general delivery.

488
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:23,840
Is he somebody
you cowboyed with, or what?

489
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,938
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly.

490
01:01:30,117 --> 01:01:32,017
We was fishin' buddies.

491
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:12,659
You can color that one, too.

492
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:14,718
I'll color the beach.

493
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,068
Maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.
Huh?

494
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:28,098
Take your friend
to the Knife and Fork?

495
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:30,665
No, Jack ain't
the restaurant type.

496
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,345
We'll more likely
just go out and get drunk.

497
01:02:35,749 --> 01:02:37,478
That's if he shows.

498
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:46,957
Okay, we take one more bite,
and then you're finished
with dinner.

499
01:02:47,594 --> 01:02:50,961
There, that's a good bite.
All right, you're excused.

500
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:52,958
Please. Thank you.

501
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:15,315
Jack fuckin' Twist.

502
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:21,550
Son of a bitch.

503
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,560
Come here.

504
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:31,992
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

505
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:34,565
And, Jack,
this is my wife, Alma.

506
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:36,225
Howdy.
Hello.

507
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,497
You got a kid.

508
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:42,596
Yeah, I got two little girls.
Alma Jr. And Jenny.

509
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:44,870
I got a boy.
Yeah?

510
01:04:45,476 --> 01:04:48,001
Eight months old.
Smiles a lot.

511
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,710
I married
the prettiest little gal
in Childress, Texas.

512
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:53,307
Yeah?
Lureen.

513
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,817
So me and Jack,
we're gonna head out and
get ourselves a drink. Yeah?

514
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:03,059
Sure enough.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

515
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:04,825
We might not
get back tonight...

516
01:05:04,896 --> 01:05:07,091
when we get to drinkin'
and talkin' and all.

517
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:08,291
Ennis?

518
01:05:09,233 --> 01:05:10,700
Would you get me
a pack of smokes?

519
01:05:10,768 --> 01:05:13,669
If you need smokes, Alma,
they're in the top pocket
of my blue shirt.

520
01:05:13,738 --> 01:05:15,365
There in the bedroom.

521
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:30,476
Four years. Damn!
Yeah, four years.

522
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,919
Didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

523
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:39,524
I figured you were sore
from that punch.

524
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:43,299
Right next summer,
I drove back up to Brokeback.

525
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:45,494
Talked to Aguirre
about a job, and...

526
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,232
He told me you hadn't
been back, so I left.

527
01:05:48,906 --> 01:05:51,965
Went down to Texas
for rodeoin'.

528
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:54,877
That's how I met Lureen.

529
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:58,908
Made $2,000 that year,
bull ridin'. Nearly starved.

530
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:04,352
Lureen's old man
makes serious money,
farm machine business.

531
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,514
Of course, he hates my guts.

532
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:14,090
And the Army didn't get you?
No, too busted up.

533
01:06:14,297 --> 01:06:16,595
And rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day.

534
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:19,066
Got out
while I could still walk.

535
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:25,130
Swear to God,
I didn't know we was
goin' to get into this again.

536
01:06:27,878 --> 01:06:29,869
Yes I did.
I red-lined it all the way.

537
01:06:29,946 --> 01:06:31,971
I couldn't get here
fast enough.

538
01:06:32,649 --> 01:06:36,210
What about you?
Me? I don't know.

539
01:06:40,056 --> 01:06:41,523
I don't know.

540
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,555
Old Brokeback got us good,
don't it?

541
01:06:55,038 --> 01:06:57,165
What are we gonna do now?

542
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:03,477
I doubt there's nothin'
we can do.

543
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,281
So now I'm stuck
with what I got here.

544
01:07:14,924 --> 01:07:18,018
Makin' a livin' is
about all I got time for now.

545
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:43,109
Hey.

546
01:07:43,419 --> 01:07:46,217
Well, me and Jack is
headed up the mountain
for a day or two.

547
01:07:46,288 --> 01:07:48,518
Do ourselves
a little fishin'.

548
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:59,225
You know, your friend
could come inside,
have a cup of coffee.

549
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,028
Well, he's from Texas.

550
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:04,130
Texans don't drink coffee?

551
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,876
You sure that foreman won't
fire you for takin' off?

552
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,884
You know, that foreman,
he owes me.

553
01:08:17,952 --> 01:08:21,786
I worked through a blizzard
last Christmas.
You remember that?

554
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:24,718
Besides, I'll only be
a couple of days.

555
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:30,324
Bring fish, Daddy.
A big, big one!

556
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,134
Come here. Come here.

557
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,577
Come here.

558
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:51,717
See you Sunday, latest.

559
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:04,028
I'm starvin'. Want to
get somethin' to eat?

560
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,122
Yup.

561
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:34,894
Last one in!

562
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,843
Is there anything interestin'
up there in heaven?

563
01:09:57,084 --> 01:09:59,814
Well, I was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.

564
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,749
For what?

565
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:06,387
For you forgettin'
to bring that harmonica.

566
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,860
I'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.

567
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,592
You know
it could be like this,
just like this, always.

568
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:19,666
Yeah? How do you figure that?

569
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:26,675
What if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere...

570
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:31,583
a little
cow-and-calf operation?
It'd be a sweet life.

571
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:33,751
I mean, hell,
Lureen's old man...

572
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:35,912
you bet he'd give me
a down payment to get lost.

573
01:10:35,988 --> 01:10:38,684
I mean, he more or less
already said it.

574
01:10:40,025 --> 01:10:41,253
No, I...

575
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:46,254
I told you
it ain't gonna be that way.

576
01:10:49,268 --> 01:10:50,633
You know...

577
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,530
you got your wife
and baby in Texas.

578
01:10:55,808 --> 01:10:58,333
You know,
I got my life in Riverton.

579
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:00,373
Is that so?

580
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:04,649
You and Alma, that's a life?
Now you shut up about Alma.

581
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:06,514
This ain't her fault.

582
01:11:08,787 --> 01:11:10,618
The bottom line is...

583
01:11:11,757 --> 01:11:13,782
we're around each other...

584
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,856
and this thing grabs hold
of us again...

585
01:11:17,763 --> 01:11:19,560
in the wrong place...

586
01:11:20,366 --> 01:11:22,129
in the wrong time...

587
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,325
and we're dead.

588
01:11:26,772 --> 01:11:28,239
I tell you...

589
01:11:28,307 --> 01:11:32,209
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.

590
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,670
<i>Earl and Rich.</i>

591
01:11:37,415 --> 01:11:38,882
<i>And they was a joke in town...</i>

592
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,783
<i>even though they were
pretty tough old birds.</i>

593
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:49,719
<i>Anyway,
they found Earl dead...</i>

594
01:11:50,962 --> 01:11:52,862
<i>in an irrigation ditch.</i>

595
01:11:54,465 --> 01:11:57,400
<i>They took a tire iron to him,
spurred him up...</i>

596
01:11:57,535 --> 01:12:00,629
<i>and drug him around by
his dick till it pulled off.</i>

597
01:12:02,607 --> 01:12:07,101
You seen this?
Yeah, I was what?
Nine years old.

598
01:12:09,447 --> 01:12:12,610
<i>My daddy, he made sure
me and my brother seen it.</i>

599
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:19,715
Hell, for all I know,
he done the job.

600
01:12:23,228 --> 01:12:25,628
Two guys living together?
No way.

601
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,029
Now, we can get together
once in a while...

602
01:12:30,101 --> 01:12:33,298
way the hell out
in the middle of nowhere,
but...

603
01:12:34,038 --> 01:12:35,733
"Once in a while."

604
01:12:37,008 --> 01:12:38,999
Every four fucking years?

605
01:12:39,344 --> 01:12:43,303
Well,
if you can't fix it, Jack,
you gotta stand it.

606
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,217
For how long?

607
01:12:50,554 --> 01:12:52,647
As long as we can ride it.

608
01:12:57,694 --> 01:13:00,094
There ain't no reins
on this one.

609
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:17,773
It's nearly suppertime.

610
01:13:17,848 --> 01:13:18,906
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

611
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,074
To work!

612
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,550
I thought you had the day off!
Well, you thought wrong!

613
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:25,019
The girls need to be fed.
Well, you take care of it!

614
01:13:25,088 --> 01:13:27,318
Alma! Alma!

615
01:13:28,091 --> 01:13:29,456
Supper's on the stove!

616
01:13:29,526 --> 01:13:31,494
No one's eatin'
unless you're servin' it!

617
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,722
I already promised
I'd take the extra shift!

618
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:36,288
Fucking tell 'em
you made a mistake, then!

619
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:38,732
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

620
01:13:48,912 --> 01:13:50,709
You girls need
a push or somethin'?

621
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:51,873
No.

622
01:14:01,123 --> 01:14:03,114
Listen to her purr, gentlemen!

623
01:14:03,192 --> 01:14:05,592
You ain't gonna get that
with your Caddy!

624
01:14:05,728 --> 01:14:08,754
I told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.

625
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,700
Say, didn't that pissant
used to ride the bulls?

626
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,663
He used to try.

627
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,338
Honey, have you seen
my blue parka?

628
01:14:55,177 --> 01:14:56,735
Last time I seen it,
you was in it...

629
01:14:56,812 --> 01:14:58,973
day we had that big ice storm.

630
01:15:00,282 --> 01:15:02,910
Well, could have sworn
I seen it in here.

631
01:15:04,452 --> 01:15:05,817
You know...

632
01:15:06,788 --> 01:15:08,881
you've been going up
to Wyoming all these years.

633
01:15:08,957 --> 01:15:11,790
Why can't your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

634
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,488
Because the Bighorn Mountains
ain't in Texas.

635
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:17,621
And I don't think that
his pickup could make it
down here, anyway.

636
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:20,395
New model comin' in this week,
remember?

637
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:23,800
You're the best
combine salesman we got.

638
01:15:24,472 --> 01:15:26,167
You're the only
combine salesman, in fact.

639
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:29,176
Yeah, I'll be back in a week.
That is, unless I freeze
to death...

640
01:15:29,244 --> 01:15:30,871
and I'll freeze
if I don't find that parka.

641
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:33,072
Well, I don't have
your goddamn parka.

642
01:15:33,148 --> 01:15:36,015
You know, you're worse
than Bobby when it comes
to losin' stuff.

643
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:38,109
Well, speakin' of Bobby,
did you call his school...

644
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:40,211
about gettin' him a tutor?

645
01:15:40,822 --> 01:15:42,119
I thought you were gonna call.

646
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,818
I complain too much.
That teacher don't like me.
Right.

647
01:15:44,893 --> 01:15:48,260
Now it's your turn.
Okay, fine,
so I'll call later.

648
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:52,258
Right. Fine.

649
01:15:53,735 --> 01:15:54,793
Goodbye.

650
01:15:55,804 --> 01:15:58,034
Got 14 hours of
driving ahead of me.

651
01:15:58,106 --> 01:15:59,971
See now, it don't seem fair...

652
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:02,032
you goin' up there
two, three times a year...

653
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,203
with him never
comin' down here.

654
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:23,427
Ennis, they got an opening
over at the power company.

655
01:16:23,497 --> 01:16:25,021
Might be good pay.

656
01:16:25,098 --> 01:16:28,295
Well, as clumsy as I am,
I'd probably get electrocuted.

657
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:30,802
Daddy, the church picnic's
next weekend.

658
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:32,964
Will you be back from fishing
by next weekend?

659
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,871
Please, Daddy? Please!

660
01:16:34,942 --> 01:16:37,809
Well, all right, as long as
I don't have to sing.

661
01:16:37,878 --> 01:16:40,676
Daddy. Thank you.

662
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:42,738
You forgettin' somethin'?

663
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,214
You're late.

664
01:17:21,288 --> 01:17:23,085
Look what I brought.

665
01:17:25,258 --> 01:17:26,486
This way.

666
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:44,969
There you go! No hands!

667
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,005
It's all yours, buddy!
It's all yours.

668
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:54,609
Come on, come on.

669
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:05,958
<i>Come on in, Alvin.</i>

670
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,565
<i>I've been trying to call you
for hours.</i>

671
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,126
It's Saturday night, you know,
we could still smarten up...

672
01:18:12,204 --> 01:18:14,798
and head on over
to the church social.

673
01:18:15,474 --> 01:18:17,704
That fire and brimstone crowd?

674
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,777
I think it'd be nice.

675
01:18:37,896 --> 01:18:39,056
Ennis.

676
01:18:39,331 --> 01:18:41,424
As far behind as we are
on the bills...

677
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:44,559
it makes me nervous
not to take no precaution.

678
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:50,037
If you don't want
no more of my kids...

679
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:53,075
I'll be happy
to leave you alone.

680
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,506
I'd have 'em,
if you'd support 'em.

681
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,566
<i>Custody of
the two minor children...</i>

682
01:19:18,637 --> 01:19:20,696
Alma Del Mar Jr.
And Jennifer Del Mar...

683
01:19:20,772 --> 01:19:22,706
is awarded to plaintiff.

684
01:19:22,774 --> 01:19:25,334
Defendant is ordered to pay
child support to plaintiff...

685
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:29,904
in the sum of $125 per month
for each of
the minor children...

686
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,210
until they reach
the age of 18 years.

687
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,749
Del Mar divorce granted,
this sixth day
of November, 1975.

688
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,229
# King of the road! ##

689
01:19:57,975 --> 01:19:59,306
In you go.

690
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:12,415
What are you doin' here, huh?

691
01:20:13,991 --> 01:20:16,516
I got your message
about the divorce.

692
01:20:17,828 --> 01:20:18,886
Come here.

693
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:23,494
Well, this here's Jack.
Jack, these are
my little girls.

694
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:26,331
There's Alma Jr. And Jenny.
Hi.

695
01:20:27,171 --> 01:20:28,900
Say hi, girls.
Hi.

696
01:20:34,511 --> 01:20:37,503
I got your card
that the divorce came through.

697
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:40,650
Yeah.
So here I am.

698
01:20:41,752 --> 01:20:43,845
I had to ask about
10 different people
in Riverton...

699
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:45,821
where you had moved to.

700
01:20:50,861 --> 01:20:53,454
I guess, I thought that
this means you...

701
01:20:56,632 --> 01:21:00,625
No, Jack,
I don't know what to say.

702
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,430
See, I got the girls
this weekend and...

703
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:07,873
Jeez, I...

704
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:11,408
I'm sure as hell sorry.
You know I am.

705
01:21:12,982 --> 01:21:16,679
See, I only get them
once a month, and I missed
last month.

706
01:21:16,886 --> 01:21:19,582
So I just...
Because of the roundup.

707
01:21:21,324 --> 01:21:22,518
So...

708
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:27,391
Well...
Yeah, all right.

709
01:21:29,365 --> 01:21:30,457
Jack.

710
01:21:32,468 --> 01:21:34,698
I'll see you next month, then.

711
01:23:26,113 --> 01:23:27,512
Comin' up.

712
01:23:30,017 --> 01:23:33,714
Here we go. Here we are!

713
01:23:37,925 --> 01:23:39,153
Whoa there, Rodeo.

714
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,956
The stud duck do the carvin'
around here.

715
01:23:42,329 --> 01:23:45,730
You bet, LD.
I was just saving you
the trouble.

716
01:23:53,407 --> 01:23:55,466
Bobby, if you don't
eat your dinner...

717
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:57,669
I'm gonna have to
turn off that television.

718
01:23:57,745 --> 01:23:58,871
Why, Mama?

719
01:23:58,946 --> 01:24:01,471
I'm gonna be eating this food
for the next two weeks.

720
01:24:01,548 --> 01:24:03,311
Hey, you heard your mama.

721
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:09,222
You finish your meal,
and then you can watch
the game.

722
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,292
Daddy?

723
01:24:25,204 --> 01:24:26,330
Daddy.

724
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:31,335
Hell, we don't eat
with our eyes.

725
01:24:32,145 --> 01:24:33,703
You want your boy
to grow up...

726
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,680
to be a man,
don't you, Daughter?

727
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:38,308
Boys should watch football.

728
01:24:41,955 --> 01:24:44,753
Not until he finishes
eating the meal...

729
01:24:45,725 --> 01:24:48,319
that his mama took
three hours to fix.

730
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:01,968
Now you sit down,
you old son of a bitch!

731
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,238
This is my house,
this is my child...

732
01:25:07,313 --> 01:25:09,611
and you are my guest.
Now you sit down...

733
01:25:09,682 --> 01:25:12,776
before I knock your
ignorant ass into next week.

734
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:06,904
Daddy, tell about when you
rode broncs in the rodeo.

735
01:26:09,141 --> 01:26:11,507
Well,
that's a short story, honey.

736
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:14,636
It was only about
three seconds
I was on that bronc.

737
01:26:15,814 --> 01:26:19,250
The next thing I knew,
I was flying
through the air...

738
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:22,319
only I was no ángel
like you and Jenny here.

739
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:24,421
I didn't have no wings.

740
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:30,219
And that's the story
of my saddle bronc career.

741
01:26:53,551 --> 01:26:55,018
There you go.

742
01:27:02,326 --> 01:27:04,260
You ought to get
married again, Ennis.

743
01:27:04,328 --> 01:27:07,695
Me and the girls worry
about you bein' alone so much.

744
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,730
Well, once burned...

745
01:27:14,872 --> 01:27:17,397
You still go fishing
with Jack Twist?

746
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,241
Not often.

747
01:27:24,915 --> 01:27:28,316
You know, I used to wonder
how come you never brought
any trouts home.

748
01:27:28,385 --> 01:27:29,977
You always said
you caught plenty...

749
01:27:30,054 --> 01:27:32,579
and you know how
me and the girls like fish.

750
01:27:35,693 --> 01:27:37,558
So, one night,
I got your creel case open...

751
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:40,825
night before you went
on one of your little trips.

752
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,328
Price tag still on it
after five years.

753
01:27:46,237 --> 01:27:48,966
And I tied a note
to the end of the line.

754
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:54,336
It said, "Hello, Ennis,
bring some fish home.
Love, Alma."

755
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:57,879
And then you come back
lookin' all perky...

756
01:27:57,947 --> 01:28:00,973
and said you caught
a bunch of brownies
and you ate them up.

757
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,642
Do you remember?

758
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:06,689
I looked in that case
first chance I got...

759
01:28:06,756 --> 01:28:08,246
and there was my note
still tied there.

760
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:10,087
That line hadn't touched water
in its life.

761
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,094
That don't mean nothing, Alma.

762
01:28:12,195 --> 01:28:14,493
Don't try and fool me
no more, Ennis.

763
01:28:14,564 --> 01:28:17,897
I know what that means.
Jack Twist.

764
01:28:18,635 --> 01:28:22,765
Alma.
Jack "Nasty"!

765
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,972
You didn't go up there
to fish. You and him...

766
01:28:26,042 --> 01:28:28,977
Now you listen to me,
you don't know nothing
about it.

767
01:28:29,045 --> 01:28:30,672
I'm going to yell for Monroe.

768
01:28:30,747 --> 01:28:32,874
You do it and I'll make you
eat the fucking floor.

769
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:33,973
Get out!

770
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,644
And you, too!
Get out! Get out!

771
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,620
Get out of my house,
Ennis Del Mar! You hear me?
You get out!

772
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,179
Daddy?

773
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:43,884
Alma?

774
01:28:45,762 --> 01:28:47,354
Bye, Daddy!

775
01:28:48,932 --> 01:28:50,194
Bye.

776
01:29:04,012 --> 01:29:06,776
Hey, asshole,
watch where you're goin'!

777
01:29:07,883 --> 01:29:09,783
Jesus. What...

778
01:29:11,987 --> 01:29:13,682
Jesus...

779
01:29:13,755 --> 01:29:15,416
You stupid fuck!

780
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:20,989
God damn!

781
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:28,567
God. God damn.

782
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:30,394
Oh, fuck!

783
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:32,567
Damn it!

784
01:30:20,888 --> 01:30:24,051
All I'm sayin' is,
what's the point of making it?

785
01:30:24,392 --> 01:30:27,793
If the taxes don't get it,
the inflation will
eat it all up.

786
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:36,329
You should see Lureen punchin'
numbers in her adding machine.

787
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:39,271
Hunting for extra zeros,
her eyes gettin'
smaller and smaller.

788
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:42,275
It's like watchin' a rabbit
tryin' to...

789
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:45,710
squeeze into a snake hole
with a coyote on its tail.

790
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,647
That's some high class
entertainment, if you ask me.

791
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,047
For what it's worth.

792
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,952
You and Lureen,
it's normal and all?

793
01:31:02,496 --> 01:31:03,588
Sure.

794
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,700
She don't ever suspect?

795
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:20,171
You ever get the feelin'...

796
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,404
I don't know...

797
01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:24,747
when you're in town...

798
01:31:25,418 --> 01:31:27,215
and someone looks at you...

799
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:29,619
suspicious, like he knows.

800
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:33,719
Then you go out on
the pavement and everyone's
lookin' at you...

801
01:31:33,793 --> 01:31:35,761
like they all know, too?

802
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:44,293
Well, maybe you ought to
get out of there, you know?

803
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:49,632
Find yourself someplace
different, maybe Texas.

804
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:51,670
Texas?

805
01:31:53,646 --> 01:31:55,238
Sure, and maybe
you can convince Alma...

806
01:31:55,315 --> 01:31:57,340
to let you and Lureen
adopt the girls.

807
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:59,851
Then we could just
live together, herdin' sheep.

808
01:31:59,919 --> 01:32:02,387
And it'll rain money
from L.D. Newsome...

809
01:32:02,455 --> 01:32:05,151
and whiskey will
flow in the streams.
Jack, that's real smart.

810
01:32:05,225 --> 01:32:06,692
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.

811
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,320
You wanna live
your miserable fucking life?
Then go right ahead.

812
01:32:09,396 --> 01:32:11,330
Fine.
I was just thinkin' out loud.

813
01:32:11,398 --> 01:32:14,333
Yup, you're a real
thinker there. God damn...

814
01:32:15,668 --> 01:32:17,431
Jack fucking Twist.

815
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:19,437
Got it all figured out,
ain't he?

816
01:32:24,144 --> 01:32:25,736
All right, hon.

817
01:32:39,925 --> 01:32:42,792
Just finished my shift.
Wanna dance?

818
01:32:43,128 --> 01:32:46,757
I was on my way to the...
I'm Cassie.
Cassie Cartwright.

819
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,861
Ennis. Del Mar.

820
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:21,463
No more dancin' for me,
I hope.

821
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:23,191
You're safe.
Yeah?

822
01:33:23,268 --> 01:33:26,135
My feet hurt.
Hard work, is it?

823
01:33:26,305 --> 01:33:30,173
Yeah, drunks like you
demanding beer after beer...

824
01:33:30,742 --> 01:33:33,370
smokin'. Gets tiresome.

825
01:33:35,546 --> 01:33:37,776
What do you do,
Ennis Del Mar?

826
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:42,045
Well, earlier today,
I was castrating calves.

827
01:33:47,225 --> 01:33:48,954
What are you doing?

828
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:51,792
Trying to get
a foot rub, dummy.

829
01:33:55,733 --> 01:33:57,064
All right.

830
01:33:58,736 --> 01:34:00,067
That good?

831
01:34:21,425 --> 01:34:24,451
And then I pledged
Tri Delt at SMU.

832
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:25,826
And I sure never thought...

833
01:34:25,897 --> 01:34:28,297
I'd end up in a poky
little place like Childress.

834
01:34:28,366 --> 01:34:30,664
Then I met old Randall here
at an Aggie game...

835
01:34:30,735 --> 01:34:33,329
and he was an animal
husbandry major.

836
01:34:33,404 --> 01:34:35,929
So we've been here for a month
and he got the foreman job...

837
01:34:36,007 --> 01:34:39,465
over at Roy Taylor's ranch.
Like it or not, here I am!

838
01:34:39,577 --> 01:34:43,206
Was you Tri Delt?
I was Kappa Phi myself.

839
01:34:45,048 --> 01:34:47,881
Well, even though we ain't
quite sorority sisters...

840
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:50,181
we just may have to dance
with ourselves, Lureen.

841
01:34:50,253 --> 01:34:53,086
Our husbands ain't the least
bit interested in dancin'.

842
01:34:53,156 --> 01:34:55,283
They ain't got a smidgen
of rhythm between them.

843
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:56,416
It's funny, isn't it?

844
01:34:56,493 --> 01:35:00,930
Husbands don't never
seem to wanna dance
with their wives.

845
01:35:01,898 --> 01:35:03,729
Why do you think
that is, Jack?

846
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,268
I don't know,
I never give it any thought.

847
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,569
Wanna dance?

848
01:35:09,973 --> 01:35:12,441
Yes, thank you.
Do you mind?

849
01:35:12,509 --> 01:35:15,376
No, it's all right. Go ahead.
All right.

850
01:35:16,413 --> 01:35:17,641
Pardon us.

851
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:19,511
Thank you for asking me
to dance with you.

852
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:21,744
I really appreciate that.
Randall never does.

853
01:35:21,818 --> 01:35:23,615
Last time I did,
I think it was our wedding.

854
01:35:23,687 --> 01:35:26,053
It's a good thing
you and Lureen happened
along when you did...

855
01:35:26,122 --> 01:35:28,249
or else we'd still be stuck
on the side of the road...

856
01:35:28,325 --> 01:35:29,587
in that darn pickup.

857
01:35:29,659 --> 01:35:31,149
I told Randall
we ought to take the car.

858
01:35:31,227 --> 01:35:32,751
Of course,
he'd never listen to me.

859
01:35:32,829 --> 01:35:35,821
He wouldn't listen to me
if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.

860
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:38,959
I told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire...

861
01:35:39,035 --> 01:35:40,593
to fix that pickup.

862
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,797
Well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.

863
01:35:45,675 --> 01:35:47,540
Come over here and ask...

864
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:56,443
You ever notice how a woman
will powder her nose...

865
01:35:56,518 --> 01:35:58,452
before she goes to a party?

866
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,956
And then she'll powder it
again once the party's over.

867
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:05,749
I mean, why powder your nose
just to go home and go to bed?

868
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:07,159
Don't know.

869
01:36:07,997 --> 01:36:09,362
Even if I wanted to know...

870
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:12,696
I couldn't get
a word in with Lashawn
long enough to ask.

871
01:36:12,768 --> 01:36:16,101
Woman talks a blue streak.
Lively little gal.

872
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:26,139
You'll like working
for Roy Taylor.

873
01:36:26,215 --> 01:36:29,412
He's solid, Roy.
Yeah, Roy.
He's a good old boy.

874
01:36:34,823 --> 01:36:37,656
He's got a little cabin
down on Lake Kemp.

875
01:36:38,994 --> 01:36:41,394
Got a crappie house,
little boat.

876
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,455
Said I could use it
whenever I want.

877
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:50,831
We ought to go down there
some weekend.

878
01:36:51,674 --> 01:36:54,108
Drink a little whiskey,
fish some.

879
01:36:55,511 --> 01:36:57,775
Get away, you know?

880
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:02,473
That was right out of SMU.

881
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:05,018
I could've had
my pick of pretty much
any job in North Dallas.

882
01:37:05,086 --> 01:37:07,452
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster...

883
01:37:07,522 --> 01:37:10,616
because, honey,
where clothes is concerned,
I got no resistance.

884
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:13,957
I was spending more than
I made. More than
Randall ever will make.

885
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:15,017
We come out here...

886
01:37:15,096 --> 01:37:17,189
thinkin' that ranchin' was
still big hats and Mariboros.

887
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:19,199
Boy, were we behind the times.

888
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:38,012
Hey there, Junior. You ready?

889
01:37:39,654 --> 01:37:42,122
##

890
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:54,996
What do you think?

891
01:37:55,837 --> 01:37:59,136
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

892
01:38:00,475 --> 01:38:03,842
Don't know. Maybe he's not
the marrying kind.

893
01:38:06,814 --> 01:38:08,543
You don't think so?

894
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,845
Or you don't think
I'm the one for him?

895
01:38:14,621 --> 01:38:16,350
You're good enough.

896
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:24,625
You don't say much,
but you get your point across.

897
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,132
Sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

898
01:38:32,038 --> 01:38:33,130
All right.

899
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,499
You're stayin'
on your feet, cowboy.

900
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:39,101
Excuse me, darling.

901
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:05,665
So I'll pick you and Jenny up
next weekend, after church.

902
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,232
Fine.

903
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:13,402
You all right?

904
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:15,772
Yes.

905
01:39:16,983 --> 01:39:18,450
Are you sure?

906
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,883
Daddy, I was thinking,
what with the new baby
and all...

907
01:39:24,957 --> 01:39:27,357
Ma and Monroe have been
awful strict on me.

908
01:39:27,426 --> 01:39:29,519
More on me than Jenny even.

909
01:39:30,429 --> 01:39:32,761
I was thinkin',
maybe I could...

910
01:39:34,934 --> 01:39:37,334
Maybe I could come
stay with you.

911
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:41,337
I'd be an awful good help,
I know I would.

912
01:39:41,774 --> 01:39:44,766
Now, you know
I ain't set up for that.

913
01:39:46,612 --> 01:39:48,739
With the roundup comin'...

914
01:39:49,415 --> 01:39:51,212
I won't ever be home.

915
01:39:52,718 --> 01:39:54,583
It's all right, Daddy.

916
01:39:54,854 --> 01:39:58,813
I'm not sayin'
that I wouldn't...
It's all right, I understand.

917
01:40:01,193 --> 01:40:03,423
Well, see you on Sunday, then.

918
01:40:04,396 --> 01:40:05,454
Bye.

919
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,592
Bye, sweetheart.

920
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,428
Going to snow
tonight for sure.

921
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:43,725
Yup.

922
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:54,834
All this time and you ain't
found nobody else to marry?

923
01:40:56,648 --> 01:40:58,047
I been puttin' the blocks...

924
01:40:58,116 --> 01:41:00,983
to a good-lookin' little gal
over in Riverton.

925
01:41:02,487 --> 01:41:06,389
She's a waitress.
Wants to go to nursing school
or somethin'.

926
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,725
I don't know.

927
01:41:14,232 --> 01:41:16,257
What about you and Lureen?

928
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:21,568
Lureen's good
at making hard deals in
the machinery business...

929
01:41:21,639 --> 01:41:24,073
but as far as
our marriage goes...

930
01:41:24,609 --> 01:41:26,839
we could do it over the phone.

931
01:41:36,754 --> 01:41:39,484
I kind of got this thing
going with...

932
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:43,052
a ranch foreman's wife
over in Rutters.

933
01:41:43,427 --> 01:41:45,088
What?
I'm bound to get shot...

934
01:41:45,162 --> 01:41:48,495
by Lureen or her husband
each time I slip off
to see her.

935
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:51,691
You probably deserve it.

936
01:41:58,642 --> 01:42:00,200
Tell you what.

937
01:42:05,248 --> 01:42:06,772
The truth is...

938
01:42:13,757 --> 01:42:17,056
sometimes I miss you so much,
I can hardly stand it.

939
01:42:59,335 --> 01:43:02,065
I guess I'll head up
on to Lightning Flat.

940
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:05,737
See the folks
for a day or two.

941
01:43:11,647 --> 01:43:14,844
There's somethin' I been
meanin' to tell you, bud.

942
01:43:18,954 --> 01:43:22,446
Well, it's likely November
before I can come out
here again.

943
01:43:25,861 --> 01:43:30,093
After we ship stock and before
winter feedin' starts again.

944
01:43:34,003 --> 01:43:35,231
November.

945
01:43:39,308 --> 01:43:42,038
What in the hell ever happened
to August?

946
01:43:42,945 --> 01:43:43,934
Well...

947
01:43:47,116 --> 01:43:48,606
Christ, Ennis.

948
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:58,754
You know, you had
a fucking week to say
some little word about this.

949
01:44:01,262 --> 01:44:03,696
Why is it we're always
in the friggin' cold?

950
01:44:03,765 --> 01:44:06,359
We ought to go south
where it's warm, you know!

951
01:44:06,434 --> 01:44:08,425
We ought to go to Mexico.

952
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,464
Mexico?

953
01:44:11,806 --> 01:44:14,297
Hell, Jack, you know me.
About all the travelin'
I ever done...

954
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:17,435
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.

955
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:22,213
Come on, Jack.
Lighten up on me.

956
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:26,287
We can hunt in November.

957
01:44:27,122 --> 01:44:28,851
Kill us a nice elk.

958
01:44:31,392 --> 01:44:33,257
I'll try if I can get
Don Wroe's cabin again.

959
01:44:33,328 --> 01:44:36,024
We had a good time that year,
didn't we?

960
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:41,362
There's never enough time,
never enough.

961
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,569
You know, friend...

962
01:44:48,676 --> 01:44:52,134
this is a goddamn bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.

963
01:44:53,214 --> 01:44:56,843
You used to come away easy.
Now it's like seein' the Pope.

964
01:44:59,821 --> 01:45:01,584
Jack, I got to work.

965
01:45:04,692 --> 01:45:07,593
In them earlier days,
I'd just quit the job.

966
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:11,661
You...

967
01:45:12,332 --> 01:45:15,597
You forget what it's like
bein' broke all the time.

968
01:45:19,206 --> 01:45:21,504
You ever hear
of child support?

969
01:45:25,379 --> 01:45:27,711
I'll tell you this,
I can't quit this one...

970
01:45:27,781 --> 01:45:29,772
and I can't get the time off.

971
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,711
It was hard enough
gettin' this time.

972
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:37,518
The trade-off was August.

973
01:45:41,662 --> 01:45:43,527
Well, you got a better idea?

974
01:45:46,333 --> 01:45:47,732
I did, once.

975
01:45:49,937 --> 01:45:51,427
You did, once.

976
01:45:56,276 --> 01:45:58,801
Well, have you been to Mexico,
Jack Twist?

977
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:05,008
'Cause I hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you.

978
01:46:06,753 --> 01:46:10,314
Hell, yes,
I've been to Mexico.
Is that a fucking problem?

979
01:46:18,398 --> 01:46:21,798
I'm going to tell you this
one time, Jack fucking Twist.

980
01:46:21,867 --> 01:46:23,630
And I ain't foolin'.

981
01:46:24,971 --> 01:46:28,634
What I don't know, all them
things that I don't know...

982
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:31,942
could get you killed
if I come to know them.

983
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:37,639
I ain't jokin'.

984
01:46:42,455 --> 01:46:45,117
Yeah, well try this one,
and I'll say it just once.

985
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:47,887
Go ahead!
I'll tell you what.

986
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:49,427
We could have had
a good life together.

987
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:52,692
Fucking real good life.
Had us a place of our own!

988
01:46:53,733 --> 01:46:55,792
But you didn't want it, Ennis.

989
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:58,666
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

990
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:04,205
Everything's built on that!
That's all we got, boy.
Fucking all.

991
01:47:04,277 --> 01:47:06,905
So I hope you know that,
if you don't never know
the rest!

992
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:09,243
God damn it.
You count the damn
few times...

993
01:47:09,315 --> 01:47:11,112
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years...

994
01:47:11,183 --> 01:47:13,310
and you measure
the short fucking leash
you keep me on...

995
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:16,014
and then you ask me
about Mexico and you tell me
you'll kill me...

996
01:47:16,088 --> 01:47:19,148
for needin' somethin'
I don't hardly never get!

997
01:47:21,727 --> 01:47:24,662
You have no idea
how bad it gets!

998
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,134
And I'm not you!
I can't make it...

999
01:47:31,202 --> 01:47:34,729
on a couple of high-altitude
fucks once or twice a year!

1000
01:47:37,309 --> 01:47:39,607
You are too much
for me, Ennis.

1001
01:47:40,312 --> 01:47:42,439
You son of a whoreson bitch!

1002
01:47:44,616 --> 01:47:46,846
I wish I knew how to quit you!

1003
01:47:49,487 --> 01:47:51,216
Then why don't you?

1004
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,593
Why don't you just
let me be, huh?

1005
01:47:58,663 --> 01:48:01,655
It's because of you, Jack,
that I'm like this.

1006
01:48:05,303 --> 01:48:06,702
I'm nothin'.

1007
01:48:07,372 --> 01:48:08,771
I'm nowhere.

1008
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:16,073
It's okay.
Get the fuck off me!

1009
01:48:23,154 --> 01:48:25,748
It's all right.
It's all right.

1010
01:48:26,825 --> 01:48:28,417
Damn you, Ennis.

1011
01:48:29,761 --> 01:48:32,355
I just can't stand
this anymore, Jack.

1012
01:48:42,873 --> 01:48:46,331
Come on now, you're sleepin'
on your feet like a horse.

1013
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:51,842
My mama used to say that to me
when I was little.

1014
01:48:52,883 --> 01:48:54,578
And sing to me.

1015
01:49:08,432 --> 01:49:09,831
I got to go.

1016
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:14,704
See you in the morning.

1017
01:49:55,611 --> 01:49:57,704
##

1018
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:11,190
Excuse me.

1019
01:50:16,265 --> 01:50:17,323
Hey.

1020
01:50:18,301 --> 01:50:19,791
Ennis Del Mar.

1021
01:50:23,372 --> 01:50:24,896
Where you been?

1022
01:50:26,876 --> 01:50:28,400
Here and there.

1023
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:34,208
I left word for you
with Steve at the ranch.

1024
01:50:35,117 --> 01:50:38,484
And you must've got those
notes I left at your place.

1025
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:45,089
Looks like I got the message,
in any case.

1026
01:50:47,330 --> 01:50:48,422
Carl?

1027
01:50:50,266 --> 01:50:52,234
Yeah, Carl's nice.

1028
01:50:53,002 --> 01:50:54,492
He even talks.

1029
01:50:57,706 --> 01:50:59,173
Good for you.

1030
01:51:01,543 --> 01:51:02,635
Yeah.

1031
01:51:05,647 --> 01:51:07,046
Good for me.

1032
01:51:13,488 --> 01:51:15,786
I don't get you,
Ennis Del Mar.

1033
01:51:21,129 --> 01:51:22,460
I'm sorry.

1034
01:51:30,939 --> 01:51:33,464
I was probably
no fun anyways, was I?

1035
01:51:36,945 --> 01:51:39,880
Ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.

1036
01:52:22,623 --> 01:52:26,286
<i>Hello.
Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.</i>

1037
01:52:29,597 --> 01:52:31,224
Who? Who is this?

1038
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,598
Ennis Del Mar.
I'm an old buddy of Jack's.

1039
01:52:36,704 --> 01:52:38,797
<i>Jack used to mention you.</i>

1040
01:52:39,173 --> 01:52:42,870
You're the fishing buddy
or the hunting buddy,
I know that.

1041
01:52:43,944 --> 01:52:45,707
Would have let you know
what happened...

1042
01:52:45,779 --> 01:52:48,304
but I wasn't sure
about your name or address.

1043
01:52:48,382 --> 01:52:51,317
Jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.

1044
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:56,155
That's why I'm callin',
to see what happened.

1045
01:52:58,158 --> 01:52:59,682
Oh, yeah.

1046
01:53:02,129 --> 01:53:05,064
Jack was pumpin' up a flat
on the truck...

1047
01:53:05,165 --> 01:53:07,895
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.

1048
01:53:08,035 --> 01:53:10,936
The rim of the tire slammed
into his face...

1049
01:53:11,138 --> 01:53:15,040
broke his nose and jaw
and knocked him unconscious
on his back.

1050
01:53:16,309 --> 01:53:19,767
<i>By the time somebody
come along, he'd drowned
in his own blood.</i>

1051
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,871
<i>He was only 39 years old.</i>

1052
01:53:27,487 --> 01:53:29,921
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1053
01:53:31,157 --> 01:53:32,385
<i>Hello.</i>

1054
01:53:36,029 --> 01:53:38,020
Was he buried down there?

1055
01:53:38,765 --> 01:53:40,198
We put a stone up.

1056
01:53:40,667 --> 01:53:42,692
He was cremated,
like he wanted.

1057
01:53:42,769 --> 01:53:47,035
Half his ashes was
interred here, the rest was
sent up with his folks.

1058
01:53:48,307 --> 01:53:52,334
He use to say he wanted
his ashes scattered
on Brokeback Mountain...

1059
01:53:52,412 --> 01:53:54,812
<i>but I wasn't sure
where that was.</i>

1060
01:53:55,181 --> 01:53:58,947
<i>I thought
Brokeback Mountain might be
around where he grew up.</i>

1061
01:53:59,018 --> 01:54:00,315
<i>Knowing Jack...</i>

1062
01:54:00,386 --> 01:54:02,650
it might be some
pretend place...

1063
01:54:02,722 --> 01:54:05,919
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.

1064
01:54:08,895 --> 01:54:10,328
No, ma'am...

1065
01:54:11,397 --> 01:54:14,525
we was herdin' sheep
on Brokeback one summer...

1066
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,567
<i>back in '63.</i>

1067
01:54:26,011 --> 01:54:28,707
Well, he said
it was his favorite place.

1068
01:54:30,082 --> 01:54:33,279
I thought he meant to
get drunk. He drank a lot.

1069
01:54:36,488 --> 01:54:39,355
Is his folks still up
in Lightning Flat?

1070
01:54:40,025 --> 01:54:42,721
<i>They'll be there
till the day they die.</i>

1071
01:54:47,766 --> 01:54:49,734
Thank you for your time.

1072
01:54:50,602 --> 01:54:52,194
<i>I sure am sorry.</i>

1073
01:54:53,438 --> 01:54:55,201
<i>We was good friends.</i>

1074
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:04,610
Get in touch with his folks.

1075
01:55:04,683 --> 01:55:08,483
I suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.

1076
01:55:10,322 --> 01:55:12,290
About the ashes, I mean.

1077
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:16,519
Want a cup of coffee,
don't you?
Piece of cherry cake?

1078
01:56:16,587 --> 01:56:18,145
Yes, ma'am,
I'll have a cup of coffee...

1079
01:56:18,222 --> 01:56:21,385
but I can't eat no cake
just now. Thank you.

1080
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:32,228
I feel awful bad about Jack.

1081
01:56:35,072 --> 01:56:36,403
Thank you.

1082
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:41,173
I can't begin to tell you
how bad I feel.

1083
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:46,080
I knew him a long time.

1084
01:56:48,985 --> 01:56:50,953
I come by to say that...

1085
01:56:51,621 --> 01:56:55,250
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on Brokeback...

1086
01:56:55,992 --> 01:56:58,426
like his wife said
he wanted to...

1087
01:56:59,195 --> 01:57:00,992
then I'll be happy to.

1088
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,829
I'll tell you what.

1089
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:09,303
I know where
Brokeback Mountain is.

1090
01:57:10,573 --> 01:57:14,703
Thought he was too goddamn
special to be buried
in the family plot.

1091
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,843
Jack used to say...

1092
01:57:20,683 --> 01:57:23,345
"Ennis Del Mar,"
he used to say.

1093
01:57:25,021 --> 01:57:28,286
"I'm gonna bring him up here
one of these days...

1094
01:57:28,925 --> 01:57:31,860
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."

1095
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,127
He had some
half-baked notion...

1096
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:37,792
the two of you was gonna
move up here...

1097
01:57:38,268 --> 01:57:39,860
build a cabin...

1098
01:57:40,904 --> 01:57:42,633
help run the place.

1099
01:57:46,209 --> 01:57:47,938
Then, this spring...

1100
01:57:49,545 --> 01:57:52,776
he got another fella
gonna come up here with him...

1101
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:57,646
build the place,
help run the ranch.

1102
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:03,091
Some ranch neighbor of his
from down in Texas.

1103
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,493
Gonna split up with his wife
and come back here...

1104
01:58:09,264 --> 01:58:10,629
so he says.

1105
01:58:12,467 --> 01:58:14,799
But, like most of
Jack's ideas...

1106
01:58:16,638 --> 01:58:18,367
never come to pass.

1107
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:25,378
I kept his room
like it was when he was a boy.

1108
01:58:26,782 --> 01:58:28,909
I think he appreciated that.

1109
01:58:33,455 --> 01:58:36,652
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

1110
01:58:42,331 --> 01:58:44,629
Yeah, I'd like that.
Thank you.

1111
02:01:45,811 --> 02:01:47,403
Tell you what.

1112
02:01:49,915 --> 02:01:53,646
We got a family plot.
He's goin' in it.

1113
02:01:56,321 --> 02:01:57,583
Yes, sir.

1114
02:02:00,192 --> 02:02:02,490
You come back
and see us again.

1115
02:02:16,808 --> 02:02:18,298
Thank you, ma'am.

1116
02:03:13,064 --> 02:03:14,998
##

1117
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:18,762
Hey there, Junior.
Hey, Daddy.

1118
02:03:27,612 --> 02:03:28,909
Come here.

1119
02:03:31,716 --> 02:03:33,183
Like the car?

1120
02:03:33,651 --> 02:03:36,449
Yeah. Is it yours?
It's Kurt's.

1121
02:03:37,188 --> 02:03:40,282
I thought you were
seein' Troy.
Troy?

1122
02:03:40,857 --> 02:03:43,087
Daddy, that was two years ago.

1123
02:03:44,527 --> 02:03:46,825
Troy still playing baseball?

1124
02:03:47,197 --> 02:03:50,394
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm seein' Kurt now.

1125
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,963
Well, what does Kurt do?
Works out in the oil fields.

1126
02:03:55,739 --> 02:03:59,072
So he's a roughneck, huh?
Yeah.

1127
02:03:59,909 --> 02:04:03,743
I guess you're 19,
you can do whatever you want.
Isn't that right?

1128
02:04:03,813 --> 02:04:05,110
Sure.

1129
02:04:13,723 --> 02:04:16,783
Daddy,
you need more furniture.
Yeah, well...

1130
02:04:17,427 --> 02:04:20,260
if you got nothin',
you don't need nothin'.

1131
02:04:24,534 --> 02:04:26,502
So, what's the occasion?

1132
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:32,430
Me and Kurt...

1133
02:04:33,743 --> 02:04:35,608
we're getting married.

1134
02:04:38,381 --> 02:04:39,780
Well...

1135
02:04:40,583 --> 02:04:43,108
So how long have you
known this guy for?

1136
02:04:43,286 --> 02:04:44,753
About a year.

1137
02:04:46,756 --> 02:04:50,123
Our wedding will be June 5,
at the Methodist church.

1138
02:04:50,426 --> 02:04:54,226
Jenny will be singing
and Monroe is gonna cater
the reception.

1139
02:05:00,703 --> 02:05:02,694
Now this Kurt fella...

1140
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,507
he loves you?

1141
02:05:09,278 --> 02:05:10,870
Yeah, Daddy.

1142
02:05:12,147 --> 02:05:13,546
He loves me.

1143
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:23,615
Was hopin' you'd be there.

1144
02:05:26,395 --> 02:05:27,521
Yeah.

1145
02:05:30,799 --> 02:05:35,293
I think I'm supposed to be
on a roundup down near
the Tetons.

1146
02:05:56,225 --> 02:05:57,817
You know what?

1147
02:05:59,161 --> 02:06:02,220
I reckon they can find
themselves a new cowboy.

1148
02:06:04,031 --> 02:06:07,558
My little girl,
getting married.

1149
02:06:21,182 --> 02:06:23,241
To Alma and Kurt.

1150
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:45,527
Jack, I swear...
