00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.220

‎Great work, Marinette!

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.180
‎Thanks to you,
‎Parisians can rest easy tonight!

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.340
‎I can't wait to do the same!

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.340
‎Good night, Master!

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.180
‎Marinette, you forgot to mention
‎the school field trip!

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.140
‎It's not like I'll be able to go anyway.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.340
‎What field trip?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.300
‎Oh! The whole class
‎is taking the train to London tomorrow

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.380
‎to see Big Ben.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.900
‎But if Hawk Moth creates a villain
‎while I'm away,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.220
‎Cat Noir won't be able
‎to capture the akuma on his own,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.820
‎which means I have to stay.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.780
‎Too bad.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.100
‎Tough life of a superhero.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.460
‎Besides, I'm too exhausted to go.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.580
‎Wait. The Horse Miraculous

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.340
‎can be used to teleport back to Paris
‎in the event of an akuma situation.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
‎That's so cool! Thank you, Master!

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.780
‎Ladybug definitely deserves a bit of fun,
‎just like all young people her age.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.540
‎ ‎See you tonight!

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.900
‎Hawk Moth struck last night,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.180
‎so there won't be another
‎akumatization today!

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.380
‎A day of vacation, finally!

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.780
‎Far from Paris and those annoying akumas!

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.060
‎Good idea, Adrien!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.180
‎Huh? Trash must be thrown
‎inside the trash can,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.860
‎or it's littering! He's getting a fine!

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.660
‎No, please don't, Dad!

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.060
‎You'll make me miss the train!

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.740
‎You know Chloé's relying on me!

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580
‎But the law is the law, sweetie!

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.620
‎But you're not on duty yet, are you?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.180
‎Right now, you don't have to be anything
‎but my dear, sweet daddy!

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.780
‎Hmm.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.140
‎-You backed right into me!
‎-No, you backed into me!

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.540
‎A frustrated police officer
‎with a passion for justice

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.980
‎who has his hands tied.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.460
‎The ideal prey.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.740
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise him.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.180
‎Another polluter?
‎That driver's getting a fine!

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.820
‎His vehicle does not meet city standards!

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.100
‎ ‎Daddy!

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.380
<i>‎Hurry up, Sabrina!</i>

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.380
<i>‎Hurry up, Sabrina!</i>

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.100
<i>‎Hurry up, Sabrina! Hurry up, Sabrina!</i>

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.980
‎What's happening?
‎I can feel the anger receding!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540
‎Fly faster, my akuma, catch up with him!

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.500
<i>‎You have no new emails.</i>

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.300
‎Who wants a sneak peek
‎of the Startrain's operator cab?

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.780
‎Thanks! This'll make an awesome exclusive
‎for my astronomy blog!

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.540
‎You've started another blog?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.740
‎I can't help it! Life is so interesting!

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.940
‎Hey! Isn't that Adrien?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.020
‎ <i>‎Affirmative, Marinette.</i>
<i>‎That is indeed Adrien Agreste!</i>

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.580
‎There was less than a 0.23% chance
‎his father would allow him to come!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.060
‎Alya, this trip is gonna be amazing!

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.540
‎Adrien? What are you doing here?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.340
‎I'm tired of my father keeping me
‎from going on field trips!

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.180
‎You're disobeying him, dude?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.180
‎Technically not,
‎because I didn't tell him about this one!

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.020
‎That's sneaky smart, my dude.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.780
‎ ‎The operator must hold this

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.020
‎throughout the journey
‎between Paris and London.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.700
‎It's called "the dead man's switch."

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.740
‎And if you take your hand off?

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.620
‎-The train would stop!
‎-Even for just a second?

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.900
‎It's a safety switch,
‎in case the operator feels faint.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.420
‎That's why I always love travelling
‎by train.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.540
‎Trains get from A to B
‎within a given time,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.260
‎they're programmed and safe.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.620
<i>‎Programming is the best!</i>

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.380
‎Have you always wanted to do this?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.060
‎I always wanted to be a driver, yes.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.340
‎But my true dream is to be an astronaut!

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.260
‎To drive a rocket across the universe!

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.820
‎I decided to operate trains
‎so I'd be here while Max was growing up.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.020
‎A space mission lasts several months.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.900
‎I could never be away
‎from my Maxypoo that long!

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.100
‎But now my son's a young man!

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.420
‎Mom is going to start astronaut training.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.700
‎That's amazing!

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.180
‎I'm expecting the results today.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.780
<i>‎You have no new emails.</i>

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.300
‎It's too early, Mom!
‎The official documents said 11:00 AM!

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.580
‎You'll get them during the train ride.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.980
‎If I pass the test,
‎this trip will be my last.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.980
‎Next time I drive,
‎I'll be manning the controls

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.100
‎of a space shuttle,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.020
‎taking the next space crew to the Moon!

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.100
‎You have an 89.7% chance of passing!

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.340
‎That still leaves
‎a 10.3% chance of failing.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.460
‎I believe in you. You're the best!

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.820
‎You're only going for the day.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.940
‎Why do you need a huge suitcase?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.660
‎I have to be prepared
‎for anything Chloé needs!

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.460
‎In case of a hair crisis,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.220
‎in case she wants
‎a cup of her favorite tea...

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.900
‎I'm proud of you, sweetie.
‎"To protect and serve",

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.620
‎that's our Raincomprix family motto!

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.420
<i>‎Hurry up, Sabrina! Hurry up, Sabrina!</i>

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.020
‎Chloé's waiting for me!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.220
‎See you tonight, Daddy!

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.900
‎All right, that's it!
‎You're getting a fine!

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.820
‎Argh! I can't feel
‎any negative emotions any more.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.740
‎What's gone wrong? Where's my akuma?

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.620
<i>‎Final boarding for train number 8065.</i>

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.180
<i>‎Platform number 23.</i>

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.900
‎Ah! Finally you're here!

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.060
‎You'll probably be hot in those clothes.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.220
‎May I remind you, Miss Bustier,
‎that it's always cold in London!

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.740
‎Don't worry. I've brought
‎an English weather survival kit!

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.980
‎But where are you two going?
‎Our car is this way!

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.460
‎It's all right.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.860
‎The mayor arranged for his daughter
‎to be in First Class!

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.740
‎I'm just taking her suitcase there.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.700
‎I'll be right back!

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.940
‎-You're still here?
‎-Oh! Sorry, Chloé!

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.220
‎ <i>‎Come back now!</i>

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.700
‎Do you need anything?

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.860
‎I want my seat completely reclined.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.340
‎Yes, of course, Chloé!

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.140
‎-Mask!
‎-Ooh!

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.340
‎It's Big Ben.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.860
‎-That was so embarrassing!
‎-You're too funny, girl!

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.500
‎But why are you so tired?
‎What were you doing all night?

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.820
‎I... oh... I tried to come up with a plan
‎to find a way to tell Adrien that...

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.340
‎Well, you know.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.420
‎You know what your problem is?
‎You make too many plans.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.140
‎Be yourself and go with the flow.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.780
<i>‎Hello! Would you like a beverage?</i>

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.180
<i>‎Hello! Would you like a beverage?</i>

‎-Apple juice!

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.980

<i>‎Hello?</i>

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.580
‎It's not programmed to chat, Markov!
‎It's just a service drone!

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.940
<i>‎What a shame!</i>

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.300
<i>‎You have no new emails.</i>

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.540
‎Would you mind swapping seats, Adrien?
‎I wanna chat with Nino!

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.540
‎Sure.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.100
‎<i>‎Lesson three.</i>

‎Rose!

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.820
‎Awesome!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.940
‎Hmm.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.660
‎Need something, Lila?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.140
‎Uh... actually, I get motion sickness,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.740
‎and Marinette
‎always has a solution to everything.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.700
‎I get it. But she's asleep right now,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.900
‎as you can see, and she's exhausted, so...

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.860
‎I can help you!
‎I have just what you need in my suitcase!

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.100
‎Thanks a million, Sabrina,
‎you're so sweet!

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.300
<i>‎You have no new emails.</i>

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.340
‎Awesome!

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.940
‎Well, how about that?
‎You happy now? You woke me up!

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.900
‎Oh, I'm so sorry, Chloé!

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.500
‎Well, now I'm awake,
‎I might as well have some tea!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.420
‎Of course, Chloé!
‎I'll take care of that right away!

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.420
‎-Calm down everyone!

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.700
‎I'm sure you all recognize me, of course.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.940
‎I'm Chloé Bourgeois!

‎I'm also... Queen Bee!

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.900
‎Whatever you do, don't panic!
‎But there's an akuma!

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.340
‎Everyone, get out of this car, right now!

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.820
‎I've lost contact.
‎My akuma's too far away.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.820
‎You sure it's really an akuma?

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.860
‎It looks more like a harmless butterfly!

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.900
‎Chlo... I mean, Queen Bee
‎knows what she's talking about, trust me!

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.700
‎What are you doing
‎in your swimming trunks?

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.540
‎Well, we're about to go under the sea!

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.620
‎Ugh! You are ridiculous, Kim!

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.100
‎Utterly ridiculous!

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.660
‎-I'm scared!
‎-Don't worry, Nicole!

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.380
‎If it were a real akuma,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.260
‎there'd already be a supervillain
‎on the train!

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.780
‎Daddy, do you think Ladybug will come?

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.380
‎ ‎Of course not!

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.420
‎I'm sure there isn't an akuma on board!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.660
‎It's probably a prank.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.020
‎Your daddy doesn't have a clue.
‎It really is an akuma!

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.700
‎It's definitely an akuma!

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.780
‎I should know.
‎I was once akumatized myself!

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.180
‎There's zero risk to anyone now anyway,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.860
‎since the amazing Queen Bee
‎has shut the car doors,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.980
‎taking the akuma prisoner!

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.140
‎Nothing there!

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.540
‎Probably just Chloé
‎needing some attention again.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.420
‎Come on, let's head back to our seats!

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.580
<i>‎You have no new emails.</i>

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.460
‎That's impossible. I can't have failed.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.620
‎I'll never be an astronaut.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.940
‎Who cares about the results
‎of that stupid exam?

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.020
‎I can become an astronaut,
‎right here and now.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.820
<i>‎Ladies and gentlemen, I am Startrain.</i>

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.700
<i>‎You all get to live my dream with me.</i>

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.260
<i>‎Shoot off the rails</i>
<i>‎and fly off in a rocket</i>

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.820
<i>‎to explore not just the Moon,</i>
<i>‎but the entire universe!</i>

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.380
‎- Mom?
<i>‎-Fasten your seatbelts, we have liftoff!</i>

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.300
‎See? I was right to change
‎into my swimming trunks!

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.540
‎This... is... spacy!

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.140
‎I don't think Ladybug and Cat Noir
‎can save us!

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.300
‎Uh, maybe we can persuade
‎your mom to turn back, Max?

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.700
‎Sir, you should take a look at this.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.780
<i>‎An observation satellite took</i>
<i>‎these amazing photos earlier.</i>

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.940
‎So, that's why I lost touch with my akuma.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.500
‎It's too far out of range.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.780
‎There's another problem.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.660
‎Adrien's class is on the train,
‎and your son is on the passenger list!

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.620
‎He's up in space,
‎and there's nothing I can do.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.820
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir will rescue him.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.660
‎Hoping that my enemies will save my son...

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.060
‎How ironic!

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.700
‎-Mom!
‎- <i>‎Max!</i>

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.100
<i>‎You see this? I'm Startrain!</i>

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.300
‎You must take us back to Earth!

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.020
‎-You can go into space later!
‎- <i>‎W</i><i>‎hy?</i>

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.740
<i>‎Now I have a 100% chance</i>
<i>‎of travelling the universe!</i>

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.540
<i>‎And I get to take you with me, too!</i>
<i>‎Isn't this fantastic?</i>

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.460
‎We must get to the cabin
‎to take control of the train,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.500
‎and drive it back home.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.740
‎And, how do you plan
‎to take down the villain?

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.740
‎No one here has any superpowers!

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.620
‎No, but you do have a superheroine
‎with you!

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.380
‎We have two things in our favor,
‎the element of surprise

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.900
‎and the fact there are a lot of us!

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.940
‎Good point!

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.100
‎Where do you think you're going?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.260
<i>‎Don't you want to sit back and relax?</i>

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.020
<i>‎I don't want anyone to get hurt.</i>

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.340
<i>‎So, stay in your seats and enjoy the view!</i>

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.180
‎No peace for Ladybug, obviously!

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.380
‎Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.100
‎Ladybug? But... how did you get here?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.660
‎Teleportation,
‎courtesy of the Horse Miraculous. And you?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.260
‎I was on the train! Lucky, huh?

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.980
‎Just like they say about black cats!

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.860
‎No one must know you were a passenger!

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.740
‎They are hundreds of people on the train!

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.540
‎-I'm just a cat in a haystack!
‎-I guess you're right.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.380
‎Let's go and stop Startrain!

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.020
‎Why not use the Horse Miraculous
‎to teleport us back to Earth?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.540
‎That would be pointless.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.660
‎She could make the train take off again.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.340
‎We must capture the akuma first.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.700
‎But if we do it
‎while the train's in space,

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.540
‎we'll have no air to breathe!

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.980
‎Which is why we must reach Startrain,
‎then capture the akuma

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.660
‎and teleport back to Earth
‎at the same time.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.700
‎ ‎Ladybug? Cat Noir?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.580
‎Have you been aboard the whole time?

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.660
‎Of course not!

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.900
‎We teleported here using a Miraculous!

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.460
‎We're handling this.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.460
‎Gather everyone at the back of the train.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.820
‎Of course! Everyone,
‎please follow me to the back of the train!

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.260
‎I hope you remembered to bring
<i>‎my</i><i>‎ Miraculous!</i>

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.060
‎Uh... actually...

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.620
‎We didn't know you were going to be here,
‎otherwise, we would've, for sure!

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.100
‎Reinforced Plexiglas!

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.980
‎Unbreakable. Except for my...

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.220
‎-Cata--
‎-No, wait! We might need it when

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.580
‎we're face-to-face with Startrain.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.780
‎ ‎Max!

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.420
‎Looks like we have some intruders.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.740
‎<i>‎ You'd better</i>
<i>‎give up if you don't want to fly</i>

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.940
<i>‎too close to the sun!</i>

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.220
‎-Got it!
‎-Well done!

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.180
‎Max, Markov, we need you with us
‎to open the next door!

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.420
‎-But isn't it too dangerous?
‎-We'll protect you!

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.940
‎-What's happening?
‎-Gotta be ready for anything.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.420
‎Lucky charm!

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.980
‎I can't find any...

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.420
<i>‎Max, my circuits are overheating!</i>

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.620
‎What are we gonna do?
‎Markov's having a meltdown!

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.340
‎You must finish the job,
‎or we'll all toast inside this car!

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.580
‎She wasn't kidding!

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.260
‎It feels like we're really close
‎to the sun!

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.020
‎Whoo! We almost got cooked in there!

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.860
<i>‎I think we could classify this</i>
<i>‎as a Code Red situation!</i>

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.900
‎Good job! You make an awesome pair too,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.900
‎like me and milady!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.980
‎Markov, check the oxygen level
‎in the next car!

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.980
<i>‎-It's decreasing quickly!</i>
‎-Startrain is creating a void!

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.500
‎The temperature inside
‎will soon be close to absolute zero!

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.060
‎Max won't be able to hold on
‎in these conditions without superpowers!

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.900
‎Max Kanté,
‎here's the Miraculous of the Horse,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.860
‎which grants the power of teleportation.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.700
‎You will use it for the greater good.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.580
‎Once the job is done,
‎you will return the Miraculous to me.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.740
‎Can I trust you?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.700
‎You can count on me 100%, Ladybug.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.700
‎I'll do everything I can
‎to save my friends

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.420
‎and my mom!

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.180
‎Oh, to whom do I have
‎the pleasure of speaking?

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.700
‎-Uh... hello, my name's Max!
‎-Are you glorious and famous?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.780
‎Kalkki, we don't have time for that.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.460
‎Max is perfect for the job, trust me!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.860
‎We're going to the last car,
‎to the driver's cab.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.500
‎-That's where Startrain is.
‎-We have to be in sync!

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.260
‎While I handle Startrain
‎and Cat Noir uses his Cataclysm,

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.260
‎we need you, Max,
‎to teleport the train back to Earth

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.020
‎so I can summon up my Miraculous Ladybug,

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.380
‎-so everything gets fixed!
‎-Got it!

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.300
‎All you need to say is,
‎"Kalkki, full gallop!"

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.780
‎Kalkki, full gallop!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.900
‎ ‎I was expecting you,
‎my dear super-passengers!

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.140
‎You can't stop me from
‎living out my galactic dream!

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.700
‎I shall conquer the universe!

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.900
<i>‎My little drones...</i>

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.260
<i>‎Attack!</i>

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.380
<i>‎I'm getting cold!</i>

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.740
‎Cataclysm!

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.940
‎Pegasus!

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.540
‎Voyage!

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.620
‎I'm sorry. Looks like I got
‎the spatial coordinates wrong!

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.300
‎I heard your class was supposed
‎to be visiting Big Ben.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.900
‎ ‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.860
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.660
‎ ‎Pound it!

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.500
‎Thank you, Max.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.980
‎Children, please, all aboard!
‎Back to London!

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.580
<i>‎You have one new email.</i>

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.500
‎-Huh?
‎- ‎Hey, Mom!

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.900
‎I passed!

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.340
‎I told you, Mom! You're the best!
‎That's 100% certain!

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.300
‎I'm getting the feeling
‎that was your first and last field trip.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.580
‎That's OK. At least I got to see Big Ben.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.180
‎Sure did!
‎No one's seen it as close up as we did!

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.900
‎Too bad we got separated at the end!

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.060
‎We'll go together some day! See ya.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.460
‎Oh, no! Poor Adrien!
‎This trip was a total disaster!

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.900
‎A total disaster, really?
