1
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,791
I never get to know how you are

2
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,416
The news died down after we had parted

3
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:28,291
You have someone else in my place.

4
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,083
Is she good to you?

5
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:38,541
Do I appear in your dreams?

6
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,958
Or have you forgotten everything?

7
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,291
Do you still miss me

8
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:51,083
When you are alone?

9
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,916
Since you left

10
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,250
Your life seems to have changed

11
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:24,333
I still feel lonely and sad

12
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,916
Only loneliness was left in me

13
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:33,708
I still miss the old times

14
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,916
When there was only us

15
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,291
But there's only emptiness
And loneliness now

16
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:51,250
Do you know that I miss you?

17
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,833
I miss you every time

18
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:03,083
I'm alone

19
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:58,083
Since you left

20
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,500
Your life seems to have changed

21
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:07,083
I still feel lonely and sad

22
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:11,916
Only loneliness was left in me

23
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,708
I still miss the old times

24
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,083
When there were only us

25
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,833
But there's only emptiness
And loneliness now

26
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:33,958
Do you know that I miss you?

27
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,083
I miss you every time

28
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:46,125
I'm alone

29
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,333
Excuse me. Can I have a cigarette--

30
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,875
Taweesuk Alley, please.

31
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,958
Ninety-five baht.

32
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,583
Here you go.

33
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,125
Should we cook for real?

34
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,416
Hey, are we allowed to play with fire?

35
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,666
I don't know.

36
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,666
I'll ask Mom.

37
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,458
What about others?

38
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,291
It's all right. I'll join later.

39
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,500
Honey.

40
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,500
Honey.

41
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,458
Are you all right?

42
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,291
Yes, I'm all right.

43
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,791
Do you have a session today?

44
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,083
Of course.

45
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,958
Will you finish late?

46
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,416
Yes, I have to stay late to grade papers.

47
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,833
Again?

48
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,541
Come on, I'll try to find some time
next week.

49
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,750
I'm not asking for my own sake.

50
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,125
You're working too hard

51
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,250
that we barely have the room to keep
all the money now.

52
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,083
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

53
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,416
Miss,

54
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,416
your daughter is already too old
to have an imaginary friend.

55
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,000
I think she should receive a full therapy
at the hospital.

56
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,125
I'll show you something.

57
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,791
Can you tell me about Toto?

58
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,625
I can't

59
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,166
because

60
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,416
Toto doesn't want me to.

61
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,125
Why? Is it because Toto doesn't like
your mom?

62
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,708
She's not here right now.

63
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,416
You must not tell anybody, okay?

64
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,875
Toto has buried

65
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,666
Pug in the ground,

66
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,375
because he doesn't want me

67
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,791
to get thrown out of the house.

68
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,875
When Pug grows up,

69
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,125
it would be as if

70
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,708
Mom has two children,

71
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,875
and she will love Pug more than me.

72
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,125
Please, miss.

73
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,041
Please do something
before it's more than just a pet.

74
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,958
Hello, honey.

75
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,958
I still can't find my wallet.

76
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,625
You really haven't seen it anywhere,
right?

77
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,958
No.

78
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh, you went back to the office yesterday,
didn't you?

79
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,458
You might have left it at the hospital.

80
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,166
Oh, right.

81
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,791
I'll go back to look for it again.

82
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,583
-You're forgetful these days.
-Doctor.

83
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,458
I'm hanging up.
I have to go back to work now.

84
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,041
Professor, what are you looking for?

85
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,666
It's my wallet.

86
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,375
I have no idea where I left it.

87
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,250
Well...

88
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,416
When was the last time you saw it?

89
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,958
Never mind.

90
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,875
So, are the students ready?

91
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, they are.

92
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,458
Dr. Jib.

93
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,500
Please dress properly. Your shirt is out.

94
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,958
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,041
The part right here,

96
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,083
please freeze it in another room.

97
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,375
Oh, very good.
Have you located the bicep tendon?

98
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,458
Is it around here?

99
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,708
Yes, look for it, so you can answer
Professor Suthee when he comes.

100
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,958
Are you doing it right?

101
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:25,541
Of course, I strictly followed
all the procedures.

102
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,333
Look, here's the flexor
that Professor Suthee talked about.

103
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,041
-It's right here.
-Where?

104
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,916
-You idiot!
-You guys are shrieking like scaredy-cats.

105
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,541
Hey, Dr. Jib.

106
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,208
I have taught you to become
a medical professor.

107
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,708
I didn't teach you to become friends
with those students.

108
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,458
What's his name?

109
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,541
His name is Siwapong, sir.

110
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,833
Siwapong.

111
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,250
Tell him

112
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,916
I have to deduct 30 points from him

113
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,291
for acting inappropriately
as a medical student.

114
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,500
For you,

115
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,375
if you still can't control your students,

116
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,166
I can't approve your status
as a medical professor.

117
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,875
How's Usa doing?

118
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,000
What?

119
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,041
I'm talking about Usa.

120
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,666
We haven't seen each other in ages.

121
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,875
Well, she's fine.

122
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,416
By the way, what do we do

123
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,041
about Professor Dararai?

124
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,250
Sir.

125
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,458
Sir.

126
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,458
I'm talking about Professor Dararai.

127
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,208
Well...

128
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,125
The students want her signature

129
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,000
before they withdraw from her class.

130
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,291
Just leave it like that.
I'll take care of it.

131
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,541
You can go now.

132
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,291
Excuse me, then.

133
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,041
Let me know when you have to be
on duty at night.

134
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,333
-Aey.
-What?

135
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,375
Let me know when you have to be
on duty at night.

136
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,833
Why?

137
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,875
It's so that I can find some company.

138
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,791
Are you scared?

139
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,541
It's pretty spooky around here,
but you'll get used to it soon.

140
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,208
Chon.

141
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,958
Did you see something?

142
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,291
Hey.

143
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,083
Don't do this.

144
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,833
Really, someone got murdered
near the main road last week.

145
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,916
I don't believe you.

146
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,875
-How is that funny?
-You're such a chicken.

147
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,208
So what?

148
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,916
You're a sissy.

149
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,166
-I'll put it right here.
-Okay.

150
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,083
Hey.

151
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,208
I wanted to ask you since you came in.

152
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,375
-What is it?
-Whose car is that?

153
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,666
It's the owner's car.

154
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,791
He let you use the car?

155
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,958
Yes.

156
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,166
I hardly use it.

157
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,125
He's very kind.

158
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,958
I want to meet him in person.

159
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,291
When is he coming again?

160
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,041
He rarely comes.

161
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,625
He's been busy lately.

162
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,541
Have you found a place to stay?

163
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,083
I have been here for just two days.

164
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,125
I also haven't unpacked my boxes yet,
and you already want me to leave?

165
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,041
No, I'm just afraid that if he shows up,
I wouldn't know what to tell him.

166
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,375
Do you have money?

167
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,541
Yes, I do.

168
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,833
Are you sure?

169
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,375
Sure, I'm fine.

170
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,541
-Chon.
-Yes?

171
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,708
Are you thinking straight these days?

172
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,125
What do you mean?

173
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,958
No sane person would put a rice cooker
in a fridge. Take it out.

174
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,875
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

175
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,208
Are you all right?

176
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,291
I'm fine.

177
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm just absent-minded.

178
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,250
Do you need help with anything else?

179
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,958
Remove the shell of the prawns
and clean them.

180
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,708
Why don't you do it yourself?

181
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,833
I don't want to commit a sin.

182
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,583
Hey, aren't you afraid I'd commit a sin?

183
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,541
You're already a big sinner.

184
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,708
Just do it and stop complaining.

185
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,208
Okay.

186
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,208
Let me ask you a serious question.

187
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,166
What now?

188
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,708
Do bears really eat bees?

189
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,291
I have no idea.

190
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,083
Don't they teach you that
in medical school?

191
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,583
Do they really eat bees?

192
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,791
-Come on, I really want to know.
-Hey.

193
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,208
Hey, Chon.

194
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,458
If you don't stop talking,

195
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,166
I'll eat you instead.

196
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,000
-So, you don't want the prawns anymore?
-No!

197
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,708
Are you done yet?

198
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,625
Hey, Chon!

199
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,958
What did you do, Chon?

200
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,791
-That hurts!
-Be quiet. You're crying like a baby.

201
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,916
What are you looking for?

202
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
I'm looking for a needle and a thread.

203
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:25,791
A needle?

204
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,541
Why do you need it?
Are you going to stitch it up yourself?

205
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,666
Yes.

206
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:34,500
No! Look at the wound!
Go and get a real doctor to treat me!

207
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,916
I told you not to shout.

208
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,125
I'm a doctor. Can't you trust me?

209
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,375
Also, stop talking.

210
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,666
Stay here. I'll find a needle
and a thread.

211
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,833
Hey, if somebody finds out,
don't tell them you're with me.

212
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,250
Got it?

213
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,333
Why are you making that face?
"I understand."

214
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,333
Very well.

215
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,083
What are you doing here by yourself?

216
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,375
Oh, what happened to your hand?

217
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,250
Come, let me look at it.

218
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,458
Wow, it's a really deep cut.

219
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,416
Why are you treating it yourself here?

220
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:35,958
Well...

221
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,458
I...

222
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,541
Do you cook your own meal?

223
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,916
Oh, yes.

224
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,166
I was slicing a prawn.

225
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,500
Maybe it wasn't completely dead,
so it took revenge.

226
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,541
Okay.

227
00:24:58,708 --> 00:24:59,750
I...

228
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,416
Tell me honestly.

229
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:03,458
So,

230
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,625
which drugs are you on?

231
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,125
Doctor.

232
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,125
I'm not on drugs.

233
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,666
If you don't believe me,
you can test my urine.

234
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,125
My urine, my blood, my hair, anything.
I'm clean. I'm not on drugs.

235
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,958
Excuse me.

236
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,250
Please look at the light.

237
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:57,958
How many fingers do you see?

238
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,583
One.

239
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,166
Three, maybe.

240
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:10,916
Please do what I tell you.

241
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,958
Touch the tip of your nose,

242
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:18,000
and then touch my index finger.
Do it back and forth.

243
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,125
-Like this?
-Yes.

244
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,625
Yes, and touch my finger.

245
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,666
Yes.

246
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,833
-And?
-Touch your nose, back and forth.

247
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,458
Touch here.

248
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,333
Faster, please.

249
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,208
Do you have any other symptoms,

250
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,541
such as insomnia

251
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,708
or hearing things?

252
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,875
I don't remember.

253
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,958
Can you remember how many fingers
I just showed you?

254
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:57,041
Listen, Doc. I was cut by a knife.
I don't think that has anything to do

255
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,375
with counting your fingers
and touching my nose.

256
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,750
Then, please look at your name and tell me
if it's spelled correctly.

257
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,666
CHONLASIT

258
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,833
It's already correct.

259
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,208
Chonlasit.

260
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,333
Please try to talk to this person.

261
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,125
She might be able to help you.

262
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,000
Who's this?

263
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,125
She's a psychiatrist.

264
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,375
I got cut by a knife, Doc.

265
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,708
-Dr. Jib.
-Wait up.

266
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,666
-They need you immediately at ER1.
-Excuse me.

267
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,791
Wait up.

268
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:19,958
Excuse me.

269
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,333
Please give me a second.

270
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,833
-Please let us through.
-Excuse us.

271
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,958
Please let us through.
It's an emergency case.

272
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,458
This way please, Doctor.

273
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,083
Hang in there.

274
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,333
Hey, why did you have to be
so secretive back there?

275
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,916
Aren't you a medical student?

276
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,041
I don't think they would mind you

277
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,541
borrowing their equipment.

278
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,541
Hey.

279
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:46,333
I could be expelled
for stealing a government's property.

280
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,041
Would you be able to look after me
if I get kicked out?

281
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,375
You're exaggerating.

282
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,000
Hey.

283
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,583
Are you that rich?

284
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,916
I helped you, and you're complaining.

285
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,375
"Usa."

286
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,583
Which Usa is it?

287
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,416
A psychiatrist.

288
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,625
-A doctor who treats psychopaths.
-What?

289
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:24,708
That psychopathic doctor referred me
to a psychiatrist for a knife cut.

290
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,875
I bet he'd send his wife to a dentist
if she were giving birth.

291
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,458
Chon.

292
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,166
Have you been sleeping well?

293
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,416
I...

294
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,750
have been having nightmares.

295
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,375
What are those nightmares about?

296
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,458
Chon.

297
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,958
I think you really need treatment.

298
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,000
Are you also saying I'm crazy?

299
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,458
I just want you to take care of yourself.

300
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,791
If something happens to you,

301
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,791
I'll have no one left.

302
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,583
We only have each other, Chon.

303
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,625
Chon!

304
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,666
Chon!

305
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:53,916
Let go!

306
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,125
Chon!

307
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,958
What the hell is wrong with you?

308
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,125
Aey.

309
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,333
I don't know.

310
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,541
I'm sorry.

311
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:27,791
See the doctor tomorrow.
Please, I beg you!

312
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,541
I'll soon be strangled to death
if you don't!

313
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,083
DR. CHOOKIET WEERASAKKUL
INTERNAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

314
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:51,333
USA 091-8999065

315
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,250
I'm borrowing this for now.

316
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,041
I'll give it back.

317
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,000
DR. USA

318
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,833
I really want to know

319
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,583
who Chonlasit is.

320
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,916
Let's just say it's related

321
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,250
to Professor Suthee's job.

322
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,583
For the details--

323
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,250
Hey, Jib. I'm hanging up. He's here.

324
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,416
Hello.

325
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,666
Are you Dr. Usa?

326
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,625
Yes.

327
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,208
Please take a seat.

328
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,916
Have some water first.

329
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,750
Thank you.

330
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,125
Put it down first.

331
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,958
Well, Mr. Chonlasit.

332
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,750
Is there anything I can do for you?

333
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,708
Well, Dr. Usa.

334
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,958
I've been having nightmares
quite often lately.

335
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,708
What did you see?

336
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,541
I saw a murder.

337
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,916
I don't know who was killing whom,

338
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,125
but I saw the scene over and over.

339
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,750
-The victim was a woman.
-Over and over.

340
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,208
Her body was hacked to pieces.

341
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,833
-It seems real.
-I have no idea

342
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,666
how those images got into my head.

343
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,583
-The victim was a woman.
-But,

344
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,041
as days go by,

345
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,875
they keep coming back

346
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:31,916
over and over

347
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,250
until they seem real

348
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,625
-like they weren't dreams at all.
-You...

349
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,541
Are you going to say I'm crazy?

350
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,333
What does it feel like
when you're spaced out?

351
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,041
Everything was blank,

352
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,375
as if I...

353
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,500
I were sleepwalking,

354
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,291
but I was still conscious.

355
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:58,958
It's as if the dead woman

356
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,083
that I saw in my dream

357
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,166
wanted me to do something.

358
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,375
Why do you think that way?

359
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,125
I'm not sure.

360
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,708
You wouldn't want your wife
to see these photos, right?

361
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,500
I'm Dararai.

362
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,333
Find me.

363
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,083
She told me to find her.

364
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,208
Find who?

365
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,625
Why are you taking my picture?

366
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,666
Are you done?

367
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:13,958
Yes, I'm done.

368
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,958
What about the test result?

369
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,458
I have to analyze it first,
then I'll call to make an appointment.

370
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,291
I'm leaving, then.

371
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:25,666
Bye.

372
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,291
-Bye.
-Bye.

373
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,791
DARARAI

374
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,916
I don't think I'm going back again.

375
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:54,958
Why not?

376
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,125
It's useless.

377
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,458
Did she prescribe any medication?

378
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,333
No, there's no medication nor treatment.

379
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,416
Nothing.

380
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,541
You have to take some rest.

381
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,458
I don't think you understand.

382
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,375
He told me he's an engineering student
at Ratanaraj University.

383
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,333
Did he give you the same information

384
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:40,708
when you met him?

385
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,541
I didn't get into that much details

386
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,416
about his personal history.

387
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,750
There's another interesting point.

388
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,791
During the session, he mentioned a name.

389
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,291
What name?

390
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,083
Dararai.

391
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,416
Dararai, does it ring a bell?

392
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,041
No, it doesn't.

393
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,708
Why are you asking me?

394
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,375
Well, he mentioned this name
and your university,

395
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,208
so I thought you might know something.

396
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,541
Hello, Dr. Jib.

397
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,125
Just a second.

398
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,625
Usa, I have to go.

399
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,875
I need to hang up.

400
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,625
The nurse came to get me.

401
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,875
DARARAI RATANARAJ UNIVERSITY

402
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,458
RATANARAJ UNIVERSITY

403
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,125
GUEST LECTURER
DR. DARARAI SUWAMONGKOL

404
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,291
Hey.

405
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,375
I'm going to bed now.

406
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,458
By the way, don't stay up too late.

407
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,916
Okay, Mom.

408
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,500
Who are you calling mom?

409
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:01,458
DR. DARARAI SUWAMONGKOL

410
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:36,625
Chon!

411
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:47,958
Chon!

412
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,875
What are you doing?

413
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,625
What are you looking for?

414
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:04,958
Dararai.

415
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:08,041
Faculty of Medicine.

416
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,083
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

417
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,916
I would like to see
Professor Dararai Suwamongkol.

418
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:31,958
A moment, please.

419
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,958
Nok, another one is here
to see Professor Dararai.

420
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,375
Are you the teaching assistant
of Professor Dararai?

421
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,416
Yes.

422
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,000
May I have a word with you?

423
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,458
May I ask who you are?

424
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:49,166
I'm Usa Pattanaphong.

425
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,541
Pattanaphong...

426
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,250
What are you looking for?

427
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,791
How are you going to find it
if it's this dark?

428
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,583
Do you feel

429
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,291
that this cabinet is at the wrong place?

430
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,750
It's just like

431
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,916
it's supposed to be somewhere else.

432
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,416
It struck me since the first day.

433
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,041
So?

434
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,250
Hey.

435
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,541
What are you doing?

436
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,833
I'm trying to move it.
There might be something behind it.

437
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,416
Chon.

438
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,458
This isn't our house.

439
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,458
Hey.

440
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,916
Tell me honestly.

441
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:46,458
What if the story about
this Dararai person is

442
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,333
something you just made up
in your own head?

443
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,958
Where are you going?

444
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,458
I'm going to prove

445
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:01,791
that she's not just my imagination.

446
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,416
Which class did she teach?

447
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,833
She was our lecturer
on Therapeutic Hypnosis.

448
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,583
By the way, please keep this to yourself.

449
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:22,166
The students called her The Witch.

450
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:24,708
There are so many stories about her.

451
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,000
For example, this room.

452
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,000
On that day, I was her TA.

453
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,958
When I think about it,

454
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,208
it gives me the creeps.

455
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,625
This kind of memory is called

456
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:44,041
unconscious memory.

457
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:49,208
It is a remnant of a traumatic incident
that leaves a strong impact on the mind.

458
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,916
Even though we want to forget it,

459
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,416
or have already forgotten,

460
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,083
we can wake it up anytime.

461
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,125
Don't you get it?

462
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,250
I already told you.

463
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,041
Excuse me, please hang up first.
The class is still ongoing.

464
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,458
I'm hanging up.

465
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,791
I still have class.

466
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,583
I'm really in class.

467
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,625
Okay, I'll call you back.

468
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:28,833
The benefit of exploring this memory is

469
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,041
to locate the course of various illnesses,

470
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,458
either mental

471
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,041
or physical illness.

472
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:41,041
Physical illnesses that
were caused by mental illnesses...

473
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,708
Don't answer it yet.

474
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,291
Can you tell me

475
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,958
what you understand
about unconscious memory?

476
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,708
Well,

477
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,583
it's the kind of memory that...

478
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,958
I'm sorry, professor.

479
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,250
I didn't catch it just now.

480
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,750
Could you please explain it again?

481
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,333
Sure.

482
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,291
Let me answer the call first.

483
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,916
No, let it continue ringing.

484
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,250
How are we supposed to study then?

485
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,375
The whole class is waiting.

486
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,208
It's disturbing others.

487
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,541
Can you tell me

488
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:44,416
what the most embarrassing moment
of your life was?

489
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,208
What are you saying?

490
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,083
It doesn't make any sense.

491
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:56,166
Didn't your parents ever teach you
any social manners?

492
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,250
My parents have nothing to do with this.

493
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,666
FOUR MISSED CALLS

494
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:35,708
When was it?

495
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,541
I was eight.

496
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,583
The belt...

497
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,041
Who was it?

498
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,291
My dad.

499
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,166
Dad, please don't hit me.

500
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:09,708
Dad!

501
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:12,541
-Please, let me go!
-Professor, that's enough!

502
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,875
Please, don't hit me.

503
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,041
Do all of you understand

504
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:04,666
the meaning

505
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:06,583
of unconscious memory now?

506
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,666
This is it.

507
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,666
One by one, the students dropped out
of her class.

508
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,250
The professor herself also disappeared.

509
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,791
People always come to ask me for her,

510
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,583
but I really don't have a clue
of her whereabouts.

511
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,125
Why don't you go through her profile?

512
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,666
Well, she was a guest lecturer,

513
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,708
so we only have her name,
but not her details.

514
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:40,375
Why don't you ask the person
who recommended her to teach here?

515
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:42,958
Well...

516
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:46,041
It's a little complicated.

517
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:47,750
Well.

518
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,666
Don't get mad at me if I tell you this.

519
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,916
Why?

520
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,500
It's because I'm telling you

521
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,583
that Professor Suthee was the one

522
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,541
who got her the job.

523
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:28,875
Excuse me.

524
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,083
-Yes.
-Is Professor Dararai here?

525
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,375
Nok, he's looking for...

526
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:40,208
I'm afraid she's not here.

527
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:46,083
So, there's a professor
called Dararai here, right?

528
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:47,958
Yes.

529
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:10,375
May.

530
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:13,208
Finish your vegetables
and brush your teeth.

531
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,875
May!

532
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,875
Stop playing and brush your teeth!

533
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,958
Please listen when I tell you what to do.

534
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:58,083
May, let's go and brush your teeth.

535
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,333
Today, I went to
the Department of Psychology.

536
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,958
Sweetie, go on.
I'll catch up with you later.

537
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,708
I was looking for some information

538
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,666
for a case I'm working on.

539
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:21,916
Really?

540
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,541
There were people asking for you.

541
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:27,000
Who?

542
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:29,791
There were many.

543
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,416
There were professors
and a faculty member.

544
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,708
A faculty member?

545
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:41,833
The one named Nok. Do you remember her?

546
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,791
Hey, this is the concert we went to
the other day.

547
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:55,666
Yes.

548
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:57,833
You left us halfway through.

549
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,166
May and I had to come back alone.

550
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,083
Why did you have to go inside?
I should be going home now.

551
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,958
Where did he go?

552
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,375
I'm always in trouble.

553
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:14,333
You have really picked
a nice room to enter.

554
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,708
Where are you?

555
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:23,083
Ngor, have you seen Dr. Suthee?

556
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,416
I haven't seen him since I got here.

557
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,083
Good morning, Doctor.

558
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,750
-Hello. Is anyone here yet?
-Not yet.

559
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,625
Here's the note I wrapped up for you.

560
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,458
At three o'clock in the morning,

561
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,916
the police were informed of a murder

562
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,541
at Ratanaraj University Hospital.

563
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,416
At the scene, the police found the body
of Ms. Napat Duangkaew

564
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,416
on the floor of the hospital's museum.

565
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,416
There were deep cuts on her face and body.

566
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:56,375
The police believes

567
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:59,500
that the dead woman fell
on the barbed wire in the museum.

568
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:02,041
Initially, the police assumed

569
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,041
that it was an accident.

570
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:10,083
But they haven't confirmed anything yet.

571
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,666
They are still investigating the case
and collecting evidence

572
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,291
to verify the death.

573
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,666
She was a faculty member
of the Department of Psychology.

574
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,375
She's a teaching assistant
of the department.

575
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:35,833
Excuse me for a second.

576
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,791
-Hello, Usa.
-Jib, what's going on there?

577
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,875
It's like what you have heard.

578
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,583
It was an accident, right?

579
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:47,666
We still don't know.

580
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,958
They're doing the autopsy right now.

581
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:51,208
Why?

582
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,958
Do you know the dead person?

583
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,458
I went to talk to her yesterday.

584
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,500
Are you here to do the autopsy?

585
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:26,541
Yes.

586
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,333
This way, please.

587
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,208
The body is right there.

588
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,791
I didn't make it in time, right?

589
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,666
Do you think this is really going to help?

590
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,291
Anyway,

591
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,958
if what you're doing makes
you feel better,

592
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,333
then do it.

593
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:50,666
There are plenty of trees here.
Why don't you water them?

594
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,791
This one is dying.

595
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,875
There's no point trying to save it.

596
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,208
Chon.

597
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,375
Where did you put the umbrella?

598
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,708
What if that faculty member's death wasn't

599
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:40,208
an accident like the police said it was?

600
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,166
What if she was murdered?

601
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,958
She was killed because
I dragged her into this.

602
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:57,375
Chon.

603
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:01,541
Don't think too much.
It was not your fault.

604
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,500
Of course, it is.

605
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,958
I don't know how I can comply

606
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:10,166
with what the woman named Dararai wants.

607
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:13,916
Chon, don't!

608
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,458
-Fuck.
-Chon, stop!

609
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:24,125
Please, can you stop torturing yourself
with these thoughts?

610
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:28,166
I can't shake them off my head!

611
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,041
Chon!

612
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:28,750
Have you been waiting long?

613
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:43,500
Jib.

614
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,416
Why didn't you ever tell me about this?

615
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,083
How do you want me to say it?

616
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,500
I feel

617
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:58,000
that it's a family affair,
and I didn't want to meddle in.

618
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:07,708
How important was she to Suthee?

619
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,083
Actually, the professor felt very guilty.

620
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,916
That's all I know about Dararai.

621
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,541
SUWAMONGKOL

622
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,791
Prestige Clinic, may I help you?

623
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:34,208
Hello. Is Dr. Usa there?

624
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:37,208
I tried to call her,
but I wasn't able to get through.

625
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:40,208
Dr. Usa has gone to see someone
at Ratanaraj Hospital.

626
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:41,875
Thank you.

627
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,416
After a while,

628
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,750
the professor did try to
distance himself from her.

629
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:54,875
Whenever Dararai called, I was always
the one who answered the phone for him.

630
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,750
So, everyone knows about this, right?

631
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,375
No, that's not it.

632
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,583
I'm the only one who knows.

633
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,041
Usa.

634
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,791
Don't tell anyone that you heard
all of this from me.

635
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,250
Dr. Jib.

636
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,541
Where's Dr. Usa?

637
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,291
Did she come to see you?

638
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,041
Oh, yes.

639
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,333
She just left.

640
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,791
Well, Dr. Jib.

641
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,333
Do you know the woman

642
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,708
named Dararai?

643
01:16:16,208 --> 01:16:17,166
Why?

644
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,458
It's Dararai. Do you know her?

645
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,833
Why are you asking me this?

646
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,166
What more do you want from me?

647
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:32,291
Well...

648
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,208
If...

649
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:38,000
if you know Dararai or anything about her,

650
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,416
please don't tell anyone about it.

651
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,958
It's very important. Don't tell anyone.

652
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,375
Otherwise, you might become
the next victim.

653
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:53,583
Just like that faculty member.

654
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:28,916
CHONLASIT'S CASE

655
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,208
Hello, Mom.

656
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,958
What's wrong, honey?

657
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:13,166
Usa, what's wrong?

658
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,916
About Dararai Suwamongkol,

659
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,958
the woman you had an affair with...

660
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:28,291
I know it's over,

661
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,625
but I just want to tell you.

662
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,791
Why did you do this to me?

663
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,333
You cheated on me.

664
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:49,750
Usa.

665
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,750
It's over.

666
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,375
She'll never come back
into our lives again.

667
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:58,916
SUBJECT: OUR PICTURE

668
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,291
Fuck!

669
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:03,916
My name is Dararai.

670
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,833
Find me.

671
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,625
I beg you. Please, leave me alone.

672
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:14,541
I'm scared. Please, leave me alone.

673
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,833
Please, don't do anything

674
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:21,958
to those who are involved.
Please, don't kill anybody.

675
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,083
Aey!

676
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,291
Aey!

677
01:24:39,416 --> 01:24:40,583
Let's go to the hospital now.

678
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,041
It will happen.

679
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:35,208
It will happen to you.

680
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:39,250
It will happen to you.

681
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:42,083
Find me.

682
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:45,166
Find me.

683
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,291
Find me.

684
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:50,958
Yes.

685
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:55,916
Yes.

686
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,125
I'm on my way.

687
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,833
You're Ms. Usa, right?

688
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:59,000
The victim was struck with a blunt object

689
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,125
and was thrown into a vat

690
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,625
that was filled with
strong acidic solutions.

691
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:21,416
There's one thing

692
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,583
I'd like to ask you.

693
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:24,791
USA

694
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:26,333
I found this name card

695
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:27,916
at the crime scene.

696
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:30,416
More importantly,

697
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:34,000
your name and phone number
are written on it.

698
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,083
Do you have any idea

699
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:44,416
whom the victim gave this name card to?

700
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:25,625
You wouldn't want your wife
to see these photos, right?

701
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:34,583
Fuck!

702
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:55,541
SUTHEE PATTANAPHONG

703
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:58,083
DR. SUTHEE PATTANAPHONG

704
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:19,833
I want to meet him in person.

705
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:21,208
When is he coming again?

706
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:22,291
He rarely comes.

707
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,250
He's been busy lately.

708
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,333
Please contact us immediately

709
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:34,166
if you have more evidence.

710
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,416
Thank you.

711
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:22,250
Could you please find the address
of this patient for me?

712
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,500
May.

713
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,708
May, get Ngor on the phone, please.

714
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,041
Is this Dr. Usa?

715
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,083
It's Chonlasit speaking.
Do you remember me?

716
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,041
Are you home now?

717
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:56,541
No, where are you?

718
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,166
I'm outside your house.

719
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,750
You must come back here quickly.
I have something important to tell you.

720
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,083
Don't go inside my house.

721
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,166
I'm coming now.

722
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:05,916
Don't go inside!

723
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,791
If you go in, I'll call the police.

724
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:33,375
Hey.

725
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:35,708
Don't be afraid.

726
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:52,875
Stay with me first.

727
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:15,500
Dr. Usa.

728
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,541
I'm Chonlasit. Do you remember me?

729
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:19,458
Where's May?

730
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,416
May!

731
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:24,541
-May!
-Dr. Usa, please listen to me first.

732
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:27,666
-May! Where's my daughter?
-Dr. Usa, please calm down.

733
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,208
I have something to tell you.

734
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,625
It's important,
and you must know the truth.

735
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:33,958
Your husband killed

736
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,708
the woman called Dararai

737
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:37,875
because she planned to blackmail him.

738
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:40,791
That's not it.

739
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,625
Your husband also murdered your friend.

740
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,125
Your husband murdered Dr. Jib.

741
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,750
He also murdered the faculty member.

742
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,000
He murdered everyone who knew about it.

743
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:52,833
I have to tell you this

744
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:54,208
because

745
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:56,125
Dararai wants me to tell you.

746
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:58,875
Now, your husband has kidnapped

747
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,541
my sister.

748
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:02,458
You have to tell me where he is.

749
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:05,125
Where is he, Doctor?

750
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,125
You have to tell me.

751
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:09,791
He's going to kill my sister, Doctor.

752
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:12,166
You must tell me!
Tell me where your husband is!

753
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,708
Stop! I can't take it anymore!

754
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,333
I can't treat you anymore.

755
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,916
Let me tell you something.

756
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:22,541
You sister is dead.

757
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,333
The sister you're talking about

758
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:27,916
is dead.

759
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:33,916
How do you know?

760
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:38,833
You killed her.

761
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:41,666
You killed everyone.

762
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,916
You killed Jib.

763
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:46,291
You killed Nok,

764
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:49,791
and you killed Dararai Suwamongkol.

765
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,083
That's not true.

766
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:54,083
What are you talking about?

767
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:56,333
Don't talk nonsense.

768
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:57,500
I didn't do it.

769
01:37:58,041 --> 01:37:59,625
The police already know about it.

770
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,250
Just accept the truth.

771
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,041
Let me help you.

772
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,291
I didn't do it!

773
01:38:10,708 --> 01:38:12,416
It was your husband!

774
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:15,458
I don't know anything about this.
He took my sister. He's going to kill her!

775
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:16,750
You aren't Chonlasit.

776
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:35,208
Chonlasit is at drawer number 19.

777
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:49,875
Chonlasit

778
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:51,500
is dead.

779
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,833
CHONLASIT SUWAMONGKOL

780
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:05,291
CAUSE OF DEATH: SEVERE BLOOD LOSS

781
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:20,208
CHONLASIT SUWAMONGKOL

782
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:23,083
AGE: 21
CAUSE OF DEATH: SEVERE BLOOD LOSS

783
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,250
Please give us the way.
There was an accident.

784
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:42,708
Go faster!

785
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:43,750
Chon!

786
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,250
Chon, you'll be all right.

787
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:49,458
Chon!

788
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,791
Suthee, please don't let him die!

789
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:56,125
-You can't go in.
-Suthee!

790
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:58,208
Suthee, save my brother.

791
01:42:58,541 --> 01:42:59,666
Chon!

792
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:01,958
Chon!

793
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:03,666
Chon!

794
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:06,166
It's enough. You did your best.

795
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:07,291
Chon!

796
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:22,166
Suthee.

797
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:26,083
Can you keep him like this for a while?

798
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,208
There were only two of us.

799
01:44:02,666 --> 01:44:04,250
Please don't leave me.

800
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:06,625
I have no one left anymore.

801
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:37,041
What if all of these are

802
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:39,750
just something you made up in your mind?

803
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,958
Why are you treating it yourself here?

804
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:54,000
Tell me honestly.

805
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:56,458
So, which drugs are you on?

806
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,583
Then, please look at your name and tell me
if it's spelled correctly.

807
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:04,708
Are you Dr. Usa?

808
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:06,583
They seem real,

809
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:08,833
-like they weren't dreams at all.
-You wouldn't want your wife

810
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:09,875
to see these photos, right?

811
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:11,500
She'll never come back
into our lives again.

812
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:14,083
There were people asking for you.

813
01:45:14,166 --> 01:45:16,416
It was the faculty member called Nok.

814
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,416
Do you remember her?

815
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,833
-You might become the next victim.
-What more do you want from me?

816
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:21,875
You killed everyone. You killed Jib.

817
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:23,958
You killed Nok,
and you killed Dararai Suwamongkol.

818
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:25,041
Chonlasit is dead.

819
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:27,791
I didn't kill them. It was your husband.

820
01:47:07,166 --> 01:47:08,666
CHONLASIT'S CASE

821
01:47:32,291 --> 01:47:34,458
COURTROOM NO. 1

822
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:02,666
This is

823
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:04,500
Dr. Suthee's brain waves

824
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:06,750
when he thought he was Chonlasit.

825
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:08,208
Also,

826
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:10,125
we have tested his blood pressure

827
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:12,541
and his heart rate, and they show

828
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:14,916
significant discrepancies.

829
01:48:15,666 --> 01:48:16,916
From now on, I would like

830
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,625
the psychiatrist to continue
with a detailed explanation.

831
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:28,083
The defendant is ill.

832
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:32,333
The medical term for his condition is
multiple personality disorder.

833
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:34,958
It is a form of hallucination.

834
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,208
Those who suffer from this

835
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:40,083
normally build another personality,

836
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:42,541
or thinks that he's another person.

837
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:46,958
Sometimes, he may have interactions
with imaginary people.

838
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,541
This is the case of Dr. Suthee,

839
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:51,333
who believes he is Chonlasit

840
01:48:51,416 --> 01:48:53,416
and is still living with his sister.

841
01:49:00,791 --> 01:49:03,708
Do you know the details of the murders
of Dararai Suwamongkol

842
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:06,625
and the other victims?

843
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,125
Yes, I do.

844
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:12,333
Do you know

845
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:13,708
who the killer is?

846
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:15,583
Yes, I do.

847
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:18,416
Can you tell us

848
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:19,541
who killed

849
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:20,833
those people?

850
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,208
Dr. Suthee did.

851
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,125
The court has decided

852
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:29,791
that in order to ensure
the defendant a fair trial,

853
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:33,333
the case will be temporarily suspended.

854
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:35,000
The defendant will be sent for

855
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:38,125
psychiatric rehabilitation.

856
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,125
When he is fully recovered,
the trial will be resumed.

857
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:01,916
The court has suspended the case.

858
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:14,458
Dr. Suthee.

859
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:15,916
Dr. Suthee.

860
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:19,666
We are taking you back to the hospital.

861
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,208
Mr. Chon.

862
01:51:26,458 --> 01:51:27,541
Mr. Chonlasit.

863
01:51:28,791 --> 01:51:30,833
Does he stand a chance of
going back to normal?

864
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:37,083
It's like he's trapped

865
01:51:37,541 --> 01:51:39,375
in his subconsciousness

866
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:41,541
and refuses to wake up.

867
01:51:43,166 --> 01:51:46,041
You mean he's stuck in a dream,
like a sleepwalker?

868
01:51:48,916 --> 01:51:50,375
It's more like he's been hypnotized.

869
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:53,666
Are you serious?

870
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:54,958
Do you really believe that?

871
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:01,958
-How can a lawyer believe that so easily?
-Since you left

872
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,791
Your life seems to have changed

873
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:07,958
That's almost right.

874
01:53:02,791 --> 01:53:06,958
I never get to know how you are

875
01:53:07,041 --> 01:53:10,500
The news died down after we had parted

876
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:11,500
Suthee.

877
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:14,583
Look into my eyes.

878
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:19,291
Every time you hear this song,

879
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:25,791
you'll feel the happy memories

880
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:28,791
that the two of us have shared.

881
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:34,875
Do you still miss me

882
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:39,791
When you are alone?

883
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:14,916
If you ever think of leaving me,

884
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:17,541
this song

885
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:19,208
will remind you

886
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:22,125
of the bad things you've done to me.

887
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:25,625
It will possess you.

888
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:34,083
Even when I'm already gone,

889
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:39,333
you'll never be able to forget me.

890
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:03,541
Since you left

891
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:08,458
Your life seems to have changed

892
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:12,875
I still feel lonely and sad

893
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:17,750
Only loneliness was left in me

894
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:22,541
I still miss the old times

895
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:26,833
When there was only us

896
01:55:27,958 --> 01:55:29,291
My name is Dararai.

897
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:32,833
Find me.

898
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:39,458
Since you left

899
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:43,791
Your life seems to have changed

900
01:55:44,083 --> 01:55:48,500
I still feel lonely and sad

901
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:53,333
Only loneliness was left in me

902
01:55:53,666 --> 01:55:57,916
I still miss the old times

903
01:55:58,166 --> 01:56:02,541
When there was only us

904
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:10,208
But there's only emptiness
And loneliness now

905
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:15,333
Do you know that I miss you?

906
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:19,791
I miss you every time

907
01:56:20,083 --> 01:56:26,291
I'm alone

908
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:24,708
I have forgiven you.

909
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:29,833
I'm going to set you free now.

910
02:04:15,541 --> 02:04:17,541
