00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,476
Zoey: Listen to us.
It has to be ghosts.

160
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,112
‐What happened?
‐Call an ambulance.

161
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,313
Do not call
an ambulance.

162
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,748
It was just
a little shock.

163
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,316
You lost consciousness, Dad.

164
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:29,118
Mom...

165
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,687
Hi, I need paramedics
to 860 Bayou Road.

166
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,289
I told you, I'm fine.

167
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,324
‐Mom!
‐She's on the phone, Wyatt.

168
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,559
Sarah:
Yes. Yes, The Tremont.

169
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,860
My father‐in‐law
had an accident.

170
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,728
Fire!

171
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,365
I never should've
touched that rock.

172
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,500
Sarah:
And now there's smoke
coming out of the basement.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,368
Tell them to hurry!

174
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,036
Calm down.
There's no need to panic.

175
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,005
Yes, there is.
My hat's inside!

176
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:50,306
The hat can be replaced.

177
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:51,574
Stay with your sister
and brother.

178
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,344
Wait... Where's Griffin?

179
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,615
(both coughing)

180
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,552
Listen. I'll find
a fire extinguisher.
You call 911.

181
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:05,054
‐911?
‐Just press the numbers.

182
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,123
Once someone answers,
tell 'em it's an emergency.

183
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:09,659
No, you can't go back
in there, Griffin.
It isn't safe!

184
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,828
But if the basement burns,
we can't get to the bunker.

185
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,162
You'll be trapped here.

186
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,664
And you'll never see
Harper again.

187
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,632
Ben:
What are you doing
in here?

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,901
(coughing)
We smelled smoke.

189
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,336
Yeah, the fire department's
already on the way.

190
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,804
Come on, everyone's
waiting outside.
Let's go.

191
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,442
(ominous music playing)

192
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,334
(indistinct chatter)

193
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,171
Take it easy tonight.

194
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:57,140
Any headaches,
nausea, dizziness,

195
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,342
I want you to go
to the closest ER,
understood?

196
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,577
‐I'm fine, really.
‐Understood?

197
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,879
Understood.

198
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,686
Dad, I don't know
what to say.

199
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,161
All clear.
Smoke's pretty much
gone too.

200
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:19,495
Check for toxicity?

201
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:20,930
Yeah. And she's clean.

202
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,569
So it's safe
to go back inside?

203
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,704
Yes, ma'am.
I'd open up some windows,

204
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:31,207
though you've already got
a pretty good draft in there.

205
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,509
Especially
on the second floor.

206
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,547
Is there something else?

207
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,148
Anyone living in room 205?

208
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:41,350
No one.

209
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,353
We use it
mostly for storage.
Why?

210
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,822
When I was checking it out,
I noticed it seemed very cold.

211
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,891
And I saw
what I thought
was smoke,

212
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:51,561
but it was just
this mist,

213
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:53,529
like you see in the mornings
out in the pastures.

214
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,498
Anyway, nothing was burning,
so I locked it back up.

215
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:57,500
Thank you.

216
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,008
Topher: You know
what we're gonna hear,
don't you?

217
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,010
Wyatt:
"No logical explanation."

218
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,546
When we all know exactly
what the explanation is.

219
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,015
‐But will they listen to us?
‐Nope.

220
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,651
Because you guys
have been screaming
the same thing for days.

221
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,420
I mean, you've heard
of Chicken Little, right?

222
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,355
Yeah, yeah.
"The sky is falling."

223
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,957
But in this case,
it really is!

224
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,426
There's a ghost
in that hotel.

225
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:27,230
I don't know, maybe
there are two ghosts.
Or maybe 100!

226
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,564
Topher! Harper!

227
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,534
Thank God,
you're all right.

228
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,069
Come on.
Let's go home.

229
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,303
Wyatt:
Bye, guys.

230
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:36,772
It's getting worse.

231
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,141
There's no telling
how this is gonna end.

232
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:41,010
Especially when
we don't even know
where it began.

233
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,086
Harper:
There he is.

234
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,687
He paces
when he's thinking.

235
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,189
His grown‐up self
does that too.

236
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,728
What are you doing?
Or maybe I should ask,
what are you planning?

237
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,630
What does it look like?

238
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,331
I've got business
with the judge.

239
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:03,733
There's things
he needs to hear.

240
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,134
Like what, exactly?

241
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,337
Well, first,
I'm gonna call him
a no‐good, lying grifter,

242
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:10,273
then I'm gonna get him
to admit what he did.

243
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,375
He's a judge, Sam.
You can't do any of that.

244
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,376
Oh, yeah?

245
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,112
Watch me!

246
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,880
Out of my way, Daisy.

247
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,848
Sam!

248
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,722
You promised!
You gave us your word

249
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,457
that we could stay
on the land!

250
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,959
Now, now.
Easy there, young man.

251
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,761
Come on, Sam.

252
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,296
I'm sure
the judge is very busy.

253
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,965
‐Papa's waiting for
us at home.
‐She's right, son.

254
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,634
You listen to your sister
and your daddy.

255
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,736
And remember,
he did this for you.

256
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:45,541
Let go! I needed
to make our case

257
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,209
since you
and Papa won't!

258
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:50,713
Sure, Papa, I get,
all filled with sadness
over Mother.

259
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:54,116
But if you were really Daisy,
you'd be fighting this too,

260
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,318
right alongside me.

261
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,453
It's a losing battle, Topher.
Can't you see...

262
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,889
Who's Topher?

263
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,325
I don't know. I just‐‐
Look, Sam‐‐

264
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,559
You just...

265
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,094
stay away from me!

266
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,935
Finch case is on the docket
for tomorrow.

267
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,770
Make sure you have
the brief ready and organized.

268
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,138
associate:
Already in the works.

269
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,575
That kid sure caused
a ruckus back there.

270
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,344
Oh, nothin' to worry about.

271
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,312
You got the document
for their farm?

272
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,216
If you mean the original
that Elijah signed,

273
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:28,451
got it right here.

274
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,619
You want me to tear it up?

275
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,355
It can go out
with tonight's trash.

276
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,789
I'll take care of it
tomorrow.

277
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,259
It'll be safe here till then.

278
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,135
Harper.

279
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:49,205
‐Where have you been?
‐It doesn't matter.

280
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,140
I know where
the real document is,

281
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,842
and I know
how we're gonna get
our hands on it.

282
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,817
Dad.
Dad, slow down.

283
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,652
Sarah:
You don't have
to leave tonight.

284
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,888
Uh, didn't they tell you
to rest?

285
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,859
What? How am I gonna rest
in that... place?

286
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,762
The sander, the porch,
the fuse box?

287
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,164
Haunted, cursed,
or just falling apart,

288
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:17,566
The Tremont is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

289
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,701
Ben:
Look, Dad...

290
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,304
Come on, we've been
working together
and it's...

291
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,439
It's been good.

292
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,109
Until today!
The contractors
have all backed out.

293
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:30,446
No amount of money
is going to insure this place.

294
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:31,680
I wanted it to work out.

295
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,948
I really did.

296
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,217
But it's useless!

297
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,753
Plain and simple,
that place wants us out.

298
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,356
I'm sorry, Bennett. Sarah.

299
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:55,938
It's not fair.

300
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:10,052
So? What are you?
Like some big fancy judge?

301
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:13,022
I've been called
a lot of things,
but never fancy.

302
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,457
If you don't mind me asking,

303
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:16,125
I read somewhere
about this law

304
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,928
that it's illegal
to tie your alligator up
to a fire hydrant.

305
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,095
You ever hear that?

306
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:22,097
I can't say
that I have.

307
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:25,100
Yup, it's pretty amazing
what they come up with
these days, huh?

308
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,470
You know, I'm thinking,
I wanna be a lawyer
when I'm older.

309
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,005
I mean,
I'm pretty good in school

310
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:32,842
and I like helping people...
and alligators.

311
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,444
Oh, that's dandy,
little lady.

312
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,547
But shouldn't you be
a little more practical
in your ambitions?

313
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,249
Find yourself a lawyer
to marry.

314
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,384
Not sure I understand.

315
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:44,186
Nothing wrong
with being married
to a lawyer.

316
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,521
Just ask my wifey.

317
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,578
Grandpa must've been
really spoked
to bail on you.

318
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:18,320
‐If I just knew the answer.
‐To what?

319
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,324
All of this.

320
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:25,694
This hotel...

321
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,264
its secrets,
the mystery...

322
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:32,201
What's in the mirror?
What's in the basement?

323
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,739
Why won't it let us
finish this place...

324
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,475
or, God forbid,
open it?

325
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:58,594
(loudly):
We're good people!

326
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,063
You hear me?

327
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,731
(Ben scoffs)

328
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,733
All we want to do
is open this place
back up again,

329
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,968
give it another chance.

330
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,572
What's so wrong
with that? Huh?

331
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,541
Why won't you let us?

332
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,010
You know what?

333
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:19,415
You may have driven
my father away,

334
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,450
but I'm not giving up.

335
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:23,886
(loudly):
You hear me?

336
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,255
We will not give up.

337
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:29,625
Not today, not tomorrow,
not ever!

338
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,394
We're finishing the work
and we're opening this hotel

339
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:33,696
and you just‐‐

340
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,065
You better get used to it!

341
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,740
You go, Dad!

342
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,080
Savannah:
Harper!

343
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:53,949
I did what I could
to slow him down,

344
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,084
and then he did
this whole

345
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,486
"ladies can't be lawyers,
only wifeys" thing.

346
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:59,154
So 1930s.

347
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:00,689
‐Did you get it?
‐It's right here.

348
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,225
I checked it.
It's the one Elijah signed,

349
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,793
letting him
keep the house.

350
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,129
So what now?
Do we give it to Elijah?

351
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,164
Sam?
The Supreme Court?

352
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,266
Or maybe "The People's Court"?

353
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,636
Oh, wait, no.
Television's not been
invented yet.

354
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:16,105
Savannah!
We're gonna get
this document

355
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,806
once and for all
into the right hands,

356
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,808
but not into the hands
you think.

357
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:27,449
I've told you
a hundred times
that place is cursed!

358
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:30,185
I don't understand
why you won't listen to me
and why you keep going back.

359
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,888
Don't you want us
to have friends?

360
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,890
Of course,
I do, baby.

361
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,893
I'm not saying
you can't be friends
with other kids

362
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,928
or the Campbell kids.

363
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:42,731
It's just...
that hotel and‐‐

364
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:45,034
And the ghosts
who dwell there.

365
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,069
That's not
what I was gonna say.

366
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,537
But you were thinking it.

367
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:50,639
You said our dad
was drawn to it.

368
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,575
And you were
before the Campbells
showed up, right?

369
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,845
‐Right.
‐And I couldn't stay away.

370
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,314
And now,
you can't either.

371
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,916
(chuckles)
That's nonsense.

372
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,252
The only time I go there
is when I'm chasing
after you two.

373
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,256
And, yes, your dad had
an obsession with it

374
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,958
because...
it was in his family.

375
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,528
And when you married him,
you became a part
of his family.

376
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,230
Just as other women
who married
into our family did.

377
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,100
It wasn't the man's land
or her land.

378
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,301
It became their land.

379
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,504
You got a lot
from going through
that old trunk.

380
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,240
All you have to do
is look at our family tree.

381
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,145
All right, you two
need to go to bed.

382
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,148
Okay, so we'll table this?

383
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,550
I'm not changing my mind.

384
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,586
You will if The Tremont
wants you to.

385
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,256
‐Good night, Mom.
‐Good night.

386
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,980
You were pretty good
back there.

387
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:07,282
Had me snowed.

388
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,219
I meant it. Every word.

389
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:15,624
Good night, sis.

390
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,439
I'm sorry
it took so long.

391
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,474
You're here now.
Let's get going.

392
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:33,709
Ben:
Griffin!

393
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,648
There you are.
I need another pair of hands.

394
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:41,984
Unless you got
something else to do?

395
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:44,419
Oh, no, um...
be right there.

396
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,454
All right.

397
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:53,962
Here, take this
and go back.

398
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,998
‐You're not coming?
‐There's no time.

399
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,332
You need to switch
with Harper

400
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,901
and make sure
she gets back here.

401
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:01,103
Then you'll stay
in the past,
where you belong,

402
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:03,372
and she'll stay
in the present.

403
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,440
And the world
will be right again.

404
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,777
Just use the other door
and... be careful.

405
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,315
(sighs)

406
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:18,220
What?

407
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:22,191
Just...
goodbye is all.

408
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,194
Goodbye, Daisy.
Good luck.

409
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:32,234
Ben: Griffin,
come on, son.
This can't wait!

410
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,202
Coming!

411
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,575
Sam, have you seen
Savannah?

412
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:41,276
I thought she might be
helping you out again.

413
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:42,377
No. Not all day.

414
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:44,780
I've been up at 205
working on locating
that draft.

415
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,914
Still can't pinpoint it.

416
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:48,116
Only Mrs. Henderson
would complain about a draft

417
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:49,751
in the heat
of a Louisiana summer.

418
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:54,089
If Savannah turns up,
I'll be sure to send her
your way.

419
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,124
Much appreciated.

420
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:09,972
Savannah!
Are you down there?

421
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:12,841
Oh, no!

422
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,614
(groaning)

423
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,922
Why can't you tell me
what the plan is, Harper?

424
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:28,490
I mean, what else
can we do

425
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,158
but show the paper
to Elijah?

426
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,462
(leaves rustling)

427
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:36,064
Harper? What is it?

428
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,599
Harper: Shh.
Do you hear that?

429
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,602
Someone's there.

430
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,975
You're back!

431
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:48,310
Hi, you must be
Savannah.

432
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,578
Nice to meet you,
Daisy.

433
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,880
‐Where's Griffin?
‐His father needed him
for something.

434
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,348
So he sent me back alone.

435
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:55,350
He said we have
to switch places right away.

436
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,986
I'm ready,
and I assume
you are too.

437
00:22:57,986 --> 00:23:00,155
Boy, this is crazy,
seeing you two together.

438
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,491
I mean, the resemblance
is truly uncanny.

439
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,393
So no one
in the present
figured it out?

440
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:06,862
There were some
pretty close calls.
How about you?

441
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,298
Plenty of the same.
Your brother, Sam,
was nearly onto me.

442
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:10,933
(chuckles)
Same with Topher.

443
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,367
I'm gonna
miss that kid.

444
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,403
And I'll miss Sam
and your father.

445
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,738
Thanks for letting me
borrow your mother.

446
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,874
It was nice...
having one again.

447
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,976
And, for me,
nice having a father back.

448
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,946
There's something
you need to know
about the farm.

449
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,448
That eventually
it was turned
into a hotel?

450
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,183
Sooner than
you probably know.

451
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:29,818
Judge Walker
bought it.

452
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,387
Uh, excuse me,
but shouldn't that be
stole it?

453
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,857
The judge tricked your dad
with a switch of the documents.

454
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,361
All you have to do
is take this inside,

455
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,797
show your father,
and the land stays
yours forever.

456
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,231
That's wonderful.

457
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,000
Only it's not
what you're going to do.

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,168
It's not?

459
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,203
But if we can
save the farm...

460
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:49,972
We're not going to,
Daisy.

461
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:52,708
In fact,
that's the last thing
you're going to do.

462
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,217
Harper:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

463
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,654
(gasps)

464
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,256
Caroline: Sam took a fall
down the basement stairs.

465
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:10,092
‐He's unconscious.
‐No.

466
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,627
Is he‐‐
Is he gone?

467
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:15,364
Daisy, what are you
still doing here?

468
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:16,832
You were supposed
to switch back
with Harper.

469
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,534
I think our ghost
is on notice,
