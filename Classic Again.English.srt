2
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,250
Poppy, can we take a photo with you?

3
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,500
Sure, but please take this leaflet.

4
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,833
Let's go to the backdrop.

5
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,958
Guys, move over.

6
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,750
We're taking a photo here.

7
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,375
You stand here, and you here.

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:47,833
Bota!

00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:48,750
DRAMA CLUB

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,750
Bota!

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,000
Come take a photo for us.

12
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,916
Will you sign up for our Drama Club?

13
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,500
You have to!

14
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,083
Ready?

15
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,250
Squeeze in.

16
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:02,958
One, two...

17
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,833
Got it.

18
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,250
Thank you.

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,500
Don't overact!

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,083
Please take our leaflet.

21
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,083
Sign up over there.

22
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,583
Look at that. Is he from another planet?

23
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,666
My prince charming.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,958
Come and wake me up
from the eternal sleep with your kiss.

25
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,916
Did you just peck me?

26
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,666
Hot latte with no foam, please.

27
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,833
Same for me.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,166
That's Non's favorite drink.

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,416
Who's Non?

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,708
That architecture student.

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,333
Did you hear?

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,125
Non and I have the same taste in coffee.

33
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,791
Same as me too!

34
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,291
Just me. Not you.

35
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,541
You know what?
The other day when I brushed past him...

36
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
I was so nervous I couldn't look at him.

37
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,541
But I felt like...

38
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,791
He was sneaking a look at me.

39
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,416
He must have feelings for me.

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,041
Poppy, if you didn't look at him,

41
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,708
how could you know he was looking at you?

42
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,041
It's all in your head!

43
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,416
Bota!

44
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,666
Bota!

45
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,583
Stay here.

46
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,750
Hello.

47
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,458
It's me, Mom.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,416
Hi, Mom.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,833
Thought you worked so hard
you forgot your daughter in Thailand.

50
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,541
Of course not,
but it's pretty hectic here in Seoul.

51
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,458
Hold on.

52
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,208
An envelope, in the wardrobe.

53
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,791
Found it.

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,875
A big brown envelope?

55
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,208
Yes.

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,125
Check the document inside.

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,791
-Is it a title deed?
-I'm looking.

58
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,833
Yes, it is.

59
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,458
Can you drop it off at your aunt's?

60
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,458
Sure. I'll do it before class.

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,625
Good.

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,916
Miss you, love.

63
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,500
Miss you too.

64
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,083
I have to go.

65
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,500
Call me more often.

66
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,625
Okay.

67
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,208
Bye.

68

TANIL CHAISAMUT

70
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:45,125
How are you? I miss you so much.
It's raining a lot here. What about there?

71
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,041
How romantic!

72
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:05,541
Everybody has their own love story
kept in a memory box

73
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:12,458
and stashed away in a corner,
waiting for it to melt into thin air.

74
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,958
These love letters
are so sweet and tender.

75
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,833
Mom's first love has been kept here.

76
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,833
Hear that, kitty?

77
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,625
1967

78
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,375
You're Kajorn, right?

79
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,166
Yeah.

80
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,916
I'm Tanil, from Class C.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,041
Okay. Hi.

82
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,791
Beautiful poems.

83
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,875
They say you can write love letters
that win over girls.

84
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,958
You must have a way with words.

85
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,666
Please write one for me.
I tried but it sucked.

86
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,833
Her name is Dalah.

87
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,833
An MP's daughter
my dad wants me to marry her.

88
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,333
Please help me out.

89
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:05,291
WEEKS EARLIER

90
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, Kajorn.

91
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,958
How many fish shall we catch today?

92
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,166
How about four?

93
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,208
Why four?

94
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,458
So they're in pairs.

95
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,375
So, whoever catches no fish
has to buy sweets for everyone.

96
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,333
For real?

97
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,291
Yeah.

98
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,333
Right on.

99
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,541
Look, that's Mr. Kham's beautiful niece.

100
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,416
She goes to school in the city.

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,875
An angel is out of your league, man.

102
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,083
She's waving at me.

103
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,833
Not at you!

104
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,166
She's waving at me.

105
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,750
-At me.
-At me.

106
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,583
-Hi, there.
-My name's Yod.

107
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,625
-Hello.
-I'm Chai.

108
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,000
Hello. I'm Yod.

109
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,291
Kajorn, let's go catch some fish.

110
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,750
Get it, Chai.

111
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
I can't.

112
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,916
Chai, move your ass!

113
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,208
Trap it!

114
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,375
-Easy, easy.
-What are you doing?

115
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,500
Damn!

116
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,250
These boys always sneak in
to steal our fighting fish.

117
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,708
You've got some nerve
stealing from my grandpa's orchard.

118
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,583
If he finds out, you're finished.

119
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,166
Please don't tell him!

120
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,208
It's just some fish.

121
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,416
Fine. I won't tell him.

122
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,625
But you have to do something for me.

123
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,708
Of course! I'll do anything for you!

124
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,708
You know the haunted house
across the river?

125
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,416
Take me there.

126
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,291
Don't go. The demon will break your neck!

127
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,416
Or Grandpa will give you hell.

128
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,208
Noi, if you're so scared, stay here.

129
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,958
But don't tell anyone.

130
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,708
I'm definitely going there.

131
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,541
What do you say?

132
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,083
Ghosts or Grandpa, what scares you more?

133
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,208
Meet me tomorrow at the river.

134
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sure.

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,416
So, what was that?

136
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,125
Yod.

137
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,833
Find me a boat.

138
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,291
Okay.

139
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,291
Chai.

140
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,041
Teach me to row.

141
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,625
Me?

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,250
I can't row a boat.

143
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,208
-Hi.
-Hi.

144
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,250
Please get in.

145
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,541
Take my arm.

146
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,041
Well, my name is Dalah.

147
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,458
I'm Kajorn.

148
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,875
Are you sure you know how to row?

149
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,750
Piece of cake,
though it's my first time today.

150
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,291
The haunted house is that way.

151
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,208
Oh, that way.

152
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,833
Take the flashlight. I won't need it.

153
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,291
Damn it!

154
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,541
Don't hold it like that.

155
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,916
It's spooky.

156
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,083
Don't!

157
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,916
Old folks warn us not to call out
to unusual things.

158
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,375
Let's get out of here.

159
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,750
Still want to see a ghost?

160
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,208
It's going to rain.

161
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,833
We'd better hurry.

162
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,166
Don't worry, let's find a shelter first.

163
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,625
We'll come back when the rain stops.

164
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,375
Are you hurt?

165
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,083
I've sprained my ankle.

166
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,750
Let me help you.

167
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,666
So, there are no ghosts.

168
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,541
Isn't that a good thing?

169
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,375
Why did you want to see ghosts?

170
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,291
I'm curious...

171
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,500
I want to know
what happens when people die.

172
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,375
So, you go to school here?

173
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,458
I'm from around here,
but I study in the city.

174
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,958
Me too.

175
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,166
I only come back to visit Grandpa
during school breaks.

176
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Hungry?

177
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,708
Be careful.

178
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,083
Don't worry. Almost there.

179
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,416
Watch out.

180
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,083
Are you hurt?

181
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,916
You're okay?

182
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,125
Wait here.

183
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,375
This is for you.

184
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,541
Thank you.

185
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,708
Slowly.

186
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Thanks.

187
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,916
Look.

188
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:35,833
So beautiful.

189
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,250
You've done a lot for me today.

190
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,458
But I haven't done anything for you.

191
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,750
You don't have to.

192
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,541
I had so much fun today.

193
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,375
Thank you, Kajorn.

194
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,625
Miss Dalah!

195
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,333
Miss Dalah!

196
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,666
-There she is!
-Be careful.

197
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,166
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.

198
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,208
It's all right.

199
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,250
My dear, are you all right?

200
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,833
I'm fine, Grandpa.

201
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,916
Kajorn! You damn boy!

202
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,125
I'm in so much trouble because of you!

203
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,916
Please, Miss Dalah.

204
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,125
Let's go home.

205
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,500
THE PROBABILITY THEORY

206
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:44,541
The least likely event
can in actuality happen.

207
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:49,416
The probability of an event
is a number that shows

208
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,541
how likely it is that a random event
will happen.

209
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:58,333
The probability of any given event is

210
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:02,000
equal to the ratio
of an event of our focus...

211
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
-But it can or cannot happen...
-Bota!

212
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,750
Why are you here? This isn't your class.

213
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,291
I'm here to deliver good news.

214
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,958
Move over.

215
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,500
The story I proposed
will be performed by the club.

216
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:29,916
Really?

217
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,583
Congratulations!

218
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,000
Which story, anyway?

219
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,125
The one you told me about.

220
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,875
Which one?

221
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,166
Your mom's love letters!

222
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,416
No! Not that one!

223
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:54,208
You can't do that.
It's personal and I trusted you!

224
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,916
If my mom finds out,
she's going to kill me.

225
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,125
Bota, calm down.

226
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,583
Your mom lives in Korea.
How could she find out?

227
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,666
You have to help me write the script.

228
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,500
No, I'm not going to,
and no one can make me.

229
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,333
You have to.

230
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:17,208
You two! Take your business outside!

231
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,208
Now!

232
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,833
The director said he loves the story.

233
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:33,500
He promises to let me play the lead.

234
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:36,333
You know that's always been my dream,
being a female lead!

235
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,000
This is my big break.

236
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,333
Won't you help make my dream come true?

237
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,708
Why did he choose you, anyway?

238
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,958
Dear Dalah,

239
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:52,875
while I was writing
this letter by the window,

240
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,958
a gentle breeze came through.

241
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,916
So I put it in the envelope
along with my words.

242
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:07,250
I hope the wind of love
will make you feel wonderful.

243
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:35,333
SCENE 1
A MAN IS SITTING BY THE WINDOW

244
00:29:54,791 --> 00:30:00,333
After she came back from Grandpa's,
she was ill for weeks.

245
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,041
I don't know what she had.

246
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,750
But when she left the hospital,
she became bright and happy.

247
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:09,458
She'd had a sad air about her
since she lost her mother.

248
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,916
It hurts me having to write
the love letter for Tanil.

249
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,083
There are so many things
I wish I could tell her myself.

250
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:27,750
But at least this letter gives me a chance
to talk to her again.

251
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,041
Done.

252
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,375
Man, so sweet.

253
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:46,000
Sugary, impossibly sweet!

254
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,333
You're so damn good, like it's all
coming straight from your heart.

255
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,125
Don't flatter me.

256
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,083
I have something for you.

257
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,500
-You don't have to.
-Come on. Here.

258
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,291
Thanks.

259
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:14,583
"To the end of the Earth,
to the edge of the ocean

260
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:20,250
My love knows no bounds

261
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,541
Beneath the ground,
or under the magical stream..."

262
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,791
Kajorn.

263
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,708
She wrote back!

264
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:32,583
Thanks, man. Your letter
truly works wonders! Awesome!

265
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,791
She wrote me back, ma'am!

266
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,583
She invited me to go see her school show.

267
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,500
Sent me a couple of tickets.

268
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,041
Wanna come along?

269
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,750
There'll be lots of cute chicks.

270
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,833
Dalah plays beautifully.

271
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,166
That was so beautiful.

272
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,833
Thank you.

273
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:30,916
You're wonderful.

274
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
Thanks, Dad.

275
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,416
Come join us for lunch.

276
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,000
My pleasure, sir.

277
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,250
Let's go, Dalah.

278
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,333
Time for lunch.

279
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:11,125
Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

280
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,333
I have to run back.

281
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,833
I snuck out.

282
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Right.

283
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,250
Dalah.

284
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,666
Will I see you again?

285
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,958
Will I see you again?

286
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,791
Fantastic!

287
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's take ten. We'll do the next scene
when we come back.

288
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,958
Non, can I have a word with you?

289
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,291
Take a look here...

290
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,833
Hey!

291
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,625
I'm so happy Non accepted the role.

292
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:46,125
He rejected every play
they offered him before.

293
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,500
But he likes this script
and wants to have a go.

294
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,875
But, in fact, he accepted
because he knows I'm the lead actress.

295
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,583
Poppy.

296
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,958
You didn't tell anyone
I wrote the script, right?

297
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:07,875
Of course not. It's your mom's life story.

298
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,041
And this is just college theater.

299
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,083
Anyway, what's with the makeup?

300
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,166
I've never seen you with makeup.

301
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,250
-You're pretty.
-I had stuff to do.

302
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,416
What stuff?

303
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:21,916
Well...

304
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,625
Non!

305
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,041
This is Bota, my best friend.

306
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,875
Bota, this is Non.

307
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,083
Hi.

308
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,583
Hi.

309
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,250
Poppy.

310
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's discuss the next scene.

311
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,000
Coming.

312
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,916
Excuse me.

313
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,541
Wait!

314
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,166
Excuse me.

315
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,833
Do you know who wrote the script?

316
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,458
No, I don't.

317
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,625
In case you bump
into the writer, tell her that...

318
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,833
it's a fantastic script.

319
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,541
Right.

320
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
Are you all right?

321
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,875
Aren't you feeling well?

322
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,708
Your cheeks are kind of red.

323
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,375
-Got a fever?
-No! Nothing!

324
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,125
I'm totally fine.

325
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,166
I have to go check the next set.

326
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:57,791
Bota!

327
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,666
You forgot your bag.

328
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,875
Thank you.

329
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,583
-Wait up!
-No.

330
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,250
It's pretty crowded.

331
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,208
I've never been to this kind of party.

332
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,041
You think Dalah's here already?

333
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,208
She'll be here soon.

334
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,958
Here she is.

335
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,041
Dahla, this is Kajorn.

336
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,541
Good evening.

337
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,625
Nice to meet you.

338
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,625
You guys are friends?

339
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,833
We're best pals.

340
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,708
This is Tubtim, my best friend.

341
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,250
Hi, nice to meet you.

342
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,291
I'll get you some drinks.

343
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,791
I'll come with you.

344
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,333
Kajorn is so cute.

345
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,125
I miss you.

346
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:34,916
I miss you too.

347
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,166
CHARITY DANCE

348
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,375
I didn't know you're Tanil's friend.

349
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,041
Now we meet again.

350
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,250
See you guys later.

351
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,208
It was nice meeting you.

352
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,833
Good luck.

353
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,416
Let's go.

354
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:35,083
This is my first time at a dance party.

355
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:39,958
On the floor I felt like
a storybook princess...

356
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,166
dancing with a prince.

357
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,458
One day when I actually meet my prince,
I will...

358
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,833
Kajorn!

359
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,041
I had a great time today.

360
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:21,416
-I want to--
-Thank you for today.

361
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,625
All right. I'm leaving now.

362
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:27,875
Bye.

363
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,666
Non is such a gentleman.

364
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,541
Popular and nice.

365
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:18,166
Strange that he's never dated a girl.

366
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:21,041
Maybe he's waiting for the right one.

367
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,833
That's me! I'm definitely his right one.

368
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:28,750
It must be my destiny and you're my cupid.

369
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,375
Let's drop the subject.

370
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,083
Where shall we go tomorrow?

371
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,750
Tomorrow after class
Non will give me a birthday treat.

372
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,625
He asked for you to come along.

373
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,375
I happened to tell him
that we have the same birthday.

374
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,375
So he wants to treat you too.

375
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,666
Bota, rehearsal time!

376
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,416
Okay. That's all for now.

377
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,291
Poppy.

378
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,791
Can you try on the costume now?

379
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,041
If it doesn't fit,
we'll have time to fix it.

380
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,000
Right.

381
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,708
That was good, but can you be more--

382
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:21,958
Director,

383
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,166
I need two people on stage
to set up the light.

384
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,458
You, there.

385
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,583
Dance with him, would you?

386
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,166
Me?

387
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,458
I can't dance.

388
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:46,791
It's just for marking.

389
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,958
Just follow Non's lead. Come up here.

390
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,416
Come!

391
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,208
Repeat the same routine,
but you have to lead her.

392
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,208
Ready?

393
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:07,875
May I?

394
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:31,958
Don't be nervous.

395
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,583
Ready! Music!

396
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:28,833
Bota.

397
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,208
What?

398
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:34,541
Your foot.

399
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,208
I'm sorry.

400
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,250
So sorry.

401
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,208
It's all right.

402
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,583
-Here you are.
-What?

403
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,666
Come on.

404
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,041
-What's up?
-Let's continue.

405
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:52,583
Okay.

406
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,291
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

407
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:57,666
Just twisted my ankle.

408
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,041
Thais are peace-loving

409
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,375
but do not fear to fight

410
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,291
They will never let anyone
threaten their sovereignty

411
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:11,000
Sacrificing every drop of their blood
for the nation

412
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,791
Hail the nation of Thailand

413
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:16,125
Long last the victory
Hurrah

414
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:21,875
Tanil!

415
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Tanil!

416
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,083
Tanil!

417
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,208
-Take him to the nurse.
-Yes, sir.

418
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,041
Can you walk?

419
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,708
What are you doing?

420
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,708
She hasn't replied to my letters lately.

421
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:59,625
Usually, I'm not anxious
about something like this.

422
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,458
I want to give her a present
that makes her feel special.

423
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,833
Help me pick something.

424
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,541
Do it yourself.

425
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,916
You don't need me.

426
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,333
I do because you're my best friend.

427
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:18,416
You know my feelings more than anyone.

428
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,791
Right?

429
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,125
Kajorn.

430
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,791
This? It looks like her.

431
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:42,791
Or this?

432
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:06,291
This is perfect.

433
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,416
See? You know me best.

434
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:12,875
How much is it?

435
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,875
Happy Birthday to you

436
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,291
-I'll put it on a plate.
-Thank you.

437
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,583
Thanks.

438
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,958
I have presents for both of you.

439
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:49,750
I'm taking this one.

440
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,750
Thanks.

441
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,208
What is it? A bomb?

442
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,666
Actually, I meant to give you this one.

443
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:02,583
Thank you. It must be something special.

444
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,500
Obviously.

445
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,208
Poppy.

446
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,375
I'm going home.

447
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,000
Have some cake with us first.

448
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,333
I'd better go.

449
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,541
Thank you for the present.

450
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,708
Can you take me home later?

451
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:43,625
Yes.

452
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:09,583
I don't want it.

453
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,333
Look, it's not my dad's idea.

454
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,666
I want to give it to you.

455
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,083
I really like you.

456
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,541
That brooch. You chose it, didn't you?

457
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,291
Didn't you care
about how Tanil and I would feel?

458
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,166
I'm sorry.

459
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,625
I wanted to buy it for you.

460
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,125
But I couldn't afford it.

461
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,000
Tanil saw me holding it.

462
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,416
He took it and went to pay for it.

463
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,541
Tanil is an idiot.

464
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,625
No.

465
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,250
He's a good guy.

466
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,750
He's an idiot.

467
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,416
Because he's too good.

468
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,791
He's perfect for you.

469
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,708
We shouldn't see each other again.

470
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:55,000
Our love will only hurt everyone.

471
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:01,291
I won't see you and Tanil again.

472
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,166
When the sun shines in the morning,

473
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,291
I think of you.

474
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,208
When the moon sparkles at night,

475
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:02,583
I think of you.

476
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:33,291
When the sun shines in the morning,
I think of you.

477
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:39,666
When the moon sparkles at night,
I think of you.

478
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:08,500
Wait, Dalah.

479
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Can we talk?

480
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,916
Please.

481
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:19,208
Can we just be like we used to be?

482
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,666
Between us, it's impossible.

483
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,041
No.

484
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,375
There's got to be a way.

485
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,458
Why are you doing this?

486
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,291
You'll die of pneumonia.

487
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,500
I'm doing this...

488
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,833
because I love you.

489
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:40,208
Hi, there.

490
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:44,750
Hi.

491
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:50,416
Wait.

492
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,333
Where are you going?

493
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,791
To the library.

494
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,625
But the library is that way.

495
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,625
It's not that far.

496
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,000
If we hop around the buildings,
we won't get soaked.

497
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:29,875
I'll walk with you.

498
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,250
I have a magic umbrella.

499
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,416
Ready?

500
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:48,500
One, two, three.

501
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:09,666
It's still there and has never changed

502
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:16,000
Still beautiful and valuable in my heart

503
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:23,250
The memory of someone I once knew

504
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,375
Ready?

505
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,250
Even though we said goodbye

506
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:30,291
But I still remember everything

507
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,625
One promise

508
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:36,750
I could tell by looking into your eyes

509
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:42,375
My heart does not need any reason

510
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,375
Holding your hand

511
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,875
I still remember that day

512
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:56,166
There are words that
only two of us would understand

513
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:01,833
It's still there and has never changed

514
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:08,375
Still beautiful and valuable in my heart

515
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,875
The memory of someone I once knew

516
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,208
Even though we said goodbye

517
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:23,416
I still remember everything

518
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:38,875
Thank you so much.

519
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,000
No problem.

520
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,125
I'd better go.

521
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,750
See you again.

522
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,250
I've made up my mind.

523
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:48,125
I'll confess
that I didn't write those letters myself.

524
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,083
She's now sick in a hospital.

525
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:53,000
What's wrong with her?

526
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,708
The flu's got her again.

527
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,375
No idea why she likes
to go out in the rain.

528
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,916
How long have you been sitting there?

529
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,250
A long while.

530
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:33,416
I didn't want to wake you up.

531
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,625
Why are you covering your face?

532
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:37,750
No.

533
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,625
I haven't washed my face.

534
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,208
I've got sticky eyes, I look horrible.

535
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,375
You look as beautiful as always.

536
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:47,833
Nothing horrible about you.

537
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,333
How did you know I was here?

538
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,375
Tanil told you?

539
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:08,750
Are you very sick?

540
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:15,500
I'm sorry.

541
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,083
I always do stupid things.

542
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,791
Apart from loving you...

543
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,416
I'm not good at anything at all.

544
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,375
That's not true.

545
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,833
You're good at many things.

546
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,458
Especially writing romantic letters.

547
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:50,333
This afternoon,
Tanil came to tell me everything.

548
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,208
I was stunned.

549
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,583
But I'm happy too...

550
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,958
to know that those words
have been coming from you.

551
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,791
I've made up my mind.

552
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:12,750
I'm going to tell Tanil everything.

553
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,875
That's only fair to everyone.

554
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,541
Don't worry.

555
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:30,958
Get well soon.

556
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,541
What's up with you?

557
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,166
Make a fist.

558
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:10,583
Why?

559
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,583
Hit me. Hit me hard.

560
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,833
Do it. Do it now!

561
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,666
Why are you doing this?

562
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,708
Because I'm a terrible friend.

563
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,750
I like Dalah.

564
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,916
I met her and liked her before
you asked me to write the letters.

565
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,250
But I didn't have the guts to tell you.

566
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:46,833
I remember that necklace.

567
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,791
It belonged to her late mother.

568
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,708
I've suspected you and Dalah
might have feelings for each other.

569
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,875
At first I courted her
just to please my dad.

570
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:05,083
But when I got to know her,
I really fell for her.

571
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,791
That shouldn't be a problem.

572
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:13,541
A handsome guy like me
can always find a new girl.

573
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:18,750
If you keep writing to her,

574
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,750
put my name down on the envelope as usual,

575
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,583
so her family won't get suspicious.

576
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,083
I thought I knew love.

577
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:30,625
Now all I know is loss.

578
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,833
Do you really need so many of them?

579
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,833
Not really.

580
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,541
Just in case.

581
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,250
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

582
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,958
I miss you.

583
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,916
If I missed you more my heart would break.

584
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,458
Please say hello to the river
and the fireflies for me.

585
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:05,500
Tell them I miss them so much.

586
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,083
And that I'm doing fine here.

587
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,416
-Your letter.
-Thank you.

588
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:19,166
I'm jealous of the sun for it gets
to wake you up in the morning.

589
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,250
I'm jealous of the water
for it gets to kiss you every day.

590
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:25,916
Whenever you look out the window

591
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:29,083
and see tree branches
dancing with the wind,

592
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:34,416
please remember 
that the one you love is loving you too.

593
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,750
It's school break now.

594
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:45,166
Couples go out, walking hand in hand.

595
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:48,083
But I can only write you letters.

596
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,416
I miss you so much.

597
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,750
Please wait for me.

598
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:56,333
I'm going to ask my dad
to let me visit Grandpa's.

599
01:12:56,583 --> 01:13:01,625
I long for the day
I'll see your face again.

600
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,041
On a long and lonely night,

601
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,041
close your eyes
and put your ear to the pillow.

602
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:13,625
You'll hear our song in your dream,

603
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:17,166
singing, "I love you."

604
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:03,583
Bota.

605
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:04,958
Here's Non's umbrella.

606
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,875
Can you give it back to him?

607
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,750
Why are you asking me?

608
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:20,333
Remember that day when it rained so hard?

609
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,708
Did you bring your umbrella?

610
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,458
Guess I didn't.

611
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,250
It really is a magic umbrella.

612
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,000
I'll return it to him.

613
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:17,500
It's still there and has never changed

614
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:23,916
Still beautiful and valuable in my heart

615
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:32,083
The memory of someone I once knew

616
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,916
Even though we said goodbye

617
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,750
I still remember everything

618
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:51,958
Poppy.

619
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,000
What's wrong?

620
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,958
I just told Non...

621
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,166
I liked him.

622
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,791
He didn't say a word back.

623
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:10,750
He must have someone else.

624
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:19,250
All this time I thought he liked me.

625
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:23,333
Why is it like this?

626
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,083
It's okay.

627
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,458
Everything will be all right.

628
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,708
Hello?

629
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:07,333
I don't think I can help you
with the play anymore.

630
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,958
My grades have dropped.

631
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:12,125
I need to focus on my studies.

632
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,458
I'm sorry.

633
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,708
Thank you.

634
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,958
Bye.

635
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:40,666
When the sun shines in the morning,
I think of you.

636
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,666
Kajorn and Dalah are so much in love.

637
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:05,916
I tried but she never even saw me.

638
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,958
Because you're a good-for-nothing.

639
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,916
Never once did you succeed
in what I asked you to do.

640
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,333
She's the daughter of a bigshot MP.

641
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:23,708
Do you realize that you're
jeopardizing our family business?

642
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:26,708
Please don't hit me, Dad.
I'll make her like me. I promise.

643
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:31,041
Please don't, Dad! I'm sorry.
Don't hit me.

644
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,041
That's enough.

645
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,916
See? Because you're so weak.

646
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
The boy's a total failure.

647
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:39,833
Don't hit Mom. Please.

648
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,250
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

649
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,250
You're a curse to the family.

650
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,500
I shouldn't have a son like you.

651
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,416
-Dalah.
-Yes, Dad.

652
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:06,375
Good morning.

653
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:07,541
Good morning.

654
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:23,375
You'll arrive
during the Songkran festival.

655
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,541
I'll be waiting at the station.

656
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:35,666
BAN DIN LAN

657
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,958
-Take him to the nurse.
-Yes, sir.

658
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:13,250
Tanil!

659
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:17,708
Help! He's hung himself!

660
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,250
Help!

661
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,333
Tanil!

662
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:23,166
Why are you doing this? Tanil!

663
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,750
Tanil! Wake up!

664
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,083
Help!

665
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:29,125
Why did you do this?

666
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:32,500
Wake up! Tanil! Wake up!

667
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:54,833
TO EVERYONE I LOVE - TANIL

668
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:30,083
Go and sit by the bed.

669
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,083
When he opens his eyes...

670
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,166
and you're the first person he sees,
he will be very happy.

671
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,916
Come on, you'd better wake up soon.

672
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,958
So we'll go out
and have fun together again.

673
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:28,583
Remember when we went dancing?

674
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:36,083
Next time I'll you teach you a new move.

675
01:24:58,041 --> 01:24:58,958
Kajorn!

676
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,166
Kajorn!

677
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:45,416
Kajorn!

678
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:47,666
Kajorn!

679
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:56,375
Kajorn!

680
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:00,833
Kajorn!

681
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,250
Kajorn!

682
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:03,833
FIRST LOVE

683
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:24,916
1973

684
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,375
Listen up, folks!

685
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:35,125
We must stand united
to fight the imperialist nations

686
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:38,416
that are using their influence
to take control of our country.

687
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,416
-We will never give in.
-Never!

688
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,416
-We will never give up.
-Never!

689
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,083
-Get out!
-Get out!

690
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,041
-Never give in.
-Never give up.

691
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,500
-Get out!
-Get out!

692
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,166
-Never give in.
-Never give up.

693
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,458
-Get out!
-Get out!

694
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:55,166
-Never give in.
-Never give up.

695
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,333
-Never give in.
-Never give up.

696
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,041
-Get out!
-Get out!

697
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,833
Come this way.

698
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,166
Come!

699
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:14,875
Run! Quickly!

700
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:18,958
Give me some water!

701
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,833
Are you okay? Get up.

702
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:28,041
Get back there!

703
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:29,833
This way.

704
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,583
Over here.

705
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,041
Sit down.

706
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,500
-Wash your face with this.
-Thank you.

707
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:44,458
Keep running!

708
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,666
Go this way!

709
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,625
You okay now?

710
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,500
Tanil...

711
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:05,000
You look much better.

712
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:09,166
Mature, serious, like a different person.

713
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,541
After what happened,

714
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:14,958
I decided to grow up
and turn myself around.

715
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:18,208
What about you?

716
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:20,250
What are you doing here?

717
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:24,916
I just finished college
and am looking for a job.

718
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:29,375
Today I came for a test
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

719
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:31,000
Maybe I won't get it.

720
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,583
I'm sure you will.

721
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,458
Back then, if I hadn't been so stupid,

722
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:40,541
I would've had a degree by now
instead of ending up a permanent dropout.

723
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:54,500
And... have you heard from Kajorn?

724
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,291
The trucks are leaving!

725
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:14,500
Excuse me.

726
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,250
Kajorn!

727
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:33,375
Kajorn!

728
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:36,208
Kajorn!

729
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:48,375
Kajorn!

730
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:50,958
Kajorn!

731
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:54,583
Kajorn!

732
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:57,125
Kajorn!

733
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:00,208
Do you hear me?

734
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:03,291
Look at me!

735
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:05,666
Kajorn.

736
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,250
What have I done wrong?

737
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:13,625
Look at me.

738
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:18,041
Kajorn!

739
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:20,458
-Kajorn!
-Kajorn!

740
01:31:21,791 --> 01:31:22,708
Kajorn!

741
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:27,916
Kajorn!

742
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:30,500
Kajorn!

743
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,625
Kajorn!

744
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:47,291
You have to come back.

745
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,791
Take care of yourself.

746
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:57,416
Kajorn.

747
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:01,208
I've missed you.

748
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:02,750
Make it back, pal!

749
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:58,375
Shit!

750
01:32:58,916 --> 01:32:59,916
Medic!

751
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,625
Medic!

752
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:05,791
-Medic.
-He's dead.

753
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:06,750
Medic!

754
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:24,208
Pull out!

755
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:30,708
Run. Hurry.

756
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:32,625
Go!

757
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:38,000
Kajorn!

758
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,458
Kajorn.

759
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:36,458
Cover him!

760
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:38,083
On the right!

761
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:42,250
Over here.

762
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,833
It's been ages.
You're still as beautiful as ever.

763
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,333
Not really...

764
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm getting old.

765
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:06,625
You still look good too.

766
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:23,000
How have you been?
I haven't heard from you for a while.

767
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,166
I'm so sorry.

768
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,958
I've been busy.

769
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:27,375
Are you doing well?

770
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,875
Yes.

771
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,791
I have something to tell you.

772
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:48,458
Tell me, then.

773
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,500
I got married.

774
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,291
Congratulations.

775
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:05,458
Why haven't you married yet?

776
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,791
You must have many admirers.

777
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:10,875
I'm a workaholic.

778
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:14,000
So I haven't been thinking of marriage.

779
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,916
I have so many things to tell you.

780
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:24,333
But when I see you,

781
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,666
I forget about everything.

782
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:38,375
Look at that little piano.

783
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:43,666
It brings back the memory of that day
when I heard you play so beautifully.

784
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:51,208
I wish I could hear you play again.

785
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,291
It'd be a shame if I don't get a chance.

786
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:03,208
It's funny thinking about us...

787
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,458
We were so naive.

788
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,416
We let emotions get the better of us.

789
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:18,041
When something happened...

790
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:20,833
we laughed...

791
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:24,041
and we cried too.

792
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:29,708
But the past is the past.

793
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:35,458
I know I have to endure

794
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:39,375
How do I look now?

795
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:43,041
Not to fall for you again

796
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:45,083
You look cheerful and happy.

797
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:50,125
But I want to see you look even happier.

798
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:57,541
I will let you go

799
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:00,125
Kajorn, I'm crying.

800
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,083
Don't you see my tears?

801
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,000
How long do you think
you could hide it from me?

802
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:15,000
I'm ready to forget everything

803
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:19,416
I'm ready to stay away

804
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:24,333
Let our memories fade away

805
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:29,833
I know I can't do it

806
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:34,041
I'm willing to get hurt

807
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:41,375
When I think of our past

808
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,750
I almost did it.

809
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:53,458
No.

810
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:59,458
But you were so convincing.

811
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:04,583
I almost believed you.

812
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:11,291
I know you won't come

813
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:15,791
I don't want to think too much

814
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:20,958
Truthfully
I didn't think it would be hard

815
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:23,916
I came to return this to you.

816
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,375
Thinking that you're no longer with me

817
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:34,541
But it is so difficult

818
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:42,583
I'm ready to forget everything

819
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:45,916
I'm ready to stay away

820
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:50,583
Let our memories fade away

821
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:53,583
I know I can't

822
01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:55,041
Keep it.

823
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,458
I'm not ready for the agony

824
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,750
It's been yours...

825
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,833
since the first day we met.

826
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:12,666
I'm ready to stay away

827
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:17,041
Let our memories fade away

828
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:22,041
I know I can't

829
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:25,916
I'm not ready for the agony

830
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,666
When I think of 

831
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:35,166
Our past

832
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:19,041
It's strange that my story
and my mom's are remarkably similar.

833
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:24,041
We choose what we think is best
for the man we love,

834
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:28,000
but in exchange for pain.

835
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:34,750
Her letter has taught me
a deeper meaning of love.

836
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:43,291
But I don't want my love
to end the same way as hers.

837
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:48,583
Now, I don't know what will happen...

838
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:57,541
but I've decided to try
saving this love in my own way.

839
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:46,041
I hope I've made the right choice.

840
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,416
Poppy. Non.

841
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:09,416
It's not raining.

842
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,291
What's with the umbrella?

843
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:18,458
I have something to tell you.

844
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:24,791
I...

845
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,750
I've liked Non...

846
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,041
from the very beginning.

847
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:44,291
Hold on.

848
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:46,666
I...

849
01:45:56,208 --> 01:45:58,166
Why didn't anyone tell me?

850
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:00,416
Bota.

851
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,291
What the hell?

852
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,541
Poppy, wait!

853
01:46:51,916 --> 01:46:53,583
I'm learning to play the guitar.

854
01:46:53,916 --> 01:46:55,708
I'm still not very good at it.

855
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:59,083
But I wanted to play this song for you.

856
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:00,583
Please listen.

857
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:37,250
Love comes with the wind

858
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:40,500
Nestles closely

859
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:44,000
With care

860
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:48,083
When I first met you

861
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:52,958
Everything became so beautiful

862
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:59,666
We met because of destiny

863
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:05,083
I know you think the same

864
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,083
Two hearts united as one

865
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:17,500
This is our eternal love

866
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,416
Play with me.

867
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:31,625
Come on.

868
01:48:39,791 --> 01:48:41,208
Stay here.

869
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:22,500
What's that?

870
01:49:51,666 --> 01:49:54,166
I WANT TO BE THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE

871
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:18,541
Toom.

872
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:20,791
Still here?

873
01:51:21,291 --> 01:51:23,333
Your date won't be waiting for you.

874
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:30,875
Toom's just left.

875
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,166
She asked you to look after the shop too?

876
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,708
She didn't tell me.

877
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:45,375
Get to work, then.

878
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,750
Why do we always have the same taste?

879
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:09,125
It's you...

880
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:11,458
who copies my taste.

881
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,750
So you and Non...

882
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,458
Did you do it?

883
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:32,875
Stop it!

884
01:52:35,458 --> 01:52:38,666
I heard you auditioned
for professional theater.

885
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,625
How was it?

886
01:52:39,708 --> 01:52:40,916
I got a supporting role.

887
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:43,166
That's awesome.

888
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:45,833
My friend's going to be a star.

889
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:51,791
I was lucky to be in the play you wrote.

890
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,291
They saw my potential there.

891
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:56,500
It wasn't really my play.

892
01:52:57,333 --> 01:52:59,666
It's all my mom's story.

893
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,958
You know what?

894
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:08,625
I thought your mom's letters
were a trick of destiny

895
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:11,166
to bring me and Non together.

896
01:53:12,125 --> 01:53:14,083
With you as my cupid.

897
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:21,416
Turned out I was the bad guy
who got in the way of the leading couple.

898
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:25,666
Don't be such a drama queen.

899
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:29,375
What can I do?

900
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:32,166
I'm on my way to become a famous actress.

901
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:41,000
It's nice here.

902
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:42,250
Pretty windy.

903
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:45,125
You could get blown away.

904
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:48,791
After that day...

905
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:52,875
did they ever meet again?

906
01:53:58,083 --> 01:54:00,375
No, my mom didn't meet Kajorn again.

907
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:04,708
Then, after he passed away...

908
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:26,083
Miss Dalah.

909
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:35,125
Thank you for coming.

910
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:37,416
Do you remember me?

911
01:54:38,041 --> 01:54:40,250
I'm Kajorn's friend.

912
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:41,541
And also...

913
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:43,708
his brother-in-law.

914
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:48,875
You were in the gang
that snuck into Grandpa's orchard.

915
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,375
Yes.

916
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:57,750
Before Kajorn died,
he asked me to give this to you.

917
01:54:58,791 --> 01:54:59,708
Here.

918
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:18,125
He wanted you to keep it.

919
01:55:18,416 --> 01:55:22,375
After you got married,

920
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:24,458
he married my sister.

921
01:55:28,291 --> 01:55:30,125
They have a son.

922
01:55:48,625 --> 01:55:50,375
Please, excuse me.

923
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:30,750
Mommy, look at the rainbow.

924
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:47,375
I still remember that rainbow.

925
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:55,958
It was the biggest
and most beautiful one I've ever seen.

926
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:11,375
I remember that rainbow, too.
