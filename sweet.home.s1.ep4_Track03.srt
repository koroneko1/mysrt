1
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:21,459
He could still be alive.

2
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:24,628
No.

3
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:27,673
Move out of the way.

4
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,256
She died because of you.

5
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,966
If only I'd gone out sooner…

6
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,805
This is your fault.

7
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,227
You killed her.

8
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,467
ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

9
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,919
You can't trust that announcement.

10
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:32,131
Will you really be okay?

11
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:36,844
We can't keep sponging off you.
We should do something.

12
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:39,346
Thank you for the meals and this.

13
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,599
May God bless you.

14
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,727
I'm Buddhist.

15
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:50,441
If the first floor is safe,
we'll come back to get you.

16
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,819
Don't make a promise you can't keep.

17
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,405
I feel like

18
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:58,908
I should say farewell now.

19
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,499
Someone once said that
even the thickest darkness

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,169
disappears with the faintest light.

21
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,632
Is the person who said that still alive?

22
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,801
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:19,887
I…

24
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,351
Can I go with you?

25
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,520
I guess three is better than two. Right?

26
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,564
Of course.

27
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,566
Okay.

28
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,651
Go.

29
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,570
Go. All of you.

30
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:46,538
Hyun-su, you have to come back, okay?

31
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:53,963
Okay.

32
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,924
Thank you for saving us.

33
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,012
Shall we get going?

34
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,224
Thank you.

35
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,963
Suddenly,

36
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,217
I'm like the head of a kindergarten.

37
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:47,474
AUGUST 18, 2020
DAY 4 OF CONFINEMENT

38
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,936
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS GLAD TO HEAR
THE APARTMENT PA ANNOUNCEMENT

39
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,688
I WANTED TO GO AS SOON AS I HEARD HIM

40
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:54,732
URGE US TO GO DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR

41
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,652
I THINK WE SHOULD GO DOWN
FOR YU-RI'S SAKE

42
00:04:58,736 --> 00:04:59,987
I think it's time to leave.

43
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,322
Not yet, sir.

44
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,784
I'm praying hard for you
to live a long life.

45
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,619
No, I didn't mean this world.

46
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:10,789
I meant here. This disgustingly small,

47
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,666
dirty old room.

48
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,003
But isn't this place
younger than you, sir?

49
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,963
How long have you been living here?

50
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:20,132
Let me see.

51
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,009
Hold on.

52
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:29,058
Was it since the independence

53
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,101
or the Korean War?

54
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,606
Your life has been extended just now.

55
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:45,282
I guess I won't die anytime soon
thanks to you.

56
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,542
What are you doing?

57
00:05:57,086 --> 00:06:00,089
Didn't you hear the announcement?
I should go to the first floor to help.

58
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,549
Could you be of any help?

59
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,057
Careful.

60
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,995
She must be devastated.

61
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:34,832
If my Bom died,

62
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,252
I think I'd be devastated, too.

63
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,006
I think this is a little different.

64
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:44,925
No, it's not.

65
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,469
Bom is family to me.

66
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,264
Still,

67
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:54,518
it can't be the same
as losing your own child.

68
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:57,438
You don't have kids, either.

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,398
You wouldn't know what it's like.

70
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:06,405
-Right.
-Anyway, I feel really bad

71
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:09,867
for Ms. Cha and the firefighter lady.

72
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:11,994
What about her?

73
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:15,330
Her fiancé used to live here.

74
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,334
He died.

75
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,004
The wedding's supposed to be in two days.

76
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,089
What happened to him?

77
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,510
I don't know.

78
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:31,472
What do you think happened?

79
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,894
She seemed so poised. I had no idea.

80
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,442
But what's taking her so long?

81
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:45,861
Do you think something happened to her?

82
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,984
SANG-WON

83
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:14,861
Sang-won.

84
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:36,007
The cellphone's out of service anyway.

85
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:37,300
Exactly.

86
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:40,804
But how'd she know her daughter
was coming?

87
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,222
It's a mystery.

88
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,641
Do you think she's possessed?

89
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,852
Possessed? No, she's just crazy.

90
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,771
I feel bad for her.

91
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,316
Anyway,
you better watch out for Eun-hyeok.

92
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,486
That guy is totally heartless.

93
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,614
That's bullshit. He saved your life.

94
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:00,741
What are you talking about?

95
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:02,868
If he hadn't stopped you,

96
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,536
you'd be dead like that soldier.

97
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,955
Hey, Seok-hyeon.

98
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:10,041
It's so reassuring
to have you as the leader.

99
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,794
Leader, my ass. I don't want that job.

100
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,881
But we can't let that four-eyes
be the leader.

101
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,380
I'm glad you're okay.

102
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,594
You knew

103
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,305
there was a monster, didn't you?

104
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:11,269
Yi-kyung.

105
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,109
I was worried about you.

106
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:20,195
Are you okay?

107
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,047
This is not a drill.

108
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:42,092
This is not a drill.

109
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:43,552
BREAKING NEWS

110
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,389
As of 24:00 on August 17, 2020,
martial law has been declared

111
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:51,226
throughout the Republic of Korea
in accordance with Article 77, Section 1

112
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,937
of the Constitution and Article 2,
Section 2 of the Martial Law Act.

113
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,233
The military will be in charge
of all security and civil affairs.

114
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:01,069
The military has confirmed that
an unspecified number of people

115
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:03,321
have been turning into unknown creatures.

116
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,115
The exact cause is still unknown,

117
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:07,742
but it is believed
to be related to human desire.

118
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,911
It is not a respiratory
or blood-borne infection.

119
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,664
Quarantine those who show symptoms
of hypothermia,

120
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:15,834
nosebleeds, fainting, and auditory
or visual hallucinations.

121
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:19,796
These creatures have excellent
resilience and regenerative abilities.

122
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,257
Before an individual turns,
there is a period of time

123
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,718
when they cannot recover
from severe lacerations or damage.

124
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:28,096
It is the only time
these creatures can be killed.

125
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,807
We have thus termed this
the "golden hour."

126
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,729
All captured creatures

127
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,063
should be incinerated.

128
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,152
Currently, this is the only action
civilians can take.

129
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,494
The military can and will
solve the current situation.

130
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,371
Survive.

131
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:54,915
Good luck.

132
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,835
See? We're fine.

133
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,588
The military will come and rescue us
if we hold out.

134
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,839
I knew it.

135
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:05,008
She just told us to survive on our own.

136
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,134
Is that what she meant?

137
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,011
Desire makes you a monster?

138
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,221
-Does that make sense?
-You saw them roaming outside.

139
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:12,599
She told us to survive.

140
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:14,768
-That's what she meant, right?
-What?

141
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:16,311
That's it!

142
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:18,605
-But the president died.
-Is that really what she meant?

143
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,690
-Yes, of course.
-What do you mean by hold out?

144
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,192
-What?
-Do you really believe that?

145
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:24,069
-We all saw it.
-Pay back what you owe!

146
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:36,081
Seriously?

147
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:42,921
Is it okay to go downstairs like this?

148
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,632
Shouldn't we grab something useful?

149
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,342
The most useful thing is our lives.

150
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:58,853
It's a person.

151
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,272
I'm relieved to see a corpse.

152
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,823
It's still warm.

153
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:12,575
He hasn't been dead for long.

154
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,868
Oh, God.

155
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:32,220
Put it back if you don't want it.

156
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:36,224
-You're mean.
-Yes, I am.

157
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,437
I can do worse things to survive.

158
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:48,570
You're an accomplice now.

159
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:52,157
Let's go.

160
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,697
Don't die. Why did you die?

161
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,367
You can't leave me here all alone.

162
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,622
Don't die, please. I beg you.

163
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:48,421
MOON HYEON-SUK, CHA SU-A

164
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,381
-Is he dead?
-No.

165
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,425
He isn't dead.

166
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,886
I thought he'd die.

167
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:59,224
-Do you know him?
-No.

168
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:01,017
Don't go near him.

169
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,895
-We can't leave the infected here.
-Take this monster out.

170
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,610
Dad…

171
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,447
You really fell.

172
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:22,914
When I told you not to die here,
I meant the whole building.

173
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,291
Where am I?

174
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:29,420
It's a place where everyone gathered,
waiting to die.

175
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,049
What about the other two?

176
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,678
They're safe.

177
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,808
I guess you aren't as shitty as I thought.

178
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,811
You should worry about yourself, not them.

179
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:46,729
Pardon?

180
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:48,356
Eun-yu.

181
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:58,283
You're fine.

182
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,203
You fell from the 9th floor
and woke up in 3 hours.

183
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,581
Maybe the golden hour saved you.

184
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,792
Isn't it ironic?

185
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:10,420
The golden hour used to mean
the last hour to save someone.

186
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,048
Now it means the only possible period
of time to destroy someone.

187
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:19,596
How do you feel?

188
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,272
I think I'm okay.

189
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:30,815
Good.

190
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,693
It's going to be tough from here on out.

191
00:19:35,945 --> 00:19:37,197
What is it?

192
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,990
Why did he call us?

193
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,075
-What?
-Keep going.

194
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,704
You're out of your mind.

195
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:48,333
You brought a frigging monster in here.

196
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,213
Don't you dare turn.

197
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:57,425
Got it? You fucking monster.

198
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:03,431
Answer when an adult speaks to you.

199
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:06,809
Got it.

200
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,438
-What?
-We can't do that.

201
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,690
I don't intend on missing the golden hour.

202
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:14,859
-The Lord said--
-I'm sure Jesus never lived

203
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:16,945
in a world like this, did He?

204
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,113
It's for everyone's safety.

205
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:20,698
Here.

206
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,825
What is that?

207
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,662
Each of you take a piece of paper.

208
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,749
If you think we should oust Hyun-su,
draw a circle.

209
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,294
And if you don't think we should,
draw an X.

210
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:35,004
Then put the paper in this box.

211
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:37,173
Obviously, he'll be kicked out.
Why bother?

212
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,468
Just do a show of hands. I want him out.

213
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,011
Who wants him out?

214
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:45,765
Why don't you raise your hand?

215
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:48,726
I don't.

216
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:52,563
You aren't old enough to vote.

217
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:54,482
Are we electing the president?

218
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,401
Age doesn't matter.

219
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,194
How dare you talk back?

220
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,863
When an adult says something,
you should shut up and agree.

221
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,368
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

222
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,538
Did you just swear at me?

223
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm old enough to be your dad.
How dare you!

224
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,418
No, I didn't.

225
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:15,795
I said you're the best.

226
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,423
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

227
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:25,430
To protect everyone's privacy,
it must be a secret ballot.

228
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,389
What?

229
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,351
Because ousting him…

230
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:33,604
would be taking part in murder.

231
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,744
Privacy? My ass.

232
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,579
I want him out. Out!

233
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:51,789
Murder?

234
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,585
We're making this decision to survive.

235
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:57,045
Don't be scared!

236
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,715
Hey, aren't you going to raise your hand?

237
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:02,216
What? Well…

238
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,302
Raise your hand, you stupid cow.

239
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:06,679
I think Eun-hyeok has a point.

240
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:11,142
Isn't it better not to know
who agreed to oust him?

241
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,520
It's only natural to vote
in a democratic country.

242
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,648
Democracy? The world is coming to an end.

243
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:20,568
Stop calling your wife names

244
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:23,029
and using profanities.

245
00:22:23,112 --> 00:22:24,322
It's very offensive.

246
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,200
Why you…

247
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,452
-How dare you tell me what--
-Enough.

248
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,710
IN FAVOR, 8

249
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,712
OPPOSED, 7

250
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,675
There are eight in favor
and seven opposed.

251
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:32,098
If one of the last two ballots is
in favor, he'll be ousted.

252
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:35,101
Seven people opposed?

253
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,561
Are you guys crazy?

254
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:38,312
Opposed.

255
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:39,689
It's eight to eight.

256
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:42,984
Damn it.

257
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:44,610
Did you oppose?

258
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:47,238
I didn't.

259
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,200
All the bitches and bastards on his side

260
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:52,368
should all be thrown out!

261
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:53,661
Hey, mister!

262
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,746
Don't get worked up yet.

263
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,293
This last vote will determine the result.

264
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:17,935
Invalid.

265
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:24,484
No way.

266
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:30,156
Hey, bring that bastard here.

267
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,365
Me?

268
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:33,701
Yes! We have to get rid of him
as fast as we can!

269
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,373
Voting, my ass.

270
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:41,000
Are you all nuts?

271
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,836
Did you already forget that someone died?

272
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,172
Are you against the result?

273
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:49,467
What? "Taking part in murder?"

274
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,969
Murder is killing a human being,

275
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,056
not a monster!

276
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:05,191
Honey.

277
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:06,817
Honey…

278
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,615
This is…

279
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:15,117
It's because I'm tired.

280
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,869
-Don't come near us!
-Don't!

281
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:18,412
It's because I'm tired!

282
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:24,418
You better brace yourself.

283
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:26,128
What?

284
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,757
If you don't want to be eaten
by a monster.

285
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,759
You son of a bitch.

286
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,726
Do I have the right to vote?

287
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:49,402
If I put this in,
he'll be thrown out with me, right?

288
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:53,114
Am I right?

289
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:07,503
He looks like he's just a kid.

290
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:09,589
A handsome kid.

291
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:12,842
Didn't you see how much he bled
and still didn't die?

292
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,845
You can't judge someone on their looks.

293
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:18,848
Would he survive a shot to the head?

294
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:20,349
How can we kill him then?

295
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:23,060
-Can we?
-How can you…

296
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:24,395
Did you vote in favor?

297
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,189
You're the murder accomplices.

298
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:28,983
What if he turns into a monster?

299
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:30,234
Will you leave him like that?

300
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:33,070
Can someone explain

301
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:34,905
why this is happening?

302
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:38,284
Is it because of a virus?

303
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,660
It's because of radiation.

304
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,621
Come on. Didn't you guys watch the news?

305
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:43,664
It's because of human desire.

306
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:47,543
Right. It must be because the owner
of the supermarket is so greedy.

307
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:49,086
Then what about Hyun-su?

308
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:50,755
What was his desire?

309
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:53,132
You better be careful, too.

310
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,093
It seemed your appetite
was out of control.

311
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:00,598
-It's because of radiation.
-Radiation?

312
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,724
We're getting punished.

313
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:06,854
It's God's punishment.

314
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:09,190
Yes. I agree.

315
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:12,068
That's the most plausible answer
I've heard so far.

316
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:15,321
Since we're all humans,

317
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,157
no one knows…

318
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:25,748
who will be next.

319
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,351
What?

320
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:48,229
Why am I…

321
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,148
You had a nosebleed and fainted.

322
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:54,402
I think it's pretty obvious.

323
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:01,200
That can't be…

324
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,120
Why now?

325
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,913
Why?

326
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:16,716
Well…

327
00:28:18,926 --> 00:28:20,344
I hear you're holding out.

328
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:23,597
How are you doing it?

329
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:25,433
How?

330
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,854
You're shameless.

331
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:35,693
I have to live. I want to live.

332
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:39,488
Pull yourself together.

333
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:42,575
What?

334
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:45,745
I have nothing else to tell you.

335
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,969
It's a good thing. Don't you think?

336
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,096
He beat you every day.

337
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,390
What? Did I say something wrong?

338
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,642
Divorcees are considered hot these days.

339
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:10,394
A new life lies before you.

340
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:22,323
Excuse me.

341
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,743
I can't find Su-ung anywhere.

342
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:29,789
Oh, my… I guess you haven't heard.

343
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,082
Ms. Cha's daughter

344
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,752
really came back.

345
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:40,382
And Su-ung went out to rescue her.

346
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,219
He barely took a few steps.

347
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,095
Whoosh! It got him.

348
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:57,942
We're stuck here.

349
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,862
GREEN HOME HAIR SALON

350
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,328
SANG-WON

351
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,746
Sang-won…

352
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:23,717
Here.

353
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,847
You must be starving.

354
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:35,771
Thank you.

355
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:39,024
Eat this and cheer up.

356
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,828
I'm sorry I stared.

357
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:54,748
Eat up.

358
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:08,554
What's wrong?

359
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:10,556
Is something wrong with it?

360
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,519
It tastes okay.

361
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:20,024
My stomach is a little upset.

362
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:02,816
She's very pretty.

363
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,199
Did you take many pictures of her?

364
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:12,409
I only took a few.

365
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,120
That's what I regret.

366
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:23,170
He was a good person.

367
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,264
You need energy to miss someone.

368
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:15,681
Is this funny to you?

369
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:18,851
You should quit music
and become a comedian.

370
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:21,311
Why don't you teach me then?

371
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:24,815
First, relax your body.

372
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,195
Spread your legs shoulder-width apart.

373
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,864
Keep your hands close.

374
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:35,117
Don't take your eyes off the ball.

375
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,844
It's disgusting to see you act nice.

376
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:59,433
Do you think a frigging chocolate bar
can cheer her up?

377
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,272
You did that to make yourself feel better.

378
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,483
Are you the crazy bitch around here?

379
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,652
Fine. Go head, you crazy bitch.

380
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:30,923
He doesn't die?

381
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:47,314
You're here?

382
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,942
You said see you again, son of a bitch!

383
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,915
Wait a minute.

384
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:12,464
I have something to say.

385
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:14,424
I…

386
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:44,121
I think I've turned into a monster.

387
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:53,547
Please lock me up.

388
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:01,305
When did you get here?

389
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:03,974
Did you see the news?

390
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,143
It's not infectious.

391
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:09,980
We're still fucked, though,

392
00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:12,482
because the world is doomed.

393
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,281
Moron.

394
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:23,660
He really looks like he got beat up.

395
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,370
He's the one who wants to be locked up.

396
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:26,997
Why did it happen to such a good man?

397
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,334
If you feel that bad,
you can get in there with him.

398
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:35,923
That's not the reason, is it?

399
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,510
Jeez.

400
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:47,035
Good morning.

401
00:37:47,744 --> 00:37:48,912
You must be hungry.

402
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:53,583
I'm good.

403
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:58,588
What?

404
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,759
A monster can't eat?

405
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,012
You sleep well, though.

406
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:15,480
What does it feel like?

407
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:20,694
You feel so powerful, don't you?

408
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:35,125
How can I become like that?

409
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,920
Tell me.

410
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,008
Tell me.

411
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:48,221
I can do it really well.

412
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:50,724
What should I do?

413
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,296
Here.

414
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:24,466
You can take it.

415
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:31,973
PREGNANCY TEST

416
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:34,976
It's okay.

417
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,436
You never know.

418
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:38,605
Just in case.

419
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:41,233
Okay?

420
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:47,364
PREGNANCY TEST

421
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:08,343
Amen.

422
00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:17,602
It was your voice, wasn't it?

423
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,106
"The first floor is quite safe for now."

424
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,816
Yes.

425
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:25,235
Did I hear you wrong?

426
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:31,992
That shield.

427
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:39,708
Who made it?

428
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:55,849
Mister.

429
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:57,809
What?

430
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,353
Ms. Im…

431
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:04,107
still hasn't come out of the bathroom.

432
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:08,653
Do you need to poop?

433
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:11,907
How long has she been in there?

434
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:14,868
It's been about an hour.

435
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:27,672
Okay. Step aside for a bit.

436
