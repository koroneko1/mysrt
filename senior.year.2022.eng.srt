00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,875
Okay, yeah, Dad, just press the circle.
Just once. Just press it--

4
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,166
-Okay, wait, tell me when we're going.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,833
-Okay. All right.
-Okay. Ready?

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,125
Okay. I know I have
some things to clear up, so…

7
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,833
I thought this is gonna be the best way.

8
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,875
If you don't like what I'm saying,
don't write in the comments

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,041
because I will not read it
and will not even care.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,791
Okay, here we go.

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,333
<i>When I moved to the US,</i>
<i>I knew fitting in was gonna be hard.</i>

12
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,625
<i>I just didn't know</i>
<i>how bloody hard it was going to be.</i>

13
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,625
<i>And all I wanted was to get invited</i>
<i>to the coolest club in town,</i>

14
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,875
<i>Rock 'N' Bowl.</i>

15
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,458
<i>But I never was.</i>

16
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,458
<i>Anyone who was anyone was rolling</i>
<i>with their homies on a Saturday night.</i>

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,666
<i>It was like basically a VMAs after-party.</i>

18
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,916
<i>So when I turned 14, uh, yeah,</i>
<i>that's where I had my birthday.</i>

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,125
-Ah! It's an alien baby.
-Ew!

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,125
That's gonna make me sick.
I think I'm gonna shit fireballs.

21
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,708
<i> Being there made me feel cool</i>
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>

22
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,833
Steph, you do one.

23
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,083
<i> I felt like</i>
<i>the kids I wanted to be.</i>

24
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:38,125
<i>You know, the ones who seem immune</i>
<i>to that awkward teen phase…</i>

25
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:43,333
<i>…the ones whose bones</i>
<i>have Jenga'd themselves into a hot frame.</i>

26
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,541
<i>The only bumps on their skin are abs,</i>

27
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>and their natural scent is perfect,</i>
<i>like CK One perfect.</i>

28
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,375
<i>-The populars.</i>
-Been looking for you.

29
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,125
'Sup, Blaine. Hey, Tiffany.

30
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,208
I'm having a birthday party,
if you guys wanna join.

31
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,291
Ooh, ooh.

32
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,541
Cute that in Australia
you call it a party,

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,208
'cause in America,
we call that a freak show.

34
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:13,208
Well, um, it's actually not a freak show
'cause we have cake, so…

35
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
Let's go.

36
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,500
<i> God, I just wanted</i>
<i>to be like them so bad.</i>

37
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,375
<i>If they were this amazing in high school,</i>

38
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,166
<i>imagine how perfect</i>
<i>the rest of their lives would be.</i>

39
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,125
Come on, Steph,
I wanna take more photos.

40
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,125
-Come on, Bobby!

41
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,583
You are too much.

42
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,791
Guys! Could we just, like, try to be cool
for once?

43
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,041
<i>I hated thinking</i>
that<i> life wasn't for me…</i>

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,333
<i>that I was destined to be</i>

45
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:53,666
<i>just some average, boring, invisible girl</i>
<i>who had no friends.</i>

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,000
<i>In Australia, we call that a Nigel,</i>
<i>but whatever.</i>

47
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,625
<i>You guys know what I mean.</i>

48
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,416
<i>I wanted to be something more.</i>

49
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,875
<i>And that's when I decided…</i>

50
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,625
<i>…that's it.</i>
<i>I'm gonna become popular.</i>

51
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,708
I know your favorite is
"I Want It That Way,"

52
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,041
but it's my favorite too.

53
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,791
Oh my God!

54
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:21,208
<i>Okay, I Darrin Dance Groove'd my ass off</i>
<i>and became captain of the cheer squad.</i>

55
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>I got so many new friends,</i>
<i>I didn't even know some of their names.</i>

56
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,375
<i>But like, of course,</i>
<i>I would always smile at them.</i>

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,125
<i>And, oh my God, before I knew it,</i>
<i>I had the hottest boyfriend in school.</i>

58
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>Like he was so, so hot.</i>
<i>Just like, mega hot.</i>

59
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,333
Steph! Seth is here!

60
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,458
Uh, yep, yep. Coming, coming.

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Mmm.

62
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,291
Yeah, this… this
is really good, Mr. Conway.

63
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,125
It's cereal, Seth.

64
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,666
Stephie, let's move it!

65
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,750
So, are you going to ask
my daughter to the prom or not?

66
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,625
Me?

67
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,416
What? No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,208
You drive here every morning
just so Stephie can drive you to school.

69
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,333
-You think I'm an idiot?
-No, sir.

70
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,750
It's really hard to find the right time.
And what about Blaine?

71
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,958
Hey!

72
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,708
Oh my God, Seth, did you Fatone your hair?

73
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,583
It looks so good!

74
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,791
Dad, you didn't have to cook breakfast.

75
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,125
You're about to graduate.

76
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,791
We're not gonna have too many more
of these breakfast opportunities.

77
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,125
-Yeah.
-Grateful to be included, sir.

78
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,291
Um, can we actually rain check?

79
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,291
I'm on a diet of only bananas
and ice cubes till prom.

80
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,750
Oh! Speaking of…

81
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,958
I've been, uh, waiting to give you this.

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,708
"I know you'll look beautiful in this.
Love, Mum."

83
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,375
Oh my God. 

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,791
It's gorgeous.

85
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
You know, Dad, um,

86
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,083
I saw at the mall
in that empty store next to Wet Seal

87
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,458
that they were holding, like, groups
for widows and widowers.

88
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,916
Looked pretty jumping.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,250
You're a catch, Mr. Conway.
A sad woman would totally go out with you.

90
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,583
I'll tell you what, I'll ask somebody out
when you do, Seth.

91
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,875
Yeah.

92
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,791
Did you hear
Tiffany went behind my back

93
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,166
and got the Activities Committee

94
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,875
to make the prom king and queen song
"Wherever You Will Go" by The Calling?

95
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,833
Uh, no. You know, that piece of gossip
hasn't really trickled down to me yet.

96
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,666
Well, when it gets to you,
believe it.

97
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,708
She's doing it to mess with me.

98
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,916
She knows I want a classic,
like "Power of Love."

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,666
I'm not going to go to my prom,
get my crown, get glitter-rained on

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,375
and then dance to
"Wherever You Will F-ing--"

101
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,083
-Ooh! Ow!

102
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,500
There she is,

103
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,708
Deanna Russo,

104
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,208
Harding High cheer captain
and prom queen '95.

105
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,833
Bangin' bod.

106
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,041
She's boy-band rich and lives
in the most beautiful house in Maryland

107
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,333
with her… Three, two, one…

108
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,750
…perfect husband,

109
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,541
Harding High quarterback
with a famously girthy dong.

110
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,583
So I've heard.

111
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,791
They're just like me and Blaine.

112
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,708
I want it so bad
I can practically taste them frenching.

113
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,000
It's my dream life.

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,916
And it all starts with prom queen.

115
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,500
Well, I think you're better
than just another Deanna Russo.

116
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,250
Oh my God, Seth…

117
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,166
Oh my God.
Your forehead's bleeding.

118
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh.

119
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,791
Sure you're okay?

120
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

121
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,541
Hey, so you know
prom is coming up,

122
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,125
and I really wanted to ask you something.

123
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,708
I know it's a long shot, but--

124
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,083
Seth, you don't even have
to finish the question.

125
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,750
-The answer's yes.
-Wait, really? What about Blaine?

126
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,458
Ah, he'll understand. It wouldn't feel
right to spend prom without you.

127
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,916
Seth,

128
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,583
I would love for you to come
to my after-prom party.

129
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,416
Oh, wow. Yeah, cool.

130
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,250
-Thanks, Steph.
-Oh my God. Duh, no prob.

131
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
Oh, also, there's gonna be a VIP room,

132
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,916
and you're totally gonna be on the list.
I mean it.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,833
Fun.

134
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,625
Okay, um, I'm gonna let you out here
because I got to make my entrance.

135
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,666
Oh, also, I need that sock back.
It's Blaine's.

136
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,875
We use it for handies.

137
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,125
Oh, okay, yeah. That's… that's gross.

138
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,541
-Bye!
-Bye!

139
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,250
-Oh my God!

140
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,500
I was wondering
where the future prom queen was.

141
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,125
Just thinking about my life
with the future prom king.

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,458
I'm gonna miss you so much
these next two periods.

143
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,375
Yeah?

144
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,000
Let me give you a little something
to remember me by. Boop, boop!

145
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,916
Oh my God, Blaine, stop.
That's so embarrassing.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,666
Oh my God, he's so into me. What?

147
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,666
Oh my God. Did anyone see that? Bye.

148
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,666
Ew. He shouldn't do that to you.

149
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,875
It's called love, Marth.
That's what couples do.

150
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,291
When you get a boyfriend,
you'll understand.

151
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,708
Yeah, I'll pass.

152
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,125
-Here.

153
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,750
Don't lose these. I'm serious.

154
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,666
If my parents find out I gave you
the keys to our lake house for a party,

155
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,375
they'll ship me off to a convent
before I even make it to Wesleyan.

156
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,083
-My grandfather built that with his hands.

157
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,000
If anything happens--

158
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,458
Oh my God, I promise you have nothing
to worry about. You're the best.

159
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,458
Thank you so much, Marth.
You know you're invited, right?

160
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,791
Did you just invite me
to a party that's at my own house?

161
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,458
Of course not.
I'm inviting you to the VIP section.

162
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,916
Seth will be there too.
So you'll have someone to talk to.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
Right. I could also talk to you.

164
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,708
Right, yeah, duh.

165
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,416
Um, except I'm probably gonna be losing
my bottom half virginity to Blaine.

166
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,875
So I'll be, like, in and out.

167
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,541
So will Blaine, literally.
You know what I mean?

168
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,666
Also, Martha, it's pep rally day.
Why aren't you in your cheer uniform?

169
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,208
Oh my God.

170
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,833
You look so hot right now.

171
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,958
-You look so great.
-Okay. Yeah.

172
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,166
-Okay. I'll see you later. Bye!
-Bye.

173
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:57,166
So, I've been telling everyone
about the VIP section at our party,

174
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,291
but here's a little secret.

175
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:04,208
There's gonna be
a VIP VIP section just for us.

176
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,125
For boning.

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,416
Mmm, so, uh, about that,

178
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,583
um, most of the football team's already
said yes to going to a different party.

179
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,791
But this one has
a heated pool and a live band.

180
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,958
What? Whose party?

181
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,833
Tiff's. But we could bone there,
if you want.

182
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,833
What the slut?

183
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,000
Get back to your seat, Miss Conway.

184
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:34,583
I would like to start my class
before the next millennium hits.

185
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,375
-Can I go to the bathroom?
-Fine.

186
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,791
Dex, wait.

187
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,458
Get this to Tiffany,

188
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,541
now.

189
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,666
Would you turn your books to the…

190
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
Got your note.

191
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,958
For the last time, Tiffany,
I won cheer captain fair and square,

192
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,875
and you and Blaine were broken up
when we got together. I don't cheat.

193
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:19,083
So why do you continue
to be the butt-roids on my… butt?

194
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,041
I don't know what you're talking about.

195
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,625
First, you changed
the prom king and queen song.

196
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,291
Now you're throwing an after-prom party

197
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,666
when you know
I've been planning mine for months.

198
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,166
You mean the one you have to throw
at Barfa's family lake house

199
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,416
'cause you live in a shanty.

200
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,083
Her name is Martha,

201
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,375
and she hasn't thrown up on herself
since the eighth grade, so…

202
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,291
-Cancel your party!
-Sorry.

203
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,000
My daddy has already paid
for the caterers.

204
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:47,791
Open bar, Jäger,
Mike's Hard Lemonade, Smirnoff Ice.

205
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,208
All the good shit.

206
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,833
So, you cancel yours.

207
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,541
You won't wanna throw a party
after I beat you for prom queen.

208
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,916
What makes you think
you're gonna win?

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,375
'Cause I'm MTV, and you're VH1.

210
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,791
I'm the real deal, and you're a poser.

211
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,625
You think you can shimmy your koala ass
to the top of the food chain I created

212
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,500
and screw up my senior year?

213
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,125
You're just a poor spaz playing dress up.

214
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,750
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,041
Take that back.

216
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,333
-Freshmen suck!

217
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,875
-Freshmen suck!
-Freshmen suck!

218
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,666
-Freshman suck!
-Settle down.

219
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,750
Blaine, settle down. Settle down.

220
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,125
Listen.

221
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,875
We have less than a month of school left.
Let's all just get through it.

222
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,333
-Now I know you all…
-All right, sluts.

223
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,291
Everybody, listen up.

224
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,166
Listen to Martha.

225
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,500
Just a couple notes
before we get out there.

226
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,958
We replaced the spotlight operators

227
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,833
with kids tall enough
to see what's going on.

228
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,791
Try not to hit the ground too hard
so our CD doesn't skip.

229
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,833
<i>"Our </i>CD"?

230
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:05,916
I'm sorry, since when does a clipboard
and a windbreaker make you a Bulldogette?

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,083
Since I appointed her
equipment manager, Tiffany.

232
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,291
Do you have any idea
how much she does for us?

233
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,000
Without her, we'd fall apart.
Whereas without you, Tiff,

234
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,958
we'd, I don't know,
have less stains on our uniform

235
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,041
-from catching your spray-tanned ass.

236
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,125
Continue, Marth.

237
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,708
Oh, I was done.

238
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,208
Oh.

239
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,625
All right, biatches. When I started
choreographing this routine,

240
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,875
I knew it had to be more
than just a regular cheer,

241
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,458
which is why I made this,

242
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,750
a step-by-step guide to our routine

243
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:41,541
so that future squads will be able
to replicate our VMA-level performance.

244
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,041
Martha, please see
that this gets into the school archives

245
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,083
so that our legends will live on.

246
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,458
-Do we have a school archive?
-We do now.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,666
All right, places, skanks!

248
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,166
Twins?

249
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,875
Can we talk?

250
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,250
And speaking of "not school appropriate,"

251
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,833
please welcome
our award-winning Harding Bulldogettes.

252
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,541
-That's my girl!

253
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,041
-Yeah!

254
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,041
-Ready?
-Okay!

255
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,791
<i> Who wants to forget</i>
<i>the good old days?</i>

256
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,166
<i>No one.</i>

257
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,583
<i>That's why, at Balbo Hummers,</i>

258
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,666
<i>we've got the sweetest rides</i>
<i>for the sweetest prices.</i>

259
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,458
<i>Oh! And hey,</i>
<i>all you high school seniors out there,</i>

260
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,125
<i>who doesn't want a Hummer</i>
<i>on their big night. Am I right?</i>

261
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:08,291
<i>That's right. Balbo Hummers is renting out</i>
<i>stretch limos for all of your prom needs.</i>

262
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:14,333
<i>Balbo Hummers.</i>
<i>We're ready for prom. Are you?</i>

263
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm ready for prom.

264
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,458
What the slut?

265
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
Oh, hi.

266
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,375
Hi. Hello. Hi.

267
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Excuse me. Um, I'm not sure what happened,

268
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,166
but I think there's been a mistake,
and I've been put in the wrong room

269
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,166
'cause there's a bunch of birthday cards
for, like, a really old person.

270
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,708
And the TV's flat,
like the back of it is missing,

271
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,166
and I really need to see
who's number one on <i>TRL.</i>

272
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Dr. Johnson to the third floor.
The cheerleader just woke up.

273
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,583
Oh, I don't mean to be a bitch,
but "cheer captain."

274
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Cheer captain.

275
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,333
And do you have any Von Dutch jeans?
'Cause this is, like, really unflattering.

276
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,416
Oh crap.

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,125
What are you staring at?

278
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,958
Hello? It's very rude to be a stare bear.

279
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,333
Hello? Are you-- Stop… stop doing that!

280
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Why are you doing that, you freaky old--

281
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,416
And the cheerleader's back down.

282
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,125
Oh, cheer captain. Are you okay?

283
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,750
This defies scientific explanation.

284
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,916
Being this hot?

285
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,666
No.

286
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,916
Stephanie, it's 2022.

287
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,375
No way.

288
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,500
Mm-hmm.

289
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,750
Are you sure I haven't been
Freaky Friday'd into some old lady's body?

290
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,541
You've been in a coma
for almost two decades.

291
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,583
That doesn't sound right.

292
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,916
I know this is a lot to process,
but we'll just take this nice and slow.

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,125
-Stephie?
-Stephanie!

294
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,291
-Oh my God.
-Stephanie!

295
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,875
Stephie, I can't believe this!
It's me. It's Dad!

296
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,208
Oh my God!

297
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,666
-Dad?
-Yeah!

298
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,333
How about me? Do you remember?
It's Martha, Martha Riser.

299
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,166
I never thought
I'd have this moment again.

300
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
I was this close to freezing you.

301
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,208
What do you mean, Dad?

302
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,333
Don't worry. I couldn't afford it.
I was only gonna freeze your head.

303
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,541
-No!
-We'll have to be gentle.

304
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,000
Physically she's aged,
but mentally she's still 17.

305
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
Of course. Yes, I see
how we came in a little hot.

306
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,541
Yeah.

307
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,500
Martha, you look like
an<i> Ally McBeal </i>character.

308
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,250
Oh my God. Thank you.

309
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, the good news is
nothing abnormal came up in her tests.

310
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,708
Stephanie, your physical
and mental resilience are remarkable.

311
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,958
Uh, let… let's go home.

312
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Marth, oh my God, what is that, a tiny TV?

313
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
No. No, Steph,
this is my cell phone.

314
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,875
Oh my God. Whoa! Really?

315
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,125
-That is very cool.

316
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,625
I always knew you'd be some high-powered,
<i>Sex and the City</i> businesswoman.

317
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,625
-Total Miranda, right, Dad?
-Oh…

318
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,250
I'm actually
a high school principal at Harding.

319
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,416
Oh my God, you still got
a good sense of humor.

320
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:32,291
That's… I mean, that's actually
a very cool and important job.

321
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
-So, whoo!
-Mm-hmm.

322
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,041
Um, and they give you
a fancy cell phone for that?

323
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, they're common now. Even I have one.

324
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,916
Oh. Okay.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,208
They do much more than just call people.
You could also watch the news.

326
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,875
Look, here's a news story
about you right now.

327
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,791
-What? No. Oh, about me? No, oh my God.
-Yeah, it's you!

328
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, wait, show me.

329
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,416
<i>Video edits of her infamous accident</i>
<i>went immediately viral on Instagram…</i>

330
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,041
Oh my God.
I went down like a bag of dicks.

331
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,875
Oh.

332
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,458
-Stephie!
-Wait. What does "viral" mean?

333
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,875
Well, "viral" just means everybody saw it.

334
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,583
Everybody's seen that?
I look retarded in those videos.

335
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,666
Now, Steph,
you… you cannot say the R-word anymore.

336
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,375
-What? Really? Why?
-Mm-mm.

337
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,291
Because it's offensive
to people with intellectual disabilities.

338
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,958
But what if something
really is, like, "R-word,"

339
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,666
um, what do you call it?
Like, "super gay"?

340
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,458
No, no. You can't call things "gay"
anymore, either,

341
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,958
unless you use it
as a neutral-positive term

342
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,625
to refer to somebody
who identifies as homosexual.

343
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,500
-So you cannot say the "R-word."
-Right.

344
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,541
And, um…

345
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,958
Sorry. Coma brain.

346
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,083
-What was the other word you can't say?
-"Gay."

347
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,291
Ha! Made you say it.

348
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,041
-Stephie.
-I-- That's…

349
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,791
-Still got it, Dad.
-You do.

350
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,416
Dad, um, can you take a left up here?

351
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,625
-Oh.
-To see--

352
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,291
No, no, no. No, um,
actually, you should get home and rest.

353
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,833
Rest? I've been asleep for 20 years.

354
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,458
-Dad, just take this left here.
-Jim, don't take the left.

355
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,083
Is there-- I don't understand…

356
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,291
-Indicator. Indicate left.
-Do not. Do not.

357
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,750
-Thank God, it's still the same.
-Yep. There it is. Let's keep going.

358
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,916
That's not Deanna Russo's husband.

359
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,375
-Who is that?
-Um…

360
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,541
Oh my God.
I know that ass anywhere. That's Blaine.

361
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,916
Wait. Did he get me my dream house?
Stop the car! Why didn't you say anything?

362
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,916
-Don't stop the car.
-What are you talking about? Stop the car!

363
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,916
Don't stop the car.
No. He's probably sleeping.

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,125
-He walked into the house.
-You don't wanna wake him.

365
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,291
He looked tired!

366
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
-I don't know what to do. Ah!
-Just stop the car!

367
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,333
-No!

368
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,083
Oh. You know what?

369
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,666
Someone from the shelter
already came by yesterday

370
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,208
to pick up our donations, so…
Thank you though.

371
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,291
Tiffany?

372
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,041
Shut up!

373
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,083
Stephanie?

374
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,916
-Oh my God, look at you!

375
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,666
-I can't believe this.
-What is happening?

376
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,208
I have so many things I… I want to say.

377
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,916
I've always felt terrible
about what happened.

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
I can't believe
you didn't land that stunt.

379
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,333
Wait, why are you living here with Blaine?
I don't get it.

380
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,375
This is mine and Blaine's dream house, so…

381
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,041
-Well, actually--
-Why are you here?

382
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,625
It's a long story.

383
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,625
Our parents got it for us
as a wedding gift and…

384
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
Well, that's it. The end.

385
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,791
No, you shut your face.

386
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,000
Um, where's Blaine?
Just get me Blaine, and, um--

387
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,041
I'm so sorry.
He is just so swamped right now with work.

388
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh.

389
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,916
I see what you did here.

390
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,041
Get rid of me
so you can steal my dream life.

391
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh…

392
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,791
Steph.

393
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,333
-No, no.

394
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,041
Look, I know
we never saw eye-to-eye back then,

395
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,083
but you know, the beautiful thing
about time is you move on.

396
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:07,291
Okay, you know what? I need to go
because I am brining zucchini ribbons,

397
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,041
but I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

398
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,041
Um, so I'm just gonna give you…

399
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,250
-What?
-Here.

400
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,208
Homemade from my own starter.
A peace offering.

401
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,166
I really look forward
to putting the past behind us.

402
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,208
You know, move past the past.

403
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,625
So, maybe when you're feeling better
and a little bit more stable,

404
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,125
we could do brunch sometime.

405
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,041
-Blaine!
-It's great to see you!

406
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,125
Blaine!

407
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,375
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

408
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,833
Who's that at the door?

409
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,333
It was… Stephanie Conway.

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,041
She's awake?

411
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,125
Ah, yes.

412
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
Perfectly preserved.

413
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,916
-And here we are.

414
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,458
Oh!
Did she not wear her seat belt?

415
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,791
I don't think she did.

416
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,375
-Oh God.

417
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,791
-It's locked, hon.
-Dad!

418
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,541
Here we are. Yeah.

419
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,458
Hey, S…

420
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,625
She's…

421
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,166
Oh my God.

422
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,000
Didn't have the heart to change it.

423
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:37,458
Kept your Cabriolet too. You know me,
never very good at letting things go.

424
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,958
I… I also never, uh, canceled
any of your magazine subscriptions.

425
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:52,083
Wait, Madonna's now called Lady Gaga?

426
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,833
-No.
-No.

427
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:58,208
-But she looks exactly like Madonna.
-You've had a lot to digest today.

428
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,833
We'll get you caught up this weekend.

429
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,833
Dad!

430
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,875
Dad. What the F?

431
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,708
Who was in charge of my feeding tube?
My boobs are huge.

432
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, you… you're just getting older.

433
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,916
You know, bodies change,

434
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,166
and pretty soon,
you'll go through menopause.

435
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,875
Oh my God. Don't.

436
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,750
I can't do this.

437
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,250
I was so close to having my dream life.

438
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,125
You still can, sweetie.

439
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,291
I can't. Look at this.

440
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,166
-Well--

441
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,083
-If anyone can do it, it's you.

442
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,791
Oh, Dad, shut up. I'll get it.

443
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:42,958
Dad…

444
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,875
Oh God. Okay.

445
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,416
Steph, babe, what are you doing?

446
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,916
I'm trying to not be ugly.

447
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,958
I'm just tired of being made fun of.

448
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,375
You are not ugly.

449
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,166
Yes, I am.

450
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,708
I just want to be like the populars.

451
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,625
Oh. What do they have that you don't?

452
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:26,083
Cool hair. Hot clothes.
Even hotter boyfriends.

453
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:30,541
They pronounce
their… …R's.

454
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,125
Mmm.

455
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,333
Well…

456
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:40,750
I think that you are beautiful
and smart and funny…

457
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,791
…and I think the accent makes you unique.

458
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,416
Well, it doesn't really count
if you say it, Mum.

459
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,541
Oh. It doesn't, does it?

460
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,916
Well, uh, too bad 'cause it's a fact.

461
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,625
Mums have senses about things like this.

462
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,625
-And I know that you…
-Uh, Mum.

463
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:06,416
…are gonna graduate and grow up

464
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,375
and have the most perfect life.

465
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,291
I just know it.

466
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,291
You mean it?

467
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,708
Do you think I could even be prom queen?

468
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,500
-You sure that's what you want?
-Duh.

469
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,791
Well, if anyone can make it happen,
it's you.

470
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,500
-Martha!
-Oh my God.

471
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,541
-There you are!
-Steph! Wha…

472
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,875
-Yeah.
-What are you doing here?

473
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:53,083
This is exactly the type of car
a principal would drive.

474
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,541
It's like… like you nailed it.

475
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,625
-Um, I just need your help with something.
-Uh…

476
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:00,916
I want to go back to school.

477
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:02,916
Oh, Steph.

478
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,416
That's wonderful. Yes, of course.

479
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,416
I can get you some info on those programs.
There's a lot of great ones.

480
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,041
Uh, no, Marth, I meant, like,
me come back to school, to Harding High,

481
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,500
and finish my senior year.

482
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:16,875
What?

483
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,875
God.

484
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,458
No…

485
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:21,916
No?

486
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,375
Or not no, but maybe not?

487
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,000
Steph, hey, you know what?

488
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,875
Instead…

489
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,291
Wow. There's online classes.

490
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,083
Or… or… or… or…

491
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,583
Um… Oh, GED courses
at the community college.

492
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,333
I cannot move on
to the next chapter of my life

493
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,375
if I'm still stuck in the old one
for 20 years.

494
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,208
And I understand that, but…

495
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,916
Steph… …I can't let
an almost 40-year-old woman

496
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,166
into high school.

497
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,458
Yeah, but you heard the doctor.
I'm still 17 mentally.

498
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,708
-And look…
-That's--

499
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:59,625
…that is medical.
And you cannot argue with science.

500
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,375
-Are you sure you're ready to go back?
-Yes!

501
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,958
High school was like yesterday for me.
It will not be weird at all.

502
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,375
What else am I supposed to do?

503
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,916
Start an OnlyFans account?
Queef for 20 dollars?

504
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,291
-What?
-That's…

505
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,083
I think that's what happens there.

506
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,250
Those aren't your only two options.
You have lots of options.

507
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,541
Look… …high school,
it's an intense but delicate ecosystem.

508
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,583
Yeah, which I can handle.

509
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,833
But you know what? There's only a month
of the school year left--

510
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:30,541
Oh, that's perfect!
That's basically the time that I missed!

511
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,291
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, that is, like, fate.

512
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,541
Like, Destiny's Child.

513
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,958
Well, you might be
the first person in history

514
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,208
to use a doctor's note to get into school.

515
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,708
-My God! Yes!

516
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:50,291
Martha! Oh my God.
You're the best. You're the best.

517
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,083
I'm so worried.

518
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,750
Sorry, babe.

519
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:28,458
I was in a coma.

520
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,250
Miss Conway! Miss Conway! Miss Conway!

521
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,166
Hi!
G'day, mate!

522
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,583
I wanted to say hi in your native tongue.
'Cause you're Australian, right?

523
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,416
-Yes. Yeah.
-Oh, good, good, good!

524
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,625
Your friend, my boss, Principal Riser,
asked me to show you around

525
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,041
and give you a little orientation
here at Harding.

526
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,958
Oh, okay. I don't really need to.
I know my way around.

527
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,500
Oh, come on, it's fun.
I have nothing else to do.

528
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,291
I'm Mr. Tapper, the guidance counselor,
but you can call me Mr. T.

529
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,250
Is that because you…
…"pity the fool" who has a bad first day?

530
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,666
Oh.

531
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,250
Well, yeah. Yeah, I would feel…
I would feel terrible.

532
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,208
No. I meant, like,
you know, Mr. T.

533
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,208
"I pity the fool. I pity the fool."

534
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,500
I've never said that before, but I guess
I could start if you wanted me to.

535
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,875
I pity the fool!

536
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,958
Mr. T is pitying fools over here.

537
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:50,000
All right, let's, um…
let's… let's go on a little tour here.

538
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:53,291
I have your records here from 2002.
You were a cheerleader.

539
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,625
-Cheer captain.
-Ooh, cheer captain.

540
00:33:55,708 --> 00:34:00,125
Uh, president of the Fashion Club.
Whoa! Your grades were pretty good.

541
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,916
My God, shut up. Don't. I don't want
anybody here to think I'm a dork.

542
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,791
I'm saying
graduating shouldn't be a problem.

543
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,958
Wait. What happened?

544
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,875
Where are
all the prom king and queen winners?

545
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:13,875
Oh, um, Principal Riser felt
that it sent a bad message,

546
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,333
so she replaced it
with something more positive.

547
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,583
-That looks like a bunch of tampons.
-Yeah, it is.

548
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,375
But it's also found art.

549
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,250
So you're saying they're found tampons.

550
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,625
Oh, yes, I am.

551
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,083
If not, just pretend
it's fake history.

552
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,333
Oh! I am so sorry.

553
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,583
Stephanie?

554
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,875
-Oh my God!
-It… it's… it's Seth!

555
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,291
-Seth?
-Yeah!

556
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,041
-Oh, Seth!
-Oh my goodness!

557
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,875
-Oh!
-Wow!

558
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,666
Martha said that you were back,

559
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,500
and I guess, in my head,
I just couldn't make it real,

560
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,250
but look at you. You look great!

561
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,250
It's me! Like, look,
I'm walking and talking.

562
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,166
-Yeah. Doing all those things.
-Everything.

563
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,958
Just like you used to, walk and talk.

564
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,625
Well, look at you! Oh my God!

565
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,583
-You look so cool and suave and adult.
-Yeah.

566
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,708
Wow! What happened to that nerd
that used to just hang out in the library?

567
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,000
He became the school librarian.

568
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:21,916
Seriously?

569
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,083
-Mm-hmm.
-Ah…

570
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,333
Seth, thank you so much for the yearbook.

571
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,458
Why didn't you just come in and say hi?

572
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:31,458
You know,
I didn't wanna overwhelm you, you know.

573
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,958
Plus, I can't stay out so late
on a school night.

574
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,666
-Ah, shit. Shoot.

575
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,583
Dang!

576
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:42,083
I wish I could hang out and talk more,
but I gotta get back to work.

577
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,791
-Oh, yeah, I got to get back to class.
-Yeah.

578
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,916
I don't wanna be
20 years and ten minutes late.

579
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,916
So, I will see you around.
You know where to find me.

580
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,416
Yeah, same.
You know where to find me, in the library.

581
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,666
-Some things never change, right?
-Bye, Seth. I'll call you.

582
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,833
Or you can do some long division, I guess.

583
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,958
Steph, how's your first day?

584
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,208
Oh my God,
it's just been, like, so amazing.

585
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:12,666
Like, just making new friends.
Everyone's already obsessed with me.

586
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,000
That's so great. We strive
for a welcoming environment here.

587
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,708
Um, listen, I need to talk to you
about rejoining the Bulldogettes.

588
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,000
Um, instead of cheer, I think
you should be focusing on your schoolwork.

589
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,125
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure!

590
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:28,541
Um, but who do I talk to about rejoining?

591
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,750
Well, you would talk to me.
I'm the cheer coach now.

592
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay. Wait, I see your game.

593
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,375
You become principal

594
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,958
so then you can get real power
by running the cheer squad.

595
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,750
That's smart. I respect that.

596
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,166
Yeah, that… that's not why
I got my master's in education.

597
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,666
Um, look, I don't think the cheer squad

598
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,208
needs a new member right now.

599
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,333
Well, that's wrong
'cause every cheer squad in the country

600
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,666
would love to have me.

601
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,583
There's only two performances left,
so I don't think it's worth it.

602
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,500
Marth, I only need
one performance to make a splash

603
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,541
if I have any chance
of becoming prom queen.

604
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,125
-Steph…
-This head still needs a crown.

605
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,916
I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna get it.

606
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,875
Steph,

607
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,416
we do not have
prom queen at this school anymore.

608
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,833
Oh my God, are you having a mini stroke?

609
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,166
What?

610
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,666
Competitions like that, they're dangerous.

611
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Winning things, it just…
it doesn't reflect our school values.

612
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,625
With no winners, there aren't any losers.

613
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,500
I've made a school with no losers.

614
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,208
But everybody was just talking to me
about how much they want prom queen.

615
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,291
Steph, if all the students want it back,
they know they can petition for it.

616
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,041
But so far no one has.

617
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,375
Oh, that was so close.
You were so close.

618
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,291
-Let me put it my mouth.
-One more. Ready and one…

619
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,500
Yay!

620
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,333
Oh, hey, is this where the ho-bags sit?

621
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,375
That's a fun way of saying "what's up?"

622
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,833
-I'm Janet.
-And I'm Yaz, and that's Neil.

623
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,208
I just have to say I'm living
for this little vintage fit.

624
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,458
-And I'm not even JK-ing. Okay?

625
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,250
Okay, what is with
this enormous lunch table?

626
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,541
How are we supposed to know
where the popular kids sit?

627
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:22,458
Well, when there's just one table,
we're all popular kids.

628
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,708
-Everybody.
-Oh no, no, no. That's not how life works.

629
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,791
There's only, like, three ways
to become popular,

630
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,458
to be a cheerleader,
to work at Abercrombie,

631
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,208
or to let guys go in the back door.

632
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,166
-What?
-Oh my God, I must be really popular then.

633
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,416
-What?

634
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,750
-Nothing.
-Anyways, um, Janet…

635
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,166
Mm-hmm.

636
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,750
…I was wondering
if you would like to sign my petition.

637
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,041
It's to bring back
prom queen to Harding High.

638
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,541
-Oh my gosh!
-No way!

639
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,583
Do I respect IRL grassroot efforts

640
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:53,083
to effect change
into societal systems? Yes.

641
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,750
It's also very refreshing
to see non-digital campaign strategy.

642
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,333
-It is.
-So I'll sign it.

643
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,791
I'll sign it too, but don't be surprised
if we're the only ones.

644
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,541
Why's that?

645
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,208
Because nobody's gonna sign this
unless Bri Luvs signs it.

646
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,125
-Who?
-Her.

647
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,458
Bri Luvs.
That's just her name on social media.

648
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:14,291
She's got, like,
three million Instagram followers.

649
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,791
And that 98 pounds of sexy is Lance,
her fine-ass boyfriend.

650
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,791
Last year, <i>Vice </i>did a whole vlog
about their open relaish

651
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,666
and called it
the gold standard of the future.

652
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,166
Cool, cool, cool.
So, um, how do I get her to sign it?

653
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,208
Oh, you won't. She's untouchable.

654
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,250
Okay, everyone's friends with her,
but she's friends with no one.

655
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,166
Yeah.

656
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,125
-She's coming over here.
-No, she's not.

657
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,375
-Just act normal. Avoid eye contact and--
-Okay.

658
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:42,083
-Yaz! Been a minute, huh?
-It has been so long.

659
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:46,500
So long! And Janet, loved your post about
alternative body positivity the other day.

660
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,375
You are so inspiring.

661
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,791
I was just showing off
my new bathing suit.

662
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,875
Hi, I'm Bri, and you must be Stephanie.

663
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,041
I heard about you.

664
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,750
Really?

665
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:57,791
I mean, um…

666
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,666
Yeah, obviously,
because I'm, like, the total shiznit,

667
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,541
and I basically used to be you
when I went here.

668
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,541
You know, the most popular girl in school
'cause we're the same.

669
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,875
I don't really think about popularity.

670
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,666
I'm just trying to build
my most authentic, socially conscious,

671
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,125
body-positive, environmentally aware,
and economically compassionate brand

672
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,500
that's a home for inclusion,
focused fashion, food,

673
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,958
and fun-filled lifestyles.

674
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,916
And if tons of people respond to that,
then, great.

675
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,750
Totally. Yes.

676
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,291
I mean, obviously.

677
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,333
Um, while I've got you here,
would you mind signing this?

678
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:33,541
I'm gonna stop you right there.

679
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:37,250
I made a paper-free pledge this year,
so I only deal with forms digitally.

680
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,291
I'm sure you understand.
But can we take an ussie?

681
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,791
Yes. Absolutely.

682
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,416
-Where to?
-Um…

683
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
Where are we going? We're going--
Ooh. What? Sorry.

684
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,625
-What was that?
-Oh, before I forget.

685
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,375
My mom, Tiffany,
told me to tell you she says hi.

686
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,416
She said to remind you
she's married to Blaine

687
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,666
and lives in your dream house,
in case you couldn't place her.

688
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,666
Your mom, Tiffany.

689
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,833
Nice meeting you, Stephanie. Bye.

690
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,250
-Bye.
-Bye.

691
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,416
Baby, you're manspreading again.

692
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,375
Oh.

693
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:10,750
-Whoops.

694
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,833
Oh my God. He knows you exist.

695
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:18,333
Yeah, 'cause probably
he's, like, already obsessed with me.

696
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:21,625
-Oh my God. What is that? A fire drill?

697
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,250
-Uh…
-What, robot invasion?

698
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,333
Bri is going live.

699
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,750
<i>Hey, guys, we have a new student</i>
<i>at Harding High, and she's older than us.</i>

700
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,500
<i>And I want to remind</i>
<i>everyone around the world</i>

701
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:35,000
<i>that treating someone different</i>
<i>'cause they're elderly is called ageism,</i>

702
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:38,375
<i>no matter how weird or foreign</i>
<i>or out of touch they may seem,</i>

703
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,166
<i>and that's not cool.</i>

704
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,708
<i>Also, stay tuned. I have amazing news</i>

705
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,666
<i>about my upcoming summer</i>
<i>screen-detox vacay in Nepal.</i>

706
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,500
<i>Remember, Bri loves you.</i>

707
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,541
That was hot.

708
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,125
You're hot.

709
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,791
-I'll sign your petition.
-Oh my God! Yay! Three people!

710
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,083
-Whoo!
-Oh my God, no.

711
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,500
Guys, I need
the cheerleaders to sign this.

712
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,708
Because then everyone will.
Cheer pressure.

713
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:07,041
Well, they'll sign it
'cause we already did.

714
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:08,708
Ha!

715
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,416
-You guys are the cheerleaders?
-Absolutely.

716
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,333
-Ready?
-Okay!

717
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,833
Oh.
Good job, good job. What'd you think?

718
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,291
What was that?

719
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,166
-Well, that's--
-What was that?

720
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,833
-It's our most popular routine.
-Yeah.

721
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,625
-Well, who were you guys cheering for?
-For everyone.

722
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:45,625
You know, to do the right thing, right?
Team Humanity!

723
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,041
Team Humanity!

724
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,750
Uh…

725
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,791
But what about, like, the music
and the dancing and the flipping?

726
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh. Oh no. No.
We do not do stunts anymore.

727
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,791
-Oh.
-And also we don't do any sexy dancing.

728
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,833
We'd rather have people listen
to our words than just our bodies.

729
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,500
Okay, yeah, but this cheer
would be so much better

730
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:07,083
if you guys made me believe you were
seconds away from showing your tits.

731
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,000
-No, Steph…
-Yes, Martha.

732
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,750
-Okay.
-Yes. I had this one signature move.

733
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:15,375
You'll love it. It's called lips to lips.
Everybody, do it with me.

734
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,041
-Don't.
-You start on the face.

735
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,666
-Fingers go down the body.
-No.

736
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,208
Down the body and up.

737
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,708
No! Why is everyone doing it?
I'm saying don't do it.

738
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,291
-Okay, look.
-Okay.

739
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:27,541
We would do that, but our freshman year,
Bri Luvs made an Instagram post

740
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,791
saying that cheerleaders
were anti-feminist.

741
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,291
The whole school turned against us,
and we had to recalibrate.

742
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,791
Her post got, like, seven million likes.

743
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,375
-Eight million.
-It was for the best.

744
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,166
Anyways, let's show her
our gun control routine.

745
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,833
-It's one of our best.
-No, wait!

746
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:43,458
What even is this squad? Like…

747
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,791
Is there even a cheer captain?

748
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,041
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Stephanie, I am the cheer captain.

749
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,375
-I am the cheer captain.
-I am the cheer captain.

750
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,250
I'm a cheer captain.

751
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,500
-And also the coach.
-You?

752
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,541
Martha, that's the most fucked up thing
I've ever heard.

753
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:02,291
Steph, we are all cheer captains here
to promote… Say it with me.

754
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:05,041
Equality!

755
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,250
-Including you, Steph.
-Welcome.

756
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,916
-Do you love it? Are you okay?

757
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh my God.

758
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,333
-Oh my God.
-She loves it, you guys. You nailed it!

759
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,958
-Oh my God!
-Aw!

760
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,125
Excuse me, Mr. Bud.

761
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,500
Hey, what's up?

762
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,500
Um, seeing as you're my librarian now,

763
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,625
you're legally obligated
to help me research something, yeah?

764
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:32,541
Yeah, by law.

765
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,291
Yeah, I think the teachers union's
a real stickler about that sort of thing.

766
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,208
I'm just kidding.
I'm not in the union. What's up?

767
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,833
-Oh, this is addictive.
-Yeah.

768
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,083
Social platforms have become
a vital tool for communication.

769
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:48,250
Look, it's a turtle humping a rock!

770
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,666
-Yeah.
-Oh, get it. Get it.

771
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,416
Yeah, oh, that gets a heart.

772
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,916
-And it's also that.

773
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,791
Okay. All right.
I think I've worked this thing out.

774
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,708
Okay.

775
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,458
So, basically you get followers
by being somebody everybody likes.

776
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,375
Mm-hmm.

777
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,666
So it's a popularity contest,
but instead of just high school,

778
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,750
it's now the whole world,
and the whole world is your phone.

779
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,708
Yeah. I mean, that's exactly it.

780
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,541
-That's it.
-Yeah, it's pretty sad.

781
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,250
No! This is, like, amazing.
This is like a shortcut.

782
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,500
Wow, I immediately regret
showing you this.

783
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,750
Just to be clear,
this is a way for people to pretend

784
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,000
their life and skin texture
is better than it is.

785
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,708
Is that why you've posted this picture
of you with this random hot chick?

786
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,625
No, that's my ex-fiancée Diana.

787
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,458
-You were engaged?
-I was.

788
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,125
-Shut up! Seth.
- Uh-huh.

789
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,041
That's actually how I ended up here.

790
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,916
We both were working
at the National Archives in DC,

791
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,333
and when we split up, I needed a change.

792
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,958
So Martha got me a job at Harding,
and here I am.

793
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,583
Trust me, being close to 40
and back at my high school

794
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,208
isn't exactly where I wanted to be, but…

795
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,083
-Oh. Tell me about it!
-Yeah, right!

796
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,458
Uh, well, I should get back
to enriching young minds.

797
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,291
Just kidding. I'm covering a drama class.

798
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,625
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

799
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,708
-All right. Oh!
-Bye!

800
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,166
Need that back. Yeah, thanks, Steph.

801
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,500
Please, Dad!

802
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,333
Phones are like the new Tamagotchis.

803
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:13,875
Okay? I need one, and I promise you,
I will not go over the minutes.

804
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:17,791
Really, it's for my own personal safety,
'cause what happens if I get kidnapped?

805
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,250
I think if you get kidnapped, Stephanie,
they'll probably take your phone.

806
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,916
Not if I'd hidden it up my…

807
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,416
Well, just to be safe,
it's probably a good thing.

808
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,166
I got you this.

809
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,916
Oh my God.

810
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,250
Dad…

811
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,375
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

812
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,375
Oh, you're the best dad!

813
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,500
Dad, I can't believe this!

814
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,833
Hey, guys, uh, it's just me, Stephanie.

815
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,333
-I'm just chilling at my crib.

816
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,083
I don't even know how to do this.

817
00:46:56,166 --> 00:47:00,875
I was just thinking that we should bring
prom queen back to Harding High.

818
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,375
-#AwesomeIdea.

819
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,208
-#Yes.

820
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:07,208
-Spread it around. Let's make it a virus.

821
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,541
That's… that's cute.

822
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,791
<i>Remember to vote</i>
<i>for this year's prom theme.</i>

823
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:13,291

-Okay.
-So fire.

831
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,625
Let's wait
until the party to tell everyone.

832
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,541
Oh my God,
is there a party happening? Whoo!

833
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,625
Oh. Hi, Stephanie. What's up?

834
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:40,958
I just came to say we're, like, cool.

835
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,791
Okay? Even after the other day
when you, like, said I was old and shit.

836
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,083
Oh, did you think that was mean?

837
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,458
I am so sorry.

838
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:48,791
I was just shedding light

839
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,833
on an often overlooked
discrimination issue.

840
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,208
Look, okay, I get.

841
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:55,541
Queen bee feels very threatened
by the hot new girl

842
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,458
and decides to go on the offensive.

843
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,375
Classic Sandy/Rizzo.
It was the same way with your mum.

844
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:03,250
I am not my mom. I'm nothing like her.

845
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,750
So whatever went on between you two
has nothing to do with me.

846
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:11,041
Awesome. Okay, so now that we're friends,
can you follow me on Insta?

847
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:16,666
I'm "A" with this little circle around it
hot coma girl 113.

848
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,583
Who knew?
There's 112 other hot coma girls.

849
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:23,125
Mm-hmm. Okay, so I get this request a lot.

850
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,416
Um, I limit my follows,

851
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,083
'cause if I follow one person,
another might get mad,

852
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:31,166
so it's a sacrifice I make
for everyone's mental health.

853
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,291
Um, but good luck getting followers.

854
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,041
Okay.
Well, wait, can you follow me?

855
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,666
Can I follow her on Instagram?

856
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,583
No.

857
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,958
I can't.

858
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,583
Sorry.

859
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,666
Hey, Steph.

860
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,416
-Holy shit. Mmm.
-Um, I'm doing a makeup tutorial.

861
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
For who? Batman villains?

862
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,708
I'm just really needing
some new followers.

863
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:04,458
You don't realize
how many people don't care about you

864
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,416
until you see it
as a number on your phone.

865
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,166
Okay. Well, if you get tired
of being an influencer,

866
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,708
the Natural History Museum is showing
<i>Deep Impact </i>on their IMAX all week.

867
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:15,500
So, maybe we could go this weekend?

868
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>Deep Impact </i>again?

869
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,541
Oh my God. You, me, and Martha
just watched that a couple weekends ago.

870
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,250
Oh no, actually, I think you're thinking
of 1,000 weekends ago.

871
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,416
Oh. Right.

872
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,291
Mm. Okay, I would go,
but I've got a party this weekend.

873
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,875
Oh, cool. Uh, you know, what night?
I'm completely free.

874
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:40,500
I don't actually know yet,
so I'm just keeping my schedule open.

875
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,666
Right.

876
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,250
Just to be clear,

877
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,708
you're saying no to attend
a party you haven't been invited to

878
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,458
and don't know
when or where it's happening?

879
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:51,291
Yeah. Okay, I gotta get back
to my contouring.

880
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,875
All right.

881
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,708
So hot.

882
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,416
I mean, even just an hour a night,
that would be amazing.

883
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,000
-I can make that happen.
-Yeah.

884
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,916
Okay.

885
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:07,833
What's going on?

886
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:12,541
Why are you guys acting sus?
What? Don't say…

887
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:16,916
Are you two together? Oh my God.
I'm not calling you Mum!

888
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,291
Martha tells me you're already
falling behind in your classes.

889
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,833
Are you doing crack cocaine?

890
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,166
No.

891
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,208
Dad, I'm just still adjusting.

892
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,833
I just found out there were
eight more <i>Fast and Furious</i> movies.

893
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:34,375
I just wanna make sure that you're giving
your schoolwork the attention it deserves.

894
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,625
Well, I've just been really busy

895
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,875
with super important stuff,
like making friends.

896
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,500
-Well, good. I'm… That's great.
-Mm-hmm.

897
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,583
-But you can still do your homework.
-Yep!

898
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,041
You're smart, Steph,
always have been.

899
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,625
I don't wanna see you
use this second chance incorrectly.

900
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,458
Okay. Well, I've got
the solution for this.

901
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:52,916
No phone for the weekend.

902
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,500
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

903
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:57,375
Dad, no. How else will I live?

904
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,000
You survived 20 years without solid food.

905
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,208
You can go for a weekend
without your iPhone, hon.

906
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:03,708
-No!
-Hand it over.

907
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,083
-Are you being serious?
-Yes. I am being very--

908
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,041
Are you being full serious right now?

909
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,000
-Full serious.
-Are you from Syria?

910
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,125
I'm very serious.

911
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,458
No!

912
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:14,875
No!

913
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:17,500
-Hand me the phone.
-Here, have it, then. Have it.

914
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,208
It's a remote.

915
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,958
-No!
-Uh…

916
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,291
-Get off the door frame, honey.
-No! It's my phone!

917
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,541
Give him the phone.

918
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,708
No…

919
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,708
Thanks a lot, Principal Martha.

920
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,791
Oh my God, Lance and Bri look so hot.

921
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,458
What the slut? They're all there.

922
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,416
Can I… can I have my phone back now?

923
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,208
Oh my God.

924
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,625
Guys, what kind of psycho world is this

925
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,708
where the cheerleaders
don't get invited to a party? Hello!

926
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:51,833
Are they stupid? We are the party!

927
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,666
Babe, of course we weren't invited.

928
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,416
-It's DM VIP.
-Yeah.

929
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,583
You only get to go to them
if they follow you.

930
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,916
Only the hot, cool people.

931
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,500
-Yeah.
-Well, yeah, but we are hot and cool.

932
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:02,916
-Thank you.
-Um,

933
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,458
four years of not getting invited
to those parties,

934
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,416
the message gets, like, very clear.
We're not.

935
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,791
This is kind of like a party.
I can have my dad pop in a Di.

936
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,041
It means "DiGiorno."

937
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,833
-Oh, oh, oh.
-No, I'm talking about a "party" party.

938
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:22,541
I can't have video record of me partying.
The media's gonna use it to try

939
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:25,833
and discredit me when I run for office,
like they did with AOC.

940
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:26,750
No.

941
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:31,625
Okay, guys, you need to listen up,
all right? This is now serious.

942
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:37,250
We need to dance
because we need to show everybody

943
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,666
that we are the cool ones.

944
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,708
Guys, when I was in high school,
all the popular kids treated me like shit

945
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,583
until I showed them how cool I was,

946
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,708
which is so cool that
the most popular girl in high school,

947
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,458
her boyfriend dumped her for me.

948
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:54,416
-And you know who that was?
-Who?

949
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,041
-Bri's mom.
-Tiffany?

950
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,083
And that guy,

951
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,291
Bri's dad.

952
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,791
What?

953
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:10,000
And once you've blown someone's dad,
you realize they're not that scary.

954
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,208
-Hmm.
-Good to know.

955
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,416
Yeah, I mean…

956
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,875
So, everybody, watch and learn.

957
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:17,916
-Let's dance.
-Okay.

958
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,541
Okay, can you hit play?
Yeah, nice fingering.

959
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,500
-Yeah. Okay, get into it, guys.

960
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,791
-Like, hips, shoulders.

961
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,208
Sing it!

962
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:27,125
Yeah!

963
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:36,625
-Stop!

964
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,958
All right, guys, we have a show to put on.

965
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:09,291
Please don't blow my dad.

966
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,416
Now, don't worry.
I've spoken with the school nurse,

967
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,833
and with less than three weeks
until graduation,

968
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:22,000
we are prepared
for an epidemic of senioritis.

969
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,333
Freshmen suck.

970
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:31,000
Um, okay. So without further ado,
please join me in welcoming

971
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:34,666
the president of the Harding High PTA,
Tiffany Balbo.

972
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,500
Hi!

973
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,125
Thank you.

974
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,958
And I know she's the principal, boo.

975
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,000
Boo.

976
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,875
-But give it up for Miss Riser, everyone.

977
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:55,000
-Stop it.
-Sorry. Sorry.

978
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:59,375
Okay. What a special evening
we get to share with our kids

979
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,916
before they go off to adulthood.

980
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,875
Okay, guys,
the energy in this place is sucking wiens.

981
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:06,833
We need to get out there
and rock their worlds.

982
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:07,958
Oh, and here's this.

983
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,291
Huh?

984
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,083
-It's the music for the routine.
-Oh, yes.

985
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,208
Thank you for the computer tampon.
Shove that where that goes.

986
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,000
Really, guys, you're the bomb diggity.

987
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,291
-All of you.
-Aw!

988
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,166
I love you,
and we're gonna crush the sluts and--

989
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,083
Oh, it's the big finale, you guys.
It's the big finale!

990
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:25,625
I'm so proud of you.

991
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:28,000
You pumped to go out there
and change some minds?

992
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:31,916
And just remember, this is all I have.

993
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,833
And real quick,
due to the custom table-scapes,

994
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:43,791
the prom ticket prices have gone
from $48 to $93.

995
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,333
-We take Venmo and PayPal and Zelle.

996
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:47,666
Thank you so much!

997
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,333
Yeah!

998
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:54,291
Okay. Thank you, parents.

999
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,916
Speaking of prom,

1000
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,666
making good choices is at the forefront
of every school function,

1001
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,583
so to help us illustrate that,
please welcome our radical Bulldogettes.

1002
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,708
-Ready?
-Consent!

1003
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,500
Yeah!

1004
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,458
Let's go!
Let's hear it for consent!

1005
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,708
Are you ready for the remix?

1006
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,125
Oh my God.

1007
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,583
-Did they just touch their--
Just shut up. Shut up.

1008
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:39,833
Yeah!

1009
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:44,041
Bulldogs, fuck yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

1010
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:47,666
-You are a father.
-They brought it back. I am a father.

1011
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,291
Ooh.

1012
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,500
-Damn, Conway!
-Oh!

1013
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,500
-Blaine! Oh my God! Oh my God.
-Whoo!

1014
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,958
Watching you up there.

1015
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,791
-Shut up.
-No, it's true!

1016
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,750
-Shut up! Look at you!
-Yeah?

1017
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,125
Look at you now. You're such a--

1018
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:09,625
I'm a DILF. I know. Who would've thought?

1019
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:10,916
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1020
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,625
Oh, and I wanted to say
I thought it was so cool

1021
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,416
that I was one of the first places
you stopped when you woke up.

1022
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,708
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought of you over the past years.

1023
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:20,833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1024
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,916
Well, even though
I was pretty much brain-dead,

1025
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,875
you were the one
that kept my heart beating.

1026
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:29,333
Well, listen, I'll just say,
you let me know

1027
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:32,500
if you ever want to take
another trip down memory Blaine.

1028
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,916
-Yeah, but, Blaine, what about Tiff?
-Eh.

1029
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,166
Didn't stop us the first time.

1030
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,125
What? You said you two were broken up.

1031
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:42,375
It's, uh… You know, I don't…

1032
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,208
-What?
-I was joking.

1033
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,208
I haven't forgotten
about your whole "no cheating" rule.

1034
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:52,041
Yeah, which is why we can't be together.

1035
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,166
Yet.

1036
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,291
But if you're the man
that I think you are…

1037
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,458
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

1038
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:02,958
Yeah. No, I…

1039
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:04,958
Oh, sh…

1040
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,333
Hmm.

1041
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:15,250
Conway.

1042
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,500
Stephanie,
can you come down here, please?

1043
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:53,500
"Stephanie, we support
Instagram stars like you

1044
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,166
who share Hostess' commitment
to never growing old."

1045
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,500
"Warmest wishes from your friends
at Canada Goose." That is sick!

1046
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:03,375
"Let's be buds."

1047
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,083
Holy shit.

1048
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:35,541
I don't get what the big deal was.
We were just dancing!

1049
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:39,791
Steph, the big deal is that I told you
that we don't do that anymore,

1050
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:42,250
and you went
and did it anyway behind my back.

1051
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,000
Are you really mad?
Or is this because Tiff yelled at you?

1052
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:45,958
Oh, Steph!

1053
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,625
You can't let her bully you,
I've always said that.

1054
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,250
It's not about Tiffany.

1055
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,375
I care about this

1056
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,833
because what you did up there,
it wasn't school-appropriate.

1057
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:56,000
You fondled yourself

1058
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:59,166
for an unsuspecting audience
in a routine about consent.

1059
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,416
But I gave myself consent

1060
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,583
to do that to myself.

1061
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,458
Stop stroking your nipples.

1062
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:07,291
Marth, what is going on here?

1063
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,250
The cheerleaders aren't allowed to dance.

1064
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,833
You took away prom queen.

1065
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,833
You turned the cafeteria
into a Hogwarts without the magic.

1066
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:15,750
Are you trying
to make this place suck wiens?

1067
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:19,958
Number one, how dare you?
It is like Hogwarts with the magic.

1068
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:24,750
And number two,
it doesn't suck wiens. It's nice.

1069
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,791
It's… it's nice here.

1070
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,833
-I had more fun in a coma.
-You did not have more fun in the coma.

1071
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,250
I had more fun going like this.

1072
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:35,666
Stephanie.

1073
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,333
That was way more fun
than this high school.

1074
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:43,166
Steph, this may come as a shock to you,
but for most kids, high school sucks.

1075
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,916
I don't know why you're acting
like we didn't have the same experience.

1076
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,583
High school was awesome!

1077
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:53,125
Freshman year, you bailed on Seth and I
to go be some popular girl.

1078
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,666
No, I didn't bail. I just got more friends

1079
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,916
and a really hot boyfriend.

1080
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,541
Seriously, if you'd had a boyfriend,
you would have understood.

1081
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,875
Stephanie, I wouldn't understand
because I'm gay.

1082
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,291
Ooh, you can't say that word,
unless you're saying it

1083
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:10,708
in a neutral-positive way
to refer to someone that is…

1084
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,375
Mm-hmm.

1085
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,583
Oh.

1086
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:18,500
Yeah.

1087
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:23,208
And it… it made high school
a living hell for me.

1088
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,708
Back then, I felt very alone

1089
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:32,375
and angry and so threatened

1090
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:38,083
that if I showed one iota of my real self,
then I would be ripped to shreds

1091
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:43,041
by Tiffany or Blaine or you.

1092
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,500
Me?

1093
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,875
No way. Why would you even say that?

1094
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,541
Because, Steph,
sometimes I didn't know who you were.

1095
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,833
Or… are.

1096
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,291
Look, let's…

1097
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,583
There's three weeks left
of the school year.

1098
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:03,000
So let's just get through those
as peacefully as possible,

1099
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:06,500
and then I can go
to my family's lake house for the summer.

1100
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:12,916
The periodic table
is made up of 119 elements.

1101
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,666
<i>Oh, hey, space nerds. JK, JK.</i>

1102
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,000
<i>Any of you want to come see </i>Deep Impact
<i>with me and Blaine this weekend?</i>

1103
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:23,291
<i>As part of my collab</i>
<i>with the Natural History Museum,</i>

1104
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:28,166
<i>you will get 20% off ticket prices</i>
<i>and complimentary space ice cream.</i>

1105
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,833
<i>So come watch</i>
<i>the end of the world with us.</i>

1106
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,666
Remember it just for me. Please.

1107
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,250
-No one's gonna read you.

1108
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,416
Oh boy,
no one's gonna read you.

1109
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,708
Are you talking to the books?

1110
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:46,416
-Oh, yeah, I find it helps them grow.
-Still a dork.

1111
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,375
-Huh.
-So…

1112
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,333
Uh,

1113
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,041
do you, like, still wanna see <i>Deep Impact?</i>

1114
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,166
I'm gonna get some popcorn.

1115
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,875
Maybe some freeze-dried space ice cream.
Maybe some Milk Duds, some Whoppers,

1116
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:04,083
some Juicy Fruit.
I gotta keep this girlish figure.

1117
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,708
You want anything, or…

1118
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,333
Um, oh, no, no, no, don't go just yet.
Just hang here for one second.

1119
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,375
Yeah, sure.

1120
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:14,791
Oh my God, Seth, you're such a gentleman
going to get the snacks.

1121
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,708
Oh my God, I swear,
you have such a massive dick.

1122
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:20,833
-What did you say?
-What? Oh, Blaine, Tiffany.

1123
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,958
-Hi!
-Hi! What are you doing here?

1124
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,458
What a coincidence.

1125
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:27,125
I'm, um, here on a date with Seth.

1126
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,416
He asked me out, and I said,

1127
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,958
"You know what? I am single
and so horny, so yes."

1128
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,875
-Isn't that right?
-Yep.

1129
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:35,833
Really?

1130
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:38,208
Wait, I'm sorry.
You are on a date with Sethany?

1131
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,916
-Well, it's just Seth.

1132
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,041
Relax. I'm just joking.

1133
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,666
Well, yeah,
we're just here to see a movie.

1134
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,291
It's not like
we're gonna have hot, consensual sex

1135
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,583
when the lights go down.

1136
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,333
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm?

1137
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,041
Wow! Uh…

1138
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,541
Wow, Seth, it only took 20 years
and some brain damage,

1139
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,375
but she finally agreed
to go out with you. Way to go!

1140
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,250
Again, just joking.

1141
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,166
-Hilarious.
-Let's go find our seats.

1142
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,333
-Huh?
-Let's go find our seats.

1143
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,458
-We gotta go find our seats.
-Down in front, yep.

1144
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,416
Yeah.

1145
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,041
-Oh, yeah.
-"Sethany."

1146
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,208
Feed me some popcorn.

1147
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,750
Are you serious about that?

1148
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:36,666
Yeah, just be awesome.
Just… just toss some into my mouth.

1149
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,625
All right.

1150
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,791
Seth!

1151
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,833
Oh my God. It's stuck in my throat.
Oh, I'm choking.

1152
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,666
-No, I really… I just got a Milk Dud.
-Did you actually choke on that?

1153
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,958
Yeah, it's stuck right there,
but it's all right.

1154
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,875
I thought that was
a euphemism kind of thing.

1155
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,833
<i>-Fire tether pitons.</i>
<i>-Pitons fired.</i>

1156
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:12,541
-Stop it.
-What?

1157
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:15,833
You're eye-fucking Stephanie so hard,
she'll need the morning-after pill.

1158
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:18,000
I am not eye-fucking anybody.

1159
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:21,916
It is embarrassing. Do you want me
to call Dr. Wilbin for more therapy?

1160
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,625
-Don't threaten me with a good time.
-Shut up!

1161
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,833
Bitch, turn your ugly face around
and watch the movie.

1162
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,833
Careful how you talk
to senior citizens.

1163
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,916
Shut up, Blaine.

1164
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,625
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to be quiet.

1165
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,916
I am not the problem.

1166
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,416
There is a freaking porno
happening over there!

1167
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,041
-What?
-Don't put that on my face.

1168
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:42,291
It is not my fault.
I am not doing anything.

1169
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:45,541
Be quiet. I'm trying to watch the movie.

1170
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,500
You're afraid you'll miss something?

1171
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,958
The asteroid hits,

1172
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:53,125
and Téa Leoni and her Austrian dad
get hit by a ginormous wave.

1173
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,416
-Aw.
-What?

1174
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,375
Oh, come on! We all knew that!

1175
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:59,083
Can you…

1176
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:00,833
-Sorry.
-Ma'am?

1177
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,041
I…

1178
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,708
-Ma'am, come with me.
-Okay, fine. Blaine?

1179
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,708
What is the name of your manager?

1180
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,416
Sir? I am going to have
to email your manager.

1181
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,416
-Ah!

1182
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,625
Two decades later, and I still love
watching Tiff lose her mind.

1183
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:24,416
-I mean, that was incredibly satisfying.
-Mm-hmm.

1184
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,625
Okay, now I understand

1185
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,458
why you devoted so much of your time
on it in high school.

1186
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,833
-Well, not the whole time.
-Oh?

1187
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:34,166
Just all of my junior,
sophomore, and most of my senior year.

1188
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1189
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,416
Anyways, Marth told me
something about you in high school.

1190
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,583
Oh God. What?

1191
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,166
She said that you had
a crush on me.

1192
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:45,875
Yes.

1193
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,208
When we were in high school,
I was very much in love with you.

1194
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,500
Seth!

1195
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,333
-Eh.
-You were? Really?

1196
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,916
-Eh.
-Why didn't you ever say anything?

1197
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,666
'Cause, you know,
we were friends.

1198
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,375
-Yeah.
-And you were with Blaine.

1199
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,375
And, you know, we both know
what your answer would've been.

1200
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:07,208
Maybe, maybe not.
We're hanging out right now, aren't we?

1201
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:10,916
Yeah, but that's only because you thought
you could use me to make Blaine jealous.

1202
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:14,958
Steph, come on. I'm a full-blown adult.

1203
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:17,875
I think I can recognize
a teenage trick when I see one.

1204
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,791
That's not what's going on.

1205
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:24,500
Oh, come on, you used to pull this with me
and Marth all the time in high school.

1206
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,625
You'd use our attention
to make the popular kids crave yours.

1207
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,416
Um, did I?

1208
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,750
Yes.

1209
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,208
We always wondered
if those kids ever got to really meet you.

1210
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,833
Like, the real you.

1211
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,875
Well, I did have
a really fun time tonight.

1212
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,208
I'm… I'm sorry.

1213
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:44,291
No, forget it.

1214
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,291
So should I take you home?

1215
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:51,041
Or we could continue to hang out.
I have an idea of where we could go.

1216
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,333
Whoa, okay. This place has changed.

1217
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,791
Yeah, I think the lights are just on.

1218
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,000
-Come on.
-Okay.

1219
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,041
Bri, baby, I need favor.

1220
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,416
I want you
to get prom king and queen reinstated.

1221
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:14,708
What?

1222
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,583
Mom.

1223
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,791
No. No one cares about that.

1224
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:19,833
I do.

1225
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,750
I want you to beat Steph for prom queen.

1226
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,750
You said it rewards archaic gender roles.

1227
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:32,750
Well, exactly, which is why
you need to be the woke prom queen.

1228
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:36,041
I've already got interest
from some brands,

1229
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,708
and they are supes into it.

1230
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,791
Mom. I'm not doing this.

1231
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,166
And don't say "woke" or "supes."

1232
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,541
Just beat Steph for mommy.

1233
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,458
You owe me.

1234
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:49,750
For what?

1235
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,500
For being alive.

1236
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:56,541
And if you wanna go on your trip to Nepal,
you will do this for me.

1237
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:03,375
-Can I ask you something?
-Hmm?

1238
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:06,166
Does it get exhausting trying to make
everybody like you all the time?

1239
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,875
Well,

1240
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,333
it will be worth it when I win prom queen.

1241
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:16,416
Well, what I remember about prom
is that it was overhyped,

1242
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,750
you weren't there, and it sucked.

1243
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:23,041
-That's your memories of prom. That's it?
-Yeah, pretty much.

1244
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,333
Seth! Dude, come on.

1245
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:29,291
Did you even try to have fun? Did you
even try to tear it up on the dance floor?

1246
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:32,083
-Just, like, give it the old groove? No!
-Yeah!

1247
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:35,416
It wouldn't have mattered,
because prom doesn't matter,

1248
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,458
especially not prom queen.

1249
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,083
You maniac.

1250
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:40,416
Come on, Steph.

1251
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,083
You will yourself out of a coma,
and that's what you care about?

1252
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,666
-It's more than just a crown to me.
-Hmm.

1253
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,625
When I moved here to America,

1254
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:51,958
it was so hard.

1255
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,458
-Everyone made fun of me, as you remember.
-Yeah.

1256
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,083
And then Mum got sick.

1257
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:02,375
And I was miserable. I was so miserable.

1258
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:07,625
And you know what she used to say
to help cheer me up?

1259
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:13,916
She'd, like, say, "Steph, close your eyes
and imagine your perfect life."

1260
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,458
"And if you can imagine it,
you can have it."

1261
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,875
I was like… …"Shut up, Mom."

1262
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,458
I didn't believe her.

1263
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,125
Then she died.

1264
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,875
Then I was…

1265
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:34,833
I didn't tell anyone, but I was…
I was more miserable than ever.

1266
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,291
And then one day when we were driving
and I saw Deanna Russo,

1267
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:45,208
and I was like, "Whoa, she's happy."

1268
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,250
And she was prom queen,

1269
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,458
and I… I need to be her. Okay?

1270
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,333
I wanted to be her so badly.

1271
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:58,916
And I was getting there,
and then all of a sudden, boom.

1272
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:02,416
Coma. Lights out.

1273
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,458
And I was bloody miserable again.

1274
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,583
Then I thought, "Well…

1275
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:16,625
I should see if I can prove my mum right."

1276
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:26,375
"I should… I should really try
and get that perfect life," you know?

1277
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,291
Okay, definitely not just a crown.
Sorry about that. I'm an asshole.

1278
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,208
No, you're… 

1279
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:36,583
-No, you're not.
-All right.

1280
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:40,333
-Oh!
-Oh! You did it. You got it!

1281
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,750
Oh my God, okay.

1282
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:45,708
-Yeah!

1283
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:46,666
Woot, woot.

1284
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,541
-Oh my God!
-That's all yours. You can have that.

1285
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:56,125
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

1286
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,583
I promise you, you'll have a good time.

1287
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:06,791
Well, I already signed up
to be a chaperone, so, yeah, I'll go.

1288
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:07,708
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.

1289
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,791
-Awesome!

1290
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:11,875
-Great.
-Yeah.

1291
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:13,083
Okay. All right. Wait.

1292
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,125
-Let me try to win you something now.
-Okay. Yeah.

1293
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:17,333
Attention Harding High seniors,

1294
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:20,875
a petition
was just delivered to me by Bri Balbo,

1295
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,416
I mean, Luvs,

1296
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,166
<i>um, officially reinstating</i>
<i>a king and queen election</i>

1297
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,458
<i>at this year's prom.</i>

1298
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:29,500
-What? It's back!
-Prom?

1299
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,000
Oh my God!

1300
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:31,916
Oh my God!

1301
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,833
-Shut up!
-Oh my God!

1302
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,708
Obviously, I respect
the sacred privacy of student elections.

1303
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:41,166
-But I'm totally voting for you.
-Absolutely! Later, prom queen!

1304
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,916
-Love you!

1305
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,625
Can you believe it?

1306
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,375
You might make history after all.

1307
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:05,291
The first person
to ever lose prom queen twice.

1308
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,208
Don't go chasing waterfalls, Steph.

1309
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:11,333
-Skank face.
-What was that?

1310
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:13,833
Oh, nothing.

1311
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,208
Slut bag.

1312
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,166
What did you just call me?

1313
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:20,291
-Nothing.
-Possum pussy.

1314
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:22,041
-Rumpel-slut-skin.
-Jizz collector.

1315
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,291
You're a sad wife.

1316
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,541
What did you say?

1317
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,250
I didn't say shit, but you heard me.

1318
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:41,916
Oh my God.

1319
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,666
It's an invite to a prom party at Bri's.

1320
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,541
-An invite?
-Check your phone!

1321
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,750
Oh my God! I got invited!

1322
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,625
-Can you believe that?
-We got invited!

1323
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,416
-Steve Aoki is DJing.
-Right?

1324
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,250
Steve Aoki? I love it!

1325
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,666
Oh my God!

1326
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:04,250
Steph. Steph, we're not gonna go probably
'cause, I mean, it's a $50 cover.

1327
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,250
-Oh, yeah.
-That's so expensive.

1328
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:07,333
I can't afford that.

1329
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:10,666
Why didn't you tell me we were hosting it?
I'd have got that aphrodisiac wine.

1330
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,166
I didn't know.

1331
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:41,958
Hi, guys.

1332
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43,583
I am so pumped to announce

1333
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,833
that I will be hosting the biggest
and the best prom after-party

1334
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:48,541
at a supersecret locaish.

1335
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,250
It's free to get in, unlike Bri's.

1336
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,000
It's gonna be awesome.

1337
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:57,666
So, DM me a picture of your ballot
voting me as prom queen,

1338
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,708
and you'll get all the deets night of.

1339
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,250
This is weird for me too, sir.

1340
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:18,875
Stephie!

1341
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,208
Wanna hurry it up?

1342
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:26,875
You want a beer?

1343
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,583
Oh, uh, sure.

1344
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:33,125
Wrong answer, hot rod.

1345
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:35,500
You think I'll let you drink
and drive with my daughter?

1346
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,708
Oh, well, I'm actually not driving.
We're taking a Lyft.

1347
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,375
Oh, cool.

1348
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:44,916
Though I suspect Stephanie would prefer
not to spend her prom evening

1349
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,250
with a drunken fool.

1350
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,666
It would just be the o--

1351
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,750
No, I think I'm okay, actually.
I'll maybe have a water, if anything.

1352
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,750
-Did you bring some condoms?

1353
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,083
Um, no.

1354
01:17:56,166 --> 01:18:00,083
Hm. Didn't think we needed
to have this talk, but, uh, Seth,

1355
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:04,208
you are aware that unprotected sex
can lead to geriatric pregnancies?

1356
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,291
-Stephie!
-You ready to be an old dad?

1357
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,750
I'm sorry, do you want me
to sleep with your daughter?

1358
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:10,333
-Or--
-What did you just ask me?

1359
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:12,333
-It's--
-Okay, I'm ready!

1360
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,291
Mom chose great.

1361
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,083
Yeah.

1362
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,875
-Going to prom.

1363
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,375
-Oh my God. Dad, stop it.
-Don't.

1364
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:38,083
Dad, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

1365
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,708
A bit higher on the angle.

1366
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:42,375
Dad, you're taking so many,
but take more, take more.

1367
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:44,416
-Boy band.

1368
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,750
Okay, Dad, that's enough.

1369
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:46,916
-Maybe just some of me?
-Oh.

1370
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:06,291
This is such a perfect night.

1371
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,875
-Yeah.
-That filthy ho.

1372
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:11,625
-She's rigging the election.
-She's an adult. She won't stoop that low.

1373
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,166
Wait.

1374
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,791
Hey, Tiffany.

1375
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,708
-Oh my gosh.
-Hey, Steph!

1376
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,000
I'm surprised you're here.

1377
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:24,875
Aren't you normally on a Saturday night
just home sharpening your teeth?

1378
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,583
You know, I just want to say

1379
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:31,583
the noble thing would be to do
what the rest of these students are doing

1380
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,708
and vote for Bri.

1381
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,083
Oh.

1382
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:36,625
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

1383
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:40,208
Well, I always do the noble thing.

1384
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:43,916
Vote for Bri.
Is it spelled like the cheese?

1385
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,250
B, R, I.

1386
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,166
Hmm.

1387
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,208
Interesting.

1388
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:51,541
Ooh.

1389
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:52,875
Yep. Right in there.

1390
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:53,958
There.

1391
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,875
I'm just so confident.

1392
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:03,833
-Just vote for me.
-Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1393
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:05,458
Sethany.

1394
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:09,208
You know you're not eligible
for prom queen, right?

1395
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:12,500
That's right, I'm not.
I'm not eligible for prom queen.

1396
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:15,291
And it's probably killing you
that you aren't either.

1397
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,625
Relax, Tiff.

1398
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,375
I'm just joking.

1399
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,791
-That's funny.
-It's funny. It was a joke. Yeah.

1400
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,750
-It was a joke.

1401
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,625
She's going down.

1402
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,791
Bye.

1403
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:43,291
-Oh my God, it's beautiful.
-Mm-hmm.

1404
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:45,166
Oh my God, Steph! There you are!

1405
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:49,833
-Oh, you guys look incredible. Amazing!
-Thanks. Wanna go crush the photo booth?

1406
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:52,166
Oh my God, stop.
You're causing climate change.

1407
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,958
Um, I've got to go and get some votes.
I don't know whether you guys saw,

1408
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:59,125
but Bri's mom is, like, totally trying
to rig the election.

1409
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:01,166
Oh! Oh, hell, no!

1410
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,333
I will not stand for voter suppression.

1411
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:06,291
-We're gonna go help spread the word.
-Storm the cafeteria.

1412
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,375
-Bye.
-See you later?

1413
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,291
Everyone feeling included? Okay.

1414
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,833
There's enough room
on the dance floor for everybody,

1415
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:16,000
and you don't need a partner to dance.
I usually dance by myself. It's fun.

1416
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:26,750
Baby, look at me. You know, this is
the dress I won prom queen in. Still fits.

1417
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,875
I almost wore that exact same dress,

1418
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,958
but I'm glad I didn't
because you look phenomenal.

1419
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,666
-Aw.
-What are you doing?

1420
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:36,791
I am fulfilling my duties
as the president of the PTA,

1421
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:39,041
overlooking the ballot boxes,

1422
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:43,708
and something tells me
that you got this in the bag.

1423
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:44,750
Wink.

1424
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:49,000
I mean, you can't be
a woke prom queen if you lose.

1425
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:51,541
Which reminds me, here is a list of brands

1426
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:54,708
I'd love for you to casually drop
during your acceptance speech.

1427
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:57,416
Each one could be an additional 10K.

1428
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,041
Don't worry if you can't work in Pep Boys.
It's not really our thing.

1429
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:05,333
Please just try and remember
this is my prom, not yours.

1430
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,500
-Hey, fam.

1431
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:18,958
Um, guys, just letting you know
that prom queen voting is still open,

1432
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,458
and I think that something--

1433
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,875
Damn, Conway, you look…

1434
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,416
-…banging.

1435
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,625
Oh my God, you're here. I mean, um…

1436
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,208
You came.

1437
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:34,666
Of course, I came. I've been waiting
20 years to see you in this dress.

1438
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,166
My God, you look beautiful.

1439
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,708
What is this? You mind if I slip this off?

1440
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,583
-Um--
-You really don't need it.

1441
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,625
I still have a naughty thing
for prom queens, right?

1442
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:50,416
Well, If I don't get enough votes,
you might be fucking your daughter.

1443
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,583
Huh?

1444
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:55,375
-No, I wouldn't do that, but…
-No. Obviously. Sorry. Yeah.

1445
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,666
Look at us. We are…

1446
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,666
We're meant to be together.
We're perfect together. Admit it.

1447
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,833
We're made for one another.

1448
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,291
-Blaine?
-Yeah.

1449
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,291
I don't think this is right.
This is a mistake.

1450
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,750
No, no. The mistake was me
asking Tiff to prom. Trust me.

1451
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,666
Wait. No, Blaine. Seriously.

1452
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:16,583
Seth.

1453
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:17,541
Seth?

1454
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,416
Hey, Seth. Seth, hey!
I know what that looked like,

1455
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,500
but I promise you,
it's not what you think.

1456
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:28,541
You teenage-tricked me, Steph.

1457
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:33,166
And you know what?
It's my fault for believing you changed.

1458
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:39,875
Okay, class of 2022,
it's the big moment!

1459
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:44,166
Okay, so the reason that we're all here
and the only reason we all came tonight…

1460
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,166
-No.
-…is because-- No, it is.

1461
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:51,708
…is because I have the results
of our prom elections.

1462
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:59,250
By a unanimous vote, our 2022 prom king is

1463
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,583
Lance Harrison.

1464
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:09,916
Yes!

1465
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,250
Oh my God!

1466
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:18,083
And the winner of prom queen
received over 1,000 votes

1467
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:21,583
despite there only being 327 of you.

1468
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:23,708
However, she has just informed us

1469
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,541
that she has withdrawn
from the competition.

1470
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:27,625
What?

1471
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,541
-Okay, so…
-Bri.

1472
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,500
…the 2022 prom queen will go to…

1473
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:38,916
Stephanie Conway.

1474
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,375
There's been a mistake. No, no, no.

1475
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,541
-Go, Steph! I can't believe it!

1476
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:56,458
God!

1477
01:24:56,541 --> 01:25:01,541
Stephanie!
Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie!

1478
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:03,041
Stephanie!

1479
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:04,416
Stephanie!

1480
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,500
No! No!

1481
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:08,791
Stephanie!
Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie!

1482
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:25,833
Now it is time for our king and queen
to take their dance.

1483
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:35,750
-Oh my God!

1484
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,583
-Oh my God!
-What?

1485
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:41,250
Stop.

1486
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:23,583
After-party at Bri's house
with live music.

1487
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:28,125
And spoiler alert, party favors
are Beats by Dre headphones!

1488
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,833
Bri, will you tell them?

1489
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:34,750
Hey, everyone, after-party
is at Steph's place. See you there.

1490
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,791
Wait, what are you doing?
The house is ready for the party.

1491
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:41,500
I mean, Steve Aoki is in our living room.
What am I going to tell him?

1492
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:44,250
I don't know.
Tell him you lost prom queen.

1493
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,708
Shit. Shit.

1494
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,250
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

1495
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:02,541
No!

1496
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:10,625
Yes, hi. I'd like to report
a rowdy high school party

1497
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:13,000
with tons of underage drinking.

1498
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:15,000
And-- Oh my God!

1499
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,333
I think an adult is hosting it.

1500
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,125
Yeah!

1501
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:29,791
Hey!

1502
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:30,750
Hey, Janet!

1503
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:32,208
Come on!

1504
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,125
-No, don't film me!
-Why?

1505
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,500
The media will use it
to try and discredit me.

1506
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:40,666
Wait, no.

1507
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,291
-Fuck it! Fuck it! Film me! Film me!
-Okay. Okay.

1508
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:47,208
Yeah, come on, yeah.
That's right. It's the president, bitch!

1509
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:49,208
-Yeah!
-Suck my vulva!

1510
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,166
Oh my God, whose tooth is this?

1511
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,541
-Oh shit.

1512
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,125
Cops!

1513
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:05,625
-Where? Wait. Okay, wait--
-Bye, Stephanie.

1514
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,291
No. Oh my God.

1515
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:27,041
Oh my God, Martha,
I was just about to call you.

1516
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:31,166
Steph, what in ever living fuck
were you thinking?

1517
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:36,083
-You said I could use the house.
-Are you kidding? Twenty years ago.

1518
01:29:36,166 --> 01:29:39,166
And even then,
I didn't want you to use it.

1519
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,041
-Did you even think about me?

1520
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,666
This is all kinds of illegal.

1521
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:47,333
Oh my God, they're gonna make
a Netflix documentary about me.

1522
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:50,791
Well, wait. Okay, think about that.
That could be really cool.

1523
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,791
That… that could be epic.

1524
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,916
Look how well it turned out
for Tiger King.

1525
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,041
No.

1526
01:29:56,125 --> 01:30:00,166
No, it's not epic or cool.

1527
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,416
God, you're the same as in high school.

1528
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,708
-So you don't want a drink?
-No, I don't want a drink!

1529
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:08,333
You need to grow up!

1530
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:10,250
You're not a teenager!

1531
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:13,833
I know I'm not. I'm an adult.
Is that what you want to hear?

1532
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:18,000
Yes, I am a 37-year-old 12th grader.

1533
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,541
You don't think I know how crazy it is
going back to high school in this body?

1534
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,083
What else was I supposed to do?

1535
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:32,375
-What else did I have?
-You had me, and you had Seth.

1536
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:35,708
Everybody else just got to go on
and live their lives.

1537
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:37,583
I'm supposed to just jump forward?

1538
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,750
I'm just not allowed
to ever make mistakes?

1539
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:43,166
Making mistakes is different

1540
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:46,125
than willfully screwing over
the people who care about you.

1541
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,708
You pushed us away.

1542
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,708
They were not your friends.
We were your friends.

1543
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,250
We were the ones who cared about you.

1544
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,458
We were the ones
who showed up at the hospital.

1545
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,375
They never came to the hospital.
None of them.

1546
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:01,541
I can't believe you would say that.

1547
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,291
I got tons of birthday cards.

1548
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,291
Did you even look
to see who they were from?

1549
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:13,750
Help. Oh God.

1550
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:15,458
Was that curry?

1551
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,708
I'm done. You can find your own way home.

1552
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,166
Hey, Seth.

1553
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:33,583
Finally.

1554
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,666
I saw you followed Stephanie on Insta.

1555
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:39,166
Don't you wanna know if I got arrested
at that party you called the cops on?

1556
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,166
I know it was you.

1557
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:44,000
Do you think I do this stuff for fun?
I'm looking out for you.

1558
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:46,125
We could have made
a hundred grand tonight.

1559
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:49,208
We could've used that money
as a donation to get you into college.

1560
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:51,708
So you could blog
about being an Ivy League mom?

1561
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:54,083
Oh well, I guess
I'll have to get in myself.

1562
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:57,500
I want you to have the perfect life,

1563
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:58,916
like me.

1564
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,708
The perfect life online means nothing
when you're miserable in real life.

1565
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,166
We are not miserable.

1566
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,125
Yeah, we are.

1567
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,583
And you're right, Mom.

1568
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:12,416
No elite person
follows more than 100 people.

1569
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,666
So you gotta go.

1570
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,333
-You are toast.

1571
01:32:17,416 --> 01:32:18,875
Hey, your family's fucked up.

1572
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,333
Are we doing this?
I got another gig in an hour.

1573
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:23,791
You know what? Fuck you, Steve Aoki.

1574
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,875
No offense,
but you look like a prom queen.

1575
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:40,791
Holy shit, Deanna Russo?

1576
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,041
Yeah. Do we know each other?

1577
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:47,708
Oh my God. No. I… I mean…
Well, I know who you are.

1578
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:49,541
You're a legend at Harding High.

1579
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:51,750
You won prom queen and had a perfect life.

1580
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,500
Perfect life?

1581
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:57,208
Yeah. Uh, let's see, um…

1582
01:32:57,291 --> 01:33:01,500
I was divorced before I was 30
when my husband left me

1583
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:05,666
for a 21-year-old barista
with two more abs than I had.

1584
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:10,541
And I was left with no credit
and no job prospects.

1585
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:14,500
My advice, throw that crown away now.

1586
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,666
You know what prom queen got me?

1587
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,416
An even spray tan

1588
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,375
and the ability to dodge bleach poisoning
every time I get my hair done.

1589
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,250
Well, I mean, that is a skill.

1590
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:26,416
Yeah.

1591
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:33,666
But, uh, imagine all the other skills
I would have had if I'd gone to college.

1592
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,500
I don't know where I would be,

1593
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:39,208
but I do know it wouldn't be
taking courses at the community college

1594
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:42,375
while hustling
to make rent between two jobs.

1595
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:46,458
The only thing I look forward to
is taking my pants off at night.

1596
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:48,250
Oh my God. I do that too now.

1597
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:50,708
-It's so good, right?
-Yeah. Just like…

1598
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,375
-Yeah.

1599
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:57,583
But it's all worth it
'cause I am going to get a degree,

1600
01:33:57,666 --> 01:34:02,166
and I am going to have a career,
and that is everything.

1601
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:06,708
And for the first time in my life,
I'm excited about the future

1602
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,416
instead of holding on to the past.

1603
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:42,666
<i>Please welcome</i>
<i>our award-winning Harding Bulldogettes!</i>

1604
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,500
Oh. There you are.

1605
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,000
Is everything okay?

1606
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,208
Want something to eat?

1607
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:31,291
I'm not hungry.

1608
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:34,125
Oh, come on. Sit down with me.
Have breakfast with your old dad.

1609
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:42,625
Do you know
where you're sitting at graduation yet?

1610
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:44,708
On my butt?

1611
01:35:47,416 --> 01:35:49,458
I just wanna get a good seat
so I can see you.

1612
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:53,708
I'm not gonna go to graduation, Dad.

1613
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,458
Seth and Martha won't talk to me,

1614
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:57,791
and I don't think
anybody else wants me there.

1615
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,208
Well, I want you there.

1616
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:00,833
That doesn't count.

1617
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:02,333
Yes, it does.

1618
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,083
I count.

1619
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:10,083
I know you used to roll your eyes
whenever Mom would compliment you,

1620
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,041
tell you how amazing,
beautiful, wonderful you were,

1621
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,750
like she had to say it 'cause she was Mom,

1622
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:19,750
but she wanted to

1623
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:22,666
because she believed it, deeply.

1624
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:28,041
One of the last things
she said to me was to make sure

1625
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:31,291
that you knew how to receive love.

1626
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:35,916
And I spent every day of your coma
wondering if I messed up,

1627
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,250
so… let me be clear.

1628
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:45,166
Don't waste your time
telling the people who love you the most

1629
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,666
that they don't count.

1630
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:50,125
They are the only ones that count.

1631
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,250
Thanks, Dad.

1632
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:56,458
Yeah.

1633
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:05,250
Okay, I know I have
some things to clear up, so…

1634
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,125
I thought this is gonna be the best way.

1635
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:12,958
<i>Guys, I fucked up.</i>
<i>And I really need to apologize.</i>

1636
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,916
<i>First of all, I've been</i>
<i>a really dodgy friend</i>

1637
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,583
<i>to the two people</i>
<i>who care about me the most,</i>

1638
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:23,291
<i>the people who supported me when I was</i>
<i>just that dorky kid fresh from Australia,</i>

1639
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:28,500
<i>the ones who stayed by my side,</i>
<i>even when I majorly neglected them,</i>

1640
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:32,666
<i>the ones who,</i>
<i>for some reason, never gave up on me.</i>

1641
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:36,500
<i>It doesn't matter who has</i>
<i>the most friends or likes or followers.</i>

1642
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,958
<i>If you just have one or two great friends</i>

1643
01:37:39,041 --> 01:37:41,875
<i>who will support you</i>
<i>even when you're being a butt slut,</i>

1644
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,375
<i>then you've got it all.</i>

1645
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:46,333
<i>And that is something worth fighting for,</i>

1646
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:48,416
<i>so fuck what other people think.</i>

1647
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,958
<i>Yeah, like, fuck being popular.</i>
<i>Fuck being cool.</i>

1648
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,625
Fuck it in the ass.

1649
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,333
Stephie, language.

1650
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:59,708
<i>I never planned on taking</i>
<i>two decades to graduate, obvi,</i>

1651
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,666
<i>but the class of 2022</i>
<i>showed me something that</i>

1652
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,333
<i>I could never have learned</i>
<i>when I was in high school the first time.</i>

1653
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:06,833
We have a school archive!

1654
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:12,666
<i>And that is every single one of us</i>
<i>is so unique, and that's awesome.</i>

1655
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,041
<i>Why fit in when you can stand out?</i>

1656
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:19,416
<i>And so, okay, now I'm gonna do something</i>

1657
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,458
<i>that I wish I had</i>
<i>the confidence to do 20 years ago,</i>

1658
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:25,083
<i>and that is being my real self.</i>

1659
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,958
And yeah, I'm still afraid that
if I show everyone my real self,

1660
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,916
the wrong people will make fun of me.

1661
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:34,041
But it's the only way
for the right people to see me.

1662
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,125
And they're the ones
I care about the most.

1663
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:44,458
They're the ones I want,
more than anything, to forgive me.

1664
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:59,541
Dad, stop. Stop it.

1665
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:00,916
That's it.

1666
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:03,416
Dad, just stop it! Press stop.

1667
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,250
-Sorry.

1668
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:06,875
That was beautiful.

1669
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:10,458
Tiff.

1670
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:15,500
My daughter
won't, um, unblock me unless…

1671
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,250
I came to apologize to you.

1672
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:21,041
-Seriously?
-So…

1673
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:22,000
Um…

1674
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:26,208
I am sorry for everything I've done

1675
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:31,208
and for treating you
like human garbage all these years.

1676
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:34,166
Tiff, I'm not the one you should be trying
to make things right with.

1677
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:37,125
You and Blaine have an awesome daughter

1678
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:41,458
who's so smart and way cooler
than what you and I ever were.

1679
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,958
Stop competing with her.

1680
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,458
There's enough room for both of you.

1681
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:50,000
There's enough room for all of us.

1682
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,458
We don't need to fight with each other.

1683
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:54,625
You're right.

1684
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:59,000
I am really sorry, Stephanie,

1685
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,708
for…

1686
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:03,541
everything.

1687
01:40:06,416 --> 01:40:07,291
Yeah.

1688
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,541
Apology accepted.

1689
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,958
-Okay.
-Tiff, wait, um…

1690
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,375
I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

1691
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:21,166
-Hang on.
-That is…

1692
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,083
-Just wait… wait one second.
-…so cute.

1693
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,500
That's for you.

1694
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,791
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-Thanks for coming over.

1695
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,416
Lance Harrison.

1696
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,916
Oh my God.

1697
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:49,791
-I just wanna say thanks to my grandma--
-No, no, no, no.

1698
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:52,833
Just so everybody knows,
nobody else do that. Okay.

1699
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,500
Britney Jean Balbo.

1700
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:01,208
-Yes, Bri!
-Go, baby!

1701
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:02,333
Go, Bri!

1702
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:11,500
Stephanie Marie Conway.

1703
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:15,583
That's my daughter!

1704
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:24,875
Um, oh…

1705
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:28,666
Here. To pay
for all the damage at the lake house.

1706
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,125
Where did you get this from?

1707
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:32,625
I sold the Cabriolet.
Time to grow up.

1708
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:35,458
Aw.

1709
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:36,958
I am so proud of you.

1710
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,166
Aw, thanks, Marth.

1711
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,541
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1712
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:49,333
Congrats, Steph.

1713
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,833
Thanks.

1714
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:53,333
Now, to end our ceremony,
I'd like to invite

1715
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:57,666
our 2022 class valedictorian, Janet Singh.

1716
01:42:00,166 --> 01:42:01,833
-After you.
-Thank you!

1717
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:06,250
Go, Janet!

1718
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,208
Okay, listen up.

1719
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:14,375
It is hot as hell,
and this ceremony is way too long.

1720
01:42:14,458 --> 01:42:16,666
So I'm just gonna say one thing.

1721
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,791
Who you are in high school
doesn't define you.

1722
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:23,166
And I would also like
to officially announce

1723
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,583
my campaign for US president.

1724
01:42:25,666 --> 01:42:27,583
Vote for me in 2040.

1725
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:29,125
Yay!

1726
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:35,916
And lastly,
I have one question for all of you.

1727
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,958
-Are you ready…

1728
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:40,791
-…for the Harding…

1729
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:44,000
-…Bulldogettes?

1730
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:53,833
No way. Stephanie's Dance Grooves?

1731
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:25,958
-Ready?
-Okay!

1732
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,291
-Strong arms!

1733
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:46,083
Okay, I have to go.

1734
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:50,583
-Kelly Clarkson!

1735
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:04,583
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1736
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:11,250
Well, then, we should go out?

1737
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,041
-No duh.

1738
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:36,000
Who doesn't want a Hummer
on their big night?

1739
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:37,541
Not me.

1740
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,875
-I love belly button play.

1741
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,875
I really wanna get spit-roasted
by two leather daddies.

1742
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:50,875
Never before. I'm sex… sex nothing.

1743
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:53,875
-Stop.
-Okay, all righty.

1744
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:01,750
-A-mark.

1745
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:02,791
B-mark.

1746
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,875
I'm making a love heart sign.

1747
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:13,750
What am I doing?
I'm just making a love heart.

1748
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:15,625
Welcome to Book Corner
with Sam Richardson.

1749
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:18,291
-Oh.

1750
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:19,666
Oppa Gangnam Style.

1751
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,500
-Oppa. Oppa.
-Oppa Gangnam Style.

1752
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:23,333
Yeah, very fast.

1753
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:21,208
I really do want to go to college.
So what do I need to do?

1754
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:24,708
I… I would do anything.
I mean, not…

1755
01:48:24,791 --> 01:48:25,708
Oh.

1756
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:29,708
Sorry, I just… Yeah, I… I meant… anything.

1757
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:33,541
No, I didn't… Sorry.
I didn't mean that. I meant…

1758
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:36,666
Oh my God. I meant I will do anything…

1759
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,291
-Oh my God.
-…non-sexually.

1760
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:44,875
Oh, good, good. Don't ever resort to that
unless you have to.

1761
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:47,666
And if that's what you wanna do
with your life, then do it,

1762
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:50,625
but don't do it with me.
I'm terrible in bed.
