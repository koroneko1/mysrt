1
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,416
Your Holiness!

2
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,958
Your Holiness!

3
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:55,166
Two handsome temple boys are here!

4
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,750
Are you up?

5
00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:00,083
-Monk Jazz!
-Monk Jazz!

6
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,083
-Your Holiness!
-You'll be late for almsgiving.

7
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,458
Kor, moor the boat.

8
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,875
-Careful.
-This rock here.

9
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,333
Your Holiness! Monk Jazz!

10
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,125
He's rigorous.

11
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,541
He even meditates!

12
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,916
Enough about me. What about you two?

13
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,500
Since our return from Bangkok,
you two have really been dressing up.

14
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,791
Your Holiness, this isn't much.

15
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,791
When will you stop your pilgrimage?

16
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,625
We're tired of taking a boat
to pick you up here.

17
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,208
-Your Holiness.
-We want to go back to Bangkok.

18
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,958
We want to go to Bangkok.

19
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,583
It's nice here.

20
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,750
No fuss. Calm.

21
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,958
It's also beautiful.

22
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,291
Let's go. It's late.

23
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,708
Careful.

24
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,958
Please, Your Holiness.

25
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,208
-Will you be all right?
-Take him.

26
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,125
Come, Your Holiness.

27
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,000
Get in. Get in.

28
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,750
Hold tight.

29
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,708
No need to hurry. Just go leisurely.

30
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,333
I like it here. It makes us feel calm.

31
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,125
The place is serene.

32
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,083
I want to stay here for a year.

33
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,000
-Isn't it too long, a year?
-What time is it?

34
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,833
It's 6:00 a.m.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,375
Calm down. Paddle carefully.

36
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,250
Your Holiness, it's 9:00 a.m.

37
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,541
No hurry.

38
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,666
If we don't hurry, when will we arrive?

39
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,250
Humans.

40
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,750
We're born with a hot temper.

41
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,166
We want to arrive to destination quickly.

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,333
We want to do things quickly.

43
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
And it turns into temper.

44
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,250
It will end badly.

45
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,750
When the water runs still,

46
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,416
we feel calm.

47
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:28,375
When you see that water
move up towards you,

48
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,708
you feel scared.

49
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,750
It's just water all the same.

50
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
Go calmly.

51
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,333
Let your mind be at ease.

52
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,916
Be conscious.

53
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,125
It's 10:00 a.m., Your Holiness.

54
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,958
It's 10:00 a.m., so what?

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,166
I told you to stay calm.

56
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,958
Like the old proverb says,

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,125
"Slow and steady wins the race."

58
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,625
-No hurry.
-No hurry.

59
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,583
No hurry, Kor.

60
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,333
We've arrived. No need to say anything.

61
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,833
-You need a hand?
-I can do it.

62
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,333
-Careful, Your Holiness.
-Careful!

63
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,083
Will you be all right?

64
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,666
-We'll help.
-I'll do it myself.

65
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,666
Thank you all so much

66
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,916
for making me miss the alms.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,958
You said not to hurry.

68
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
You said we're not late.

69
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,125
I wanted you all to be calm.

70
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,791
Are you sure you won't be hungry?

71
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,208
I've been here for a long time.

72
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,541
Once, I starved for ten days.

73
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,125
I was fine with it.

74
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,291
Are you sure you won't be hungry?

75
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,916
You paddled too slowly!

76
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,625
Monk Jazz!

77
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,250
Here we come!

78
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,041
Monk Jazz, here we come!

79
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,541
On a long-tailed boat, too!

80
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,000
You're sitting still.

81
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,625
Get up! Hurry!

82
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,291
Hurry! Hurry!

83
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,833
Your Holiness! Hurry! Hurry!

84
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,958
Hurry! Hurry!

85
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,166
Monk Jazz!

86
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,375
Hurry! Your Holiness!

87
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,375
Hurry! Your Holiness!

88
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,750
Your Holiness! Hurry! Hurry!

89
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,708
Saisin.

90
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,166
Do you remember when we went
to receive alms in Bangkok?

91
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,916
Of course, I do.
That time when we got lost, right?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,166
But we finally found our way
back to the temple.

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me ask you frankly.

94
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,708
What's with you and Bangkok?

95
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,791
Why do you really want to go back there?

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,125
Bangkok is chaotic,
unlike the countryside.

97
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,083
Everywhere is good and beautiful.

98
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,041
Even the mountain has a heart attack.

99
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,208
-It's heart-shaped, Your Holiness.
-That's right. I was wrong.

100
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,833
Your Holiness, I'll tell you what.

101
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,458
The reason why I want to go to Bangkok
is because I want to be...

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,666
Saisin, you tell him.

103
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,500
Why me? You tell him.

104
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,166
I don't know what you want to be.
A celebrity maybe?

105
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,833
How do you know?

106
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,083
You say that everyday.
You two can't be celebrities.

107
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,291
We can, Your Holiness.

108
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,500
We've come up with the title of a movie.

109
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,541
What is it?

110
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,750
Blow Till You Groan.

111
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,375
"Glow" not "Groan"!

112
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,291
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,250
I think you'll be better in this one.

114
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,166
What is it?

115
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,833
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

116
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,541
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

117
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,458
Action!

118
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,958
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

119
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,916
Ducks are small.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,291
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

121
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,291
This is fine too.

122
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,250
-Not good when you stoop.
-Again then.

123
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
-Time for alms. Quickly!
-Watch us first!

124
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,583
-What?
-Namo, you didn't do it well.

125
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,000
-You do it.
-Your Holiness.

126
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,916
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,666
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

128
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,458
Lower! Ducks are small.

129
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,916
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,875
-Your waist, it won't do.
-How?

131
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,833
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

132
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,208
May you live long and...

133
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,791
So Brutal, So Fucking Duck.

134
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,208
...fucking duck.

135
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,875
I mean, prosper.

136
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,583
You're in time for breakfast!

137
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,333
You can have breakfast today!

138
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,875
Are you happy?

139
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,375
Your Holiness?

140
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,666
How do you feel, Your Holiness?

141
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,416
Say what's on your mind.

142
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,666
Next time, can we use a paddle boat?

143
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,916
This is faster!

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,958
This is quick, Your Holiness.

145
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
Was that Kor or Vin Diesel?

146
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,083
He was going too fast!

147
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,333
Your Holiness, can I ask you something?

148
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,500
When will you stop your meditation?

149
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,958
I've been meditating here.

150
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,041
It feels so good.

151
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
When the place is good,

152
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,666
you don't leave that place, right?

153
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,208
How long will you stay here?

154
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,375
Three months.

155
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,666
-Eight months.
-Eight?

156
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,791
-Ten months.
-Ten months?

157
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,916
You stay alone then?

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,916
I've been waiting for you to say that.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,333
-You say it yourself.
-Maybe a year and a half.

160
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,333
A year and a half!

161
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,750
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

162
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,083
-I'll leave.
-I haven't eaten yet.

163
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,500
Sorry.

164
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,208
I'm going, Your Holiness!

165
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,166
What you're taking now is worse.

166
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,083
-Quickly.
-Quickly, Kor.

167
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,500
Quickly!

168
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,083
What is this?

169
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,166
You said you would stay for ten months.

170
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,916
Well, you're done after just one day.

171
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,416
Quickly! Quick!

172
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,000
It took us so long.

173
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,375
Are you all right, Your Holiness?

174
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,791
Heard you didn't get any sleep last night.

175
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,708
Did someone come to stay with you?

176
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,625
I heard there were three of them.

177
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,000
How did you know?

178
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,875
Well...

179
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,541
Your Holiness, are you sure
Monk Chongruai is here?

180
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,041
Yes.

181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,208
Before coming here,

182
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,708
I called him.

183
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,875
Where are you going?

184
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,083
You don't wait for us.

185
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,000
Quickly.

186
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
-It's heavy.
-Quick.

187
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
-This stuff is heavy.
-Quick.

188
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,750
BUDDHA VADI

189
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,083
Oh, God!

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,291
Can't take it anymore!

191
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,416
Your Holiness.

192
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,791
Monk Chongruai.

193
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,208
Your Holiness.

194
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,333
Your Holiness.

195
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,625
Your Holiness!

196
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,833
Monk Jazz.

197
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,000
Why didn't you call my name?

198
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,375
Why did you all come so quietly?

199
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,250
How was that quiet?

200
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,625
I plan to go back
to the temple in the country.

201
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,041
I heard that you became the monk
here at this temple.

202
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,666
So I came to visit you.

203
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,666
How have you been?

204
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,916
Do you want a password?

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,333
There's no WiFi here.

206
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,291
And the WiFi...

207
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,416
WiFi? Did you ask?

208
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,708
I did not!

209
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's do this.

210
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's go sit somewhere and talk.

211
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,041
Here.

212
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Your Holiness,
why did you choose to stay here?

213
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,625
People often redeem their vows
to Buddha here.

214
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,916
Around 10,000 firecrackers
go off every day.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,750
Bang! Bang! Bang! Always so loud.

216
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,000
1,000 FIRECRACKERS
FOR SUCCESS IN WORK, WEALTH, AND LOVE

217
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,416
It's giddy, dull, and deafening.

218
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,291
That's why.

219
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,083
There's so many things here.
Since you're here,

220
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
I would like to ask you for help.

221
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,583
Many years ago, there was a woman

222
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,166
who left her son at this temple.

223
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,916
He was ordained as a novice monk
and stayed for years.

224
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,041
I want your help
taking this kid to Bangkok

225
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,791
so that he can go find his father.

226
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,000
It'd be inconvenient.
I must return to the temple.

227
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,541
Well, if you agreed, I'd feel at ease.

228
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll leave it to you then.

229
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,916
No, I can't do it.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,166
Good. Good.

231
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,500
I feel at ease now.

232
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,916
After taking him to Bangkok,
if you want to go on a pilgrimage,

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,625
then it's up to you.

234
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,541
Good. Good.

235
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,208
All right then.

236
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:16,791
You said yes earlier, and now you tell me
you can't? What do you want then?

237
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,458
Don't confuse me.

238
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,708
No, no. I can't.

239
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,625
Good, good.
Well, then I'll give you this now.

240
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,041
Here.

241
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,041
Go find him.

242
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,583
He's Abbot Chaiya.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,541
A preacher.

244
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:39,833
Accumulation of merit for yourself

245
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,583
can be done simply by
making a donation to the temple.

246
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,958
Your face will be wrinkle free.

247
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,625
-Do you like that?
-Yes!

248
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,583
People say merit

249
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,666
can help with everything.

250
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,791
It helps people be normal.

251
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,041
You'll stand out and be dignified

252
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,083
because you've made merit.

253
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,291
He knows everyone in Bangkok.

254
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,666
All right.

255
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll leave it to you.

256
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,416
Kid.

257
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,750
Yes.

258
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,333
Come here.

259
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,166
Wait. Pay respect to Monk Jazz.

260
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,458
And then Monk Jazz will...

261
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,000
Not here. That way.

262
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,208
That way, son. All right.

263
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,708
Very endearing.

264
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,000
Please take care of him.

265
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,666
Be safe, son.

266
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,666
Your Holiness, can I ask you something?
Is he well-behaved?

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,416
Around 5:00 a.m.

268
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,333
Thanks a lot.

269
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,500
What is there around 5:00 a.m.?

270
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,541
It's 6:00 a.m. after 5:00 a.m.

271
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,916
That's even worse.

272
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,208
Behave. Don't get carried away in Bangkok.

273
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,625
Don't go outside the temple.
There's a lot of traffic in Bangkok.

274
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,208
You might get hit by a car.

275
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,625
Monk Jazz, please take care of him.
He can be stubborn.

276
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,000
Your Holiness.

277
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,583
Please don't worry.

278
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,250
I'll take care of him.

279
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:38,541
I heard it too. She will come perform
near the temple.

280
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,375
I saw the signboard.

281
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,208
I said I will take care of him.

282
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,791
I got it. You mean the singer,
Lamyai Haithongkham, right?

283
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,958
Goodbye then.

284
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,833
Your Holiness.
The outfit for Bangkok is ready.

285
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,500
-Handsome, cool, and awesome?
-Awesome?

286
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,916
You're wearing this in Bangkok?

287
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,791
-Why?
-For the producer, Poj Arnon.

288
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,708
That's right.

289
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,958
-What if you meet other producers?
-What?

290
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,083
Yes. Good luck, everyone.

291
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,041
Bangkok!

292
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,750
This.

293
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,375
A society where everyone
plays with their phones.

294
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,041
Look.

295
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,291
All with their phones.

296
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,208
You.

297
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,208
You. Why are you lowering your head?

298
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,833
I don't have a phone. I'm just sleepy.

299
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,125
Monks can fall down.

300
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,291
So can novice monks.

301
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,833
You.

302
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,375
Monk Eakachai! Still a monk?

303
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,916
Your Holiness.

304
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,791
Yes.

305
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,000
You said you'd leave monkhood a while ago.

306
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,333
Your Holiness.

307
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,083
I thought I would do that,
but I changed my mind.

308
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,833
Since I got ordained and studied,
I decided to stay.

309
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,833
My parents said it's better for me
to stay, which is true.

310
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,791
I wanted to study more dharma.

311
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,041
I studied in Surat Thani for three months.

312
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,500
Told my folks I'd be a monk
the rest of my life.

313
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,833
And he is...

314
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,041
This is Monk Ple.

315
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,875
I'm from Lamphun.

316
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,250
I moved to Chiang Mai.

317
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,250
I came to Bangkok to study dharma.
At first, I didn't know anyone.

318
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,791
I met Monk Eak. He's so nice.

319
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,291
Monk Ple is nice. He's a good monk.

320
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,166
So good, Your Holiness. It's true.

321
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,000
Well...

322
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,458
What are you doing here in Bangkok?

323
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,666
I'm here to take him to meet Abbot Chaiya.

324
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,750
Hello, Monk Sun.

325
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,375
Hey, Ekachai. Who have you brought here?

326
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,791
This is Monk Jazz.

327
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,000
He's here to meet Abbot Chaiya.

328
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,208
I accompanied this kid
to meet His Holiness.

329
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,000
Today's not good.

330
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,666
His Holiness is very sick.

331
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,250
Please come back another time.

332
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,291
We came from the province.

333
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,958
That's all right.

334
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,041
Please stay the night here.

335
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,000
Wait for His Holiness to get better
so you can talk.

336
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,041
It's not expensive. 500 baht a night.

337
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,791
I'll go sleep at Phuwing Hotel.
It's only 350 baht a night.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,750
The soap is so tiny there.

339
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,000
You're funny like me. I like that.

340
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,541
Well, then please. Hope you find a place
to sleep with trouble.

341
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,541
With no trouble?

342
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,833
Many mosquitoes here. No AC.
It's not comfortable.

343
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,916
We'll be fine.

344
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,791
We'll stay at the temple again?

345
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,083
But it's fine too.
We can enjoy the nightlife.

346
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,583
Hell of a beat, you two.

347
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,500
Please, make yourselves at home.

348
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Your Holiness.

349
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,416
Your Holiness.

350
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,375
Your Holiness, it's all right.

351
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,333
Your Holiness, calm down!

352
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,041
Your Holiness!

353
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,333
Your Holiness! Doctor!

354
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,541
Your Holiness!

355
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,250
What? Your Holiness?

356
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,750
I'm gonna die because of you.

357
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,375
Oh, sorry.

358
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,458
I thought you were having a heart attack,
so I performed CPR.

359
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,041
Change the caretaker.

360
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,375
Your Holiness, please give me
another chance.

361
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,333
Ble, how did you end up at this temple?

362
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,708
Actually, I plan to be ordained here.

363
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,708
But it's not time yet.

364
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,458
So I stay here to prepare myself.

365
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,916
Nakhee.

366
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,750
Do you have a husband?

367
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,500
No, I don't.

368
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,666
Nakhee,

369
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,125
all this time,

370
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
though you've had no feelings for me,

371
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,000
please remember this.

372
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,708
In our other lives,

373
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,541
I will still love you.

374
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,583
Nakhee,

375
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,500
though we are not meant to be together,

376
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,083
I...

377
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,833
will keep my legs open.

378
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,458
Will keep waiting for you.

379
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,291
Ble!

380
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,125
What's wrong?

381
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,333
I don't know.

382
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,708
-I'm really going.
-Going where?

383
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,625
Anywhere! I'm a grown-up.

384
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,750
-I'm going.
-For God's sake.

385
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,708
Was I dreaming?

386
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,791
-What's up?
-They're here.

387
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,583
Your Holiness.

388
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,208
Please take them here.

389
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,333
Please.

390
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,500
This way please.

391
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:54,625
You're Monk Jazz, right? You were on TV.

392
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,541
Yes.

393
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,541
You're famous.

394
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,208
Will you be a dealer for Heaven Mic?

395
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,000
Your Holiness.

396
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,583
Should we stop talking about Mic?

397
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,041
All right.

398
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,708
Do you keep water lizards as pets?

399
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,416
Your Holiness, you're a monk.
I will knock you all out.

400
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,333
Knock us all out? You're picking a fight.

401
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,541
Monk Sun, call all temple boys.

402
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,250
Gather everyone. Assemble! Quick!

403
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,291
Wait. Wait.

404
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,750
Your Holiness.

405
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,583
We've come in peace.

406
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,125
All right.

407
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,166
So you don't dare!

408
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,833
This is me again. Please come now!

409
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,291
Anything to add?

410
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,875
No, Your Holiness.

411
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,541
If not, then what has brought you here?

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,083
I came to visit Monk Chongruai
in the province.

413
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,291
And he asked me

414
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,333
to take to this novice to meet
Abbot Chaiya.

415
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,333
What's your name?

416
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:08,708
My name is Pleum. I'm four years old.
My mom's name is...

417
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,583
Hormone.

418
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:14,416
But I don't know my father
because my mother has many husbands.

419
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,958
My special talent is,
I can chant homage to Buddha.

420
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,125
Namo Tassa, Bhagavato--

421
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,791
No need, Novice. It's ok.

422
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,875
Here's your tea, Your Holiness.

423
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Please pass it on.

424
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,166
Are you Ble?

425
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,541
Jazz?

426
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,958
-You should fight him solo.
-As Thai teens, we should pummel him.

427
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,000
You start. I follow.

428
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,750
If he falls, I'll strike again.

429
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,416
I'll take care of it. Do everything
like movie theater staff.

430
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,166
-Iced coffee?
-Damn, iced coffee?

431
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,583
Really?

432
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,791
I'm not drinking this!

433
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,541
Can I stab you with a straw?

434
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,791
You're new. Don't act up.

435
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,750
Don't stay still. Don't be a coward.

436
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:15,208
Look at me when you talk to me!
Why are you looking at me?

437
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,375
-You told me to.
-I'm not eating pork.

438
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,916
I mean, looking at your face.

439
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,583
Fermented sausage on my face?

440
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,208
I mean, staring at your face.

441
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,416
Looking at the face then?

442
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,958
Wanna pack your stuff and go home?

443
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,916
Don't be nosy, or you'll get hurt.

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,791
You'll get blood on your shirt.

445
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,000
-You, just go home!
-You asshole!

446
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,375
Okay, I'm leaving then.

447
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,833
You bastards.

448
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:39,583
You called me an asshole?

449
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, God...

450
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,125
Step away.

451
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,208
There are so many of them.

452
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,458
Kneel at my feet.

453
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,750
-What?
-Kneel at my feet.

454
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,416
-Last year, someone said that to me.
-Said what?

455
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,458
"Kneel at my feet."

456
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,875
Hope I don't have to say

457
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:55,958
what I did to him.

458
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:59,500
I don't have to say it!

459
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,333
I don't have to say much.

460
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,125
He's bold.

461
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,041
Hit here, here, and here.

462
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,791
And then, bam!

463
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,458
-Why are you shaking?
-I'm cold 'cause of AC.

464
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,541
Don't shake.

465
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,583
Do you have a problem with my bro?

466
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,291
We'll have a long conversation.

467
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,666
Enough. I got excited.

468
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,125
Are you afraid of me?

469
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,708
I think I am.

470
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,375
Yes.

471
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,041
I heard you were ordained as a monk.

472
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,416
I almost got to be ordained,

473
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,916
but something happened.

474
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,750
What thing?

475
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,208
That day...

476
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,041
Stop!

477
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,916
You can't be ordained yet.

478
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,958
You must be curious who I am.

479
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,583
It's me, Lovesick.

480
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,666
-You can't be ordained yet.
-Why?

481
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,125
You got my friend pregnant.

482
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,416
-Who?
-You!

483
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:54,666
Who got pregnant?

484
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,083
Hormone!

485
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,041
Hormone?

486
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,208
Hormone?

487
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,083
Jazz, I'm pregnant.

488
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:07,500
Three months, four days, five hours,

489
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,541
twenty minutes

490
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,375
-pregnant.
-Yes.

491
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,666
I can be a witness.

492
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,291
Jazz, are you all right?

493
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,916
Should the baby die?
You don't have a father. Should you?

494
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,833
Don't worry.

495
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,250
Jazz!

496
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,708
What's wrong, Your Holiness?

497
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,375
Did you really do it?

498
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,083
I was drunk. Can't recall.

499
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:36,708
God helps those who help themselves.

500
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm happy for you.

501
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,791
You get to meet your son today.

502
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,291
Oh, God!

503
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,541
This is not my son.

504
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,166
How can he not be?

505
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,958
Tell him your mother's name.

506
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,500
My mother's name is Hormone.

507
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,416
Not true.

508
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,458
My son doesn't look like this.

509
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,750
I'm leaving then.

510
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,833
I'll take my leave too.

511
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,416
Monk Jazz.

512
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,125
Don't hurry back.

513
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,541
Please stay with Novice
for a few more days.

514
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,875
That's right. I don't want to go back.
Haven't met Poj Arnon yet.

515
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,625
You want to meet Poj Arnon?

516
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,041
Poj Arnon comes to this temple often.

517
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,500
Does he come to make merit?

518
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,750
To get rid of misfortune.

519
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,666
-Why?
-Too much criticism on the Net.

520
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,833
-Hello, Song.
-What's up, Ble?

521
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,458
You know who I met today?

522
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,458
How would I know? Who did you meet?

523
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,000
-I met Nakhee.
-Nakhee?

524
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,916
-And Jazz.
-Jazz?

525
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,583
-Monk Jazz.
-He's a monk now?

526
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,833
He brought me something.

527
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:48,750
What is it?

528
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,416
-A child.
-A child?

529
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,291
He said Hormone and I are the parents.

530
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,375
You and Hormone are the kid's parents?

531
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:58,125
You should get a DNA test.

532
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,666
What is DNA?

533
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,416
You're so stupid!

534
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,666
I don't know either.

535
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,458
I only know you need
that child's hair for the test

536
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,041
to find out who the father is.

537
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,666
-Where is this test?
-At the hospital, stupid!

538
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,458
Since I became friends with you guys,

539
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,750
-I've become smarter.
-That's for sure.

540
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,583
Nam, right?

541
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,000
-Yes.
-Rain water.

542
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,666
Pus.

543
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,083
Pus leaks everywhere she goes.

544
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,416
From her wounds.

545
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,541
It just leaks.

546
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:32,958
What's up?

547
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,250
There's a ghost at my house,
Your Holiness.

548
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,833
Everywhere in your house?

549
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,416
Yes, everywhere.

550
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,875
At the dressing table too?

551
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,625
Yes, there too.

552
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,833
And your bedroom?

553
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,583
Yes, bedroom too.

554
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,750
You see a ghost wherever
there's a mirror, right?

555
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,416
Yes, Your Holiness.

556
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,000
Evidently.

557
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,750
I'm a monk.

558
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,500
It's not my business to deal with ghosts.

559
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,541
Please help me, Your Holiness.

560
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:05,625
-Please sympathize with me.
-People come and ask for help.

561
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,500
We shouldn't ignore that.

562
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,208
What's up, Monk Jazz?

563
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,875
I'm here to say goodbye.

564
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,041
Wait.

565
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,583
The province will always be there.

566
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,166
You can go back anytime.

567
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,833
Can you please stay and help me?

568
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,791
If you want my help, then I'm glad.

569
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,708
Promise me?

570
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,500
Yes.

571
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:35,250
Please help deal with the ghost
at Nam's house.

572
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,375
Ghost!

573
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,583
Clearly!

574
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,708
Take care of it! Quick, Your Holiness!

575
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,583
Haunted right at the front door!

576
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,541
You!

577
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,000
Why are you scared?

578
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,875
This is Nam
the owner of this house, not a ghost.

579
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,833
Please.

580
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,250
Are we really going in there?

581
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,083
Come on in.

582
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,541
No...

583
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,000
Come on in.

584
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,375
No, Your Holiness.

585
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,916
No, Your Holiness.

586
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,958
I'm scared.

587
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,583
It's dark.

588
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,083
-Oh, God!
-Clearly, Your Holiness.

589
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,666
Tie it with holy thread.

590
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,125
You don't have to be scared.

591
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,291
This is my little sister.

592
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,916
Her name is Noona.

593
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,458
She's living, right?

594
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:39,166
Yes, 100%. Give them your hand.

595
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,958
Both of them.

596
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,666
A monk can't touch women.

597
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,750
Oh, gosh.

598
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,791
Please come in.

599
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:54,958
Gosh.

600
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,458
Come on in.

601
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,166
Your Holiness, I'm scared.

602
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,541
I'm scared.

603
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,083
Gosh!

604
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,416
Put away the holy thread.

605
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,250
Time to use this.

606
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,500
Go ahead, Your Holiness.

607
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,125
Don't be afraid.

608
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,041
This is my son.

609
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,208
His name is Chaonai.

610
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,000
Say hi to Your Holiness.

611
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,916
Hello, Your Holiness.

612
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:37,125
Come on, the ghost is upstairs.

613
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,916
Help!

614
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,458
Help! Please help!

615
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,083
It's so scary.

616
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,708
Go away from this house!

617
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,291
Still here?

618
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,125
Damn! I'm not a ghost!

619
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,500
Stop throwing rice at me! It hurts!

620
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,083
You're not a ghost?

621
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,208
A ghost could be this beautiful?

622
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:02,583
Nam, Noona, please help me.

623
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,875
It's so scary. Please help.

624
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,500
The ghost is upstairs.

625
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,166
Your Holiness,
you're really going up there?

626
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,541
Stop pushing me.

627
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,166
God, I can't take it anymore.

628
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,333
Stop pushing me.

629
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,750
I'm scared.

630
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,833
Scared me.

631
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,875
Which room?

632
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,833
This one.

633
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,041
Okay.

634
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:46,250
Your Holiness! I said the other room.

635
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,166
Why didn't you go in the other room?

636
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,625
Your Holiness! Ghost!

637
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,916
Your Holiness!

638
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:10,916
I see nothing.

639
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,958
Where did it go?

640
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,375
It was just right here!

641
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,708
Where?

642
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,416
Loud and clear, Namo.

643
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,958
-You were in the picture in that room?
-Yes.

644
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,041
-So you're a ghost?
-Yes.

645
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,833
-Your Holiness!
-I'm going.

646
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:47,833
Go! Quick!

647
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,458
Go. Go.

648
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,708
You.

649
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,291
It's wrong, what you're doing.

650
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,958
Why are you haunting
this scary-looking family?

651
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,166
Please go haunt some other place.

652
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,083
I'm not haunting them.

653
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,625
Give me a talisman.

654
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,708
-It's not with me.
-Give me a talisman.

655
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:20,208
Are you gonna kick me out?

656
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,791
You're being defiant.

657
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,000
Defiant.

658
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,416
That's the wrong side. The other side.

659
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:33,708
Put it away. It doesn't work.

660
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,250
If you want to get out alive,

661
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,458
have these two come in this room.

662
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,541
Why?

663
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,375
You want to be dead?

664
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,291
Of course not.

665
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,958
A living human shouldn't be this stupid.

666
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,125
So your skirt got stuck in the door.

667
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:02,958
Your Holiness! Run!

668
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:03,958
Thanks!

669
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,041
A ghost shouldn't be this stupid!

670
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,125
Why are you stepping on it?

671
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:13,791
Go.

672
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,791
You must die first.

673
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,333
Go! Quickly!

674
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,333
Go! Quickly!

675
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,791
I'm going. Bye.

676
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,458
This damn skirt!
Should have taken it off when I was dead.

677
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,875
Wait for me! I'm gonna get you,
Your Holiness!

678
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,833
How were things at Nam's?

679
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,875
Look at my face.

680
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,833
It was so scary there.

681
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,458
A ghost?

682
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,791
The people in that house.

683
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,291
Everyone looks so creepy there.

684
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:02,083
Don't blame her. It's nobody's fault,
what they're born with.

685
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:08,125
They have a face like that because they
did many bad things in their past lives.

686
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,208
They killed many toads.

687
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,375
Face?

688
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,375
Monk Jazz, what are you doing here?

689
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,166
I'm here to see Novice Pleum.

690
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,750
He's around here somewhere.

691
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,166
Don't force yourself.

692
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,250
You want me to help?

693
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,750
Please do.

694
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,000
Novice.

695
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,500
I want you all to be quiet.

696
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,208
Novice. Don't fight.

697
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,916
Calm down. Sit down first.

698
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,166
Novice! Sit down first.

699
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,375
Sit down! Don't fight!

700
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,958
-Novice!
-Don't fight.

701
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,500
Sit down! Here's a snake!

702
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,666
Khob!

703
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,541
What's wrong?

704
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,166
I'm practicing my dance skills.

705
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,708
-Am I doing okay?
-Look at me.

706
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,625
A nice waist you've got there.

707
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:43,333
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to see His Holiness.

708
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,208
-Where are all the novices?
-They're in class.

709
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,541
Take me there.

710
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,458
Why don't you go there yourself?

711
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,041
-Will you take me or see His Lameness?
-"Holiness."

712
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:52,958
Okay.

713
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,333
-Are you going or what?
-Okay then.

714
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:56,916
You're easy to persuade.

715
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How are my dance steps?

716
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,833
Enough, do it just like me.

717
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,791
-Here, here.
-Twist.

718
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,291
Yeah, twist.

719
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,416
Twist some more?

720
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:07,416
Like this?

721
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,458
Enough, you.

722
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,500
-When will we arrive?
-Here we are.

723
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:18,875
Where are all the kids?

724
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,125
Just turn left and here there are.

725
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,916
Oh, no!

726
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,416
I forgot my appointment with His Holiness.
Just go in there yourself.

727
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,625
Gosh, I forgot.

728
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,250
Who is it?

729
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
Don't cry.

730
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,958
-What are you doing?
-Don't cry.

731
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,291
Stay still!

732
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,708
Let me have a look.

733
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,000
What are you doing?

734
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,916
You have no hair?

735
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,958
I'm being ordained.

736
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,916
What can I use for a DNA test?

737
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,916
You have no armpit hair.

738
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,583
-How about your nuts?
-I don't know.

739
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:18,416
What are you doing?

740
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,250
I'll tell His Holiness.

741
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,416
Shut up.

742
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,125
How can you wear boxers?

743
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,500
I keep it a secret.

744
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,166
Damn, yours is bigger than mine.

745
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,875
-Can you dance?
-Not very well.

746
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:37,333
I bought love online. My heart is for you.

747
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,666
You said "not very well."

748
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:39,750
Turn around.

749
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,458
-Can you sing?
-Yes.

750
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,041
-A song by Ble Patumrach.
-Okay.

751
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:43,958
To me,

752
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,250
you're precious...

753
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,791
-Facebook...
-has no response...

754
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,916
-Hug you,
-for the last time.

755
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,041
-I'm not a coward,
-and I can't win her heart.

756
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,291
It's not Ble Patumrach's.
It's by Zack Chumphae.

757
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,583
You're like me when I was young.

758
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,208
Or are you my son?

759
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,583
-You want to have a father?
-Yes.

760
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,916
Try hugging me.

761
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,333
Wait! I forgot.

762
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,375
What's up, Ble?

763
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,083
Hello, Song. Novice has no hair.

764
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,291
You idiot!

765
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,125
Do you have some cotton swabs?

766
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,708
Open his mouth.

767
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:29,125
Swab the bulge of his cheeks
with cotton swabs.

768
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:30,916
Stay still!

769
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,625
Open your mouth.

770
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:38,125
When you're done,
you keep these cotton swabs safe.

771
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,500
That's the DNA.
Bring them to the hospital for a test.

772
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,250
See if the DNA matches with yours, okay?

773
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,666
Okay, I got it.

774
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,458
Whose car is that?

775
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,833
His Holiness is in there too.

776
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, Your Holiness.

777
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,000
No, no need.

778
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,416
It's fine. Go, go.

779
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,916
I would have been back a long time ago,
but Sun...

780
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,166
Until the next morning.

781
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,333
I enjoyed that.

782
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,041
Yeah, Your Holiness.

783
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,750
Where have you been, Your Holiness?

784
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, well, I was invited out.

785
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,166
You got up early.

786
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,208
I was out since yesterday.

787
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:36,875
I was invited out to chant prayers

788
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,375
called Yavikarajanang.

789
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
What is it called?

790
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,125
Yavikarajanang.

791
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,500
It's the prayers chanted at night.

792
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,750
They exist, these prayers?

793
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,583
Yes, they do.

794
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,875
You haven't mastered them yet.

795
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,250
Where are you going?

796
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,916
It's to receive alms.

797
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,625
Why do you have to do that?

798
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,291
Why is that?

799
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,583
People will come giving alms
at the temple.

800
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,291
Yes, yes. He doesn't know.

801
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,750
Your Holiness.

802
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,750
Let Monk Jazz go receive alms.

803
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:18,708
We should go back to our rooms,
or we will be hungover.

804
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,833
What hangover?

805
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:27,583
Arahang Samma Sammasabuddho Bhagava

806
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,166
-Let's go, Your Holiness.
-Yeah, yeah.

807
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,958
Your Holiness!

808
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,166
Your Holiness, you're always like this.

809
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,125
Stay focused, Your Holiness.

810
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,000
Go straight. Be still.

811
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,583
-Be still.
-They were drinking.

812
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,541
Your Holiness, they stink of liquor.

813
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,416
Arahang Samma

814
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,333
-Holy--
-Don't say it.

815
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,708
I know.

816
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,666
Your Holiness.

817
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,708
That Yavikarajanang prayer.
Does it really exist?

818
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,083
Can a monk leave his temple late at night?

819
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,291
He said he was being invited out.
So that's that.

820
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,916
What kind of invitation at that hour?

821
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,833
Your Holiness, please.

822
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,666
Today's my son's birthday.

823
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:38,416
May you live long and prosper.

824
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,791
Were you in that viral video
where you swore at a policeman?

825
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:45,375
DO NOT IMITATE.
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.

826
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,541
Why did you do that?

827
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,750
I just recalled, so I asked.

828
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:49,708
What do you want?

829
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,291
Hey, you!

830
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,541
I'm ordained. I'm a monk.

831
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,041
Good for you. Otherwise, you'd be dead.

832
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,333
I cursed at a policeman.
Why not at a monk?

833
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,625
-Did you bring a razor?
-Why do you need it?

834
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,250
-To shave my head so I can fight a monk.
-People can get angry.

835
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,708
It's normal to be mad.

836
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:10,541
But you have to be conscious.

837
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,375
I understand what you did.

838
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:16,208
But you have to know this.
If you've done 100 good things,

839
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:18,125
and you do one bad thing,

840
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,791
nobody will think about
all the good things you've done.

841
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,041
You do one bad thing,

842
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,291
it will destroy all the good things
that you've done.

843
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:31,166
Think carefully before doing anything.
Be conscious.

844
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,791
Be rational, not emotional.

845
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,041
After listening to me,

846
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,500
I hope you understand this better.

847
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,625
-Any question?
-Take off your robe and fight me.

848
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,833
Go! Go!

849
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,750
Please, Your Holiness.

850
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,750
Please, Your Holiness. Please, get in.

851
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:01,083
Where is he going again?

852
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,708
Your Holiness!

853
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:12,541
I saw the same car picking up His Holiness

854
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:14,708
and his crew again.

855
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,541
They were probably invited out.

856
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,250
What invitation at this hour?

857
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,500
Don't you want to know
where they're going?

858
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,375
I do, but it's none of my business.

859
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,625
Let's do this. You don't have to butt in.

860
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,208
We'll find out for you.

861
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,333
Is that good?

862
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:38,791
It's all good, except when you said
I didn't have to butt in.

863
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:39,708
Your Holiness,

864
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,791
you don't have to believe in our talent.

865
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,833
Just trust us.

866
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:46,875
This is not a thing anymore.

867
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,166
What's in now?

868
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,166
What is this?

869
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:00,333
We're going.

870
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,333
Please, Your Holiness.

871
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,333
Walk carefully.

872
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,250
Your Holiness.

873
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,375
I think we need an escalator here.

874
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,041
Be patient.

875
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,250
Wait for the sales of Heaven Mic to go up.

876
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,041
I'm waiting for that.

877
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,000
Hurry, Your Holiness. You'll be late.

878
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,708
You took a bath or what?

879
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,541
Frankly, I forgot.

880
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:47,375
Please get some rest...

881
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,625
or you'll have a hangover.

882
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:50,875
What hangover?

883
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:57,000
Arahang Samma Sambuddho Bhagava

884
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:02,458
The morning comes, and you've just arrived

885
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:07,666
You denied that you were not drinking

886
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,416
But, damn, you reek of alcohol.

887
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,583
Amen.

888
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:17,708
Oh, Your Holiness.

889
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,416
He got the whole prayer.

890
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,041
I'm leaving then.

891
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,875
Monk Jazz,

892
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,375
that prayer,

893
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,458
when you have time, write it down for me.

894
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:30,625
Please.

895
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:37,375
Yes.

896
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,708
Smelly, very smelly.

897
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:41,916
It's gastroesophageal reflux disease.

898
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,500
Go, go.

899
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,125
Here's the target.

900
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,750
-Hello, Your Holiness.
-Hello, Your Holiness.

901
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,958
Do you remember us?

902
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,125
Sang and Kang.

903
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:26,750
Exactly.

904
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,208
How can I forget you?

905
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:32,250
Bastards like you two,
I remember them well.

906
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,791
Thank you for the honor.

907
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,541
Have you been well?

908
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,500
Yes, Your Holiness.

909
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:43,083
I heard Monk Jazz
has come to Bangkok, right?

910
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,791
Yes, I met him last week.

911
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,000
That's right. He was with a novice monk.

912
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,625
A very cute little boy.

913
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,375
But Monk Jazz is not here.

914
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,375
Where is he then?

915
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,750
He's at
the Dharmathikarn Benchamarachasit...

916
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,458
Vivekvikaramon Praditmongkol Temple.

917
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,000
Yes.

918
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,416
Right.

919
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:12,458
You all...
you have to pay attention in class today.

920
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:13,916
Wait.

921
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:18,166
You should join the Army
with all your walking.

922
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,250
You told us to watch all novice monks.

923
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,708
No need to do it that seriously,

924
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,291
like a military parade.

925
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,708
Just go stand like
some soldiers over there.

926
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,333
Do you know
why your parents sent you to study here?

927
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,541
Because they want you

928
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:42,375
to learn about dharma

929
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,041
and religion.

930
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,541
When you grow up,

931
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:50,125
you'll have moral codes in your heart.

932
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:54,000
And, in the future,
you'll be good citizens in our society.

933
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:58,625
-Understood?
-Yes.

934
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,833
We have Heaven Mask and Hell Mask.

935
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,208
You do bad things,

936
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,708
you get Hell Mask.

937
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,458
-Good deeds for Heaven Mask.
-3,500 baht.

938
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,458
-Masks are very in now.
-Your Holiness.

939
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,000
Where are you going?

940
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:14,166
I'll check the offerings made for lunch.

941
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,666
What are you doing?

942
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,125
I'm feeding Pleum.
Say hello to His Holiness.

943
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,666
Hello.

944
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,875
Go the result of the DNA test?

945
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,500
Not yet.

946
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,000
I must take care of him for now.

947
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,875
I feel sorry for him.
He doesn't have a father.

948
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,541
And his mother
is only interested in her lovers.

949
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:35,333
I'll tell you something.
Have you heard of this poem?

950
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:37,750
"Oh, a raven left its egg
for a crow to hatch.

951
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,166
A crow loved the baby,
believed it was its own,

952
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,041
feeding the baby,

953
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,666
taking very good care of it."

954
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,500
Just a verse is enough.
You cited almost the whole thing.

955
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,208
"Put another's kid on your elbow,
he'll creep on it."

956
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:53,833
No. "Put another's child in your bosom,
he'll creep out at your elbow."

957
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,541
-Didn't sleep. Meniere's disease.
-You're rambling.

958
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:00,458
Any of you remembers how long
you've been ordained?

959
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,833
How long have you been ordained?

960
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:03,958
Twenty years.

961
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,291
Twenty? How old are you?

962
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,875
One year old.

963
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,041
Ordained for 20 years, and you're one.

964
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,958
Up to you then.

965
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,166
I want to go back and see my mom.

966
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,958
-Why are you crying?
-I want to see Mommy.

967
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,000
Do you want rice in iced water?

968
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,500
Who wants to go home?

969
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,916
I want to go home.

970
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,541
Sing the national anthem.

971
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:50,583
Okay. Go. That's great, everyone.

972
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,375
You're good, Monk Jazz.

973
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,083
You can deal with them well.

974
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,583
I'm not good.

975
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm just very good.

976
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,000
-What's up, Ble?
-Your Holiness,

977
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,000
I've brought friends
who want to be ordained.

978
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:19,541
You two, get up here.

979
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,291
Here they are.

980
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:34,583
What's your name?

981
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:36,333
Songkran Laiproi.

982
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:38,083
I can't let you be ordained.

983
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,208
Your Holiness!

984
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,208
Why?

985
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:46,125
You can't keep your face
and your body clean.

986
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:49,958
I'm afraid it will damage Buddhism.

987
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,208
Even Buddha was ordained for Angulimala.

988
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,208
But Angulimala didn't have any tattoo.

989
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,708
See this, Your Holiness?

990
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,916
See? Here?

991
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,583
-Your mother?
-Your Holiness!

992
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,500
It's a woman's face. I just assumed.

993
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,833
You're right! I just called to you.

994
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,416
I won't ordain you.

995
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,583
-You know in what field I finished school?
-What field?

996
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,291
You don't have to know that.

997
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,750
But will you finish this thing between us?

998
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,541
Yes, let's finish it.

999
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,916
But I don't want to!

1000
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,541
Why do you judge on appearances?
Why not judge the inner self?

1001
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,625
-How's the inner self?
-This is how it is!

1002
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,041
Even more tattoos.

1003
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,583
You want to finish this?

1004
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:29,875
I finished a while ago.

1005
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,250
I'm going.

1006
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:32,708
Your Holiness!

1007
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,291
You won't ordain us?

1008
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,000
I can't do that. I'm done.

1009
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,541
Your Holiness! Your Holiness!

1010
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,458
Come back and ordain me!

1011
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,416
He won't ordain us.

1012
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,250
People nowadays are very bad.

1013
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,458
They even steal money
from the donation box.

1014
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,291
When these people die,

1015
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,916
they will go to hell and turn
into hungry ghosts.

1016
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,166
They even steal Buddha,

1017
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,166
not just money from the donation box.

1018
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,250
Then you must be careful.

1019
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,541
If you sleep soundly,

1020
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:23,166
someone might kidnap you.

1021
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,583
Buddha's image.

1022
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:27,458
I'm kidding.

1023
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,375
Thank you, both policemen and soldiers,

1024
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,666
for looking after our temple.

1025
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,750
All right.

1026
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,875
-Sun.
-Yes.

1027
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,000
Bring me four Heaven Mics.

1028
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,166
Thank you, Your Holiness.

1029
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,166
It's 3,500 baht each.

1030
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,958
I'm just teasing you.

1031
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:53,291
Right.

1032
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,500
Now, police and military cooperate well.

1033
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:59,000
They always work alongside each other.

1034
00:56:59,083 --> 00:56:59,916
Right.

1035
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,083
Is there any problem?

1036
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,958
No, all goes smoothly.

1037
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:07,791
Do you have any idea

1038
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:13,208
if that person escaped via
Poipet or a natural border path?

1039
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,166
I don't know.

1040
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,125
-Are you scared? Boonchoo.
-Yes, Your Holiness.

1041
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:24,958
Go find a new donation box.

1042
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,125
This time, pick a big one
so those thieves can't carry it.

1043
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,458
All right, Your Holiness.

1044
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:38,333
This scripture contains 12 days...

1045
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,000
What are you doing?

1046
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:47,875
I'm tutoring him
for the Buddhist missionaries' exams.

1047
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:52,083
This year, our temple has been
chosen to be an examination hall.

1048
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,666
Would you like to take the test?

1049
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:59,041
I'm afraid I'm not smart enough for that.

1050
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,791
All this time,

1051
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,416
when you solved problems,

1052
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,791
how could you do that?

1053
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:10,416
I guess that's my inner talent.

1054
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,375
Come to think of it, this is good.

1055
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:23,500
If I pass the exams
and get to be a missionary,

1056
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:28,250
I can promote Buddhism worldwide.

1057
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:31,000
People will get to know
about the religion,

1058
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,791
its core, and how good it is.

1059
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,791
Your Holiness!

1060
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,708
Your Holiness.

1061
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:43,958
Something bad happened.

1062
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,541
Many policemen and soldiers are here.

1063
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,666
Because the donation box
in the Vihara is missing.

1064
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,875
Does Father know about this?

1065
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,083
Yes, he does.

1066
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,375
He was the one
who called the officials here.

1067
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:03,625
These people are weird.

1068
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,958
They steal even from the temple.

1069
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,375
Your Holiness,

1070
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:12,208
stop speaking in English.

1071
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,791
It gives me a headache.

1072
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,416
Well, then...

1073
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,291
we have to keep our eyes and ears open.

1074
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:26,833
Don't let those evil bastards
harm our temple and steal from us.

1075
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,291
The signal is very bad.

1076
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,958
No connection.

1077
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,750
-What?
-Connection lost.

1078
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,666
Why don't you use TrueMove H 5G like me?

1079
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,750
The signal is great and no fuss.

1080
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,583
Here, here. I'll let you see a live video.

1081
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,583
Wait, Your Holiness.

1082
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,833
Isn't there only 4.5G?

1083
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,791
5G is not yet available.

1084
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,791
It's 4.5G,

1085
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:05,291
plus 0.5G from the goodness
of His Holiness.

1086
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:08,125
So it's 5G, right?

1087
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,166
Yeah.

1088
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,916
Very advanced. What is it again?

1089
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,666
TrueMove H 5G.

1090
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,833
Perfect for good people
from the new generation, just like me.

1091
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,333
Are you good in English?

1092
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,375
I'm quite fine, just for a bit.

1093
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:26,916
That's too easy.

1094
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,666
What are you two cocking about?

1095
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,291
No. No.

1096
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,958
It's not "cock." It's "talk."
"Talk," Your Holiness.

1097
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,250
"Talk."

1098
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,791
You hair--

1099
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,000
Two people. Not the right tone. Hair.

1100
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:48,166
Oh, so that's "hair."

1101
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,208
"People."

1102
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:51,083
You two... cocking about what?

1103
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,750
"Talk." "Talk."

1104
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:57,083
"Talk." What are you two talking about?

1105
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,916
-Sit down.
-Sorry.

1106
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,666
Hey, Namo.

1107
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,708
-Where are they going?
-Let's go take a look.

1108
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,791
Yeah.

1109
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:22,208
Now it's time for Rama and Sita

1110
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,458
to enter the mediums' bodies.

1111
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,875
Excuse me.

1112
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:32,333
For people to live well and prosper.

1113
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,666
Great!

1114
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,750
That's why so many people have come here.

1115
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:47,916
Why is it so crowded?

1116
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,583
It's your turn to ask questions.

1117
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:08,541
Here are my offerings.

1118
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,500
What is it? Tell me.

1119
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,833
Well, I--

1120
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,500
You have power.

1121
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,208
-You have power.
-No.

1122
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:24,541
I've got cramps.

1123
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,375
I'm all better.

1124
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,666
She's very sacred. Look!

1125
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,291
I... A spirit

1126
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,625
was sucking your toe.

1127
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:49,916
So I chased it away from my pavilion.

1128
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:51,416
That's sacred.

1129
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,875
I'm gonna ask you a question.

1130
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:57,166
Your mother is an elephant?

1131
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,041
Poor you.

1132
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,583
But you look sad.

1133
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,583
I'm asking you now.

1134
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,583
I want to release my own song.

1135
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:09,583
I want to be a singer.

1136
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,416
Sing! Sing!

1137
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,291
Change your career ambition.

1138
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:26,916
Goodbye.

1139
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,083
Why is she so sad?

1140
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:36,625
It's your turn.

1141
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,375
I want to ask Rama.

1142
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,000
Husband.

1143
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,625
Can you stay out of this?

1144
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:58,375
Husband, please feel for me.

1145
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,500
I will ask you then, Madam Pimp.

1146
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,208
My name is Sita.

1147
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,041
Yes, Sita.

1148
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,000
I would like to know whether

1149
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:12,833
my ex-lover, whom I was parted with,

1150
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,333
and I can be together again.

1151
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:17,541
Between my husband

1152
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,833
and your lover, who's more handsome?

1153
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,208
Rama.

1154
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,583
Bitch.

1155
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:34,875
Bitch...

1156
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,875
Bi? Bit?

1157
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:40,458
You will have a crush on a monk.

1158
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,291
A crush on a monk?

1159
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:44,791
Sita,

1160
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,541
I would like know

1161
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,208
if Rama can really float in the air.

1162
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:56,083
Your Greatness, open up her world.

1163
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,500
I can take a look?

1164
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:59,291
Go now.

1165
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:08,166
He can float thanks to these two balls.

1166
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:23,666
Go to hell!

1167
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:29,208
Ravana.

1168
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,666
Did you see what I saw?

1169
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,041
Clear as day.

1170
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:38,500
Excuse me.

1171
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,166
That was close.

1172
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,333
-Yeah, sacred.
-That's true.

1173
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,625
-Sacred.
-Excuse me.

1174
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,916
Let's see if it's gonna work.

1175
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Your Holiness.

1176
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:10,250
Saisin and I went for a walk
at the back of the temple.

1177
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,291
You know what I came across?

1178
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,250
-What?
-The pavilion of Sita and Rama.

1179
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:15,666
What's that?

1180
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,541
It's a pavilion of mediums.

1181
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,666
So what?

1182
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:20,041
"So what"?

1183
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:23,666
If you do nothing, more and more people
will believe in mediums.

1184
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,791
Then no one will believe in Buddhism.

1185
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,416
This is for the good of Buddhism.

1186
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:32,083
Namo, Saisin, listen.

1187
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:35,416
There's a thin line separating

1188
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,500
being well-intentioned and being nosy.

1189
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,208
We may be well-intentioned,

1190
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,875
but they might think
we are just being nosy.

1191
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:50,375
Whatever they believe in,
it's their choice.

1192
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:54,208
It's their happiness.

1193
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,750
If we butt in,

1194
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,916
then we are just nosy.

1195
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,250
Let me go.

1196
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,250
Let me go.

1197
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:19,041
Let me go! Help!

1198
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,041
Wait up!

1199
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,916
Your Holiness!

1200
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:41,750
Your Holiness!

1201
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,791
You've got something urgent to tell me?

1202
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:47,250
You know us, but, this time,
it's really big.

1203
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:50,166
Saisin and I went to
the pavilion of Sita and Rama.

1204
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,958
-I met Song.
-What about him?

1205
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:54,083
He lured a woman to rape her.

1206
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,000
Yes, it's true.

1207
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:58,958
What goes around comes around.

1208
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:03,666
Song will pay for what he's done.

1209
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,750
PAVILION OF SITA AND RAMA

1210
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,791
Please make way for His Holiness.

1211
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,333
This is what I told you.

1212
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,666
See? So many people here.

1213
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,500
I can't find it.

1214
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:20,166
Please make way for His Holiness.

1215
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:22,625
-Please.
-Excuse me.

1216
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,625
Please. Excuse us.

1217
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,791
Please. Excuse us.

1218
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,625
Your Holiness.

1219
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:39,416
Why are you here?

1220
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,000
You have to queue up.

1221
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,416
Your Holiness, you have to do something.

1222
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,833
They've gained popularity.
Yours might drop. Have you heard of...

1223
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,166
Why?

1224
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,333
Husband.

1225
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:56,666
Husband.

1226
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,708
How dare you?

1227
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,458
How can you disrespect me?

1228
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,583
Can't you see?

1229
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:02,875
I'm floating in the air.

1230
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:07,208
I want you to come down so people know
how you can float.

1231
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,250
Don't make me come down there,

1232
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:10,875
or you'll be dead!

1233
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,666
-Have you practiced long for this show?
-Jazz!

1234
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,875
You disrespect me!

1235
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm Ravana.

1236
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,625
Song.

1237
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,666
You're a medium?

1238
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,333
Ravana doesn't know me.

1239
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,333
Calm down, Song.

1240
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,750
Ravana.

1241
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,458
-Song.
-What's up?

1242
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,958
Ravana.

1243
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,583
-Song.
-What's up?

1244
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,125
What's up, Jazz?

1245
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,750
You got all mixed up, huh?

1246
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,458
Everyone, please listen to me.

1247
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:50,125
Humans have brains,
but they have to be conscious too.

1248
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,750
You can believe in anything,
but you have to be wise.

1249
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,666
Don't be ignorant.

1250
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,958
-Because belief--
-Is the song by Hin-Lek-Fai.

1251
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:01,416
-Ignorance--
-Bodyslam song.

1252
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,583
You have to remember that.

1253
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,583
Click "Like."

1254
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,250
And go download the songs.

1255
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,750
This is so messed up.

1256
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:12,791
Go, go, go.

1257
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,375
Yes.

1258
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,083
-Jazz.
-A one-minute talk enlightened me.

1259
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,916
Monk Jazz!

1260
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:29,791
Wait up! Monk Jazz!

1261
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,166
Wait.

1262
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:34,291
Whoever wants to go, just go.
And I will...

1263
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,250
go!

1264
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,625
It's because of Jazz.

1265
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,291
Three of us can't handle him.

1266
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,416
Yeah!

1267
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,958
How is it three?

1268
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,333
I'm a god.

1269
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,125
I am...

1270
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,458
Rama.

1271
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,875
He's lost it.

1272
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,375
Be conscious! Be a little more like that!

1273
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:01,166
I don't care about Rama.

1274
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,875
-You wanna come with me?
-Yes.

1275
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,500
-Let's go then.
-You don't remember me?

1276
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:09,208
Why are you here? Go!

1277
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,291
Bring me down!

1278
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,291
Who are you here for?

1279
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,375
-I'm here to ask Rama to the station.
-Rama is not here.

1280
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:24,208
There's just Pu.

1281
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,333
I don't know. He's floating away.

1282
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,875
He can float in the air?

1283
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,583
Let's go.

1284
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,375
You don't have to float in the air.
I'll bring you there.

1285
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,416
Let's go.

1286
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:38,791
Let go.

1287
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,333
Lucky you were there to help.

1288
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,291
People are able to realize the truth.

1289
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,833
Next time, don't get me involved.

1290
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,625
All right.

1291
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:47,666
Jazz!

1292
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,541
What is it, Nakhee?

1293
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,875
I miss you,

1294
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,000
even when you have no hair.

1295
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,375
You're as handsome as--

1296
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:12,833
As who?

1297
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,583
Vin Diesel.

1298
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,166
Why do temple boys say
I'm more like Si Quey?

1299
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,208
In what way are you similar to Si Quey?

1300
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:27,291
You...

1301
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,833
Your talking about this in the temple,

1302
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,416
I think

1303
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,166
it's not okay.

1304
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,750
All right.

1305
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,833
I still remember it well.

1306
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:43,500
The day you broke up with me.

1307
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,291
-Wait. Let me aim for it.
-It's not going down.

1308
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:53,250
Aim.

1309
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,208
Next turn.

1310
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:55,750
I don't play to win.

1311
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:58,125
Really? You don't play to win.

1312
01:13:01,416 --> 01:13:02,625
Nakhee.

1313
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,250
Let me interrupt you for a bit.

1314
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,166
I have something to tell you.

1315
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,291
Jazz, are you sure?

1316
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm here today--

1317
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,666
You're gonna regret it.

1318
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:26,166
I've come to tell you that...

1319
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:29,750
we should break up!

1320
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,125
That's harsh.

1321
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:35,000
What?

1322
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,458
Let's break up.

1323
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:39,000
What?

1324
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,500
Let's break up.

1325
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,125
What?

1326
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,458
Let's break up!

1327
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:48,750
What?

1328
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:57,583
Let's break up

1329
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,166
What?

1330
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,958
Serves her right. Hope her throat cracks.

1331
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,708
Why?

1332
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,083
Why do we have to break up?

1333
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,708
We really can't get along.

1334
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:13,500
Can't get along?

1335
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,083
You come in every time.

1336
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,375
How could you say that?

1337
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,208
What you said is right.

1338
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,083
I understand.

1339
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,958
-How could he understand that?
-I know.

1340
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,833
I know. Enough.

1341
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:32,750
Enough.

1342
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,083
Enough, you bitch!

1343
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:36,958
You want to cry or talk? Pick one!

1344
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:38,875
I'm sorry.

1345
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,125
That's all right. I'll take care of you.

1346
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,041
Yeah. You do it.

1347
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,916
Zack!

1348
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,833
No matter how much time has passed,

1349
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,125
I always miss you. I never forget you.

1350
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,541
Now I'm ordained.

1351
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,916
I've left everything behind.

1352
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,208
Love, greed,

1353
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:08,666
anger, and lust.

1354
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,666
Please get over it.

1355
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,375
But if you miss me so much
that you can't take it,

1356
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,291
how about we meet
at the back of the temple?

1357
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:23,708
I walk past there every morning.

1358
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,125
Don't forget to give alms.

1359
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,125
All right.

1360
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,416
Tomorrow, I'll get up early
to take a shower

1361
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,166
and scrub every part of my body
to make sure I smell nice.

1362
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,500
So I can take you--

1363
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,208
So I can take the offerings to you.

1364
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:38,583
Please excuse me.

1365
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:42,958
Don't cry.

1366
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,333
You shouldn't have said that.

1367
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,750
Your Holiness, she's crying.

1368
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,708
No matter how much time has passed,

1369
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:56,125
I can't forget you.

1370
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,333
Your Holiness!

1371
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:00,000
Your Holiness!

1372
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:02,625
Your Holiness!

1373
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:06,916
Your Holiness!

1374
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:14,875
What is it?

1375
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,958
It's the DNA test results.

1376
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:27,583
Where are the results?

1377
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:33,208
Here.

1378
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,791
DNA DOES NOT MATCH

1379
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:38,666
The DNA results are not a match.

1380
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,458
So Pleum is not your son?

1381
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,250
Right?

1382
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,875
Right.

1383
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:52,166
Why do you look so sad?

1384
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:55,708
Well...

1385
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:57,416
I...

1386
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,500
Does this mean that you've gotten
to love and care for that kid already?

1387
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,208
I love that kid.

1388
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,875
I want to take care of him,
be close to him.

1389
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:17,041
I want to clean his butt.

1390
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:19,958
I want to feed him,
clean up when he pees or poops.

1391
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,750
-Play with him--
-That's enough.

1392
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,166
Ble, I'll teach you one thing.

1393
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,625
Sometimes,

1394
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:31,791
when it's not right, then it's not,
no matter what you do.

1395
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:34,875
But if it's right,

1396
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,833
no matter what, it's still right.

1397
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:40,125
If it's right, then it's right.
If it's not right, then it's not.

1398
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,125
This is not right.

1399
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:44,166
If it's not right, but we think it is,
we're disappointed.

1400
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,958
It's more than right or not right.

1401
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,541
Do you understand?

1402
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:48,458
Sun.

1403
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,500
Explain it to him.

1404
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:51,250
I think it was right at first.

1405
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,416
Ble thought so too. Turns out it's not.

1406
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,041
You know that it's not right,
but Ble still thinks it's right.

1407
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,375
At first, Ble thought it wasn't right.

1408
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,958
Since the beginning. Then they met,
and he thought it was right.

1409
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:06,125
He thinks it's right, so a bond's created,
but it's not right.

1410
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:09,625
That's not right. Ble thought it was right
but said it wasn't right,

1411
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,333
but you thought it wasn't right.

1412
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,458
-Ble still thinks it's right.
-Right!

1413
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,625
-I think it is right!
-You can't do that.

1414
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,708
It's what I thought at first.
We have to think if it's right!

1415
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,250
How can it be right?
Look at the result. It's not.

1416
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,833
Here, take a look! Look!

1417
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,541
I saw it at the start.
It says that it's not right.

1418
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,750
It's right or wrong, right?

1419
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:29,833
Ble, is that right?

1420
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:32,833
You don't seem to be right.

1421
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:36,500
-He's gone.
-He also isn't right.

1422
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,416
That's true.

1423
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,333
I would like to consult with you.

1424
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:44,083
About the abbot, right?

1425
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:45,458
Yes.

1426
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:47,416
You knew about this?

1427
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:49,208
About Heaven Mics

1428
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,416
and the fact
he goes out partying at night?

1429
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:54,458
Your Holiness,

1430
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,583
this is not monks' business.

1431
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,083
Now that it has come to this,

1432
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,708
how does it not concern us?

1433
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:06,583
Can I be the one to warn him
before people know about this?

1434
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:09,291
Everyone knows about this.

1435
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,416
Why don't they say anything?

1436
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,541
He has many followers.

1437
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,125
People believe in whatever he says.

1438
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:20,666
But it's not a good thing.

1439
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,250
Yes, that's right.

1440
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,166
We can't let this happen to our temple.

1441
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,625
This harms Buddhism.

1442
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,750
I'll take care of it.

1443
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,875
Should we do it today?

1444
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:37,333
We can't today. He's sick.

1445
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:40,750
He's sick again?

1446
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,958
Please.

1447
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:50,875
Your Holiness.

1448
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,041
Hello.

1449
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,875
What is it, Jazz?

1450
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,416
Your Holiness,

1451
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,833
I have an important business
to discuss with you.

1452
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:12,500
Can't you see that I'm sick.

1453
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:13,666
I can't talk today.

1454
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:17,375
I'm a young and well-known monk.

1455
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,375
I'm also pretty myself.

1456
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:21,708
Say it.

1457
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:26,041
I would like to ask
how you became ill so quickly.

1458
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:33,666
Are you accusing me of lying?

1459
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,666
Sickness

1460
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,083
appears unexpectedly

1461
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,541
without warning

1462
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,375
or agenda.

1463
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:46,000
How would I know if I'm going to be sick
on the 18th or the 19th?

1464
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,333
But today is the 14th. Are you sick now?

1465
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,583
It was just a metaphor.

1466
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:56,458
Your Holiness,
please stop what you're doing.

1467
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:00,666
You're going to destroy
my beloved and respectful religion.

1468
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,000
Jazz.

1469
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,416
Do you know what you just said?

1470
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:08,291
You're teaching fish how to swim.

1471
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,000
But if you keep doing this,

1472
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,958
you'll become the smallest fish.

1473
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,500
Are you criticizing me?

1474
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,250
There are many good monks,

1475
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:21,416
but a monk like you destroys Buddhism.

1476
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,291
Your Heaven Mics
and your going out late at night,

1477
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,125
we all know about it.

1478
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,916
Please come clean,
so we can fix it in time.

1479
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,708
I'm being blamed.

1480
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,500
Your Holiness...

1481
01:21:33,583 --> 01:21:35,208
I'm being framed.

1482
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:36,875
Your Holiness...

1483
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:39,375
I'm being censored.

1484
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:42,750
I didn't go anywhere.

1485
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,083
I'm always at the temple.

1486
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:47,666
Where can I go

1487
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,041
when my leg is like this?

1488
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,750
What is wrong with your leg?

1489
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,958
I have Can-Dia-Hype disease.

1490
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:13,000
-What is it again?
-Can-Dia-Hype disease.

1491
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,541
-Slowly.
-Thok...

1492
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,875
It's cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.

1493
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:28,541
Please let me touch.

1494
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,000
Don't.

1495
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:34,208
He's been hurt enough.

1496
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:36,416
Please leave him alone.

1497
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,541
Let him leave us freely.

1498
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,958
Oh. Yes.

1499
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,416
Then I'll Ta-M-Le.

1500
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,333
What?

1501
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:52,791
Ta-M-Le.

1502
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,250
Slowly and clearly.

1503
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,125
I'll take my leave.

1504
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,791
It's the same.

1505
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,375
-Can I touch it?
-Don't!

1506
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:09,791
Your Holiness,
I hope you leave us comfortably.

1507
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:13,666
You've been hurt enough.

1508
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,250
Enough!

1509
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:28,041
They've gone.

1510
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:32,666
Thank you.

1511
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:38,250
I've some, some, some money

1512
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:41,458
Please give me 200, 300, 400

1513
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,916
Abbot, get out!

1514
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Abbot, don't go!

1515
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:49,250
-Abbot, get out!
-Abbot, don't go!

1516
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,833
ABBOT, DON'T GO

1517
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,500
ABBOT, GET OUT

1518
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,875
Your Holiness, please calm down.

1519
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,041
You always say there's a solution
to every problem.

1520
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

1521
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:01,958
Wait!

1522
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:05,958
Please calm down and be gentle.

1523
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,458
-We can talk it over.
-We can't.

1524
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,875
Do you know the abbot is a fraud?

1525
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:13,916
He steals from the temple
and parties with women at night.

1526
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,833
You know that?

1527
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,416
Where is the abbot?

1528
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,416
Yes! Right!

1529
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,875
It's not true!

1530
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,000
-Wait!
-What?

1531
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,041
More importantly, this stings the most.

1532
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,125
This! See? Heaven Mic.

1533
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,541
We never reach heaven with this.

1534
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:32,500
Wait. You'll go to hell for this.
The abbot never goes partying.

1535
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,083
He's always here.

1536
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,833
You don't know how to use Heaven Mic.

1537
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:39,041
If you know, you'll go to heaven for sure.

1538
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:44,666
Wait! Wait!

1539
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,875
Wait!

1540
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:48,625
You! Yeah, you!

1541
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,458
Go find the abbot!

1542
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,333
Go!

1543
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:54,583
What's going on?

1544
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,458
Go find the abbot!

1545
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:01,250
All of you, please calm down.

1546
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:03,000
Please don't shout.

1547
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:05,666
-Your Holiness--
-Your Holiness!

1548
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,125
It's out of control. They won't back off.

1549
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,000
They want to see you.

1550
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,500
You're the only one who can stop this.

1551
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,958
What should we do?

1552
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,125
Please lead the way.

1553
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,708
You.

1554
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,916
You're here today because of who?

1555
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:37,541
I asked, you're here today because of who?

1556
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,458
You're here today because of who?

1557
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:48,958
Because of you, Your Holiness.

1558
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,666
You know what to do, right?

1559
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:55,958
Yes.

1560
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,000
Thok.

1561
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:01,250
Yes, Your Holiness.

1562
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,875
He can't come out.

1563
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,250
Calm down. Don't fight.

1564
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:06,666
Go find the other one.

1565
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,833
Abbot Chaiya. Not the right one.

1566
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:12,708
Go check if he's ready.

1567
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yes.

1568
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,875
All of you from two sides,

1569
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:19,750
those who support and
those who are against,

1570
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:22,083
we're all Buddhists.

1571
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:25,916
Please be conscious.
Be rational, not emotional.

1572
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,791
Please let me take care of it.

1573
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,375
Please go ahead.

1574
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,208
Hello, everyone.

1575
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:36,000
Bring Abbot Chaiya.

1576
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:37,416
Calm down.

1577
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,833
Don't get angry. Be conscious.

1578
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:41,666
Don't get emotional.

1579
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,250
Calm down! Calm down, you all.

1580
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:49,000
Your Holiness,
Thok told me to bring you this.

1581
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,041
Where is he now?

1582
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:53,750
I saw him leave in a hurry.

1583
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:03,375
Thok, you just saved yourself.

1584
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:05,541
Can you stay and help me?

1585
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:06,916
Yes, Your Holiness.

1586
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,958
Please do as I say.

1587
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:10,583
-Yes.
-Very good.

1588
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
Don't. Calm down.

1589
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,750
I told you all to calm down.

1590
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,166
-What's going on?
-As you can see,

1591
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,500
They want to see Abbot Chaiya.

1592
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:25,375
You all.

1593
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,625
You all!

1594
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,166
Stop!

1595
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,458
Back off! He told us to stop.
Can't you hear?

1596
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:33,833
Damn!

1597
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,000
Serves you right!

1598
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,375
Listen to me.

1599
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:43,083
Those who support the Abbot,

1600
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,875
you're Buddhists, right?

1601
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,666
Those who are against him,

1602
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,458
you're also Buddhists, right?

1603
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,666
You believe in the same religion.

1604
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:59,166
Your hearts are the same.

1605
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:03,875
Why don't you work together
and create good things for Buddhism?

1606
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:07,708
You have fought against each other,
divided into groups.

1607
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:11,708
You're all Buddhists.
Please think about it well.

1608
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,708
Here he is.

1609
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,000
Here he comes.

1610
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,416
Are you all well?

1611
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,666
We're fine.

1612
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,916
-And this side?
-We're not fine!

1613
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:31,208
You guys,

1614
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:33,708
if you are not well,
why not take some medicine?

1615
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:36,250
How can we afford medicine?
You ripped us all off.

1616
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:37,166
Right!

1617
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,708
-How can we afford medicine?
-What did I do wrong?

1618
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:44,458
Framing a monk for being a fraud is wrong.

1619
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:48,041
You'll go to hell.

1620
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:51,000
It's not framing. It's true.
The Heaven Mics you sold us--

1621
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,875
All right. Calm down.

1622
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:58,083
Heaven Mics bring you to heaven.

1623
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,666
Say it together.

1624
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,666
Heaven Mics bring you to heaven.

1625
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:06,875
Heaven Mics can't bring you to heaven!

1626
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,041
All right. Enough.

1627
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:10,833
Can we take them out?

1628
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,208
No, we can't.

1629
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:15,208
Please calm down.
The reason I came out here late

1630
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:17,708
is because I'm really sick.

1631
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,625
Liar! Liar!

1632
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:21,708
If you don't believe me, look at my leg.

1633
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:24,000
It's rotten.

1634
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:26,500
Is it true? What did he do?

1635
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:28,083
I don't think it's true.

1636
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:29,625
Does he need to be amputated?

1637
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,041
Your Holiness.

1638
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,416
The other day, when I saw you,
it wasn't this leg.

1639
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:39,500
It's this one.

1640
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,541
See it clearly.

1641
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:44,916
What is wrong with you? Are you confused?

1642
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,875
-Isn't it the other side?
-Do you have bipolar disorder?

1643
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:51,083
Do you want to shoot nine bullets
into the sky?

1644
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:53,041
-This side.
-It's true.

1645
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,875
Last time, it was the left side.

1646
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:57,333
Kra.

1647
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:59,083
Please tell Jazz which leg it is.

1648
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,083
The left one.

1649
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:02,583
The right one.

1650
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,708
Liar!

1651
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,333
Stop!

1652
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:09,875
Monk Jazz.

1653
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,458
This one?

1654
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,291
That's Pleum.

1655
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:15,291
That's Pleum. Let's go, Your Holiness.

1656
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:17,666
Novice monk! Your Holiness! Follow us.

1657
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,625
Novice!

1658
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:20,666
Novice!

1659
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,750
You! Where are you taking him?

1660
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:25,208
Novice! Damn it!

1661
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:27,708
You! You!

1662
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:32,000
Monk Jazz is telling us numbers for
the lottery. It's 0-0. Write them down.

1663
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:33,750
It must be winning numbers.

1664
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:36,833
Back off!

1665
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,333
Back off!

1666
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,500
Back off!

1667
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:44,375
-Don't move.
-We're holding him hostage.

1668
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,666
Anybody play tricks or moves,

1669
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,333
the whole train will blow up!

1670
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:50,750
No, no!

1671
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,625
Your Holiness! Talk to him first.

1672
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:53,875
Quickly.

1673
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,708
Talk to him first.

1674
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:07,875
Why do you keep following us?

1675
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:10,375
Sang, Kang.

1676
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:12,625
Calm down.

1677
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:16,916
I know that you two are still mad at me.

1678
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:18,958
The whole thing happened

1679
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:21,291
because of you.
I had nothing to do with it.

1680
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:26,541
To forget a wrong is the best revenge.

1681
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,125
Be conscious.

1682
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,708
Anger will only make you crazy.

1683
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:33,500
Think carefully.

1684
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,166
Put down the bomb.

1685
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:42,791
Put down the bomb.

1686
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,000
What? We're dead.

1687
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:52,291
Idiot!

1688
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:56,083
Monk and normal people,
the bomb is not armed. How can it explode?

1689
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,666
That's right.

1690
01:31:58,916 --> 01:31:59,750
You...

1691
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:03,875
The person you're holding hostage,

1692
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:05,666
he's just a kid.

1693
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:09,291
If you want a hostage,

1694
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,166
take me instead of him.

1695
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,666
Next station is Ploenchit.

1696
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,375
-No, Your Holiness.
-You can't!

1697
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:20,708
No, you can't!

1698
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,458
The poles, guys!

1699
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,916
Go! Let's go! Quick!

1700
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,166
If you're still playing tricks,

1701
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,416
everyone here will die.

1702
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:43,541
Quick! Go!

1703
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,375
-What do we do?
-Take him and run!

1704
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:52,416
Quick! Your Holiness! Back off!

1705
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:58,041
Here, let's kill him here.
I kill him. You pour cement on his body.

1706
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,416
And you bury him
so that nobody can find him.

1707
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:01,750
Very clever.

1708
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:05,416
Let's do this.

1709
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:09,791
I'll shoot him,
and you pour cement on his body.

1710
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:11,333
-Shoot him!
-Wait.

1711
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:17,666
Can I tell you two something
for once before I die?

1712
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,041
I can honor that request.

1713
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,875
Say it then.

1714
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,750
Think about it.

1715
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:27,708
We're ordained as a way
to thank our parents.

1716
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:32,458
-Why do you have to talk about parents?
-A mother exhaust herself

1717
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:35,291
in order to give birth to her child.

1718
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,083
If you go to jail,

1719
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:39,666
how sad will your parents be?

1720
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,000
I can't say much.

1721
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:46,041
That's all I can tell you before I die.

1722
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:47,000
Enough!

1723
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:49,333
Just go, Your Holiness. Go!

1724
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,791
I'll be here.

1725
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:52,833
He won't leave.

1726
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:54,833
I want both of you to go back

1727
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:57,166
and wash your faces with clean water.

1728
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:00,208
-I'll leave.
-So you know,

1729
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,958
if that makes you feel happy,

1730
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:04,291
anger and hatred

1731
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:07,291
are like lighting up
the fire in your heart.

1732
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,125
Your Holiness!

1733
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:12,666
-Go!
-Your Holiness!

1734
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:15,875
Where are they? Your Holiness!

1735
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,750
Stop asking me!

1736
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:20,333
Now, just take me anywhere!

1737
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:22,250
But not here!

1738
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,250
ABBOT HAVING SEX AND PARTYING!

1739
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:24,666
Hello! It's me, Lovesick.

1740
01:34:25,416 --> 01:34:28,791
I want to confirm that
there were three of them.

1741
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,666
They were partying with us women.

1742
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,375
Their hands were all over us!

1743
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:35,708
So scary! They gave us a big tip,

1744
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,250
especially the one in the middle.
His wig fell off.

1745
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:43,541
That scared me!

1746
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:47,708
I can confirm that three of them
are very likely monks.

1747
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:49,666
Your Holiness.

1748
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,041
Have you read the news
on social media lately?

1749
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,416
No, I have not. What's up?

1750
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:58,500
People on social media are talking about
Dharmathikarn Benchamarachasit

1751
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:01,208
Vivekvikaramon Praditmongkol Temple.

1752
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:04,333
That's our temple.

1753
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:08,291
Many people have asked,

1754
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:12,041
where is the remaining money
to build the temple?

1755
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,958
-Sun.
-Yes.

1756
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:19,750
Was it you who asked me this question?

1757
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:23,375
For both of us.

1758
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:25,958
I just want to know
how you will handle it.

1759
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:30,958
Don't worry. I have a plan.

1760
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:32,958
Your Holiness.

1761
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,708
I have good news.

1762
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:38,666
See?

1763
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:41,791
There's a solution to every problem.

1764
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,125
-What is the good news?
-A letter from DSI.

1765
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:50,041
Your Holiness! Your Holiness!

1766
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:00,833
You read it.

1767
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,916
The DSI makes you illiterate?

1768
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,500
No, I don't feel strong enough to read it.

1769
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:12,666
It's a letter. There is no vibration mode.

1770
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,625
It's the AC.

1771
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:16,250
There's no AC out here.

1772
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,625
Are we hit?

1773
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:28,291
Bull's-eye.

1774
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:31,166
Your Holiness!

1775
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,166
Your Holiness!

1776
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,750
Please.

1777
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:49,208
Please, Your Holiness.

1778
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:02,041
Don't block the way. Move!

1779
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:04,666
Excuse me. Please go to the station.

1780
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,041
I'm very sleepy. Can I sleep first?

1781
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,541
Do you want to stay in jail?

1782
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:16,375
Lieutenant, the abbot isn't in
his dwelling. He's run away.

1783
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:23,250
What goes around comes around.

1784
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:28,291
Did you bring money?

1785
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,541
Thief!

1786
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,458
Thief!

1787
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:39,166
Thief!

1788
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:43,708
That's a kid's voice.

1789
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,541
Stop, or you'll die.

1790
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,500
Stop, or you'll die!

1791
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:52,166
Song! What are you doing?

1792
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,000
You stay out of this!

1793
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,375
Are you taking a novice monk away?

1794
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:58,458
Go! Why are you still here?

1795
01:37:58,541 --> 01:37:59,541
Let him go!

1796
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,541
I can't.

1797
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:02,833
I said let him go.

1798
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:04,375
I can't! He'll go tell!

1799
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:06,416
Let him go!

1800
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,250
Damn you!

1801
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,500
Don't!

1802
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,750
-Damn it!
-Why did you shoot?

1803
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,125
That's my brother!

1804
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:23,833
-And then why--
-Bastard!

1805
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:25,333
You bastard!

1806
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,666
-Damn you.
-I don't care!

1807
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:30,166
Do you have all the evidence?

1808
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,916
-Yes.
-Sure?

1809
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,333
Yeah, sure.

1810
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,208
Ble!

1811
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,208
Ble!

1812
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:38,666
Damn it!

1813
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,583
Song!

1814
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:45,541
Ble!

1815
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,833
Ble!

1816
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:50,625
What's going on? You're bleeding.

1817
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,750
He's still bleeding. He was shot.

1818
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:54,291
-Who shot him?
-I don't know.

1819
01:38:54,791 --> 01:38:56,416
He got away.

1820
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,791
That's fine.

1821
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,791
Help him first. He was shot.

1822
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:01,291
Take him to the hospital!

1823
01:39:11,875 --> 01:39:12,916
Ble.

1824
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:16,000
Ble.

1825
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:20,375
Hello, Monk Jazz.

1826
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:21,750
Please.

1827
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,500
How are you?

1828
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,041
I'm worried about you.

1829
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:32,583
I'm all right now.

1830
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:35,041
How is the wound?

1831
01:39:36,791 --> 01:39:40,041
It's better. There's nothing serious now.

1832
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:41,541
By the way,

1833
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,166
how is Song?

1834
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:45,916
He was arrested.

1835
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,041
Song...

1836
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,416
Is His Holiness here too?

1837
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,208
Yes.

1838
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,041
Here he comes.

1839
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:58,625
Hello, Your Holiness.

1840
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,458
Here.

1841
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:09,375
Your Holiness.

1842
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,625
He would like to ask to be ordained.

1843
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,041
Your Holiness,

1844
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:23,416
for any physical, mental,
and verbal act I did,

1845
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:28,833
whether intentionally or unintentionally,

1846
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:34,708
to your face or behind your back,

1847
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,583
I would like to ask for your forgiveness.

1848
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:40,000
From here on out till the end.

1849
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:41,416
Amen.

1850
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,791
I'm happy for you, and I forgive you.

1851
01:40:44,666 --> 01:40:46,750
I wish you well.

1852
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:49,208
Hope you get better soon.

1853
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,291
Thank you, Your Holiness.

1854
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:57,000
Ble.

1855
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:58,916
I'm leaving then.

1856
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,125
Thank you, Your Holiness.

1857
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,208
Thank you, Your Holiness.

1858
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:04,500
Let's go.

1859
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:05,958
Monk Jazz.

1860
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:08,333
I don't want to go just yet.

1861
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,666
I want to be with Ble.

1862
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:15,000
How do you like that, Ble?
He wants to be with his father.

1863
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:20,125
All right, Your Holiness.
Let him stay with me.

1864
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,125
Thank you, Your Holiness.
Thank you, Your Holiness.

1865
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:34,208
Get well soon.

1866
01:41:35,666 --> 01:41:37,583
-Get well soon.
-I love you.

1867
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:42,166
I'll take care of you.

1868
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,166
Yes.

1869
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:47,583
I love you too.

1870
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,250
I'm here to say goodbye.

1871
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,416
Where are you going?

1872
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:41,416
I think I'm going to promote Buddhism

1873
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,291
to help people understand Buddhism better.

1874
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:48,750
Most people think religion
is something serious and difficult.

1875
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:51,958
When they think religion is out of reach,

1876
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:55,500
we'll bring it to them.

1877
01:42:56,541 --> 01:42:58,125
That's great.

1878
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:02,041
If we have 100 or 1,000 monks
just like you,

1879
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:05,208
Buddhism can prosper better.

1880
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:26,916
Your Holiness.

1881
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:29,125
I'm here to say goodbye.

1882
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:30,791
Where are you going?

1883
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,500
To the temple in the countryside.

1884
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,333
I'll promote Buddhism

1885
01:43:37,875 --> 01:43:39,708
to more people there.

1886
01:43:40,666 --> 01:43:43,833
Many of them consider religion

1887
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:46,875
as something stressful
and difficult to understand.

1888
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:49,958
If they think religion is out of reach,

1889
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:52,958
we'll bring it to them.

1890
01:43:53,041 --> 01:43:54,583
Do you think it's a good idea?

1891
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:56,583
I think it's great.

1892
01:43:56,666 --> 01:43:59,375
If we have 100 or 1,000 monks
just like you,

1893
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:01,541
Buddhism will surely prosper.

1894
01:44:02,833 --> 01:44:05,708
Your Holiness, we've talked about this.

1895
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:08,000
We have?

1896
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:10,458
I'm going then.

1897
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,083
Where are you going?

1898
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:15,541
I just said it to you.

1899
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:18,583
What's with you? Why do you keep
saying the same thing?

1900
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:22,541
I have a Meniere's disease.

1901
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
You're funny.
We're not stressed when we're around you.

1902
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:31,833
Before I go,
I have some words of wisdom for you.

1903
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:35,291
They say a swift horse
can lose to a donkey.

1904
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:39,166
-Why is that?
-A donkey says goodbye and leaves first.

1905
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:40,875
Is it funny?

1906
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:47,875
Before I go,
I also have some words of wisdom for you.

1907
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:51,583
A swift horse can lose to a donkey.

1908
01:44:51,666 --> 01:44:53,041
Why is that?

1909
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:55,375
A donkey says goodbye and leaves first.

1910
01:44:57,083 --> 01:45:00,166
-Am I funny, too?
-You're a copycat,

1911
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:03,875
since you were talking about
promoting religion earlier.

1912
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:09,250
Quickly. You remember
which bus number to take?

1913
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:10,875
I don't.

1914
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,000
Hey, Peun.

1915
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,708
When were you ordained here?

1916
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:17,166
I've just been.

1917
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:18,500
Why were you ordained?

1918
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:20,416
Since I was in trouble with the law,

1919
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,125
there's no place in society
for me and my mother.

1920
01:45:23,208 --> 01:45:24,875
Anything I do is wrong.

1921
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,416
So I've turned to religion.

1922
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,708
-For how long?
-For the rest of my life.

1923
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:31,041
There'll be a special pardon.

1924
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,833
I'm at the temple, not in jail.

1925
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:34,958
I'm kidding.

1926
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:37,916
Please, Your Holiness.

1927
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,458
Monk Jazz, I'm here to give alms.

1928
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:44,708
It's good the see you. I won the lottery
with the "00" you gave.

1929
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,500
I got 30 million baht.

1930
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:48,541
I won the lottery and also a husband.

1931
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:50,625
You do bring us luck like water lizards.

1932
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,500
Just say I'm a good luck charm.

1933
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:55,958
A good luck charm.

1934
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:58,416
Aren't you afraid
your winnings will go missing?

1935
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:01,958
No, I won't lose them.
I keep them safe and even lick them.

1936
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:03,291
Why do you lick them?

1937
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:05,125
Just in case a DNA test is needed.

1938
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:07,583
You're very careful.

1939
01:46:08,166 --> 01:46:09,791
Wit.

1940
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:12,291
Let me show off my husband.

1941
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,000
He looks a lot like Poj Arnon.

1942
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:18,541
Is he Poj Arnon?

1943
01:46:18,958 --> 01:46:20,291
I'm Wit.

1944
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:23,041
-He's not.
-From the way he salutes,

1945
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:26,625
he will be very rich.

1946
01:46:29,166 --> 01:46:33,125
The ring is his mother's,
and the watch is his dead friend's.

1947
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:38,500
-Peun.
-Your Holiness.

1948
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:40,250
A policeman is here to give alms.

1949
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:42,375
Don't get in trouble with him.

1950
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,750
Or you both will be in the news.

1951
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:46,875
It will be difficult to clear things up.

1952
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:49,583
I don't want to imagine that.
I'm going then.

1953
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:52,500
-Goodbye.
-Please.

1954
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:14,958
THAMMAPATHIP TEMPLE

1955
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:20,125
It's unbelievable you passed
the exams and got to come to France.

1956
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:24,458
Even a monk from nowhere
like you can come here.

1957
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:28,666
After this, any monk can come here too.

1958
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:30,166
Listen to me carefully.

1959
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,541
I'm a limited-edition monk.

1960
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:35,958
Any copycat is not like me, the original.

1961
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:40,750
Your Holiness,
why didn't we go visiting Paris first?

1962
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:44,708
I wanted to go take some pictures.
Look, I'm all dressed up.

1963
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,458
You dress like pillow cases.

1964
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:54,041
Hello.

1965
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,375
Hello. Monk Jazz, right?

1966
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:57,458
Yes.

1967
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:01,458
Congratulations on completing
your training to become a missionary

1968
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:03,208
and on promoting Buddhism

1969
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:06,250
here at Thammapathip Temple in France.

1970
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:08,791
Here is Lapin,

1971
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:10,416
the assistant monk here.

1972
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,750
Oh, Your Holiness!

1973
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:45,416
-Beautiful, right?
-Why are you shouting?

1974
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,541
It's beautiful.

1975
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:52,333
-One... Smile.
-Smile.

1976
01:48:57,041 --> 01:49:01,000
Your Holiness,
here is Avenue des Champs-Élysées

1977
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:03,875
Shopping places for everyone.

1978
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,375
You know,

1979
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:07,291
what is this called?

1980
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,083
It's called Arch of Victory

1981
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:12,250
or Arc de Triomphe in French.

1982
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,250
Smile.

1983
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:39,416
Smile, Your Holiness. Don't look serious.

1984
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,416
-Your Holiness.
-People here look rich.

1985
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,458
If they know me,

1986
01:49:46,541 --> 01:49:48,708
they will come pay respect.

1987
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:50,166
Yes.

1988
01:49:51,208 --> 01:49:52,416
Your Holiness!

1989
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,208
Your Holiness!

1990
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:56,916
Your Holiness!

1991
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,250
Jazz.

1992
01:50:00,916 --> 01:50:03,125
How have you been?

1993
01:50:03,208 --> 01:50:05,541
I'm a missionary here.

1994
01:50:05,625 --> 01:50:07,458
Good. Good.

1995
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:09,500
Why are you dressed like this?

1996
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:12,208
It's a new cult.

1997
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,458
You're no longer a monk?

1998
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:16,916
No, I'm a goat.

1999
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,791
-What goat?
-I'm a scapegoat.

2000
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:24,208
How can you be here?
How were you not arrested?

2001
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:26,000
I'm here as a normal tourist.

2002
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:27,958
Nobody arrested me.

2003
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:29,833
Your Holiness,

2004
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:32,333
there is an extradition law here.

2005
01:50:32,416 --> 01:50:33,458
Aren't you scared?

2006
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:38,708
-There really is an extradition law here?
-Yes, Sir.

2007
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:42,291
Can I go to Montenegro?

2008
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:45,250
A powerful person like you
going to a small country,

2009
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:46,791
I don't think it's right.

2010
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:48,083
How about Dubai?

2011
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:50,291
Dubai might be too difficult.

2012
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:54,416
Where can I go? Please advise me.

2013
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,458
For someone powerful like you,

2014
01:50:57,541 --> 01:51:01,125
you should go with VIP services.

2015
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:04,333
Just go casually by sea.

2016
01:51:04,416 --> 01:51:06,500
-How?
-Like Rohingya people.

2017
01:51:08,666 --> 01:51:09,875
Thanks a lot.

2018
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:12,083
Please excuse me.

2019
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:13,416
Wait, Jazz.

2020
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:19,291
-Can you lend me 200?
-A picture with that door would be nice.

2021
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:20,833
-Let's go.
-So beautiful.

2022
01:51:20,916 --> 01:51:22,375
Please sympathize with me.

2023
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:26,166
Your Holiness.

2024
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:30,375
You won't say anything to the abbot
for what he did?

2025
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:31,791
It's true, Your Holiness.

2026
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,083
Do you love Buddhism?

2027
01:51:36,166 --> 01:51:37,583
I do.

2028
01:51:37,666 --> 01:51:40,250
Then just believe in yourself.

2029
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:42,875
Let other people do what they want.

2030
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:46,250
What goes around comes around.

2031
01:51:47,375 --> 01:51:49,333
We just do our duties,

2032
01:51:49,416 --> 01:51:53,375
promoting Buddhism so it can prosper.

2033
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:55,541
Look at Karaked.

2034
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:59,833
She's a good person,
so she ends up with a good husband.

2035
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:03,541
Got it? Okay?

2036
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:05,458
That's a TV series.

2037
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:08,583
I like this show too.

2038
01:52:08,666 --> 01:52:10,541
You're very trendy.

2039
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:36,500
If Ble wins, you have to promise me

2040
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:38,958
you won't bother him again.
But if you win,

2041
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:41,875
-we'll all crush you.
-That's fair.

2042
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:44,125
Are you crazy?

2043
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,791
Go! Go!

2044
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:52,625
Go! Go!

2045
01:52:59,708 --> 01:53:01,333
Fight him!

2046
01:53:10,291 --> 01:53:12,250
Get up!

2047
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:13,416
Jazz! Get up!

2048
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:23,250
I'm so tired. I did it many times.

2049
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:28,041
What's wrong?

2050
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,833
My eyesight.

2051
01:53:30,708 --> 01:53:32,583
I think I need a new pair of glasses.

2052
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:39,583
Ouch!

2053
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:42,541
This time.

2054
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,750
Cut!

2055
01:53:45,833 --> 01:53:47,083
Shut up!

2056
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:49,416
What should we do?

2057
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,250
I've been wanting to ask.
This date you ate,

2058
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:54,125
when will you swallow it down?

2059
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,666
That's very sharp.

2060
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:56,875
Cut!

2061
01:53:58,041 --> 01:53:59,625
Nakhee will be yours.

2062
01:54:04,916 --> 01:54:07,291
Can't you do it gently? You hit me hard.

2063
01:54:07,375 --> 01:54:08,833
They both did it.

2064
01:54:08,916 --> 01:54:11,500
-Mom isn't back yet.
-Mom isn't back?

2065
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:13,833
-Go.
-Who wants to go home? Smile!

2066
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:18,125
I'm going.

2067
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:20,000
Keep that in mind!

2068
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:21,750
Are your fathers dead? Bastards!

2069
01:54:23,666 --> 01:54:25,166
Bastard!

2070
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:26,708
Follow him!

2071
01:54:26,791 --> 01:54:28,583
You're motorcycle punks.

2072
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:30,666
No!

2073
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:35,125
You're not happy. How about a fog prince?

2074
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:36,833
So outdated!

2075
01:54:36,916 --> 01:54:38,708
No!

2076
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:40,750
Two-wheel angel.

2077
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:45,000
Just name whatever you like
on your Facebook.

2078
01:54:45,666 --> 01:54:48,708
Motorbikes can be driven at high speed
only on a race track.

2079
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:51,375
Your Holiness,
how about a race in the field?

2080
01:54:52,333 --> 01:54:53,208
Eakachai.

2081
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:55,750
I'm in the mafia.

2082
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:57,750
But there're just so many of you.

2083
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:01,583
I want you to think of your parents,

2084
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:03,958
of your wife and kids.

2085
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:06,708
If something happens to you,

2086
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:08,708
how sad will your families be?

2087
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:10,791
