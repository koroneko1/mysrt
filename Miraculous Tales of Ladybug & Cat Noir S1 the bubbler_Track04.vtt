&lrm;Take care of them in the meantime.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.540
&lrm;Yeah! Go Ladybug!

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.340
&lrm;[clock ticks]

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.860
&lrm;[sarcastically] Wow, that was a birthday
&lrm;lunch-break to remember. Yay.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.460
&lrm;Nathalie? Father?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.420
&lrm;Yay!

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.660
&lrm;Happy birthday!

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.100
&lrm;Hey, birthday boy!

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.620
&lrm;Guess what? Daddy's gone.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.660
&lrm;While the cat's away, the mice will play.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.940
&lrm;Nino?

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.780
&lrm;The Bubbler's brought all your homies
&lrm;for one single sole purpose

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.580
&lrm;to ce... le... brate!

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.340
&lrm;[cheering]

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.820
&lrm;-Let's get dis party started!
&lrm;-Yeah!

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.900
&lrm;[dance music]

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.220
&lrm;Come on everybody!

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.140
&lrm;I've brought you here to party!

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.780
&lrm;So dance...

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.340
&lrm;or else you'll join the adults in the sky.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.220
&lrm;[wicked laugh]

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.420
&lrm;It won't be long before Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir show up to meet their doom.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.780
&lrm;[wicked laugh]

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.980
&lrm;[Plagg] What's your problem? Relax.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.220
&lrm;You're getting the party
&lrm;you always wanted.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.820
&lrm;Nino's been akumatized.
&lrm;I've gotta help him

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.060
&lrm;You may never get this chance again.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.340
&lrm;Come on. Let's have a little fun
&lrm;while your father's away.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.820
&lrm;Then we'll save Nino, trap his Akuma,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.140
&lrm;and all will be good.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.380
&lrm;OK. You're right.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.260
&lrm;This might be the first time
&lrm;that I get to do what I want for once.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.860
&lrm;It's you and me, Bubbler.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.780
&lrm;Yeah!

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.740
&lrm;Hey, nice party...
&lrm;I guess, since it's my first one.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.980
&lrm;I'm requesting a slow-dance.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.860
&lrm;It's a bit early, isn't it?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.980
&lrm;[Chloe groans]

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.060
&lrm;It's for Adrien. His first slow dance...

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.540
&lrm;Oh, you know it, girl.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.100
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.740
&lrm;Is it me,
&lrm;or does everyone seem a bit weird?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.420
&lrm;Forget about them.
&lrm;Let's go dance. Come on.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.100
&lrm;There's no way this is happening.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.620
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.300
&lrm;A record?

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.340
&lrm;[she cackles]

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.940
&lrm;[funky music]

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.700
&lrm;[gasps]

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.180
&lrm;[giggling]

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.620
&lrm;[cheering]

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.420
&lrm;Dude, who just hijacked my mix?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.780
&lrm;Yours truly.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.900
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.020
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.660
&lrm;Better bug out quick before I change back.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.380
&lrm;Spots off.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.900
&lrm;Marinette!

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.460
&lrm;It was an emergency.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.060
&lrm;Yeah, if by emergency you mean jealousy.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.860
&lrm;Once you use your lucky charm,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.660
&lrm;you only have minutes before...

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.380
&lrm;I turn back, I know, but I figured...

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.460
&lrm;The Bubbler... he's not going anywhere.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.140
&lrm;We've time to get some food
&lrm;to get your energy back.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.660
&lrm;Then, we'll get right back out there.
&lrm;I promise.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.180
&lrm;[dance music]

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.980
&lrm;Gotta find a place
&lrm;where I can transform fast.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.180
&lrm;Where have you been, girl?
&lrm;I was scared for you.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.460
&lrm;Me too.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.980
&lrm;I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will save us.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.940
&lrm;They've never failed us.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.340
&lrm;Come with me, I have something for you.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.580
&lrm;I have to do something first.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.220
&lrm;[tauntingly] It's about Adrien.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.580
&lrm;[reluctantly] OK.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.300
&lrm;Marinette, the Bubbler.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.340
&lrm;OK, OK, in a sec.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.380
&lrm;Look... Now you can sign your gift.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.740
&lrm;Yes.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.100
&lrm;Hey, you. Why aren't you having fun?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.700
&lrm;None of your business.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.540
&lrm;Then I'm gonna make it my business.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.660
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.940
&lrm;"Love, Marinette"

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.260
&lrm;There.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.100
&lrm;[she giggles]

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.300
&lrm;We're good. Spots on, Marinette.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.700
&lrm;I can't do it now. Alya's here.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.780
&lrm;[Ayla] What?

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.860
&lrm;Hey... Go ahead.
&lrm;I'll meet you in the yard.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.620
&lrm;No! You were right, Tikki.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.460
&lrm;I never should have waited.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.940
&lrm;Hey, Paris! How ya doin'?

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.940
&lrm;[crowd groans]

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.580
&lrm;[cheering]

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.140
&lrm;[Adrien] Ladybug?

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.340
&lrm;Sorry, Bubbler, party's over.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.260
&lrm;Why you gotta be like that?

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.980
&lrm;You made all the adults disappear,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.700
&lrm;and now you're imprisoning
&lrm;anyone who isn't having fun.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.380
&lrm;You will not bust up my party!

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.180
&lrm;I think I've been a complete idiot.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.380
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.060
&lrm;Looks like I made it just in time.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.100
&lrm;I had it under control...

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.060
&lrm;but thanks.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.620
&lrm;Get their Miraculouses.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.580
&lrm;I want those powers... Now!

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.100
&lrm;[he roars]

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.460
&lrm;[bubbling]

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.700
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.420
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.460
&lrm;[Marinette whimpers]

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.860
&lrm;[he laughs wickedly]

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.220
&lrm;Give me your Miraculouses
&lrm;before you run out of air.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.540
&lrm;Dream on, Bubbler.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.540
&lrm;Total party-poopers, just like adults.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.340
&lrm;Kids need adults!

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.100
&lrm;False. Kids need freedom, fun,
&lrm;let loose and live it up.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.940
&lrm;[Bubbler] Adults are bossy.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.340
&lrm;[Marinette] But adults keep children safe.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.860
&lrm;They care for their kids. They love them.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.220
&lrm;Most adults do anyhow.
&lrm;You must bring the adults back.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.260
&lrm;Nope, never... Know what?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.860
&lrm;Since you care about them so much,
&lrm;why don't you go float with them?

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.340
&lrm;[they scream]

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.020
&lrm;What do you think you're doing, Bubbler?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.380
&lrm;You're supposed to seize
&lrm;their Miraculouses!

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.340
&lrm;Use your Cataclysm.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.500
&lrm;Couldn't you have said that 500 feet ago?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.620
&lrm;We can't stay stuck
&lrm;in this bubble together forever.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.500
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.140
&lrm;[she screams]

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.260
&lrm;-Shall we see if you land on your feet?
&lrm;-No thanks.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.900
&lrm;Your stick... there!

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.220
&lrm;Got it!

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.660
&lrm;Hang on!

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.340
&lrm;[they yell]

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.380
&lrm;Good thing cats aren't afraid of heights.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.100
&lrm;We have to get to his bubble sword.
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.500
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.380
&lrm;We'd better hurry.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.020
&lrm;Where is everybody?
&lrm;Get out here and party.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.940
&lrm;Sorry to burst your bubble.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.340
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Ladybug! Ladybug!

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.060
&lrm;No one wants to party with you anymore,
&lrm;Bubbler.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.140
&lrm;What's wrong with you all guys?
&lrm;Why you gotta be such haters?

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.220
&lrm;[he roars]

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.460
&lrm;No!

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.020
&lrm;Outer space is the next stop
&lrm;for your precious peeps.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.660
&lrm;And they're never coming back!

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.220
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.900
&lrm;I'm gonna switch back soon. Hurry!

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.060
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.460
&lrm;Your... plumbing skills gonna help us out?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.340
&lrm;Your aim needs work.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.820
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Is that all you got?

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.540
&lrm;Got it.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.620
&lrm;[hissing]

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.500
&lrm;[Ladybug] Cat Noir, cover me.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.700
&lrm;Go on!

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.900
&lrm;[he roars]

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.340
&lrm;[Ladybug] Get out of here, you nasty bug.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.900
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.420
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.940
&lrm;Gotcha.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.980
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.420
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.260
&lrm;Who? Dude...

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.020
&lrm;Pound it.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.660
&lrm;You can't run forever, Ladybug.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.860
&lrm;And when I catch you, I will crush you.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.900
&lrm;I will destroy you both!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.580
<i>&lrm;Nathalie?</i>

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.820
<i>&lrm;Did my son like his gift?</i>

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.100
&lrm;[nervously] Actually...

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.660
&lrm;I was going to check right away.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.820
<i>&lrm;Good.</i>

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.180
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.060
&lrm;A birthday present... from your father.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.740
&lrm;[happily surprised] Oh... thank you.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.100
&lrm;I mean... please say
&lrm;thank you to my father for me.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.820
&lrm;[Chloe] What do you mean

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.020
&lrm;'"Not for a week"?

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.740
&lrm;There were no adults to deliver it.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.620
&lrm;So what? Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.540
&lrm;Serves Chloe right.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.060
&lrm;[Adrien] Hey, girls.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.780
&lrm;Hey, that's my scarf.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.460
&lrm;He's wearing my scarf.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.180
&lrm;Hey, dude.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.540
&lrm;Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.180
&lrm;Yeah. Can you believe it?

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300
&lrm;My dad got it for me?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.260
&lrm;It's so awesome.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.220
&lrm;He's gotten me a lame pen
&lrm;for 3 years in a row.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.180
&lrm;Wow. I guess anyone can change.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.540
&lrm;Adults can be cool
&lrm;when you least expect it.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.140
&lrm;Speaking of adults, my father said
&lrm;you were a bad influence but...

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.100
&lrm;Don't sweat it.
&lrm;We're buds, always n' forever.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.020
&lrm;You've gotta tell him
&lrm;you knitted the scarf.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.780
&lrm;But he seems so happy about his dad.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.500
&lrm;I don't want to spoil it for him.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.980
&lrm;[endearing sigh] Marinette...

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.540
&lrm;You're amazing, girl.
&lrm;You know that, right?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.180
&lrm;And someday,
&lrm;Adrien will figure it out too... promise.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.460
