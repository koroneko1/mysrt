1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,666
Yo, man! I got something to tell you.

2
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:43,875
You're looking at the
"Hernia Get-Tinkled" gang.

3
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:49,083
That skinhead in the front
is their leader, Ting.

4
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,291
We're rivals.

5
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:01,041
See that good-looking poser?
He's no stranger.

6
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,750
He's my little brother.

7
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,375
His name is Pang, the troublemaker.

8
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,791
Look at him.

9
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,583
Such a badass.

10
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,958
Is that all they've got?

11
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,750
How can I know? I came here with you.

12
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,541
Shithead!

13
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,625
I want you to ask him.

14
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,916
Is that all you've got?

15
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,333
We have enough to take you down.

16
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,833
Where's his brother?

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,375
I don't see him anywhere.

18
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,083
Dumbass! Ask him.

19
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,416
Where's your brother?

20
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,000
We can take you down without him.

21
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,375
"Aww" my ass.

22
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,875
He's insulting us.

23
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,083
Whack them now.

24
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,333
Charge!

25
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,583
Hey, Dinner!

26
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,625
Go get them.

27
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,833
Hey, it's time.

28
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,083
What do we do?

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,208
We'd better back off.

30
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,541
-Charge!
-Hey, stop.

31
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,208
Stop.

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,875
Calm down.

33
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,041
He insulted you.

34
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,291
How could you be so weak?

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,375
Do I have to tell you who this guy is?

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,916
It's me, Peng.

37
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm handsome,

38
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,833
and warm-hearted.

39
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,333
Let's watch my story.

40
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,458
Charge!

41
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,916
Charge!

42
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,541
I heard you had a gang fight again!

43
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,750
Why did you do that?

44
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,333
Can anyone tell me why?

45
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,833
Puwadol, answer me.

46
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
For our school.

47
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,125
For our school?

48
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,625
If you died,
what would happen to our school?

49
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,125
Can anyone give me a better answer?

50
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,708
For friends and fraternity.

51
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,083
For friends and fraternity?

52
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,583
If you got hurt or died,

53
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,041
would they take responsibility
for your life?

54
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,125
If they closed down our school
because of your fight,

55
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,708
we all would be in trouble.

56
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,958
What would you do?

57
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,291
Think about it.

58
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Give me a good reason why you did it.

59
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,541
I'd like you to meet Teacher Rose.

60
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,041
He is your new advisor.

61
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,291
If you have any problems, consult him.

62
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,250
That's it for now.

63
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,875
Class, pay respect!

64
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,041
Thank you, teacher.

65
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,375
Well, students. Hello.

66
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,666
I'm here to...

67
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,666
-Teacher.
-Well?

68
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,291
Give me black beans,
and I'll serve you coconut milk.

69
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,375
That's good.

70
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,416
A bowl of black beans is ready.

71
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,291
Where's your coconut milk?

72
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,333
Don't you regret what you did?

73
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
Don't you ever feel ashamed?

74
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,291
I'm so tired of you.

75
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,750
You're nasty.

76
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,291
I saw that!

77
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,000
You look like shit.
Still don't repent, do you?

78
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,666
Don't you have any good sense?

79
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,541
I feel embarrassed for you.

80
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,750
I want to tell you that...

81
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,750
Stop laughing. It’s not funny.

82
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,250
Your parents send you to school.

83
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,250
Studying is your duty.

84
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,833
Got it? You're students.

85
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,125
Students, not gangsters.

86
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,375
Look at your face.

87
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,666
Do you know how ugly you are?

88
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,958
You look like dog-bitten corpses.

89
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,958
Don't you feel ashamed? You're students.

90
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,708
Don't let me catch you fighting again.

91
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,250
It's unacceptable.

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,291
Put your brains to better use

93
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,625
than this stupidity.

94
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,833
Got it?

95
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,916
I have nothing more to say.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,625
You always can consult me. That's it.

97
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,416
Class dismissed!

98
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:27,000
You know Kunathip often fights
with the other school's students?

99
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,375
Of course she knows it. She's his mother.

100
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,041
-I do.
-See? She knows.

101
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,291
Kunathip, why did you lead a gang fight?

102
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,583
Just because you dislike someone...

103
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,541
Yes, they don't like each other.

104
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,500
You sought revenge after you were
expelled from school?

105
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,500
That's right. Madness. Revenge. Expelled.

106
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,458
No, sir.

107
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,541
Then why?

108
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,666
Tell them, son.

109
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
He can't figure it out.

110
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,333
It's all right if you can't answer now.

111
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,125
I'll give you some time to think

112
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,041
and tell me later.

113
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,833
Just tell us. Your Mom needs to know.

114
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,208
The principal and I need to know.

115
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,750
So we can help you.

116
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,000
A stitch in time saves nine.

117
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,416
-Let us help you.
-Why don't you...

118
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,166
Why don't you tell him?

119
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,125
Why don't you stop?

120
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,958
Me?

121
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,083
Just want to help.

122
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,041
Ma'am,

123
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,375
This time, I'll just give him a warning.

124
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,750
But if he breaks the rules again,

125
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,583
he will be on probation.

126
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,708
Thank you, sir.

127
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,000
I won’t let it happen again.

128
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,916
Oh, you can’t blame him.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,125
It's your fault,
for not teaching him well.

130
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,666
Ma'am, speaking of which,
let me ask you something.

131
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,041
That's a fake Hermes, isn't it?

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,291
I knew it. I can tell from your long sigh.

133
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,541
You've got some nerve.

134
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,291
If Peng and I hadn't helped,

135
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
You would have been beaten up.

136
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:19,166
You're exaggerating. We could handle it.
Right, Gun?

137
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,125
Yeah.

138
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,333
You braggart!
There was a whole herd of them.

139
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,000
We're lucky we survived.

140
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,833
Check it out. Our clip on YouTube...

141
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,875
-has almost a million views.
-Lemme see.

142
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,500
Cool or not, look at what we do.

143
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,791
Awesome or not, let's give it a try.
Bring it on. Come see for yourself.

144
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,875
Let me see it.

145
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,541
They said if we got 1.5 million views,

146
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,166
we might be an opening band
at the big concert.

147
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,500
All right!

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,166
There he is.

149
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,583
However, please look out for him.

150
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,916
I will.

151
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,458
That's my Mom!

152
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,625
I don't wanna see her now.

153
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
Let's scram.

154
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,958
We'd be screwed if the teacher saw us.

155
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,500
What? Are you scared?

156
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,583
Oh?

157
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,291
Why are you hiding?

158
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,958
Damn! You're so brave, stay then.

159
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,625
-All right.
-Let's go.

160
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,750
Let's go.

161
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,625
You pussies!

162
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,041
Shit! Wait for me.

163
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,541
I don't understand why you had to fight.

164
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,875
Instead of relaxing at home
with some booze,

165
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,416
I had to sit there listening to
those damn teachers.

166
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,500
Why did you pick a fight?

167
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,458
For the dignity of manhood.

168
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,083
Dignity of manhood?

169
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,583
Manhood, get me some booze.

170
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
Hurry up.

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
That bottle. Yeah.

172
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,333
Where's Pang?

173
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,833
Practicing with his band.

174
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,625
It's late. Why hasn't he come home?

175
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,416
Bring your brother home. Go.

176
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,458
Yes, Mommy.

177
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,500
Peng!

178
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,333
What is it, Mommy?

179
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:12,083
Glass. Get me a glass. Over there.

180
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,708
Alcohol is bad for your health.

181
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,166
You might get cirrhosis.

182
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,916
My lips will stiffen up before my liver.

183
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,000
I needed it since that teacher
started preaching...

184
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,875
on and on.

185
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,666
Dignity of manhood.

186
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,541
I'd better have a drink.

187
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,041
Let's race.

188
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,000
Peng!

189
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,166
Boo!

190
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,375
Come on!

191
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,916
Can you beat me?

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,458
Can you?

193
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,250
Where are you going?

194
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,333
Go!

195
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,333
Come here, sweetheart.

196
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,916
-Hey!
-Cool!

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,125
Peng! Pang!

198
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,375
Whoop their asses!

199
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,250
Peng! Pang!

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,375
-Peng! Pang!
-Whoop their ass!

201
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,958
What do you want from me?

202
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
Asshole!

203
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,416
Come on! Come on! Come on!

204
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
-Come on!
-Come on!

205
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,208
Come on!

206
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,416
Come on!

207
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,375
Police!

208
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,500
The big daddies are here. Shit.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,583
Turn around!

210
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,666
-Police!
-Get outta here!

211
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,416
THIS IS RUNG. WE MET LAST NIGHT. REMEMBER?

212
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Peng, what is that?

213
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,083
-Focus in class.
-Let me see.

214
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,875
Jot things down.

215
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,541
So you do it then.

216
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,333
Oh, her picture.

217
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,333
We'll see.

218
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,208
OF COURSE. YOU LOOK PRETTIER.
I'LL PICK YOU UP.

219
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,375
Wow, watch your steps.

220
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,291
Can I walk you home?

221
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,958
So lame.

222
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,750
Lame?
Have you even seen a good lame bitch?

223
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,666
Here they come.

224
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,833
Where's my brother?

225
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
There he is, Rung.

226
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,250
Sitting here with his foul mouth.

227
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,166
Maew, I'm going home now.

228
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,208
Yeah.

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,166
Can I walk you home?

230
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,875
All right. Let's go.

231
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,333
Come on.

232
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,291
I'm going.

233
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,791
Rung...

234
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,666
See you at home.

235
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,958
Have a nice day.

236
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,708
Kiss, kiss.

237
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,500
Nampetch is cute.

238
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,000
I wanna tell you...

239
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,666
She will be my baby's mother.

240
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,958
This is my brother-in-law. Hello.

241
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,708
You're welcome, brother.

242
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,500
I love you.

243
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,291
Nampetch is my type.

244
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,291
Do you like anchovy?

245
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,541
But she's cute.

246
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,500
And handy in the jungle.

247
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,916
I'll walk her home. See you.

248
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,958
Don't eat that frog.

249
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,458
Do you think Peng will come?

250
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,250
A date with you, he wouldn't.

251
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,458
If it was me, he would.

252
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:31,916
There he is.

253
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,083
Unexpected.

254
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,916
Peng!

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,125
Peng!

256
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,750
I thought you wouldn't come.

257
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,208
I told you I would.

258
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,916
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

259
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,500
Wherever you will go, Peng.

260
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,125
Rung!

261
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,583
You're slutty.

262
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,458
Hey.

263
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,458
Let's go.

264
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,791
What about me?

265
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,083
Just go home.

266
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,541
-Oh!
-Go.

267
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,083
Shit!

268
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,416
Bitch!

269
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,000
What about me?

270
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,833
Don't let me catch you, bitch.

271
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,375
How could you do this to me?

272
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,791
Bitch! You were with me.

273
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,291
Hey, stop, stop.

274
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,750
-Where to go?
-Follow that motorcycle.

275
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,041
Come on. Let's go.

276
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,916
I'm still here!

277
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,083
Let's go.

278
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,333
Get down!

279
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,000
Nampetch!

280
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,000
You even flirt with a motorbike taxi?

281
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Pang is Peng's brother.
He's in a band.

282
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,166
They have a clip on YouTube.
Got almost a million views.

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,083
Let me see.

284
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,833
I want to see it too.

285
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,583
They're awesome.

286
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,000
They are not awesome.

287
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,875
They're enemies. Turn it off!

288
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,208
I'm your brother-in-law.

289
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,500
I saw Rung getting picked up by Peng.

290
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,833
You are such a badmouther.

291
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,041
How could my sister go out with our enemy?

292
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,666
But I really saw them.

293
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,500
Let's find out.

294
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,333
You can't catch up. They're gone.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,208
Damn it, Rung.

296
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,250
How was school today?

297
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,916
Fine. Too much homework, though.

298
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,083
You must be exhausted. Keep it up.

299
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,583
Of course.

300
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,041
Weren't you hanging out with friends?

301
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,125
No, I'd rather be with you, Movie.

302
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,166
Thank you.

303
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,208
My house is up ahead.

304
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't want this walk to end.

305
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,250
I want to be with you longer, Series.

306
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,666
I'd better go now.

307
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,791
Series, I love you.

308
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,958
I love you too.

309
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,916
See you.

310
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,208
What's going on with Thai language?

311
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,250
You use words incorrectly.

312
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,291
What's this? "Twinkly" "Bubbly"

313
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,958
I thought it couldn't be worse.
Now it comes in rhymes.

314
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,500
Oh, dear. "Cushy Kitty's Bell,"

315
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,458
"Sparkling Measuring Tape,"

316
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,166
"Shining Clotheslining,"

317
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,833
"Amazing Tinker bell,"

318
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,500
"Awesome Elephant's Belly."

319
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,041
Here is my favorite.

320
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,291
"Super Trendy Coconut Crotch."

321
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,166
It's "Super Trendy Coconut Candy."

322
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,125
What?

323
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,083
It's Coconut Candy.

324
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,833
Not Coconut Crotch?

325
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,625
Coconut Candy.

326
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,875
Can anyone give me
the meaning of these tags?

327
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,541
Anyone?

328
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,708
Tell me something.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,625
Why so quiet?

330
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,625
See?

331
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,250
You don't even know the meaning of them.

332
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,375
So, you have to find...

333
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,666
the meaning of these tags, all right?

334
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,208
-That's all for today.
-For real?

335
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,583
You can go home.
Dash back to your parents.

336
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,375
Help them with household chores.

337
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,666
Don't wander around.

338
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,666
I'm not pointing my finger at anyone.

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,083
Sirapob!

340
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,125
Yes, ma'am?

341
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,250
All right.

342
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,625
Are you upset? You know what I mean?

343
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,166
All right, everyone. Class dismissed.

344
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,041
Thank you, teacher.

345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,500
You were thanking me...

346
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,333
"tardily piccadilly." Lazy ass.

347
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,125
Let's go to Siam Square.
I want new drumsticks.

348
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,916
I want new bass strings too.

349
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,708
Let's go, guys.

350
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,708
And you, Pang?

351
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,208
Since you all are going, I am too.

352
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,291
Oat, are you going with us?

353
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,583
I can't go. I have a date.

354
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,375
Why?

355
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,958
Since when do you have a date?

356
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,833
You never told us about girls.

357
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,750
I'm going.

358
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,625
-Bye-bye
-See you.

359
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,166
Put away your chair, Gun.

360
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,625
Hello, Peng.

361
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,708
Hi.

362
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,958
I'm going now.

363
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,625
-Okay.
-Bye-bye. See ya.

364
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,458
You go back home.

365
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,208
I’ll go to Siam Square with them.

366
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,416
Don’t worry about me.

367
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,833
Okay, don’t be back late.

368
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,375
Got it, bro.

369
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,041
Take care.

370
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,916
Go. Go.

371
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,583
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

372
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,041
How much did you bring to school?

373
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,750
-Quick!
-Coins.

374
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,250
-Go.
-Good. Good.

375
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,458
Next time banknotes, all right?

376
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,458
Go home. Go.

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,041
Take it all.

378
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,708
Money? Give it to me.

379
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
I'll take it all.

380
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,291
Get out of here. Run

381
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,458
Wait. Where are you going?

382
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,208
-Let me see.
-Give me that.

383
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,166
No money? Get lost.

384
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,583
You're useless.

385
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,208
You've got money. Whoa!

386
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,833
Awesome.

387
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,708
Wait, girl. Do you have any money?

388
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:34,958
7-11 stamps, we take them too. Go.

389
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,625
-Red ones.
-One hundred baht.

390
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,833
We've got enough money.

391
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,791
I'm collecting 7-11 stamps.

392
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,083
Come on.

393
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,833
Ting's idea is brilliant.

394
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,291
Yeah.

395
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,625
We should do it every day.

396
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,166
Yep, we'll do this again tomorrow.

397
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
We could be expelled from school.

398
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,875
Shut it!

399
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:02,958
Go to Paragon!

400
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,666
Can our band handle this?

401
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,750
Of course.

402
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,791
We have Shorty as the guitarist.

403
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,041
-Have you transcribed a new song yet?
-Him?

404
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,041
Yeah.

405
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,500
That's the Hernias.

406
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,833
Ting. Maew. The assholes are here.

407
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,208
Get them!

408
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,958
You're ruining our image.

409
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,791
What are you laughing at?

410
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:51,833
Go! Go!

411
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,666
Follow them!

412
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,416
Quickly!

413
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,833
You can't get away.

414
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,625
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

415
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:19,708
That is quite a lot.

416
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,875
What should we do?

417
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,916
Damn. Full throttle.

418
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,541
Bring it on.

419
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,041
Run! Come on!

420
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,708
Take them down!

421
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:15,916
Good. Good.

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,250
Hang in there, dude.

423
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,458
Are you all right?

424
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,541
You're drenched in blood.

425
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,250
What are you cleaning my face with?

426
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,708
Well, this.

427
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,750
Damn it!

428
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:30,916
Oh, man!

429
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,791
You cleaned me with a sock.

430
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,916
Come to think of it...

431
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,291
I am still angry.

432
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,083
We ran after Pang's gang...

433
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:46,000
but we were beaten by Peng.
So embarrassing!

434
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,916
Right. In front of girls. Embarrassing.

435
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,541
If Peng and Tos hadn't come,

436
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,000
those dorks would have been dead.

437
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,000
Save your words, Batt.

438
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,333
You're the first one who ran off.
How's that?

439
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,625
Fight in the middle of
Maboonkrong junction?

440
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:01,833
In front of everybody.

441
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,250
Our Hernia gang's name is ruined.

442
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,166
Moron, stop talking about hernia.

443
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,250
My balls are shaking
when I hear that word.

444
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,375
Ting, you gotta admit it.

445
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,791
You actually had a hernia back then.

446
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,458
Our gang's name came from you.

447
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,208
Hernia Get-Tinkled.

448
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,041
Are you cured yet?

449
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,041
Damn! I have been cured for so long.

450
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,291
My balls are exactly symmetrical.

451
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,666
Really? Let me see them.

452
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,041
Wanna see them? Here! Look!

453
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,083
No, wait!

454
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,250
Close enough?

455
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,625
-Are you close enough?
-Damn it. You disgraced me.

456
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,666
What kind of a person are you?

457
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,291
Mark my words.

458
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,916
Manhood...

459
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,166
...is not measured by ball size.

460
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,166
What counts is here.

461
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,041
Nipples?

462
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,041
Moron!

463
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,625
It's the heart.

464
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,791
Oat, you should have come with us.

465
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,125
-What's the matter?
-Your drink.

466
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,000
If you had come,
you would have kicked their asses.

467
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,375
You big talker.

468
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:18,041
If Peng and Tos hadn't come,
you would have been flattened.

469
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:19,791
Tut!

470
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,250
Gun, you're just exaggerating.

471
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,708
You are.

472
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,791
Damn you.

473
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,208
I'm sorry, Sui.

474
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,833
It's you.

475
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,500
I swallowed it.

476
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,125
Mister Sirapob.

477
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:44,166
Tell your mother to see
Teacher Rangsan this evening.

478
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,625
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,541
And bring your brother too.

480
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,416
What's this?

481
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,333
-A snack, ma'am.
-Give it to me.

482
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,333
It's mine.

483
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,416
I'm taking it.

484
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,083
Roti from Thai Airways market.

485
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,750
Why is he calling my Mom?

486
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,708
What for?

487
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,833
How could I know?

488
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:08,791
What happened?

489
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,375
Hold this. I'll call my Mom.

490
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,208
-What is the problem?
-I don't know.

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,083
Hello, Mom?

492
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,875
I just told you not to pick a fight.

493
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,666
And you did the opposite.

494
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,791
They're stubborn.

495
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,416
You never listen to what I say, do you?

496
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,958
They were bullying my brother, sir.

497
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:35,916
Yes, Mommy.

498
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,125
Why are you talking back?

499
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,083
That is the truth.

500
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,166
Enough!

501
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:44,125
Ma’am, he leaves me no choice.

502
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,500
I'll put him on parole.

503
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:48,916
I can't compromise on this.

504
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,916
Teacher, can I ask for another chance?

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,875
No.

506
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,416
No, you can't.

507
00:29:57,666 --> 00:30:00,333
Next time he will be expelled.

508
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,375
So don't cause any trouble.

509
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,500
All right. We should leave now.

510
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,583
Goodbye.

511
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,500
You two, let's go home.

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Will they survive?

513
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:22,166
I don't know.
I'm worried about these young men.

514
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,125
Why hasn't he texted me?

515
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,791
What's wrong?

516
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,291
Nothing.

517
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,458
You miss him, don’t you?

518
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,583
Who?

519
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,250
Pang. Peng's brother.

520
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,208
Are you crazy?

521
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:45,750
But I...

522
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,833
miss Peng so much.

523
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,833
I really like him.

524
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,541
The other day I saw him on his motorbike.

525
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,833
My radiator wobbled like this.

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,791
Speaking of which,
I must go to the toilet.

527
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,791
Are you crazy?

528
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,750
I'm joking!

529
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,083
Every time I see Peng,
I wanna spread my legs.

530
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,791
What for?

531
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,583
To ride with him.

532
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,333
To ride with him.

533
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,333
Oh.

534
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,958
I've got an idea!

535
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,250
Peng.

536
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,416
Are you sure about this?

537
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,541
Trust me.

538
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,708
Where is he ?

539
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,500
Here he is.

540
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,000
Nampetch? Rung?

541
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,250
Open the gate.

542
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,875
Pang, is Peng here?

543
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:40,916
Yes, he is.

544
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
-He's here?
-Yeah.

545
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,291
He's here! Hurry up!

546
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,000
Peng!

547
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,916
Peng!

548
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,625
Don't fly down, I'll go get you.

549
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,000
No.

550
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,250
Peng. Peng. Peng.

551
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,875
What is it, Rung?

552
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,333
Rung had a fight with her brother.

553
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,083
I didn't know where to take her.

554
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,666
So I took her to see you here.

555
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,416
It's late, Rung.

556
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,541
I'll give you a ride home.

557
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,916
Come on.

558
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,125
Oh! It's raining.

559
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,583
It's raining.

560
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,791
We can't go out now.

561
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,250
Now that it's raining, well...

562
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:41,958
let us stay here a night.

563
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,333
Do you have any clothes for us?

564
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,416
Yes.

565
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,291
Come on.

566
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,000
Come with me.

567
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:58,958
Come.

568
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,583
Why did you have a fight with them?

569
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:16,833
The day that I took a ride with you,

570
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,708
Ting and Maew saw us.

571
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,125
So my parents knew about us.

572
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,333
They didn't approve of that.

573
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:34,041
You and Nampetch stay here for a night.

574
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,416
I'll give you a ride tomorrow.

575
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,041
Pang?

576
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,166
Pang?

577
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:52,875
Pang!

578
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,000
Pang! Wake up!

579
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,041
Wait a minute.

580
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,041
Pang, wake up. It's time to go to school.

581
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,375
Go to school.

582
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,500
Peng!

583
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,500
Peng.

584
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,833
We are going to be late,

585
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,208
Peng.

586
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,208
Who are you?

587
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,416
Do you realize this is a boy's house?

588
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,208
Peng!

589
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,333
Peng!

590
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,833
-Who is this girl?
-What, Mommy?

591
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,875
What's going on?

592
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,250
Mommy, calm down.

593
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,833
She had a fight with her parents
and came to consult me.

594
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,500
It was raining so she couldn't go home.

595
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,875
You really think I was born yesterday?

596
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,125
-Mommy!
-Don't you ever think before you act?

597
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,041
Why are you still standing there?

598
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,416
Mom, take it easy.

599
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,541
Hey!

600
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,125
-Go.
-Off you go.

601
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,291
Get out.

602
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,250
I'm going.

603
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,041
Don’t stand there. Get out.

604
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,166
-You stress me out.
-Mommy!

605
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,000
So stressed!

606
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,208
Mommy.

607
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,333
Get me a drink now.

608
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,000
This early?

609
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,791
I drink whenever I want.

610
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,041
Go get it!

611
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,791
You too. Think before you act.

612
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,958
-You have a brain.
-Yes, Mommy.

613
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
What's this, son?

614
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,666
Hello, Mom.

615
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,833
What's that thing?

616
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,916
This ugly one won't have a chance
to see my willy.

617
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,916
How could you...

618
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,583
choose a girl like her?

619
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,666
Go. Don't touch my son.

620
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,500
-Go!
-Yes, Mom.

621
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,250
Give it to me.

622
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:45,208
You two need to think before you act.

623
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,625
If something happened,
could you be responsible?

624
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,958
Why are you still standing?
Go get a shower.

625
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,416
Go!

626
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:03,625
Now I believe that guys
with big noses have big willies.

627
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,416
Have you ever heard...

628
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,000
Ting, nine inches.

629
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,833
Oh man! You're something.

630
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,250
Maew, three inches.

631
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,791
Our YouTube views are not doing well.

632
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,125
Let me check.

633
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,875
This band is so cool.

634
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,208
Mine is just three inches?

635
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,375
The guitarist is like...

636
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,750
Bank Clash, that famous singer.

637
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,291
Getting more views?

638
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,708
Ting,

639
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,750
don't you want to zip up your willy?

640
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,166
Batt, get it done.

641
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,666
Such an attention seeker.

642
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,750
That is too big.

643
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,416
Humping move.

644
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,625
Great show.

645
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,000
Just mediocre.

646
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,458
What are you doing?

647
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,166
Zipping up your willy.

648
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,875
No, you're giving me a hard-on.

649
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,666
-It's stuck!
-I'm trying!

650
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:20,958
Zipper!

651
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,625
My balls!

652
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,208
In no time, we will...

653
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,375
reach a million views.

654
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:36,791
Check it out.

655
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,041
Good one.

656
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,125
A million for sure!

657
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,291
Here!

658
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,083
So lame.

659
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,125
They're lame?

660
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,083
You're lame.

661
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,625
What are they playing? So out.

662
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,500
Look at Batt.

663
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,000
He sucks.

664
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,416
-Shit.
-Totally losers.

665
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,000
It sucks.

666
00:37:58,625 --> 00:37:59,541
What’s wrong?

667
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,166
Ting and his gang...

668
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,916
They clone everything we do.

669
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,375
Hi, ma'am. I'm Rose from school.

670
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,041
I'd like to ask you about your son.

671
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,083
Slow down. Slow down.

672
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,791
I can't catch up.

673
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,375
Oh yes, I'm from the school.

674
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,583
I need to know.

675
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:27,041
What is Puwadol like when he's at home?

676
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,291
-Puwadol?
-Yes.

677
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:32,375
He's a cute boy. Well-behaved.
Well-disciplined.

678
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,750
When he sees an ant,
he lets the ant go first.

679
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:36,708
-Right?
-Yes.

680
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,833
Parents’ behavior
can cause their kids trouble.

681
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,125
You should set a good example for them,

682
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,458
so they can model after you.

683
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,083
You should set a good example for them,
so they can model after you.

684
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,125
You're a drinker.
What will happen to your kids?

685
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,833
No, no, no... I don't drink.

686
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,833
Have you ever seen violence from him?

687
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,125
Like, kicking a neighbor,
killing a dog or cat?

688
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,291
Don't frame my grandson.

689
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,666
No. It's impossible.

690
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,958
He definitely wouldn’t do that.

691
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,291
When bitten by mosquitoes,
he only blew them away.

692
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,125
-Is that right?
-Yes, yes, yes.

693
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,916
You're pouring some more for me?

694
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,125
Well, if you insist.

695
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,000
Let me try another sip.

696
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,500
Cheers, for good luck.

697
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,125
You should not drink alone so often.

698
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,583
Cheers.

699
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,125
-Listen carefully.
-Yes.

700
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:27,250
Your son got in a gang fight again.

701
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,541
Don't frame my grandson.

702
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,625
It's impossible. Definitely not my boy.

703
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:36,250
It might be Puwadej or Puwanart,
but not my Puwadol.

704
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,083
Ma'am, I have to tell you this.

705
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,708
I am normally not a drinker.

706
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,666
I like making merit.

707
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,791
I usually wake up early to give alms...

708
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,541
go to the temple to free birds and fish,

709
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,041
and free myself during the night.

710
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,666
Life is made of Yin and Yang.

711
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:07,916
Good night, Rung.

712
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,458
Rung.

713
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,791
Ting, are you still up?

714
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,875
Yes. I've been waiting for you.

715
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,791
Rung, where have you been?

716
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,208
Ting, are you drunk or something?

717
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,583
Did you go out with Peng?

718
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,916
Go back to bed.

719
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,833
How could you do this?

720
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,875
What about me?

721
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,333
Ting!

722
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,250
Rung.

723
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,583
Damn Peng... I’ll get you for this.

724
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,083
Dad, Hello!

725
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,041
Peng, it's late. Why don't you go home?

726
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,958
Your Mom will be mad.

727
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,291
I don't want to go home yet.
Let me hang out here.

728
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,666
All right.

729
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:35,416
How are you doing, Dad?
How is your business?

730
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,458
How was it?

731
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,541
Not too bad.

732
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,666
Dad.

733
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,875
How did you meet Mom?

734
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,083
How I met your Mom?

735
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,791
It’s this pub.

736
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,416
Over there.

737
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,875
I was singing here, and your Mom came by.

738
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,375
Every day.

739
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,958
Listening to my songs.

740
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,583
And you hit on her right away?

741
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,958
It's me you're talking about.

742
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,416
Your Mom hit on me first.

743
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,125
I was embarrassed in front of customers.

744
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,625
But after talking to her,

745
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,416
we got used to each other.

746
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,458
We did it twice.

747
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,541
The result is you and your brother.

748
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:53,958
What's the matter?

749
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,708
Is it about a girl?

750
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,166
What?

751
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,541
I'm seeing someone.

752
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,333
But I don't know what to do.

753
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,708
If you like her, tell her so.

754
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,458
If you love her, tell her so.

755
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:14,041
Be true to yourself.

756
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,750
The most important thing for men is...

757
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,291
take a shot if you have a chance.

758
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,875
-Take a shot?
-Yeah.

759
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,291
Don't lose your opportunity.

760
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,333
How's your mother doing?

761
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,458
Same as every day.

762
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,083
She always gets drunk.

763
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,208
She never listens to me.

764
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,583
Please take care of her.

765
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,583
Your Mom and your brother.

766
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,208
Okay, Dad.

767
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,625
I'd better go now.

768
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:52,833
Dad.

769
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:54,833
Can I kiss you?

770
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,500
What? You never change.

771
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,166
Come on.

772
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,416
All right.

773
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,916
-I'm going, Dad. Goodbye.
-All right.

774
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,041
Take care.

775
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,125
Hey, wait, Peng.

776
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:14,708
What, Dad?

777
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,833
It's important for us men. Safety first.

778
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:23,750
I don't need it, Dad.

779
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,458
I'll count to three.

780
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,416
One...

781
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,208
Two...

782
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,791
Wait, wait, wait.

783
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,708
OK.

784
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,083
How could you do this to me?

785
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:45,083
Damn it. How could you?

786
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,583
Ting.

787
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,041
What's wrong with you?

788
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,916
Why don’t you ask Maew?

789
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,916
Maew, what's wrong with him?

790
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,125
Well...

791
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,291
You see, Ting...

792
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,375
See what?

793
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:07,875
Last night...

794
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,833
I was on my knees, on my knees.

795
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,208
Ting, what did you say?

796
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,166
I was saying...

797
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,791
On my knees.

798
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,125
Oh, I know.

799
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,916
Ting saw Peng dropped Rung off
at home last night.

800
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,958
Then Ting was making out with Peng.

801
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,916
And he was trying to rape Ting...

802
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,625
Damn you. I didn't make out with him.

803
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,916
I'm jealous. I saw Rung and Peng together.

804
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:43,250
Oh, no. Peng was trying to rape Rung.

805
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,916
You need to say it right.

806
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,250
Yeah, that's what I mean.

807
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,958
Did you get that thing I told you, Batt?

808
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,250
What is he talking about?

809
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,541
I don't know.

810
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,916
Give it to me.

811
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,500
Ton, make a video.

812
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:58,875
What video?

813
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,166
There he goes.

814
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,500
WPP! huh?

815
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:02,875
You guys are WPP, right?

816
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,541
Hold it.

817
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,291
Peng, here's the flag
of the school you love.

818
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,041
Look.

819
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:12,916
Look.

820
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:16,625
Here! Here! Here!

821
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:17,666
Here!

822
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,333
Look. Your school's flag.

823
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:24,208
-Are you satisfied?
-Hey, bro!

824
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:28,541
-Are you satisfied?
-I am! I am!

825
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:29,625
-Ting!
-What?

826
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:31,791
My foot! The flag is there.

827
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,708
Why did you put your foot in my way?

828
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,791
Ting, why did you do that?

829
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,083
We have no reason and get nothing,

830
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,625
no matter what we do.

831
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,041
It's not us. Just you.

832
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,458
Yeah. It's just you.

833
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,041
I don't give a damn.

834
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,666
Keep it rolling.

835
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,666
How's that? See?

836
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,958
Peng, look at this. Look!

837
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,916
Ting! Ting! Ting!

838
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,041
What?

839
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,708
Hand!

840
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,250
Shit! That's so stupid.

841
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,000
Ting.

842
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,583
What will you do next?

843
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,291
Beat them up anywhere.

844
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,166
Let's go.

845
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,750
Enjoy yourself.

846
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:18,958
Cheers.

847
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:20,666
Is everything okay?

848
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,333
Dad.

849
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,875
Hey, Peng.

850
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,458
What are you doing here?

851
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,500
Hello, Dad.

852
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:31,625
Hi.

853
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,208
I want you to meet my friend.

854
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,791
That girl you talked about?

855
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,041
What did you say?

856
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,416
Nothing.

857
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,166
Her name is Rung.

858
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,916
Hello.

859
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:44,833
Did you use it?

860
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:46,750
All here.

861
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,041
-Safety first.
-Hello, Dad.

862
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,791
-All of you?
-This is my girlfriend.

863
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,458
-Hello, Dad.
-It’s not you. Go away!

864
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,208
Fai. Fai.

865
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:59,458
Oh, my son's taste!

866
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:00,833
Come in.

867
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:02,791
This is my girlfriend.

868
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:03,750
That's my boy.

869
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

870
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,583
Where's your Mom?

871
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,291
Perhaps she's drunk at home.

872
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,208
Make yourself at home.

873
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,500
Take care of your friends.

874
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,083
Come on, Rung.

875
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,333
Keep playing.

876
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,416
What did you say to him?

877
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,041
I didn't.

878
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,833
Let me go!

879
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,416
Let me go!

880
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,166
Come on!

881
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,708
Pang, look up to Dad.

882
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,916
Peng!

883
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,875
Pang!

884
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,250
Why don’t you come back home?

885
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,958
Why are you so irresponsible?

886
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,333
Hanging out with girls here.

887
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:28,875
-I've been waiting for you all day.
-Busted.

888
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,541
-Haven't I taught you about this?
-Hold it.

889
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,208
These girls have no dignity.

890
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,583
Didn't your parents teach you anything?

891
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,000
I have become like this, so stressed out...

892
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,625
because your Dad never came home.

893
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,541
You're exactly like your father,
an asshole!

894
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:41,833
Hey, you!

895
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,458
Why are you making a scene?

896
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,208
We have a lot of customers, don't you see?

897
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,500
A lot of customers...

898
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,166
What are you looking at?

899
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,333
Shit!

900
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:54,333
Get out!

901
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,625
Get out!

902
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,083
We're having a fight.

903
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,166
Because of you.

904
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,291
Look at your sons.
They never listen to me.

905
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,166
They'll be bastards just like you.

906
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,708
You never came home.

907
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,958
Who would stay with a drunk Mom?

908
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,041
You! Shut up!

909
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,458
-Your Dad told you to come?
-Mom!

910
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,375
I'm leaving, Dad.

911
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,083
-Dad, goodbye.
-Bye.

912
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:23,625
Mom, goodbye.

913
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,541
Peng.

914
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:30,208
Pang.

915
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:31,958
Pang, honey.

916
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,375
It’s your fault.

917
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,375
You taught them to not respect me.

918
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,000
It’s because you're irrational.

919
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:38,916
Nothing to do with me.

920
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,958
You never came home,
and they're doing the same.

921
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,000
-You are babbling.
-You all are bastards.

922
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,250
I'm outta here.

923
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,333
You have never been here anyway.

924
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,458
Get out. All of you. Out!

925
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,833
Get out of here!

926
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,458
Go!

927
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,208
They're talking shit, right?

928
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:01,708
Cheers, Mom.

929
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,541
This is plain water.
Are you trying to kill me?

930
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,291
I'd better go now. Goodbye, Mommy.

931
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,000
-Go, bitch!
-I'm leaving.

932
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,333
Peng?

933
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,083
Pang?

934
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,875
Why haven't they come back?

935
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:51,791
Peng?

936
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,583
Welcome.

937
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,958
How are you? Some more?

938
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,083
Sure.

939
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,333
Cheers then.

940
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,000
Bottoms up.

941
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,000
Nah, I've been drinking all night.

942
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,250
Why don’t you come home?

943
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:29,125
It's because of this bitch, huh?

944
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,625
Messing around with my husband?

945
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,041
Don't you know our sons are waiting?

946
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,958
Why don't you come home?

947
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,500
She is a customer.

948
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,375
What are you looking at?
Never seen a couple fight before?

949
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,625
I'm leaving.

950
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:50,708
Whiskey.

951
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,125
Here you are.

952
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,416
Calm down, ma’am.

953
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,750
The customers are freaked out.

954
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,375
Where have you been?

955
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,750
I've been back for a while.
Why did you just arrive?

956
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,708
Don't tell me you dropped those girls off.

957
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,500
If they got pregnant,
are you able to take resposibility?

958
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,041
Peng!

959
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,458
I'm talking to you. Peng!

960
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,875
Peng!

961
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,333
You're gonna be like your Dad.

962
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,958
Peng!

963
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,416
Where are you guys going?

964
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,541
We're going to the Music Society.

965
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:51,958
They won the Fan's Choice award in Guitar.

966
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:52,916
Yeah.

967
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,875
So cool.

968
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,375
Yeah, whatever.

969
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,583
Just don't be late. Mom will be worried.

970
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:58,708
All right, Peng.

971
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:00,375
And don't cause any trouble.

972
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:01,416
I know.

973
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,416
Bye-bye.

974
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,208
Let’s go, guys.

975
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:10,958
Oat, aren't you coming?

976
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,041
Go ahead. I have a date.

977
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,625
Damn...

978
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:17,541
He's so in love!

979
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,083
-Romantic.
-Moron.

980
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,708
-See ya.
-Bye.

981
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,416
Cheers, guys. Cheers!

982
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,666
You're just an amateur, bro.

983
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,083
What?

984
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,416
Is it funny? Are you amused? Great.

985
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:51,708
Just one game and you're bragging.

986
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:54,125
Whoa, it's a great party, Ting.

987
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,708
This round is on me.

988
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,166
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

989
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,541
Ting...

990
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:12,625
Let me ask you.

991
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Why did you run away when you saw Peng?

992
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,708
Yeah. Come here.

993
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,916
Actually, I wasn't running away.

994
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,958
I just run to get ready for a fight.

995
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,583
Got it?

996
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,833
That's the plan.

997
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:43,791
Ting.

998
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,250
Ting.

999
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:47,833
That's Pang. Peng's brother.

1000
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,916
How convenient.

1001
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm itching to kick their asses.

1002
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,625
Come on!

1003
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,000
Come on!

1004
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,708
I think this one is okay.

1005
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,666
This one is perfect.

1006
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,750
But I think this one... looks expensive.

1007
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,166
Those are Ting's gang.

1008
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:23,208
Should we have a go?

1009
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:26,208
Have a go my ass, we're outnumbered.

1010
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,083
Let's get out of here.

1011
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,083
-Come on.
-Pussy.

1012
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,083
Pussy my ass. Run!

1013
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,958
-What?
-Let's go, Gun.

1014
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:35,375
Hey, they're getting away.

1015
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,541
Why are you still here? Go after them!

1016
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:38,958
Hurry up.

1017
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:40,833
Hurry up.

1018
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,625
Hurry up!

1019
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,125
Come on!

1020
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,666
They're coming!

1021
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,833
Gun! Hurry up!

1022
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:50,875
Hurry up.

1023
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,250
Come on.

1024
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:56,916
Shit! Dead end.

1025
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,000
What do we do?

1026
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,791
What are you scared of? Fight them!

1027
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,291
Peng, when will your brother come home?

1028
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,166
It's raining.

1029
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:26,958
Let's wait for now.

1030
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,375
-Peng!
-What?

1031
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,333
Peng!

1032
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,250
Hurry up. Lay him here.

1033
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,666
Peng!

1034
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,041
Where have you been?

1035
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,125
Who did this to you?

1036
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,625
Hernia gang slammed us.

1037
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,875
There were a lot of them.

1038
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:25,291
If we had more people, we'd have won.

1039
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,375
Peng.

1040
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:32,375
Ting left you a message...

1041
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,875
Never mess around with his girlfriend.

1042
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:40,958
Tos, let's go.

1043
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:42,750
Where are we going?

1044
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,833
You guys, take care of him.

1045
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,500
I'll be back. Don't go anywhere.

1046
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,000
He's still in the shower.

1047
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:01,083
-Too long.
-Late again.

1048
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,750
Ting, you son of a bitch!

1049
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,666
I know, just a moment.

1050
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:26,916
Hey.

1051
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,250
Don't get close.

1052
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,916
Calm down, sunshine. Don't rush.

1053
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,750
Bastard!

1054
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,000
Did you hurt my brother?

1055
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,041
Ting!

1056
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,833
Ting!

1057
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,708
What are you doing?

1058
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:52,958
What are you doing?

1059
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,583
Ting!

1060
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,125
What's going on?

1061
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:58,625
Ting!

1062
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,375
I'm passing out. Am I gonna die?

1063
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:29,333
Let go of me!

1064
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,041
Peng!

1065
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,375
Get them!

1066
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,666
Come on!

1067
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,000
-Tos!
-Peng!

1068
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:44,916
Shit !

1069
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,875
Hang in there, bro.

1070
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,166
What do we do?

1071
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,000
Peng, are you all right?

1072
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,916
-Tos!
-Hang in there, bro.

1073
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:16,333
He is a good boy.

1074
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:18,500
My grandson always stays home. Am I right?

1075
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,625
Yes, here is the thing, sir.

1076
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:24,625
The black shorts came
to attack the blue shorts.

1077
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,041
-Right, grandma?
-Yes, yes.

1078
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,166
Oh, no. I said it wrong.
Let me start again.

1079
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,708
The blue shorts came
to attack the black shorts.

1080
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,125
Our kid is the black shorts.

1081
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,458
What's his name?

1082
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:34,916
Puwadol.

1083
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,833
Excuse me.

1084
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:38,583
I'm bailing my children out.

1085
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,583
-What's his name?
-Kunathip and Sirapob. Two of them.

1086
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,291
Oh, you're their mother.

1087
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:44,916
What kind of mother are you?

1088
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,083
You let your kids hurt other people.

1089
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:49,375
And this is my grandson.

1090
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,250
Can't you teach your sons to behave?

1091
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:54,458
I should have stayed at my shop.

1092
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,708
Calm down. Calm down.

1093
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:59,583
Hey guys, your parents came
to bail you out.

1094
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,250
Peng, get up.

1095
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,833
Take it easy.

1096
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,541
Is Tongplew here?

1097
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,666
It's me.

1098
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:34,333
Tongplew, stay down. The rest, get up!

1099
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:41,208
You have to stay.
No one's bailed you out yet.

1100
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:48,500
Hurry up.

1101
01:05:58,833 --> 01:05:59,750
Ting!

1102
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,958
Don't be scared, Batt.

1103
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,291
I'll find a way to help.

1104
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,166
Don’t leave me behind.

1105
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:16,958
Are you done talking?

1106
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,750
Your parents are waiting. Come on.

1107
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:20,708
Move!

1108
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:21,958
Don't forget about me.

1109
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:25,958
Guys!

1110
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,833
Here they are.

1111
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:02,416
-Son!
-Mom!

1112
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,458
Look, he is such a good kid.

1113
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,625
Look at you! Are you hurt?

1114
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,000
I'll smack you.

1115
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:12,958
Why did you fight them? I told you.

1116
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,458
Why didn't you take care of your brother?

1117
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,166
Why did you let him do this?

1118
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,041
Why did you let him fight?

1119
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,791
Why didn't you do something?

1120
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,333
Excuse me, everyone!

1121
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,791
Now that you paid the fine,
you can go home.

1122
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:32,625
You may leave now.

1123
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,166
I’ll take care of your wound.

1124
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,625
Let’s go home, Mom.

1125
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:39,041
We need to talk. It’s not right at all.

1126
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:42,000
Tell your sons to behave.

1127
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,041
You look pretty but don't know
how to raise children.

1128
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,291
They need parent's guidelines.

1129
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,791
Don't just dress pretty
but neglect your children.

1130
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:53,041
It's useless if you can't teach them well.

1131
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,833
A thousand baht fine each
for a gang fight.

1132
01:07:56,708 --> 01:08:00,250
A thousand baht fine each
for a gang fight.

1133
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,166
Tos.

1134
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,458
Tos. Tos. Tos.

1135
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,291
Peng.

1136
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,500
How are you doing?

1137
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,833
Doctor said that I’m lucky.
It’s not on a vital organ.

1138
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:29,916
I'll be out in a few days.

1139
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:31,458
Good.

1140
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,458
Tos, you don't have to worry.

1141
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,791
Friends don’t leave each other.

1142
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,708
-That's right.
-We won't.

1143
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,291
Thank you.

1144
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:42,708
You don't have to thank me.

1145
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,208
Put your hand down. Take it easy.

1146
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:51,291
I think we should stop
being a street gang.

1147
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,166
I feel sorry for my parents.

1148
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:55,541
Batt is in deep shit.

1149
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:57,958
I feel sorry for him.

1150
01:08:58,375 --> 01:08:59,791
He doesn’t have bail money.

1151
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:04,375
Batt has gone too far this time.

1152
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,500
Now what? We're all in trouble.

1153
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,625
And my Mom is going ape shit.

1154
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:13,833
They're wasting their time and money
bailing us out,

1155
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,250
instead of working to earn more money.

1156
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:23,833
My date wants me to stop,
otherwise we'll break up.

1157
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,791
All you care about is your girlfriend.

1158
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,208
Does she really love you?

1159
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,375
Definitely.

1160
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,916
Well, we've come this far...

1161
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,833
I won't back down easily.

1162
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,583
Has it reached 1.5 million views yet?

1163
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,000
Almost.

1164
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,166
-Mommy!
-Hey!

1165
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,291
Mommy!

1166
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,125
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

1167
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,958
Mommy!

1168
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,000
Pang, take Mom to the hospital.

1169
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,416
Pang.

1170
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,625
Pang.

1171
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,958
Peng.

1172
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,041
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

1173
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:21,125
Mommy! How are you?

1174
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:25,791
Don't worry about me. I'm all right.

1175
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:29,750
Peng, adjust the bed.

1176
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,458
Don't worry.

1177
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,333
That's enough, sweetie.

1178
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,625
Mommy...

1179
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,291
I have one thing to beg of you.

1180
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,083
What is it, son?

1181
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,291
Can you quit drinking?

1182
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:06,833
Why?

1183
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,291
When you drink, you end up like this.

1184
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:13,583
And if something happens to you...

1185
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,625
How could we live?

1186
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:21,875
Please, Mommy.

1187
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:27,208
Yes, honey.

1188
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:32,583
And can I ask you both one thing?

1189
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,000
What is it, Mommy?

1190
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:38,625
Will you quit fighting?

1191
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:43,083
Stop being involved in gang fights.

1192
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:47,875
Yes, Mommy.

1193
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:50,750
And you, Peng?

1194
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,375
Yes, Mommy.

1195
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:55,916
Promise me.

1196
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:58,708
I promise.

1197
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,333
So...

1198
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:05,333
I'll quit drinking now.

1199
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,333
So you promise me?

1200
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:09,916
Yes, honey.

1201
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,750
I love you the most.

1202
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,166
I love you, Mommy.

1203
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:39,541
Mama.

1204
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:41,083
Mama.

1205
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:44,750
I'm home.

1206
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,833
Son, you're back.

1207
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:47,875
Yes.

1208
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,291
My good boy.

1209
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:55,500
Here's dinner. I made your favorite.

1210
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,291
You have to eat a lot.

1211
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:58,541
You should get some rest.

1212
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,833
I'll go to bed now.

1213
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:02,833
It's your favorite. Eat it up.

1214
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,958
Good boy.

1215
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,208
Series.

1216
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,500
When will you stop hanging out
with those guys?

1217
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,500
Why?

1218
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:38,416
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

1219
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:44,458
Your friend stabbed my friend
the other day.

1220
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,583
Let me ask you.

1221
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,958
Between your friends and me,

1222
01:13:58,708 --> 01:13:59,958
whom do you choose?

1223
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:08,500
I'm tired.

1224
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,958
We can talk about this later.

1225
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:15,916
Series...

1226
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,125
I love you.

1227
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,125
Yeah.

1228
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:43,708
Why are you screaming?
That'll hurt your throat.

1229
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,916
We're the opening band for a concert.

1230
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,916
That's right.

1231
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,875
-We made it!
-I made it!

1232
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,708
Don't shake me!

1233
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,166
-Let go of me!
-I did.

1234
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,250
You did?

1235
01:14:57,333 --> 01:15:00,333
Really? Why are you shaking me?

1236
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:02,041
Tell me what it is all about.

1237
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,083
We're opening for a famous band
at a big concert.

1238
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,291
Big concert?

1239
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,708
Yes.

1240
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:10,333
With a famous band?

1241
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,541
I'm so happy for you.

1242
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,000
Woo!

1243
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:19,166
You guys are good kids.

1244
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,000
You're bringing a good reputation to WPP.

1245
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm so glad.

1246
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,875
I can't keep this to myself.

1247
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:29,291
I can't keep a secret.

1248
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:32,291
I have to announce it.
I'll tell the principal...

1249
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:34,458
You're going to play at a big concert.

1250
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,625
Stop. Don't bother.

1251
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:38,875
I can shake myself.

1252
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,500
Hey, you guys!

1253
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:45,041
Something good is happening.
Why don't you congratulate them?

1254
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,208
Do it now!

1255
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,041
Awesome.

1256
01:15:58,916 --> 01:15:59,916
So happy.

1257
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:04,500
Ma'am, I have to expel your son.

1258
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:08,166
He constantly breaks the rules.

1259
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:12,833
First, he was warned,
then put on probation.

1260
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:15,000
But that didn't stop him.

1261
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:17,458
I'm sorry.

1262
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,166
That's all right.

1263
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:21,708
I understand.

1264
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,291
Thank you.

1265
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,833
I'll send you abroad
to live with your aunt.

1266
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,291
How did you get in here?

1267
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:20,041
Well...

1268
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:23,583
As if I never lived here before.

1269
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,125
I have a gift for you.

1270
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:38,166
No, thank you.

1271
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,125
Why?

1272
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:43,250
I made a promise to our children.

1273
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,000
I'm glad...

1274
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,541
to see you change for the kids.

1275
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,541
And for yourself.

1276
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:12,458
You know what, since the day I left...

1277
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,208
I've always been thinking of you.

1278
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,125
From now on...

1279
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:27,291
let's put the kids first.

1280
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,291
Can we still be friends?

1281
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:17,625
Mommy.

1282
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:19,958
Peng.

1283
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,916
Are you not sleeping yet?

1284
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,708
Dad told me you went to bed.

1285
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,625
Why are you here?

1286
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:28,791
I'm not sleepy yet.

1287
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,458
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

1288
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,708
Do you remember...

1289
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:41,333
that you asked me why we fought?

1290
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,083
Yes, honey.

1291
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,875
I couldn't give you the right answer
back then.

1292
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:51,958
Now I can answer that question.

1293
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:04,041
I thought the most important
thing in my life...

1294
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,083
was dignity.

1295
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:13,166
But it's actually not.

1296
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:20,000
It's just the rage, the hormones...

1297
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:22,791
the madness of teenage life.

1298
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:30,041
Now, I know

1299
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:34,250
what the most important thing
in my life is.

1300
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,583
It's you and Dad.

1301
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,458
I love you.

1302
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,333
Mommy,

1303
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:06,125
Everything I ever did that made you upset,

1304
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,333
I'm sorry, Mommy.

1305
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,208
That's all right, sweetie.

1306
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,000
It's all right.

1307
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,166
I was never mad at you.

1308
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,875
My good boy.

1309
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:33,375
Hello? What's the matter?

1310
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,750
Yeah. All right. Wait for me.
I'll be there.

1311
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,333
Movie, I have to go out.

1312
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:53,083
Stay here. I'll be back.

1313
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,208
Can you not go?

1314
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,458
No. They're waiting for me.

1315
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,375
Please, not today.

1316
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:27,375
Have you heard about Pang, Peng's brother?

1317
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:31,000
They're the opening band at a big concert.

1318
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,333
Really?

1319
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,833
Don't you remember, Tan?

1320
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,041
You showed me the YouTube video,

1321
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,166
and it had almost a million views.

1322
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,458
Now they've got 1.5 million.

1323
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,541
1.5 million!

1324
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:41,750
1.5 million!

1325
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,875
I have a plan.

1326
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:46,416
What plan?

1327
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,958
I'll wreck their concert.

1328
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:50,541
Ting.

1329
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:53,083
Are you wrecking their concert?

1330
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,791
There are too many people.

1331
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:58,875
How would we know who our people are?

1332
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,958
Yeah, how would you know?

1333
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:10,000
Here, our gang's symbol.

1334
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,833
Headband?

1335
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:16,291
Yeah.

1336
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,291
Why?

1337
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,333
Like this?

1338
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:27,625
That's quite okay.

1339
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:30,791
Here comes Series.

1340
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,833
I called you for hours.
Why have you just come?

1341
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:36,250
Sorry, I have just talked to my partner.

1342
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,875
We might have to break up.

1343
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:46,625
Maew, I saw Rung came around at the door.

1344
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,875
I asked her to come in, but she refused.

1345
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,458
She said your Mom wanted you to go home.

1346
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,333
Mom wants me to go home?

1347
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:55,375
Yeah.

1348
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:56,916
What's that all about?

1349
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:00,416
Peng, is your wound healed?

1350
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,875
It's just a scratch, no big deal.

1351
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:05,291
It didn't come even get close to my heart.

1352
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,750
Peng, you're leaving so soon.

1353
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:13,000
Who is going to support me?

1354
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:16,083
Do your best, bro.

1355
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:18,833
My brother is awesome.

1356
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,083
I'd like you to stay anyway.

1357
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,250
Pang, while I'm not around...

1358
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,541
Don't fight with anyone.

1359
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,458
You promised Mom, remember?

1360
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,958
Yes.

1361
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,750
Enough with the teenage gangster life.

1362
01:24:58,583 --> 01:24:59,666
Peng!

1363
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:00,791
What's the matter?

1364
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:01,708
Can I have it?

1365
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,666
I'd like to keep part of you.

1366
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:07,916
You too, Tos.

1367
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,583
Don't pick a fight with anyone.

1368
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,166
Take care of my brother.

1369
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,750
All right.

1370
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,000
Take care of Mom.

1371
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,083
Study hard.

1372
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:27,875
Don't let her down.

1373
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:35,083
If we were to part tomorrow

1374
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:39,208
I'd cherish those tears

1375
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:42,791
And joy in my heart

1376
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:48,583
There are so many people in this world

1377
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:52,333
But there are few true friends

1378
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:55,291
Those who don't hurt us

1379
01:25:55,375 --> 01:26:00,291
Those who see us through

1380
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:06,916
Those who stay the sam
And don't change with time

1381
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,333
Friends never leave one another

1382
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:17,958
For better or worse
We'll stand side by side

1383
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:24,250
When you are in trouble
No matter where you are

1384
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:29,125
Don't ever think you are alone

1385
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:35,250
Because you are not alone in this world

1386
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,916
We're friends

1387
01:26:55,041 --> 01:27:01,125
Different dreams we have
Different paths we take

1388
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,666
Even if our lives will not be the same

1389
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:11,041
We all have to go through high and low

1390
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:15,791
There are so many people in this world

1391
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,708
When you get there,

1392
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:22,708
be a good kid. Don't make your aunt worry.

1393
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,625
Hey, are you guys ready?

1394
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,291
It's about to start.

1395
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,333
I’ve been ready since yesterday.

1396
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,750
Pang, what's wrong? You look upset.

1397
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,958
It sucks.

1398
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:41,750
Peng is going abroad today.

1399
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:43,875
He doesn't get to see us play

1400
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,291
Cheer up. We have to do our best.

1401
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:51,083
The show must go on.

1402
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:52,958
You bet.

1403
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:55,875
Please take care of Pang.

1404
01:27:56,666 --> 01:28:00,166
Don't worry. I’ll take care of him.

1405
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:03,250
You just behave, Peng.

1406
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:06,625
Don't cry, Mom. You've gotta be strong...

1407
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,291
Like me, you know?

1408
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:11,208
I love you, son.

1409
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,958
I love you too. Don’t cry.

1410
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:17,166
I promise that I'll be good.

1411
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,208
It’s about time.

1412
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:25,125
You'll miss the flight. Go.

1413
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,833
Smile, Mommy.

1414
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:28,625
Don't cry, all right?

1415
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm leaving.

1416
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:53,750
-Rung, you go ahead. I’ll catch up.
-All right.

1417
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:32,208
Peng!

1418
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:34,500
Peng!

1419
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,083
Peng!

1420
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:01,916
Where is she?

1421
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:04,541
Rung!

1422
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,041
Rung!

1423
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:07,500
Rung!

1424
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:11,250
Come on. They're calling.

1425
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:22,083
-Guys.
-What?

1426
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:25,666
I've heard Ting and his gang

1427
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,916
are going to wreck our concert.

1428
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,333
What should we do?

1429
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:35,625
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

1430
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:42,750
Let’s go.

1431
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:45,833
Come on.

1432
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:00,250
Rung.

1433
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:12,500
Don't cry.

1434
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,666
Go find Dane.

1435
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:40,000
Hey.

1436
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:41,208
Dane, thank you

1437
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:42,500
for helping me today.

1438
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,625
Don't worry. It's ok.

1439
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:48,291
Here I am. I'll take care of you all.

1440
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,000
You and I, we're kindred spirits.

1441
01:31:50,083 --> 01:31:52,583
Beat those bastards up and off you go!

1442
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:53,958
That's how I roll.

1443
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:57,166
You can say I'm the roof
of your little house.

1444
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,250
The tiles are paved so tight
just like our brotherhood.

1445
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,000
You can count on me.

1446
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:05,625
But don't call me Dane.

1447
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:08,166
I changed my name.

1448
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,458
Call me the Bastard.

1449
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,625
-Say it.
-Yes.

1450
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:11,833
Yes, Bastard!

1451
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:13,291
Yes, call me a bastard.

1452
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:16,291
-Bastard!
-Good job. Do it again, boy-band style.

1453
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:18,041
Can you all show me how?

1454
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,500
Yes, Bastard!

1455
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:22,291
All good in the hood. That's awesome!

1456
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,666
I'll take care of you.

1457
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,500
Bastard, can you
take care of it down there?

1458
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:27,958
I'll handle it up there.

1459
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:29,875
Sure thing. You can leave it to me.

1460
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:32,000
I can take them all down myself.

1461
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,291
If anyone crosses you,

1462
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,500
I'll kick their ass.

1463
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,125
That's how I roll. Okay?

1464
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:40,458
-See you, bro.
-Okay.

1465
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:41,458
Thank you.

1466
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,833
You've gained a lot of weight.

1467
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,208
Brilliant, I can hear the bass line.

1468
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,833
-It's time to move.
-Sure, bro.

1469
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:55,416
-Are you ready?
-Yes!

1470
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,541
If you're ready, meet me at the square.

1471
01:32:57,625 --> 01:32:58,875
Yes, Bastard!

1472
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:02,500
Oh shit! That stings my ears.

1473
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,166
Are you guys ready?

1474
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:06,583
Yes, we are.

1475
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:07,916
Let's do our best.

1476
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:09,833
Are you excited?

1477
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:11,000
Of course.

1478
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:12,666
My hands are shaking.

1479
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:13,958
Do it for Peng.

1480
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,000
-All right. Of course.
-We will.

1481
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,958
Let us hear the sound of Thailand!

1482
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:26,166
All right! Here's another song.

1483
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,250
Tos!

1484
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,333
Maew!

1485
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,708
Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

1486
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:40,458
-Hey.
-Hurry!

1487
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,000
Hey!

1488
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,166
Come on.

1489
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:08,208
Come what may, we're all macho men

1490
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,083
Come hell or high water
Wanna join?

1491
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:14,625
Real men are fighters
We're rough gangsters

1492
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:18,000
An eye for an eye
Wanna join?

1493
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,625
You are not going on the stage.

1494
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,083
Don't get your hopes up.

1495
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:40,833
You think you're something?

1496
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:44,666
They will bail me out tomorrow

1497
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:48,208
Do we have a deal? All right?

1498
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:50,958
OK, right? Fight, fight fight!

1499
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:54,250
Fight like a buffalo
Act like a macho dog

1500
01:34:56,416 --> 01:34:58,833
We already cleared things upstairs.

1501
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:03,041
Okay.

1502
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:07,666
Hey, Batt.

1503
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,458
How did you get out?

1504
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,166
My parents bailed me out.

1505
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,500
And you are here?
Your parents may be in trouble.

1506
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:20,208
It's their problem, not mine.

1507
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:26,041
I thought I was quite a bastard myself,
but you're worse.

1508
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:30,333
Tos...

1509
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,333
You got me stuck in jail.

1510
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:37,000
Fight, fight, fight, fight

1511
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:40,583
Fight like a buffalo
Act like a macho dog

1512
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:43,583
It's a shame you're born as a human
Fight, fight, fight

1513
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:46,125
Dragging your folks to hell
What's wrong is with you?

1514
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:50,500
Stupid as a buffalo
Fight, fight, fight

1515
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:53,666
Fight like a buffalo
Act like a macho dog

1516
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,083
It's a shame you're born as a human
Fight, fight, fight

1517
01:35:57,166 --> 01:36:00,291
Dragging your folks to hell
What's wrong is with you?

1518
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:04,291
Stupid as a buffalo

1519
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:08,083
Batt, finish them.

1520
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:20,416
Bring it on
We're bold

1521
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,000
We'll put on a show

1522
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:24,625
-Maew.
-Maew!

1523
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:30,500
A real man has dignity
That's a good word

1524
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:49,958
Lead your friends up there, Pang.

1525
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:02,708
Series!

1526
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:03,750
You bitch!

1527
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:08,416
Come here!

1528
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,166
You stinking slut.

1529
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Tan, wait for me upstairs.

1530
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,666
Why are you standing here?

1531
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:32,708
Take them!

1532
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,208
Guys, stand back.

1533
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,250
Peng!

1534
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,916
Peng!

1535
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:43,500
You bastards fight like cowards!

1536
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:45,416
He said we were cowards, Ting.

1537
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:47,958
Peng!

1538
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:49,000
Who cares?

1539
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,041
-Go get them!
-Peng.

1540
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,041
Maew, no!

1541
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:56,083
Maew, no!

1542
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,000
Get away!

1543
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:05,208
Ting.

1544
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:06,958
Fight with me.

1545
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,916
Hey, stop!

1546
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:22,083
Ting. Maew. Enough.

1547
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:23,666
This has nothing to do with you, Rung.

1548
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:25,250
It's between me...

1549
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:26,750
and Peng.

1550
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,750
Rung, stand back.

1551
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,625
Peng!

1552
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:30,458
You only live once
Do it wisely

1553
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,708
Do good and keep the ball rolling

1554
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:41,500
Cool or not. Let's give it a shot

1555
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:45,875
Awesome or not, we can prove it right here

1556
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:50,625
We bow to no one

1557
01:39:50,916 --> 01:39:54,958
Bring it on and see who the boss is

1558
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:58,458
No calling off, No backing down
We're bold and we're proud

1559
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:01,875
We fight to the end

1560
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:05,666
Oh, I thought you wouldn't come.

1561
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,291
How could I miss this?
I want to see his success.

1562
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:11,250
He's doing a lot better.

1563
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:16,458
Let our name be spoken
Since we are

1564
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:19,333
The short-pants gangsters.

1565
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:41,500
Cool or not. Let's give it a shot

1566
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:46,083
Awesome or not, we can prove it right here

1567
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:50,750
We bow to no one

1568
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Bring it on and see who the boss is

1569
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:59,041
No calling off, No backing down
We're bold and we're proud

1570
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:02,166
We fight to the end

1571
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:08,916
No bouncing, barge in
We live for fame

1572
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:16,416
Let our name be spoken, since we are

1573
01:41:16,958 --> 01:41:19,208
The short-pants gangsters

1574
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:35,625
Peng!

1575
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,541
Peng, fight him back.

1576
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:41,333
Peng!

1577
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:45,791
Why doesn't Peng fight back?

1578
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:47,250
He will. Hit him.

1579
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,875
Why aren't you hitting me back?

1580
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:51,000
Why?

1581
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:07,250
Peng!

1582
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:09,791
Ting, enough!

1583
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,875
Ting.

1584
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:14,291
You told on me so I'll be expelled?

1585
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:19,791
You're an amateur.

1586
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:32,833
Don't hurt Peng.

1587
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,458
You want this too?

1588
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,125
Are you not afraid?

1589
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:44,041
I didn't do it.

1590
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:45,750
I didn't do it.

1591
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,291
I didn't tell on you.

1592
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,208
I didn't tell on you.

1593
01:42:49,291 --> 01:42:50,541
-Let me go.
-I didn't do it.

1594
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:51,875
Let me go.

1595
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:53,083
Ting!

1596
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:55,708
Ting!

1597
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:58,208
Stop!

1598
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:00,458
I told you to stop!

1599
01:43:02,416 --> 01:43:04,708
Kunathip, you picked a fight again?

1600
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,750
I didn't do it, sir.

1601
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,250
Peng punched me, sir.

1602
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:11,041
I didn't do it!

1603
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:14,000
We don't want a gangster. You're out.

1604
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,375
If one day...

1605
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:43,625
I can't keep my promise...

1606
01:43:46,666 --> 01:43:47,791
Would you be mad at me?

1607
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:51,791
It depends on the reason
you break the promise.

1608
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,291
I only have you two.

1609
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:58,125
And I love both of you a lot.

1610
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:01,458
If you do something to protect yourself

1611
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:04,000
or the ones you love,

1612
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:06,791
and it doesn't put anyone in trouble,

1613
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:09,541
I won't be mad at you.

1614
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:39,291
Let me go.

1615
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,166
-I'll help Ting!
-Calm down.

1616
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:44,500
Ting!

1617
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,541
Ting!

1618
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:53,958
What do you want?

1619
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,291
Over there.

1620
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:14,708
Go get them!

1621
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:17,125
Go get them!

1622
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:20,666
Take him down.

1623
01:46:24,083 --> 01:46:25,166
Ting!

1624
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:27,916
Don't come near me.

1625
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:29,333
Oh, brother.

1626
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,416
Go!

1627
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:32,083
Don't come closer.

1628
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:34,291
Fight him back.

1629
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:35,500
Don't let him go.

1630
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,291
I'll call the police.

1631
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:41,666
-Get in there.
-Punch him!

1632
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:44,083
Come on!

1633
01:46:54,666 --> 01:46:56,375
Police!

1634
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:02,083
Let him go.

1635
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,958
The police are coming!

1636
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:11,958
Hurry up.

1637
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:18,416
Police!

1638
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,083
I have nothing to do with this, just him.

1639
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:34,208
Here we go again.

1640
01:47:34,625 --> 01:47:36,083
Spend a few months in the military camp.

1641
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:37,583
That'll make you behave.

1642
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,583
Love each other just like these two.

1643
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:45,250
You too.

1644
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:47,708
You are the police...

1645
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:50,833
Can't you talk nicely to civilians?

1646
01:47:53,916 --> 01:47:55,625
Peng, did you slap my head?

1647
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,208
It’s me. So?

1648
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,208
Got a problem?

1649
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:03,500
Damn boys.

1650
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:33,041
People always asked why
we stirred up gang fights.

1651
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:36,291
For the sake of winning. For dignity.

1652
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:39,166
For friends. For the name of school.

1653
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:43,166
I really don't know why we did that.

1654
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:48,875
They said we needed to
learn to love ourselves

1655
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:51,833
and care for the love of people around us.

1656
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:56,958
Recklessness. Impetus.

1657
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:59,500
That's what might happen
in our teenage days.

1658
01:49:00,583 --> 01:49:03,708
Someday, when we're mature
enough to understand it

1659
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:06,000
and know an answer to our question.

1660
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:11,125
After that fight, we were arrested

1661
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:13,625
and sent off to a boot camp.

1662
01:49:13,708 --> 01:49:16,375
We were trained for months to change
our attitudes and behavior.

1663
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,416
However, my story didn't end there.

1664
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:25,375
Ting and I still have one last fight.

1665
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:29,708
But this time it will be different.

1666
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:21,958
-...my girlfriend
-Cut

1667
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,666
Cut. Bad for your image.
Again.

1668
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Cut.

1669
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:39,125
Action!

1670
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,541
Why are you standing there?

1671
01:51:44,375 --> 01:51:45,833
Nothing to do with you, Rung.

1672
01:51:46,166 --> 01:51:49,291
It’s about me... and Ting. Ting?

1673
01:52:02,083 --> 01:52:03,166
-Action!
-So you didn’t get to see...

1674
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,333
-to see...
-Cut again.

1675
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:07,708
-So you didn’t get to see us...
-Action.

1676
01:52:08,583 --> 01:52:09,500
Didn’t get to see our concert.

1677
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:13,625
Sorry, sorry.

1678
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:17,500
I am satisfied. I am satisfied.

1679
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,125
Again.

1680
01:52:38,166 --> 01:52:39,583
Why can’t I?

1681
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:41,208
Action.

1682
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:49,166
Kiss on her cheek. Big breath in.

1683
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,500
Not put your face down like that.
Camera, ready.

1684
01:52:54,708 --> 01:52:55,750
Action.

1685
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:55,958
Oh, it’s raining.

01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:03,416
-Who is snoring?
-Raining.

1687
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:05,708
Hey, who is snoring? Wake him up.

1688
01:54:12,958 --> 01:54:15,000
Speaking of which, let me ask you.

1689
01:54:15,541 --> 01:54:16,500
Ma’am...

1690
01:54:17,375 --> 01:54:18,791
Is that a real Hermes?

1691
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:23,666
Just tell me if it’s fake.

1692
01:54:23,916 --> 01:54:26,833
Don’t try to evade.
Just wanna know.

1693
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,375
Wait. Let me do it again.
