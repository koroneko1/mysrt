&lrm;I told you from day one, Tikki,
&lrm;I'm a total klutz.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.540
&lrm;What's done is done.
&lrm;We can't change what happened.

&lrm;We can only move forward.
&lrm;Alya mustn't find out who you are.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.500
&lrm;You know how persistent she can be
&lrm;with her blog dedicated to Ladybug.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.820
&lrm;How do we get it back?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.260
&lrm;I'm not cut out for this Ladybug thing.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.060
&lrm;You are the chosen one, Marinette.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100
&lrm;It will all work out, trust me.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.540
&lrm;Everyone has a past
&lrm;they can learn from.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.340
&lrm;This'll show you why.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.380
&lrm;An exhibition on the pharaoh Tutankhamun?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.580
&lrm;What's that got to do with Alya?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.900
&lrm;Persuade Alya to go
&lrm;and make sure she brings the book.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.580
&lrm;Tell her you found out
&lrm;something about Ladybug.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.380
&lrm;-At the museum?
&lrm;-You'll see.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.020
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;how I'm gonna convince Alya

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.940
&lrm;to go to an Egyptian exhibit

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.820
&lrm;much less convince her
&lrm;that I'm not Ladybug.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.540
&lrm;She will be interested,
&lrm;and so will you. Promise.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.420
&lrm;[Alya] Can you believe it?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.380
&lrm;If I find out
&lrm;who this history book belongs to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.100
&lrm;and I figure out
&lrm;Ladybug's true identity.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.500
&lrm;I'm so on this one.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.300
&lrm;You think you can figure out
&lrm;who Ladybug is

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.700
&lrm;from a book
&lrm;every high-school student owns?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.020
&lrm;Yep, ours is the only school
&lrm;that uses that book

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.260
&lrm;[she yells]

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.940
&lrm;All I gotta do is find out
&lrm;which girl lost her book last week.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.100
&lrm;-There are 43, not counting me.
&lrm;-42...

&lrm;[she groans]

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.620
&lrm;Yesterday, somebody didn't have
&lrm;her textbook in class.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
&lrm;I left it at home.

&lrm;I'll only drop you
&lrm;from my investigation

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.940
&lrm;when you bring your book to class.

&lrm;It's not broken.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.900
&lrm;Hey, I'm OK too.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.460
&lrm;Thanks for asking.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.740
&lrm;[Jalil] I'm sorry.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.980
&lrm;You're in the same grade
&lrm;as Alix, right?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.660
&lrm;I'm her brother, Jalil Kubdel.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300
&lrm;You're into Tutankhamun too?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.700
&lrm;Doc!

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.220
&lrm;[sighs]
&lrm;Weird.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.940
&lrm;So, again, why are we here?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.140
&lrm;It has something to do
&lrm;with Ladybug?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.060
&lrm;-For reals?
&lrm;-Well...

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.700
&lrm;Yeah, it's over there.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.740

&lrm;What are the odds
&lrm;that we have the same textbook?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.660
&lrm;Maybe we go to the same school.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.500
&lrm;Wouldn't you know her then?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.020
&lrm;[chewing]
&lrm;Why bother yourself with ladies

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.780
&lrm;when you could be enjoying this?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.900
&lrm;Ladies smell far better
&lrm;than that cheese

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.620
&lrm;and they're better looking.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.260
&lrm;Suit yourself, your loss.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.900
&lrm;My only loss is my appetite.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.140
&lrm;Come on. Tell me what it is.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.740
&lrm;No, cuz it wouldn't be
&lrm;a surprise then...

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.020
&lrm;To you or me.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.140
&lrm;[Jalil] I'm telling you, father,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.540
&lrm;it's in the hieroglyphics.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.780
&lrm;Excuse me.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.180
&lrm;There, as you know,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.260
&lrm;the one with the sceptre is
&lrm;Tutankhamun 1.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.580
&lrm;Opposite, is Nefertiti, his princess,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.620
&lrm;with 100 mummies beside them.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.340
&lrm;She died before him.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.900
&lrm;The Sun God, Ra,
&lrm;took her as his Goddess.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.420
&lrm;Yes, I know all that.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.980
&lrm;I'm the director
&lrm;of this exhibition, remember?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.700
&lrm;Then you know Tutankhamun wanted
&lrm;to bring her back to life

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.780
&lrm;by offering the Sun God a new wife.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.100
&lrm;This illustrates a ritual he devised.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.740
&lrm;Nobody has ever deciphered it,
&lrm;but I have!

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.380
&lrm;It's a magic chant
&lrm;to recite to complete the ritual.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.700
&lrm;I'm sure of it!

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.700
&lrm;He reminds me of someone else
&lrm;with crazy ideas...

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.980
&lrm;You!

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.860
&lrm;You might think
&lrm;my Ladybug theories are crazy

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.340
&lrm;but you watch, I'll prove you wrong.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.140
&lrm;Jalil, frescoes like these are
&lrm;often illustrations of a legend.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.380
&lrm;They call it a legend for a reason.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.980
&lrm;That's what everyone thinks
&lrm;but I know it's real.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.220
&lrm;I can prove it.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.100
&lrm;Really?
&lrm;How are you going to do that?

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.660
&lrm;I need to get my hands on
&lrm;Tutankhamun's sceptre

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.060
&lrm;and recite the spell.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.380
&lrm;Are you serious?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.980
&lrm;Don't even think of touching it.
&lrm;I'd lose my job on the spot.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.940
&lrm;It's a priceless, historical object,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.180
&lrm;not a toy.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.100
&lrm;Dad, we have to try out the spell.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
&lrm;What if he had found out
&lrm;how to bring people back to life?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.100
&lrm;Jalil, that's enough.
&lrm;Get your head out of those scrolls,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.540
&lrm;and focus on the real world...
&lrm;this one.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.540
&lrm;There's nothing wrong
&lrm;with living out a fantasy,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.420
&lrm;especially when
&lrm;I can make it a reality.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.660
&lrm;Fly away, my evil Akuma,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.700
&lrm;and transform that young man.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.780
&lrm;[confused sigh]

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.940
&lrm;[she squeals]
&lrm;Put that down.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.780
&lrm;I'll show you what
&lrm;I found out about Ladybug.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.260
&lrm;About time.
&lrm;This better be blog worthy.

&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.940
&lrm;I have endowed you
&lrm;with the power of the ancient gods.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.420
&lrm;You must do me a favour
&lrm;in return for this gift.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.020
&lrm;My precious Nefertiti
&lrm;will come back to life

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.300
&lrm;This thing's making my eyes hurt.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.780
&lrm;Look closely. It is in there...

&lrm;I'm here before
&lrm;Ladybug or Cat Noir. It's insane.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.620
&lrm;I love the face changes.
&lrm;They'd suit you.

&lrm;Look at Ladybug go.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.780
&lrm;If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.980
&lrm;Ladybug waved at me. No way.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.700
&lrm;[Ladybug screams]

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.660
&lrm;Sekhmet, give me your strength!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.100
&lrm;How nice of you
&lrm;to hold the door open.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.300
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Enjoy your coffin.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.940
&lrm;This is crazy. Keep your eyes peeled.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.140
&lrm;Hiya.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.460
&lrm;[Pharaoh] Your face...

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.540
&lrm;Fate has placed you on my path.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.820
&lrm;Come with me!

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.100
&lrm;Hey, hands off the threads.
&lrm;I can walk myself.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.060
&lrm;Seriously?

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.100
&lrm;[she groans]

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.260
&lrm;[Marinette] Let her go.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.420
&lrm;Hiding behind an innocent bystander?

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.180
&lrm;-You're weak.
&lrm;-I'm more powerful than you.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.060
&lrm;Don't forget all the latest
&lrm;behind the scenes are on my blog.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.140
&lrm;That Alya is one brave chick.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.100
&lrm;If by brave you mean
&lrm;bossy, feisty, and bold,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.780
&lrm;yep, that's her.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.060
&lrm;Come on, get us outta here, Cat Noir.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.660
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.700
&lrm;[clunking]

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.540
&lrm;How are we going to find them?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.420
&lrm;Alya's live stream on her blog.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.620
<i>&lrm;Hi, Alya here,</i>

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.060
<i>&lrm;live blogging from the shoulder</i>
<i>&lrm;of a terrifying villain.</i>

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.460
<i>&lrm;Huge scoop to come.</i>

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620
&lrm;Go ahead.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.580
&lrm;I'll join you when
&lrm;my Miraculous is charged up.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.100
&lrm;Hurry, It'll take both of us
&lrm;to defeat him.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420
&lrm;Hey.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.180
&lrm;On to the next phase.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.540
&lrm;Anubis, bring me mummies!

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.340
&lrm;[mummies groan]

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.380
&lrm;Soon, we will be together again,
&lrm;my Nefertiti, my long lost love.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.500
&lrm;This'll be a major scoop.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.260
&lrm;Excuse me, Pharaoh,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.700
&lrm;but what exactly is going on?

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.340
&lrm;I'm going to carry out the sacred spell,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.900
&lrm;to bring Nefertiti back.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.980
&lrm;Oh... gotcha.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.140
&lrm;You mean the spell on the papyrus?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.220
&lrm;Correct. The 100 mummies
&lrm;and the offering.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.500
&lrm;What offering?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.420
&lrm;To persuade the sun god Ra
&lrm;to give me back my sweet princess.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.180
&lrm;I must give a pure soul in return.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.460
&lrm;Dude, that's hard to come by.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.180
&lrm;I've already found her.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.180
&lrm;You look so much like her.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.140
&lrm;Say what?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.860
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.940
&lrm;Hold on, Alya.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.140
&lrm;[she yells]

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.380
&lrm;Oh no, I ran right into
&lrm;one of those time bubbles.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.620
&lrm;[slow motion]
&lrm;I've got to get out of this.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.980
&lrm;Ladybug, this is Alya.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.900
&lrm;I'm the sacrificial offering
&lrm;for the Sun God.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.940
<i>&lrm;Please hurry.</i>

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.460
&lrm;Hold on, Alya.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.780
&lrm;[slow motion]
&lrm;I'm nearly there.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.060
&lrm;[Plagg] Do you really think

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.460
&lrm;this mumbo jumbo with the sun
&lrm;and mummies is gonna work?

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.700
&lrm;[Plagg burps]

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.100
&lrm;You have no respect.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.980
&lrm;Your batteries are charged enough.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.820
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.700
&lrm;Thanks for waiting.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.460
&lrm;No problem.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.460
&lrm;We must find the Akuma and free it
&lrm;before he sacrifices her.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.380
&lrm;I can't see her or Pharaoh.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.820
&lrm;Over there.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.380
&lrm;[Alya struggles]

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.980
&lrm;Hey, back up.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.420
&lrm;Who's that goddess chick
&lrm;with black spots on your papyrus?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.180
&lrm;Ladybug, my sworn enemy.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.660
&lrm;My nemesis kept me from carrying out
&lrm;my ritual 5000 years ago,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.340
&lrm;but she won't stop Nefertiti
&lrm;from coming back to me this time.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.300
&lrm;Did you say Ladybug
&lrm;5000 years ago?

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.340
&lrm;Everyone does have a past
&lrm;they can learn from.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.900
&lrm;Well, you don't look a day over 3000.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.420
&lrm;Now you know why
&lrm;I'm so much wiser than you.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.860
&lrm;Oh sacred Ra,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.260
&lrm;God of the Sun,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.420
&lrm;I, Pharaoh, offer to thee,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.660
&lrm;a pure soul,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.460
&lrm;This sacrifice
&lrm;for the return of Nefertiti.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.740
&lrm;I bow to you

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.660
&lrm;and present this gift with my mummies.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.940
&lrm;We pray to you the safe return
&lrm;of Princess Nefertiti.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.380
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti!

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.980
&lrm;Awaken!

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.900
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti!

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.260
&lrm;Awaken!

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.740
&lrm;Awaken Nefertiti.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.820
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.100
&lrm;We must save her.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.700
&lrm;If he completes the ritual
&lrm;Alya will be gone, forever.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.140
&lrm;What should we do?

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.180
&lrm;Hold back the mummies.
&lrm;I'll take on the Pharaoh.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.660
&lrm;Why do I have to deal with them
&lrm;while you go calmly around the back?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.420
&lrm;I'm the only one
&lrm;who can capture his Akuma.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.140
&lrm;And you're the bravest.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.420
&lrm;Sure.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.820
&lrm;I'll just pretend you really think that.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.060
&lrm;[chanting]
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.260
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.740
&lrm;Awaken, Nefertiti. Awaken.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.660
&lrm;Hey, you bunch of bandages.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.820
&lrm;Shall we wrap this up?

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.900
&lrm;Cat Noir!

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.700
&lrm;Seize him!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.820
&lrm;Is that really as fast as you can go?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.460
&lrm;[mummies groan]

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.780
&lrm;Wait, this looks like a trap!

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.860
&lrm;Gotcha.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.340
&lrm;Horus, give me your wings!

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.700
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.780
&lrm;[bleep]
&lrm;Peeps, you've just witnessed

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.540
&lrm;another feat from Ladybug.
&lrm;Thanks for saving me.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.420
&lrm;Oh, you're welcome,
&lrm;but it's not over yet, not until...

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.900
&lrm;Not until Ladybug destroys
&lrm;the pendant with the Akuma,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.060
&lrm;and turns everything back to normal.
&lrm;I pay attention.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.940
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;The pendant... Good eye.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.300
&lrm;[Ayla screams]

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.860

&lrm;[sigh of relief]

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.300
&lrm;Way to go, Ladybug!

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.780
&lrm;No!

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.220
&lrm;You're not going to win
&lrm;this time, Ladybug!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.900
&lrm;Help me, Ladybug!

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.500
&lrm;Crush that insect!

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.180
&lrm;[Alya yells]

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.180
&lrm;What the...

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.020
&lrm;Cat Noir, this way.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.980
&lrm;[Cat Noir giggles]

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.420
&lrm;We have to save Alya before
&lrm;she reaches the circle of darkness.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.420
&lrm;[Pharaoh] You won't stop me

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.380
&lrm;from bringing Nefertiti back.
&lrm;I'll finish you.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.460
&lrm;Anubis, bring me mummies!

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.900
&lrm;Horus, give me your wings!

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.380
&lrm;[yelling]

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.140
&lrm;[Pharaoh cackles]
&lrm;[Ladybug screams]

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.340
&lrm;Cat Noir, the pendant.
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.260
&lrm;Sekhmet, give me your strength!

&lrm;Ladybug, save me!

&lrm;Ra, God of the Sun,

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.660
&lrm;accept this humble offering
&lrm;and return the princess to me!

&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.860
&lrm;A Ladybug outfit?

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.540
&lrm;That's our last hope?

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.300
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.540
&lrm;This offering isn't good enough
&lrm;for Nefertiti.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.660
&lrm;Hey, thanks a lot.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.460
&lrm;Too late, Ladybug,
&lrm;the ritual has begun.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.380
&lrm;Set Alya free
&lrm;and sacrifice me instead.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.660
&lrm;Wouldn't that be the sweetest
&lrm;revenge 5000 years later?

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.940
&lrm;I'm the one who kept
&lrm;Nefertiti from you all these years.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.580
&lrm;It's true that you'd make
&lrm;a much more precious offering

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.460
&lrm;than this mortal.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.540
&lrm;Horus, give me wings!

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.900
&lrm;Seriously?

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.140
&lrm;Excuse you, but I make
&lrm;excellent sacrificing material.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.980
&lrm;Take her Miraculous, the earrings!

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.940
&lrm;You win, Pharaoh.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.220
&lrm;You want my Miraculous?

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.260
&lrm;-Go get it.
&lrm;-Get it!

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.340
&lrm;[tinkling]
&lrm;A toy?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.740
&lrm;You tricked me!

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.980
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.300
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.020
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.140
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.460
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.580
&lrm;What happened?

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.220
&lrm;Thanks, Ladybug,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.540
&lrm;but I still gotta ask
&lrm;how old are you really?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.060
&lrm;Much older than a high-school
&lrm;student, that's for sure.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.860
&lrm;Don't you wanna know
&lrm;how old I am?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.780
&lrm;In a sec, it looks like

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.460
&lrm;I'll find out for myself.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.620
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.060
&lrm;[Alya giggles]

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.100
&lrm;[Alya] Where have you been?

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.020
&lrm;You won't believe this,
&lrm;I got mummified.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.620
&lrm;Hope you weren't trying
&lrm;to swap me for Nefertiti. Creepy.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.940
&lrm;What? You were almost sacrificed?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.140
&lrm;Without you, I'd never have found out

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.060
&lrm;that Ladybug's 5000 years old.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.940
&lrm;Hey, what are friends for?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.060
&lrm;[Alya] I still don't get it.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.780
&lrm;Why did she have
&lrm;a 10th-grade history book?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.740
&lrm;[hesitantly]
&lrm;She... She probably had to find out

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.580
&lrm;what's been going on
&lrm;for the past 50 centuries.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.180
&lrm;You're probably right.
&lrm;It's tough staying in the loop.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.060
&lrm;Hey, Ladybug's textbook, it's gone.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.420
&lrm;[Marinette giggles]

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.540
&lrm;You might have gotten away this time
&lrm;but I assure you, Ladybug,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.140
&lrm;someday, wherever you are,
&lrm;I will have your Miraculous,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.500
&lrm;and you'll be nothing,
&lrm;nothing at all!

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.580
&lrm;I don't get it.
&lrm;I know I'm not 5000 years old.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.740
&lrm;So who exactly was
&lrm;that Ladybug in the papyrus?

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.700
&lrm;Kwamis like me and superheroes
&lrm;like you have always existed.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.820
&lrm;So that wasn't you
&lrm;on the papyrus, either?

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.660
&lrm;-What do you think?
&lrm;-You don't look 5000 years old.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.340
&lrm;[Tikki chuckles]
&lrm;Well, I'm not. I'm older than that.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.580
&lrm;I'm the Kwami who has watched over
&lrm;every Ladybug since the beginning.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.420
&lrm;You must have known much less klutzy
&lrm;Ladybugs than me, right?

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.300
&lrm;Every Ladybug is different.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.260
&lrm;[sadly]
&lrm;Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.980
&lrm;Marinette, you are different,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.860
&lrm;but different as in surprising,
&lrm;unpredictable and endearing,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.540
&lrm;and very talented.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.380
&lrm;-You learn fast.
&lrm;-Really?

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.180
&lrm;Yes.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.300
&lrm;[they giggle]

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.260
<i>&lrm;You'd better get to sleep.</i>
<i>&lrm;You have that history test tomorrow.</i>

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.220
<i>&lrm;Oh yeah,</i>
<i>&lrm;good thing it's on Ancient Egypt.</i>

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.780
