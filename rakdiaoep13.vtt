00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You come here.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Dao!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
You need to sit here and wait for Mor Kung.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
She is our mom's favorite fortune teller

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
she's not a PM. We don't have to wait for her here.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.000
I know that but our mom asked us

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
to take a really good care of her.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Mor Kung flew all the way from Chiang Mai

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
to give you a session here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So you need to wait for her here. Right here.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
And I need to use the bathroom.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
How could I wait here by myself? If Suttirak saw me here,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
he'd have told me that I'm too superstitious.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Please don't come out when Mor Kung's here. I don't want to hear him roasting.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You see me and you're stunned like this? Don't tell me that you're missing me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's nonsense.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Nonsense how?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I forgot. Hello, Mr. House Owner.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hey, I greeted you already. You shoud say hi back.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.000
It's the simplest polite way to do .

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Hello, please go inside.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Wait. Is there something going on? Why did you ask me to go inside?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Nothing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I think there is. It's said that liars would avoid an eye contact.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let see if you avoid an eye contact with me.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.400
Why do you take so long? It should take a few minutes to know.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Know that you love me?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Are you alright?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.600
I'm alright.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Don't be alarmed. It's just my magic fireworks.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's to alert bad things from the house to leave already.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh my! You scared me.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I don't know who he is

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but I know that you should be friend with him

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
because he instantly hold you when the fireworks started.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.000
He is ready to protect you anywhere and anytime.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Where should we start the psychic session. Here or inside?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let's go inside. Why don't you go inside

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.000
and I'll follow you.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.000
Okay.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You invited her to look for your soulmate?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.000
How did you know?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Because I'm there. In your heart.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Well, it's not that hard. If you invite a fortune teller here, it must be about good luck.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But if you invite her to your house, then it must be something about your soulmate.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Wait. He can read my mind?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
What are you looking at? I can explain.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.000
You want to be in a relationship that bad?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.000
Can you stop roasting and listen to me?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
My mom had a dream that I was about to die the other day.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
She was worried that she wouldn't have a chance to hold a grandchild.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So she asked Mor Kung to come here and read my prophecy about my soulmate.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I see. You can ask her to leave already.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Because your soulmate is standing right here.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Can you stop messing with me for one second? I'm not that superstitious.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I didn't say that you were.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I don't want you to call me out like my lucky shirt incident.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Why're you smiling?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I'm glad that you care about my opinion.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I'm not. I don't want to look like a fool who makes the same mistake twice.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Wait.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Can I ask you honestly? Are you gonna believe the fortune teller?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
About how your soulmate would look like?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Well, if she sees the vision, then I need to listen to her, don't I?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.000
Why? You're afraid that you're gonna be a heartbroken if I'm dating someone?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Wow! You're speechless?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You were playing with me first now I'm getting back.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.000
Don't be sad. If I found my soulmate, she could introduce a friend to you.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.600
Okay?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Stop making that face. I know it's hard for ugly people like you.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I want to know who's gonna be a soulmate for someone like him.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.000
I told you to bring her inside.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.000
Why did she come inside all by herself?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's totally fine.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm afraid you're gonna take something.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Why does your face look gloomy like that?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Really? What should I do?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You could use my cream.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's a draw. You want to extend this match?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.500
Nope.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Diao / Yeah?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.000
Can I have your hands? / Sure.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So you two won't stop messing with me?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.000
I'm not gonna stand it anymore.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Well, we missed you. We haven't seen you in a long time / Really?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Kidding.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Just kidding / Come here, sit down. Give me your hands.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Hands. Focus.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
From my vision. Your soulmate'd be

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
One, someone close to you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Two, they'll wear blue top when you two first meet.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.600
What next?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Three, you two will meet by accident.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Hey, when you choose a motorbike taxi,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you need to choose the speedy one so you could be in accident.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.000
This is not worth it. I could be dead just to meet my soulmate? Not a chance.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's not like that. The accident could be

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.000
small one. Like bump into each other, stepping on one's feet, bumping one's head.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Or like you stepped on to dog's poops and they pulled you out of it. Something like that.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.000
Then you should consider stepping into dog's poops,

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:28.000
so someone could pull you out of it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Stop talking.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Four, when it's time, you'll receive a heart.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Can I ask something?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
About the heart

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.000
what kind of heart? Like chicken's heart? Or pork's heart?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It could be anything just in a shape of heart.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Five, they'll return something that you love but you lost it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is tough. How could he find his soulmate?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Do you think my mom could still be alive to see his grandchild?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Can you change the prophecy to be simpler and easier to find one?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Dao / Yeah?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
If you want me to say what you want not what I see,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I don't have to come all the way here.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
We could just talk on the phone.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
How could you find your soulmate?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Someone close to you. Wear blue top.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.000
Meet by an accident. Giving you a heart when it's time.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And return your lost item.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Who the hell is your soulmate?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So his soulmate needs to have all of these five items?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.000
That's right / It's too much.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Can you ask her if two items are enough?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I tried and she didn't respond well.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
She asked me what the hell I wanted.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So everyone

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.000
if you found a girl wearing blue top coming to this café, please let me know.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I'm gonna push Diao until he falls so she could help him up.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But Mor Kung said that it should be an accident, not intention.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Rak? Good timing. If you're going to the office,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and you see a girl wearing blue top, can I ask you something?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.000
Can you push her into Diao? So it'd look like an accident.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So she said that Diao and his soulmate're gonna meet by accident?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
That's right and she needs to wear blue top.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
When it's time, she's gonna give him a heart.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.000
More importantly,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:17.000
she's gonna return his lost item.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
That's right.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.000
Hold up everyone.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You all talk about my personal stuffs like it was yours.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Well, he needs to know all the details,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.000
so he could help you find your soulmate, right? / That's right.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Please. I asked you. Please help him.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So my mom will be satisfied.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.000
If I could have a child for her, then I would. But I couldn't.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Or we could try, maybe I could have a child.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Hey / You're in the way of my customers.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We can't do it here.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Please. That's enough.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Sorry.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We're gonna plan something in case we find a girl in blue top,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
so we can make it look like love accident.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Let's go. Have a seat.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Are you gonna find a soulmate like the fortune teller told you to?

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.000
Of course I am.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You want me to look for a dog?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It's hard enough to find a woman with similar personality as your mom,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.000
now you have to find a girl including 5 specific choices.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Don't you think this is a mission impossible?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's easier to conquer Mt. Everest.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Don't you get the concept of a soulmate?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
A soulmate will meet me eventually.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And she'd follow the prophecy.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Ouch / Hey.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm sorry.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Hello? It's not this café? Where is it?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Blue dress.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Meet by an accident.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Diao's soulmate.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
That's right / For sure.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Why are you still standing? Go on and hit on her.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.000
Maybe she's your soulmate like the prophecy.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.500
Go. Go. Go.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I don't think so. She just happened to wear a blue dress.

00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:15.000
We just met and she's not someone close to me.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.000
Maybe she used to be in the same kindergarten with you.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
If she used to be in the same kindergarten with me in Chiang Mai,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.000
she would have spoken in Northern dialect already.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.000
You think your face shows that you're from Chiang Mai?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.000
Go on, hit on her already.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
If she really likes you,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.000
maybe she could be the one bringing you a heart.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.000
Mor Kung just met me in the morning and that lady bumped into me in the afternoon?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Anything could happen.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
My fortune teller told me about Noi, after that I met her in less than an hour.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
You did?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.000
Stop asking and go ask her out already.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
The fortune teller is so good. I need to ask for her contact.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
He still looks for the lady?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Who am I to mess with his business?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
It's because of you, you couldn't keep up with her.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.000
She was completed two choices already. How are we gonna find someone like her?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.000
If you meet her again, you need to go straight up to her.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
If you don't know how, you can ask Rak for tips. You got it?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Please help him.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.600
Sure.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Hello / Hello what?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Dao asked me to help you flirt with girls

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
No need to. I could do it.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Can you try to hit on me?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Why do I need to flirt with you?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
You can't flirt?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Sure I can.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Is this yours? It's not?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I thought it was yours.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
See? You could start a conversation like this.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Here. You can have it.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I agreed with Dao, you were too slow.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
If I were you and she completed two choices, I'd drag her to my room already.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.000
Wow!

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Good thing that you don't listen to her. She is too slutty. Move.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
But I believe you

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.000
If the blue-top lady is really your soulmate, you're gonna meet her again.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.500
I'm sure.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Did you know that Diao found his soulmate already?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
But don't be sad

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
because you already found your soulmate too.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Your soulmate is wearing a pink dress.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
If you feel bad for her, you can always pray for her.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Are you waiting for a girl in blue top?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
This is an office. It should be safe. It shouldn't be any accidents happen.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I think you should wait by the road.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Diao?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.500
Yeah?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I'm sorry that I bumped into you yesterday. I was in a hurry so I didn't apologize properly.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I'm sorry again.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
That's alright.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
How did you know that I work here?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I asked from a man in café. He said that you work here.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
She just bumped into him and she brought a bouquet to apologize? Could she feel something?

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.000
I don't think so. She's flirty.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Like me. I'd do the same.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Manow!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
She brought you flowers, why don't you take her out for coffee?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Suttirak wouldn't mind.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Can I go?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Go ahead.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I can't help it. I'm charming just like that.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Do you need to be somewhere?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
If you don't, can I buy you a cup of coffee?

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.000
Sure.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Good. Please wait for me.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
See?I told you I could flirt.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Let's go. Let's have coffee.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
We should celebrate. Diao has a girlfriend.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.600
Come on in.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You called for me? What's up?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Don't tell me that you want to know about my date.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Nope, I want to discuss about work.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Good. I thought you wanted to know about my coffee date with Tangmay.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
You should keep in mind that when you take a girl out for a cup of coffee,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
you need to bring her to the most quiet spot,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
or her focus would be on someone else, not you.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And two, you can't let the girl order coffee at the counter by herself.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
You need to take her to the table and ask what'd she like to drink.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Then you order it for her. That's another way to treat her.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
That's all from me. I don't want to speak too much.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.600
What about work?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I'd like to you revise..

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:54.000
One more thing. Tangmay completed four choices already.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I forgot that this is a workplace.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
You can tell me if you want. I can make an exception.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.000
You want to know about this?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
You want to tell me about her or not.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Tangmay is someone close to me for sure.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
She's from Chiang Mai and she went to my kindergarten.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
What a coincidence!

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Not a coincidence, this is a fate.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Do you want to date her that bad?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Not yet. There is one thing that I still couldn't find in her.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
If she brought me my lost item, then I could think about that.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Wait, so she was checked only three choices.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Bumped into you, wore blue top, someone close to you.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
She hasn't given you any heart shape item yet.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Who told you that? Take a look right here.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Look at this. Her flower shop's name card. It's a heart shape.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Let's get back to work.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I want you to revise Songkran's promotional banner.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
You need to change the heart in this plate to look like this.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Just changing this? You could have sent me a message.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It just didn't give you the mood.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
You could have misunderstood me over the text.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And thinking that I sent you a heart for love.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:24.000
You don’t have to worry about that because all I can think of right now is Tangmay.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
She's in my heart already.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
That's all for the work.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Daisy, you chose the wrong time to get sick.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Diao found a soulmate who completed four choices already.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
He's about to find wedding date tomorrow.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
You're exaggerating it. There's one more thing to complete.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
You don't have to be such a perfectionist, keep it for work only.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.000
This is fate. You don't need it to be perfect.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
If I were you and he completed just one, then I'd have married him already.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Okay, fine. Let's talk later. Bye.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
You're worse than Manow. She said that she would be down to marry the man if two choices were completed.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And you took only just one?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Half of it would be fine too.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Half of it!

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I have slippers at home. Why didn't you wear it?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.500
This way.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
You should prepare a wedding suit already.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Because Tangmay completed the prophecy already.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
She found my lost item?

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.000
That's right. Show him.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I found this bracelet. Dao said it's yours.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
That's right! I've been looking for it for months. Where did you find it?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
It was on the ground by a tree at Uncle Jod's café.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.000
Well, she completed the prophecy already.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
That's right. Our mom's dream will come true now.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
You meet your soulmate.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.000
I'm happy for you.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
You look so dapper.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Are you going out on a date or waiting for me to ask you out?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
I'm going out with a girl. Why would I want to waste my energy with you?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
You could try. I can treat you better.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Wait.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I don't mean to pry. Even the prophecy is completed,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
if you don't have the vibe, you shouldn't force it. Or you'll end up unhappy.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Thanks for reminding me.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I agreed to go on a date with Tangmay,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
because I followed your advice.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
You forgot about this?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I still remember when you cooked me steamed eggs.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You told me that people could find a connection and like each other after a conversation.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
So I'll go out with her to find out.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You're right.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
If you don't want me to go, you can try to stop me.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
How could I try to stop you?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
You could try.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
You're speechless? You should sharpen your wit already.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
When I come back from a date, you can fight me back.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Hello, Diao.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.000
Hello, are you here for Dao?

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.000
That's right.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Hello / Hello.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Love Note : Chapter 10. The truth

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
When there's an obstacle in any relationships,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
many times it starts from miscommunication.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
A person could hurt one another unintentionally,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
because they don't know about the other's feeling.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Don't you feel anything that I need to go out with someone my parents set me up with?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Of course I do. But what could I do?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
If you don't want me to go, then you should have stopped me.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Can you not go? You know how I feel about you.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
What do you feel about me?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
I love you.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
That's all I want to hear.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
After you / Okay.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Thank you for bringing me here for brownie.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
No problem at all.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
You have brownie here everyday?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.600
That's right.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
If you like it,

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.000
I can recommend you a place with good brownie. I could take you there.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.600
Sure.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Are you alright? You seem quieter than the first time we met.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Nothing. I'm just tired after a big meal.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I see.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
You said you wanted to use a bathroom? It's over there.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I'm gonna order brownie for you.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Thank you.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Dao's profile?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Is everything okay? Don't let Diao find out about this set up.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Dao!

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Please help me.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
What? / Please help me.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
What happened?

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.000
Tangmay called to tell me that I was caught already.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.700
About what?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
About…

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.000
About you tricked me to think that Tangmay is my soulmate according to the prophecy.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.600
Come out here. Now.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
You're well-planned about this.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Tangmay, you were smart about everything but you forget to hide the text I sent you?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Don't tell me that you made up about mom's dream either.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.000
I didn't make that up. She really had that dream.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:03.000
Mom sent Mor Kung to be here and her prophecy is real.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I just invited Tangmay to pretend to follow the prophecy.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
This is too much.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
But she really has a crush on you.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
What about my bracelet? She didn't find it at Uncle Jod's tree?

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.000
Nope. I found it under your bed.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Tangmay, you shouldn't fail at this or I could have had a sister-in-law already.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I talked to her and I didn't feel any spark.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
But you're crossing the line this time.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Please help me.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
But you did cross the line

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
to fool him about this.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
But it made sense, you did all of this just to make your mom happy.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I think you should forgive your sister.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Please. I'm sorry.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
I really am sorry.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Think about it. There're too many conditions to find your soulmate.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
I think you should date Tangmay already.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Whether I find my soulmate, I won't accept this kind of set up like this.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Fine.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Dao is just too much.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Why're you smiling?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Dao really crossed the line this time.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Please calm down. Hey, I can play you a song.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Let's sit down.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Sit here.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
This is my pin. Why did you have it?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
It's yours?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
That's right. I marked something on the back. It's surely mine.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
You see?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Why did you have it?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
I found it in Chiang Mai two years ago.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Hello, Job? I'm in Chiang Mai already.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
You're done?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Can you take me around town?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Sure, where's Angkaew Reservoir?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Where did I drop it?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
It's just a pin. Let it go.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
It was specially made just for me. There's only one of it in this world.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
I knew that! But your chance to be absent in this class has only one left.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
If you're late, you can't take the exam for sure. Come on.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Come on.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Fine.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
You're son of a bitch!

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I'm glad that you found it. I thought I'd lose it forever.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
This is such a small world.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
When I first met him, I met him by accident.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
He wore a blue shirt.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
He works with me.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
He rents my place.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
He's someone close to me.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And he just gave me a heart yesterday.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I want you to revise Songkran's promotional banner.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
You need to change the heart in this plate to look like this.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
He returned my lost item.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Is he really my soulmate?

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
What is it?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
You?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Nothing.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Wait.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Guys, I've had a dream about Pom from sales department for several times now.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.000
Does it mean that I like him?

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:32.000
Is there other way to check if he really likes me beside find him in my dream?

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.000
It's easy. When you're close to someone, your heart will beat like this.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Then you like them for sure.
