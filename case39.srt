1
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,981
( crickets chirping )

2
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,482
( dog barking )

3
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,907
( stairs creaking )

4
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,577
( door opening )

5
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,005
I can see you.

6
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,718
JAVIER: ...pull into
this gas station,
the guy was like,

7
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,511
"Yo, man,
you got problems."

8
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,054
Like, "What the hell
do you think
I pulled in here for?"

9
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:59,393
So your car broke down
on the way to your blood check.

10
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,354
Yeah, smoke,
everything.

11
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,148
I'm willing to give you the
benefit of the doubt, Javier,

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,317
but a judge won't.

13
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,737
I missed a couple
of meetings?

14
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,989
What's the problem?
I mean, I don't even know

15
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,033
what I'm doing here.
You're here because your son

16
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,910
has gotten into fights
every day at school,

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,787
and the last one sent
one of his classmates
to the hospital.

18
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,581
Juanita came here
for help voluntarily

19
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,000
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,711
that's what
you're doing here.

21
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,922
He's on a
dangerous road.

22
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:31,800
Your history, all the violence,
all the anger,

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,345
that's his future
unless you break the cycle.

24
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,764
I heard you, Mrs. Lynch.

25
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,766
( over phone ): You're
trying to steal my boy!

26
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,434
No one is trying
to steal your child.

27
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,310
Then what are you trying...
They found bruises

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,771
and cigarette burns...
I told you,

29
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,773
he was playing
with some sparklers.

30
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,608
Mrs. Lynch, I read
the medical report.

31
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,610
I don't wanna talk about it
I want a lawyer.

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,403
If you feel that you need
legal representation

33
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,530
that's perfectly
within your rights...

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,450
I don't need your help,
in no case. You've already
interfered enough.

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,743
You... Hello?

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,118
( dial tone beeps )

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,831
How many active
cases you got?

38
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,583
Thirty-eight.

39
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,251
Okay.

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,629
Wayne, come on!

41
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,089
Look, I'm buried here.

42
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,173
I'm sorry, Em,
we all are.

43
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,175
(people chattering )

44
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,600
( sighing )

45
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,544
ANSWERING MACHINE: You have
three new voice messages.

46
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,795
Hi.

47
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,714
( beeping )

48
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,759
Hey, it's Suze, missed you
at yoga the other day,
give me a call.

49
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,387
Hey, Em, it's Jackie.
Just checking in,
hope you're good.

50
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,142
DOUG: Exhausted,
her career path
questionable,

51
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,728
her faith in
mankind shaken,

52
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,772
she resisted her tendency
toward introspection

53
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,776
and decides to go
have a drink with her
charming friend Doug.

54
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,985
(people chattering )

55
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,529
I am so in your head.
Be honest.

56
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,616
The whole psychology
thing, it's just about
scoring chicks, isn't it?

57
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,868
Regrettably, yes.
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,203
Two.

59
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,497
Well, what are we
gonna drink to tonight?

60
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,708
The never-ending
fun of a career
in public service?

61
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,627
Yeah.

62
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,964
You know,
I sit there talking
to these families,

63
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,007
the authority
on everything.

64
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,845
And I have these moments
where I think I might
be totally full of it.

65
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,098
Everybody's
full of it.

66
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,682
In the end you're
a number to call

67
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,185
for people who don't
have anyone else.

68
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,395
There's no way
that's bad.

69
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:20,028
Anyway, I've done
some soul searching

70
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,863
and I just want to say

71
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,117
that if a full-on
relationship feels like
too much right now,

72
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,620
I'd be willing to
consider a purely
physical one.

73
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,541
What?
Nothing.

74
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,127
What, you might actually
enjoy yourself.

75
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,045
Yeah, yeah,
I probably would.

76
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,255
( laughs )

77
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,757
It's just...

78
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,384
I know, I know,
the job,

79
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,638
you get home, no time
for anybody else. Whatever.

80
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,183
Listen, I'm giving you a month.
Okay? One month.

81
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,433
And then?

82
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,060
I don't know.

83
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,437
Probably give you
another month, but that is it.

84
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,565
Except for two more,
then, it's over.

85
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,451
If it were
anyone...

86
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,348
What are they
doing to you?

87
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,207
( dog barking )

88
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,541
( children laughing )

89
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,655
What?

90
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,075
Emily Jenkins.
Child Services?

91
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,826
We spoke
on the phone?

92
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,578
You said the 17th.

93
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,996
It's the 17th.

94
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,206
Is not.

95
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,125
I'm sorry,
but it is.

96
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,964
Monday the 17th.
The day of our
appointment.

97
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,160
Hi.

98
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,497
Come down,
I'd like to meet you.

99
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,889
My name's Emily.
What's yours?

100
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,810
Lily.

101
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,519
That's a pretty name.

102
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,108
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

103
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,612
So, when are you
expecting your
husband back?

104
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,907
Because we've found
that it's better

105
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,370
when the whole family
participates.

106
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,538
Well, he's not
here, so...

107
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,415
Do you have some way
of contacting him?

108
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,001
Not if I don't
know where he is.

109
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,543
( electric whirring )

110
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,380
EMILY: Is that...

111
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,717
Would you mind
asking him to
join us, please?

112
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,303
He doesn't have
anything to say.

113
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,888
Will you ask
him, please?

114
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,313
MARGARET: Edward.

115
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,773
That lady is here
from the state.
She wants to talk to you.

116
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,567
EDWARD: I don't have
anything to say,
tell her that!

117
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,987
I told her already,
she wants to anyway.

118
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,322
( clanging )

119
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,076
( whispers ):
It'll be okay.

120
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,452
( door opening )

121
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,666
( inaudible )

122
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,464
Hi, I'm Emily.

123
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,469
Okay.

124
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,222
I'm here because
we received a call

125
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,393
that Lilith
is showing serious
signs of neglect.

126
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,228
Now at this point
we can only assume

127
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,064
it's the result
of family problems.

128
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,945
( inaudible )

129
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,414
Eddie says
we don't have
family problems.

130
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,292
Well, many families
won't realize that
they're having problems

131
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,587
until it's too late.
And that's where
we come in.

132
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,547
We help families
communicate

133
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,883
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict.

134
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,478
Eddie says we don't
need your help.

135
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,521
Mr. Sullivan,
is there a reason

136
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,815
why you won't speak
to me directly?

137
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:56,156
Is there a reason why
your husband won't
speak to me directly?

138
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,284
( stamping foot )

139
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,291
Eddie doesn't like
speaking out of anger.

140
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,352
There's no laws
against being
weird, Em.

141
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,521
I didn't say weird,
I said scary.

142
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,231
That man sat there
staring at me
the whole time,

143
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,817
and the mother is
his emotional slave.

144
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,736
Wait, you didn't just fly
to New York and meet
with my parents, did you?

145
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,614
Wayne?

146
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,074
( sighs ): All right.
All right. Are there
any cuts, any bruises,

147
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,076
any signs she's
being abused?

148
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,664
No, not physically.
But this girl's in
trouble, I can feel it.

149
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,998
You wanna know
what I can feel?

150
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,458
The lawsuit we're
gonna get hit with

151
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,126
if we violate
her parents' rights

152
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,212
without any evidence
they've done
something wrong.

153
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,839
All right, Wayne.
You put these
files on my desk

154
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,633
and you ask me
to tell you
what's going on.

155
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,717
I've told you,
I've done my job,

156
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,887
what you do
with it is yours.

157
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,180
( stutters )

158
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,285
We're not
perfect parents,
we know that,

159
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,246
but we figure
if they know how
much you love them

160
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,416
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself.

161
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,673
She knows how
we feel about her.

162
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,926
So, tell me,
Mr. Sullivan,

163
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,470
since you've suddenly
acquired the
ability to speak,

164
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,681
doesn't it concern
you a little

165
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,476
that Lily's grades have
dropped from A's to D's
in three months?

166
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,937
Of course it does,
she's our daughter.

167
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,815
So you have no idea why
your daughter falls asleep
in class every day?

168
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,694
Why she can't sleep
at home? No idea?

169
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,283
Bad dreams maybe?

170
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,246
Don't tell me you're buying
this whole "daddy's
little girl" routine?

171
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,290
Look, they're not
my favorite people
either, okay?

172
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,584
But we can't
guarantee every kid
a happy childhood.

173
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,001
I wish we could.

174
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,254
Let me talk to her.
She wants to talk.
Alone.

175
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,005
Em, we do not
have a case.

176
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,924
Just five minutes, okay?

177
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,927
Talk to them about
how much they love kids.

178
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,561
( children laughing )

179
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,772
Hey, girls,
slow down!

180
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,859
I used to wish
I had a sister when
I was growing up.

181
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,570
To play with
and to talk to

182
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,614
about all those
things that you
just can't tell

183
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,491
anybody else,
you know?

184
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,744
Did you ever wish that?
That you had a sister?

185
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
( gasps )

186
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,295
( giggling )

187
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,589
( grunts )

188
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,883
Well, that was
a silly thing to do,
wasn't it?

189
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,430
What's happening
with you?

190
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,064
You know I can help.
Let me help you.

191
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,943
What is it,
sweetheart?

192
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,241
They hate me.

193
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,161
I'm sure they
don't hate you.

194
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,955
They do.
I hear them.

195
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:40,630
They go into the
cellar and talk.

196
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,841
What do they
talk about?

197
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,096
Sending me
to hell.

198
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,267
You heard
them say that?

199
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,312
( recorder clicks )

200
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,319
You can tell him.
He's on your side.
It's okay.

201
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,660
Lily, did you hear
your parents say they
were gonna hurt you?

202
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,767
( elevator dings )

203
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,711
I was just thinking
about you, got a nice letter
from Sandy Hutchinson.

204
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,133
Well, well, well.

205
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,803
It's sitting right in
front of me, which means
our good friend Wayne

206
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,764
has decided it fails
to meet the criteria
for child endangerment

207
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,475
and has told you in
no uncertain terms
to leave it alone.

208
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,728
Surprise, surprise.
I'm sorry, Emily. I can't.

209
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,856
Please, Mike,
I'm really
desperate here.

210
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,359
( typing )

211
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,031
Emily.

212
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,995
Now, you know how
dear to my heart
the work you do is,

213
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,916
but the department doesn't
pay me to stake out
potential child abusers.

214
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,084
Last time almost
cost me my job.

215
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,921
This little girl heard
her parents say

216
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,590
they're going to
send her to hell.

217
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,134
Sickening as that is,

218
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,596
you're a part of the
system that deals with
those situations, I'm not.

219
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,974
Mmm-hmm. But sometimes
the system doesn't work.

220
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,309
Well, maybe you
should just let it.

221
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,104
Wow. Feel like
I'm talking
to Wayne here.

222
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,774
All right. You don't
want to get involved,
that's fine,

223
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,068
but don't bullshit me,
Mike, I'm running out
of people I respect.

224
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,028
Okay. No bullshit.
Bring me evidence

225
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,866
of a crime,
I'm all over it.
Till then...

226
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,916
( Edward panting )

227
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,135
( school bell ringing )

228
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,637
( children chattering )

229
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,024
BOY: Let's go,
hurry up!

230
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,234
Lily! Lily!

231
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,822
( Emily exclaims )

232
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:57,869
Hi. I came to
tell you I hadn't
forgotten about you.

233
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,914
I'm doing
everything I can.

234
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:07,169
If I disappear
will you come
look for me?

235
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,049
You're not
going to disappear.

236
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,341
If I do?

237
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,177
( school bus honking )

238
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,515
I have to go.
They get mad at me
when I miss the bus.

239
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,395
Lily, wait. Wait.

240
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,568
Here. It's my
home number.

241
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,532
If you get scared,
I want you to
call me, okay?

242
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,661
I'm gonna get you out
of there, I promise.

243
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,706
Okay.

244
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,511
( phone ringing )

245
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,935
Hey, this is Doug,
here it comes.

246
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,561
( beeping )

247
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,899
Hey, it's me,
thought you might
be awake.

248
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:14,278
Just calling 'cause...

249
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,156
Well, I don't really
know why I'm calling.

250
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,618
Call me if you
get this, okay?

251
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,497
...proposal in
Morton Township
has some residents...

252
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,958
MAN: Here we go
golfers and shoppers...

253
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,918
Let's look at
the crepe batter.

254
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,461
In order to make
the crepe batter...

255
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,754
( hip-hop music playing )

256
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,089
( phone ringing )

257
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,886
Too late, I met
someone else.

258
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,304
LILITH: Emily.

259
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,059
Lily? Are you okay?

260
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,393
I'm scared.

261
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,479
Why, honey?
Why are you scared?

262
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,984
( crying ): They're
waiting to get me,
I can hear them.

263
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,401
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,029
Why are you sorry?

265
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,864
( sighing ):
I'm falling asleep.

266
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,365
Okay, listen.

267
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,160
Go over and open
the window.
Can you do that?

268
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,452
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,955
Lily? Lily?

270
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,929
( tires screeching )

271
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,726
( phone beeping )

272
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,733
( door creaking )

273
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,000
( phone ringing )

274
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,217
( over phone ): Yeah, Barron.
Mike, it's Emily.

275
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,802
That girl that I told you
about, I think she's
in a lot of trouble.

276
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,222
Emily, you're going...
No, I know what you said.

277
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,640
Mike, you're not
listening! Help me!

278
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,171
( screaming )

279
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,811
( muffled screams )

280
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,324
What are we
doing here, Emily?

281
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,575
Saving her life!

282
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,035
They're asleep
like we should be.

283
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,411
They're not asleep.

284
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
( muffled screaming ):
Did you hear that?

285
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,706
I didn't hear
anything.

286
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,251
Leave her alone!

287
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,711
No!

288
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,301
LILITH ( screaming ):
Let me out!

289
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,094
( grunting )

290
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,428
( screaming )

291
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,680
Did you hear that?

292
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,140
Police, open up!

293
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,476
Stop!

294
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,898
Break, break it down.
Break it down!

295
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,711
Help me. Help me.

296
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,507
BARRON: Police!
Lily!

297
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,302
( muffled screams )

298
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,058
Lily!

299
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,188
God!
Oh, my God!

300
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,606
LILITH: No! Help me!

301
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,986
Please, help me.

302
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,369
I got you,
I got you, I got...

303
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,541
( grunting )

304
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,213
( Emily shushing )

305
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,851
( Barron sighing )

306
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,353
( Lilith sobbing )

307
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,896
Okay. I got you.

308
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,439
What the hell's
the matter
with you people?

309
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,983
( Lilith sobbing )
EMILY: I got you.

310
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:12,285
( shushing ):
It's okay, honey.
I got you.

311
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,204
It's okay.
I got you.

312
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,622
( brething heavily )

313
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,875
JUDGE: The egregiousness
of the crime makes

314
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,669
the competency question
all the more relevant.

315
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,715
I hereby order the
defendants to undergo
psychiatric evaluation

316
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,635
to determine their
fitness for trial.

317
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,346
Steal a pizza,
San Quentin.

318
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,723
Try to kill your kid,
Freudian dream analysis.

319
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,559
You're gonna hate me
for saying this but
my money's on crazy.

320
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,477
What kind of people
put their kid
in an oven?

321
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,522
Bad people.
Remember that when
people were just bad?

322
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:46,068
Before everything
had a diagnosis
and a justification?

323
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,694
It's human nature.

324
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,412
What's the most
important thing

325
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,039
that we talked
about that you have
to remember?

326
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,419
It's not my fault
what happened.

327
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,047
That's right.
You know what?
It's not.

328
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,720
( whispers ): Good.
I'll see you soon.

329
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,183
Hey.
Hi.

330
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,561
That is some seriously
proactive social work
happening there.

331
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,398
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

332
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,733
How's she doing?
Typical reaction.

333
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,198
But she blames herself.
We'll get there.

334
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,327
I'm gonna put her in
a group setting, see if
I can get her to open up.

335
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:40,747
Group therapy for kids,
when am I going to
get used to that?

336
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,418
See you later. Okay.
See you.

337
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,752
Hi.

338
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:53,386
Good news. They say
you can get out
of here tomorrow.

339
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,182
Doug said I might
have to go
to a state home.

340
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:03,603
Yeah, but it's only
temporary, till we
find you a nice family.

341
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,484
Why can't I
live with you?

342
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,903
Sweetheart, that would
never be allowed.

343
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,363
Why?

344
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,408
Well, it's complicated,

345
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,950
I mean, there's this
whole process,

346
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,287
and I'm not even
a foster parent.
So...

347
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,043
It'll be fine.

348
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,639
Hi, Barb.
Hi, Em. Right this
way, little lady.

349
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,313
I'll check in,
in a couple
of days, okay?

350
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,654
I don't want to
stay here, I want to
live with you.

351
00:26:56,407 --> 00:27:00,286
Please.
I'll be good.

352
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,955
Lily, it's impossible,
I told you.

353
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,377
Will you try?

354
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,796
Honey, listen,

355
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,258
even if they said yes,
it would never work.

356
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:18,845
I work all day
and I'm hardly
ever home and...

357
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,767
I'm sorry,
I'm just not
mom material.

358
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,687
How do you know if
you've never tried?

359
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,291
EMILY: So, it's just
until we can find the
right family for her,

360
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,627
just until we can
place her in a
really good home.

361
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,795
You know you'd
have to give up
the case,

362
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,589
conflict of
interests and all.

363
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,257
Yeah.

364
00:27:55,257 --> 00:28:00,387
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you doing this?

365
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,974
What Lily needs right
now is a safe,
supportive environment

366
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,809
with someone
she trusts.

367
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,229
The system can't
provide that for her,
I think that I can.

368
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,191
Better than anyone,
given my training.

369
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,152
We spend so much of
our time negotiating
red tape,

370
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:19,323
I think if we look
at this situation,
this one situation,

371
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:23,661
this one child,
it's clear what's
best for her.

372
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,627
How long till
Foster Services can place
her in a permanent home?

373
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,255
Three weeks, three months,
it's hard to predict.

374
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,469
( children chattering )

375
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,103
No more visits.

376
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,649
What?
They said yes.

377
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,030
It's your
new beginning.

378
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:07,787
Okay. It's what I
like to think of as a
glass-half-full situation.

379
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,959
Bathroom.
Kitchen. Fish.

380
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,463
And this is your room.

381
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,801
Be okay?

382
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,604
You live alone?

383
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,938
Just me.

384
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,608
Just us.

385
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,989
What's this?

386
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,450
It's chamomile.

387
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,159
Helps me sleep.

388
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,875
You know none
of this should
ever have happened.

389
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,336
If I could make it
go away, I would.

390
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,005
You did.

391
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,182
Here. Climb in.

392
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,022
Night night.

393
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,070
( door closing )

394
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,053
( gasps )

395
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,347
( sighs )

396
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,395
Okay. All right.
Here we go.

397
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,314
Just got to grab
some of her things.

398
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,024
Okay.

399
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,858
So, here's the key.

400
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,152
You're not coming?

401
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,154
I got 15 other
places I got to be.

402
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,991
So make sure you
lock it on the way
out. Okay? Bye.

403
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,675
( door creaks )

404
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,810
( door creaking )

405
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,667
( alarm ringing )

406
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,002
( sighs )

407
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:40,519
The kids at school
are saying all this
stuff like saying

408
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,396
my mother is a puta

409
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,860
and I mean, I know
we can't go back home

410
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,363
but I miss it.

411
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,992
Sometimes when
our parents aren't
getting along,

412
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,703
it's better if they
spend some time apart.

413
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,873
That's what
a restraining
order does.

414
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,624
She's starting
to come out
of her shell.

415
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,960
It's good,
but you got to
expect some hiccups.

416
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,379
And you can't undo
10 years of trauma
in six weeks.

417
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,006
School? Too soon?

418
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,132
No, I don't have
a problem with
her going back,

419
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,427
just as long as she's
comfortable with it.

420
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,932
I went by the house.
I think her mom
and dad were

421
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,018
barricading themselves
in their room at night.

422
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,728
How sick is that?

423
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,938
Well, fear and hatred
are part of the same
pathology.

424
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,899
LILITH: See you. Bye, Diego.
GIRL: You too, Lily.

425
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,483
Oh! But I forgot.
DIEGO: Bye.

426
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,777
LILITH: Bye.
You don't think
they're crazy.

427
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,988
Well, I'm coming around.

428
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,787
I love you.

429
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,039
Love you, too.

430
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,623
( school bell ringing )

431
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,214
Wayne's looking for you.
Okay.

432
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,596
Wayne wants to see you.
Yeah, I got it.

433
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,897
What's up with Diego?

434
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:11,359
Oh, hey.
Look, why don't we
go talk in my office.

435
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,820
No, tell me
what's going on.

436
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,699
Well, we don't...
We don't know why yet

437
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,620
but he killed both
his parents last night.

438
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,960
( chattering on police radio )

439
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,170
Excuse me... Go ahead.
BARRON: Officer,
let her through.

440
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,634
What happened?

441
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,220
Gets a tire iron
from the garage,
comes back inside,

442
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,143
locks all the doors
and windows,

443
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,062
and kills them
in their sleep.

444
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,028
"Slaughters" would
be a better word.

445
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,948
( sighs )

446
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,662
Oh, my God!

447
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,960
( gasps )

448
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,555
A 10-year-old did this?
There's no way.

449
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,057
I was there
when they
brought him in.

450
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,018
Took three guys
to subdue him.

451
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,477
And the kid was
climbing the walls.

452
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,729
( barking )

453
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,773
Man's best friend, huh?

454
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,737
( cell door buzzing )

455
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,876
( crying )

456
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,962
What happened?
Tell me what
happened.

457
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,048
I killed
my mom and dad.

458
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,183
Every family
you sit down with,

459
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,769
every day of every week,
it's a family in crisis.

460
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,566
Those are your odds.
Well, that's your job,
trying to beat them.

461
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,026
( sighing )

462
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,945
( sobbing )

463
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,489
You're one
person, Em.

464
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,783
You can't
save the world.

465
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,248
I know somebody
you did save.

466
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,920
Yeah.

467
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,549
You okay?

468
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,051
Yeah.

469
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,469
It's just work.
Don't worry.

470
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,390
I think you have
a hard job.

471
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,725
So do I.

472
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,978
People have kids
and then they decide

473
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,147
they don't want
to be parents.

474
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,692
And then the kids
grow up thinking
it's their fault.

475
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,487
Is that what
your parents did?

476
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,282
You said
you were alone.

477
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,203
Yeah.

478
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,373
I never met my dad.

479
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,587
And my mom...
My mom had problems.

480
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,505
She must have
scared you.

481
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,716
Why do you say that?

482
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,594
You don't like
to talk about it.

483
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,432
You're a clever
little girl.

484
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,281
Sweetheart.
Breakfast.

485
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,367
What you got?

486
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,171
Let me see.

487
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,429
You went through
my things?

488
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:14,602
I'm sorry. I wanted
to know about you.

489
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,488
Is that your mother?

490
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,781
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,742
What happened to her?

492
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,455
She died when I was
about your age.

493
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,959
How?

494
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,418
An accident.

495
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,512
It was raining
and she was
driving too fast.

496
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,850
We had an accident.

497
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,771
Are you mad at me?

498
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,693
No, I'm not
mad at you.

499
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,904
But I need you
not to do that
again, okay?

500
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,948
Go through my private
things without asking.

501
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,785
Okay? All right.

502
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,789
Omelet's getting cold.
Better hurry.

503
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,554
( people chattering )

504
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,558
You watch, six months,
their lawyer
will hire an expert

505
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,187
to say they're rehabbed
and they'll sue for
custody when they get out.

506
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,231
She's not going
back there.

507
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,109
I'll take her out
of the state before I
let them near her again.

508
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,319
Didn't hear
you say that.

509
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,282
You guys okay?

510
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,408
Mmm-hmm.

511
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,035
We're great.
She's sweet,

512
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,037
very intuitive
about everything.

513
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,336
You wanted to talk
about something?

514
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,504
We pulled the Ramirezes'
phone records.

515
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,091
There was a call
that night
before the murder.

516
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,342
From who?

517
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:12,137
The call came from
your house, Emily.

518
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,512
What?

519
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,931
I'm not accusing
you of anything,

520
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,266
I just want to
know what was said.

521
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,393
But that's impossible.

522
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,979
I mean, I might have called
them the week before
or something, but I...

523
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,149
I'm talking to you
as a friend, you
know that, right?

524
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,192
Mike, did you
not hear me?

525
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,238
As a friend, I'm telling
you that I didn't
call that family.

526
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,244
He's in my group.

527
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,957
Why, did
something happen?

528
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,795
We're trying to
figure out why.

529
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,798
Diego got a call
from here, last
Thursday night.

530
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,092
I'm just wondering
if he might
have said something.

531
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,635
That wasn't me.

532
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,012
You didn't call him?

533
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,142
Lily, it's difficult
sometimes to tell
the truth,

534
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,644
but I know you will
because you're
a good kid.

535
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,147
I am telling the truth.

536
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:08,276
My backup files
are in the cabinet.
Diego's is in there.

537
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:13,198
Maybe you got curious
and went through some,
dialed a number?

538
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,451
It wasn't me,
I swear.

539
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:20,372
The call came at 2:00 a.m.
You ever up that late?

540
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,747
I didn't call him.

541
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,291
You ever up that late?

542
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,503
Mike, she said no.
Maybe somebody
made a mistake.

543
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,422
Yeah, maybe so.

544
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:40,308
Why would Diego do this?
He loved his mom and dad.

545
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,061
You never want to
think anyone you know

546
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,313
is capable of
that kind of thing.

547
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:49,317
In your mind, it's always
some nameless,
faceless creature.

548
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,322
Sometimes, the city
seems full of them.

549
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,409
But they're just people,
like you and me.

550
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,662
She's lying.

551
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,877
( gasps )

552
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,962
Do you believe me?

553
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,798
I believe you.

554
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,806
I need to ask you
something about the
night it happened.

555
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,976
Did you get a call?
Really late?

556
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,940
You didn't.

557
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,860
Diego, I know
that you did.

558
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,115
The call came
from my house.

559
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,411
( gasping )

560
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,745
What's the matter?

561
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,080
( choking )

562
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,749
What's scaring you?
Diego.

563
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,336
It's okay,
it's all right.
Deep breaths,

564
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,712
deep breaths,
you'll be all right.

565
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,507
Can we get some
help in here, please?

566
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,430
( beeping, door closing )

567
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,816
Who called you?
Was it Lily?

568
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,904
Did she say
something to you?

569
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,864
Something
that scared you?

570
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,702
El dijo.
"El dijo"?

571
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,706
What do you mean,
"He said"?

572
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,876
Era un hombre.

573
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,337
It was a man?

574
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,783
( chair squeaking )

575
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,252
Do you

576
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:17,089
like working here?

577
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,843
Well, photocopying
isn't much fun.

578
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,847
What?
Knock, knock.

579
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,349
Sorry I'm late, guys.

580
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,393
You ready to go, kiddo?

581
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,270
So, how's school?

582
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,231
Fine.

583
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,316
Any of your classmates
giving you a hard time?

584
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,943
No, they've been nice.

585
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,780
You sleeping okay?

586
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,868
That's not really what
you want to talk about,
is it, Doug?

587
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,328
You got me.

588
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:54,085
Question 16, am I
afraid of the dark?
You answered no.

589
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:59,507
Question 23, am I
afraid of being alone?
You answered no.

590
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,926
26, am I afraid
of my parents? No.

591
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,762
You answered no
to everything
in that section.

592
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,765
I think that some of those
should have been yeses.

593
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,393
Everybody is
scared of something.

594
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,437
Working through our fears,
conquering them,

595
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:14,272
is how we get better.

596
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,984
So, I want you
to tell me,
what scares you?

597
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:26,825
I'll tell you what
scares me if you tell
me what scares you.

598
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,330
( laughs ):
Fair enough.

599
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,168
When I was a kid,
I was climbing a tree,

600
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,046
and I accidentally put
my hand through a giant
hornets' nest.

601
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,341
And they didn't
like it. I was stung
over a hundred times.

602
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,720
They had to rush
me to the hospital.

603
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,347
Been afraid of
hornets ever since.

604
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,560
I don't climb
many trees either.

605
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,188
Everybody has fears.
Now, what scares you?

606
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,149
Me.

607
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,900
You scare yourself?

608
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,152
Sometimes.

609
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,238
Why? What about
yourself scares you?

610
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,159
I have bad thoughts.

611
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,786
About what?

612
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,120
People.

613
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,332
People in general
or certain people?

614
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,750
Certain people.

615
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,752
Like who?
You.

616
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,047
You have bad
thoughts about me?

617
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,425
Why?

618
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,802
( scoffing ): I just do.

619
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:31,432
Did I do something
or say something
that upset you?

620
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:35,311
It's just the
way you are.

621
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,896
How am I?

622
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,484
Facile.

623
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,402
Facile?

624
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,570
( laughs )

625
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,447
Do you even know
what that means?

626
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:51,160
Easily comprehended.
Often lacking
sincerity or depth.

627
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,911
You're smug, too.

628
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,208
Want me to tell
you what that means?

629
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,918
If I seemed smug
or facile I want to...

630
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,838
( laughs ):
Don't apologize.

631
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,631
Why not?

632
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:08,093
You're a grown-up.
It's embarrassing.

633
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:22,441
Number 12, I worry
about what's going
to happen.

634
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,984
Yes or no?

635
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,362
You want me
to answer that?

636
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,364
Yes or no?

637
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,824
No.

638
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,452
That should be a yes.

639
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,752
Should we talk
about school now?

640
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,421
My grades are
getting a lot better.

641
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:54,766
I talked to a lot of kids,
I don't think I've ever
felt like that before.

642
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,141
Like what?

643
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,061
( sighs ): Threatened.

644
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,438
( elevator dings )

645
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,863
I know a specialist,
I'm gonna call
him in the morning.

646
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,287
( chair squeaking )

647
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,949
Are you mad at me?

648
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:56,577
No. No,
I'm just tired.

649
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,246
Want me to
brush your hair?

650
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,332
No, thanks.

651
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,167
Are you sure?

652
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,836
Some other time.

653
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:08,255
It will make you
feel better.
I'll get the brush.

654
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,215
I said no,
thank you.

655
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,934
Doug said something,
didn't he?

656
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:27,065
Doug? No. Doug says
you're doing great.

657
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,986
What did he tell you?

658
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:31,320
Nothing.

659
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,425
( phone ringing )

660
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,854
Hello.

661
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,397
( static over phone )

662
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,824
Try again, sorry.

663
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,514
( phone ringing )

664
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,064
( hornet buzzing )

665
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,400
( exclaims in pain )

666
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,278
( buzzing )

667
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,613
( exclaims in pain )

668
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,229
( flushing )

669
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,821
( water running )

670
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,365
( sighs )

671
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,664
( buzzing )

672
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:48,874
( shouts )

673
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,208
( grunting )

674
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,295
( panting )

675
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,051
( buzzing )

676
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,054
(screaming )

677
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,057
( hornets buzzing )

678
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,769
( screaming )

679
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,147
( grunting )

680
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,697
( panting )

681
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,499
( flushing )

682
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,759
( hornets buzzing )

683
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,443
( panting )

684
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,652
( high-pitched buzzing )

685
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,154
( screaming )

686
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,506
( screaming )

687
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,063
( bone snapping )

688
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,391
PRIEST: For as much
as it hath pleased
Almighty God,

689
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,728
of his great mercy,
to take unto
himself the soul

690
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,689
of our dear brother,
here departed,

691
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:02,400
we, therefore,
commit his body
to the ground.

692
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,239
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust,

693
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:12,911
in sure and certain
hope of the resurrection
to eternal life,

694
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,998
through our Lord,
Jesus Christ, amen.

695
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,591
( Emily crying )

696
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:51,950
You think it's my
fault, don't you?

697
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,339
It's no one's fault.
It was an accident.

698
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,521
BARRON: There was
no sign of forced entry,

699
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,732
he was alone
and the doors
were locked.

700
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,403
I know he didn't
kill himself.
He was scared.

701
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:30,948
He came out of that
room with her, Mike,
and he was scared.

702
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,657
He said she
threatened him.

703
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,035
Emily, you're in shock,
let's not get carried away.

704
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,705
Diego, he said it was
a man on the phone.

705
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,374
There was no one
else in the house.

706
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,667
Do you think I don't know
how crazy this sounds?

707
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,461
Kid in that state of mind
is not the most
reliable witness.

708
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,049
But why was he in
that state of mind?
Why was Doug?

709
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,678
Pull my phone records.
See if she called him.

710
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,556
I already did, Emily.
There was no call.

711
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:01,353
So, you're saying that
you've seen this before,

712
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,898
someone just
dying like that?

713
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,775
Truly?

714
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,279
I'm shocked
every day by the violence
people do to themselves.

715
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:15,993
Her mom and dad had
deadbolts on their
bedroom door, big ones.

716
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,373
Something came
through that door,
and whatever it was,

717
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:24,876
they didn't want it
ever coming through
there again.

718
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,048
Hey guys, come on,
are you ready?

719
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,716
Yeah.

720
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,885
WOMAN: Let's get to it?
MAN: Yeah.

721
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,485
( elevator bell dings )

722
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:05,501
MALE INTERVIEWER: Take me
through the conversation,
Margaret, about the oven.

723
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:08,420
Eddie said,
"We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

724
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,339
So it was
Edward's idea?

725
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:12,883
Just the oven part,
we both wanted her dead.

726
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,512
Why did you say that it
was God's will that you
should kill your daughter?

727
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:17,762
( chuckles )

728
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,972
Why is that funny,
Margaret?

729
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,598
'Cause she's
not my daughter.

730
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,185
You think your
daughter is the devil?

731
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,769
Evil incarnate?

732
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,688
I don't care
what you call it.

733
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,358
But you have stated
that she kills people?

734
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,778
Not by her own hand,
they just die.

735
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,613
I had two brothers,

736
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,327
Eddie had
three sisters.

737
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:44,706
( crying): Soon as
she was born, they
just started dying.

738
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,379
Me and Eddie, I guess,

739
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,260
she couldn't get rid
of us until she found
somebody else.

740
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,527
MAN: The nurse on duty
heard screaming,

741
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:17,322
found Mrs. Sullivan
on the floor clawing
at her own skin,

742
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,158
absolutely convinced
she was on fire.

743
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,165
( Margaret gasping )

744
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,586
( crying )

745
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:33,922
In no condition
for visitors
as you can see.

746
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:38,051
If you'd like,
I can let you
see Mr. Sullivan.

747
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,344
Okay.

748
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,266
( gasps )

749
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,953
I know I'm probably
the last person you
want to see right now,

750
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:10,000
but you're the only
one that I can talk to.

751
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,376
Who died?

752
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,548
A friend.
You're scared.

753
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,551
You ought to be.

754
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,847
Is she...

755
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:30,604
What is she?
I can tell you
what she's not.

756
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,982
She's not a daughter of mine.
She's not a 10-year-old
having trouble in school.

757
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,901
And she's not some
innocent victim whose
door you busted down

758
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,987
and life you saved.

759
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:42,115
She's not going
anywhere soon, lady.

760
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,242
Not till she's good
and done with you.

761
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,412
Done with me how?
However she wants.

762
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,500
You think it's an accident
her ending up with you?

763
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,211
She saw you
coming a mile away.

764
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:58,340
Why me? I don't
have anything.

765
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,509
You have that
you're good.

766
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:03,428
Kindness. Decency.
That's what
she feeds on.

767
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:07,558
Bleeds you dry,
moves on to the next.

768
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:09,893
We were a big family,

769
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,563
she went through us
like a wrecking ball.

770
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:16,650
It's like she
sees everything.

771
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:21,279
And what she
doesn't see,
she senses.

772
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,825
Like when you call
a friend and they pick
it up before it rings?

773
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,119
( chuckles ):
They say
when you're born

774
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,830
you're given
your eternal soul.

775
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,418
The part of you that
lives on, lives again.

776
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:39,256
Whatever evil she is,
didn't come from us.

777
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,174
It was already there.

778
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,720
From the moment she
came into being, she brought
something with her.

779
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,222
Something older,
destructive.

780
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,808
Soul of a demon.

781
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,816
What does she want?

782
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:03,029
To know what your
idea of hell is

783
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,200
and make you
live there.

784
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,539
( lock clicking )

785
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,042
( school bus stopping )

786
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,631
( door opening )

787
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,599
Hi.
Hi.

788
01:04:55,891 --> 01:05:00,146
You weren't there
so I took the bus.

789
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,066
Sorry, work,
I lost track of time.

790
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,654
It's okay,
I know how busy you are.

791
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:15,036
Doesn't matter anyway,
the bus stops right at
the end of the street.

792
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:20,041
So I can always get home,
whether you're there or not.

793
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,376
Lucky.

794
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,964
Where's the phone?

795
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,093
It wasn't working, so...

796
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:41,563
Wow. That one, too.

797
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,613
We had gym today.
I'm gonna have a shower.

798
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,869
Are they being
nice to her?

799
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,120
Who?

800
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,538
My mother.

801
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,626
How would I know that?

802
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,796
I thought you said
you were going to see her.

803
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,759
I never said that.

804
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,176
Hmm.

805
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,222
I must have dreamt it.

806
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,325
EMILY: Nancy.

807
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,410
Emily.

808
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,623
I'm so sorry about Doug.
I know you two were close.

809
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:44,083
Do you have a minute?

810
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,044
I was just wondering
if you've had any luck

811
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,130
finding a place for Lilith?

812
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,634
Still looking.
You know, more kids
than homes right now.

813
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,928
So, how long
you think we're
talking here? Like...

814
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,306
Honestly,
she's not my
first priority.

815
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:01,142
She's in a safe environment
with someone who
understands her needs.

816
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,560
Nancy,

817
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,733
if there's anything that
you could do to expedite

818
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,276
the process...

819
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,111
Are you serious?

820
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,824
Emily, you petitioned
for custody, you got it.

821
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:18,535
She's your
responsibility.
Make it work.

822
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:23,498
How?
How do I make it work
if it's not working?

823
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:27,878
With the same coping
skills you teach these
moms and dads every week!

824
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:31,631
Walk the talk, Emily!
Walk the talk!

825
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,967
( therapist speaking
indistinctly )

826
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,308
See you next time.
Good work.

827
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,101
( children chattering )

828
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,031
( inaudible )

829
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,508
GIRL: Why is she hurting...

830
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:19,512
Hey, wait a minute.
Who do you think you are,
barging in there like that?

831
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,182
It's okay, Diane,
Emily's been under
a lot of stress lately,

832
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:28,688
but she's really nice
to me and I hope I can
stay with her a long time.

833
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,815
Don't ever do that again.

834
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,360
LILITH: See you
next week, Diane.

835
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,780
Don't worry,
it was all a
misunderstanding.

836
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:45,455
You're not
going back there.

837
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,665
Why, Emily?

838
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:55,632
Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

839
01:08:55,632 --> 01:09:00,887
Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

840
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:05,642
Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

841
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:09,479
( shouting ): Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?
Why, Emily? Why, Emily?

842
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,272
( elevator stopping )
Why, Emily?

843
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,821
Can I go back to
group next week?

844
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,076
You're never
going back there!

845
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,162
Are you sure?

846
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:28,832
( elevator cables creaking )

847
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,211
No. No.

848
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,590
( screams )

849
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,425
( alarm beeping )

850
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,096
( screaming )

851
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,104
( elevator bell dinging )

852
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:20,050
WOMAN 1: I know.
WOMAN 2: You were
terrific back there.

853
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,510
MAN: Really enjoyed
the service, Father.
PRIEST: Thanks.

854
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,345
Mike.

855
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,473
Emily.

856
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,854
They are not crazy,
Mike. Her parents.

857
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,605
They're right about her.

858
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,984
You want to wind up
where they are?
Keep talking like this.

859
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,444
Emily, you're
grieving for Doug

860
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:43,364
and you're still
confused about
what Diego did.

861
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,201
Aren't you?
Diego grew up
in a bad home,

862
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,995
he saw violence,
he repeated it,
that's the cycle.

863
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,329
You know that
better than anyone.

864
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,665
Why did she lie
about calling him?

865
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,334
Because she's a liar,
but that doesn't mean
she made him do it.

866
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,587
Let me tell you
what Lily is.

867
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:02,717
She's a damaged child,
she's a deceitful child,
she's a manipulative child.

868
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,387
But a damaged,
deceitful, manipulative
child is not a demon.

869
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,347
You think I'm crazy.

870
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:15,063
You believe in there.
But out here it's
all just bullshit?

871
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:18,233
Mike, you know
I'm not crazy.

872
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:21,611
Don't run away from this
just because it scares you.

873
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,197
I'll tell you what is
scaring me is not
recognizing my friend.

874
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,116
Get some help. Seriously.
Mike...

875
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,492
I don't want to
report you.

876
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,834
( clock ticking )

877
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,751
Good night.

878
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,596
( dialing )

879
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,895
( phone ringing )

880
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,231
Mrs. Lynch,
I told you that...

881
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,108
( over phone ): Do you think
I'm an idiot? Do you think
I'm just making this up?

882
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,319
That's not what you said.
I'm not stupid.
Yeah, no.

883
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,321
You never said anything
about unsupervised visits.

884
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,156
No, that is not
what I said.

885
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,533
You said if my husband
got help, then my son
could come home.

886
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,493
I did not. No.
Nothing between
the lines there.

887
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,162
You never said that...
Who do you think you are

888
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,039
telling me
how to raise my son?
Mrs. Lynch...

889
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,208
You know nothing about me.
You know nothing about my son.

890
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,709
Will you please
let me respond?

891
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,418
How I raise my child is
none of your business.

892
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,004
Would you let...
Would you...

893
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,881
How my son and
his father relate...

894
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:49,717
( shouting ): Shut the
fuck up, you miserable,
miserable woman

895
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,595
before I come and
beat your ass like
you beat your son!

896
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,430
I have your address!

897
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,559
Think about that
before you call
and swear at me!

898
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:02,563
Okay, so, you're certainly
in no state of mind to
be here right now.

899
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:06,401
Come on, it's late,
you look like shit,
go home.

900
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,903
I don't want to go home.

901
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,571
( cell phone ringing )

902
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,744
Hello?

903
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,204
( static over phone )

904
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,630
It's for you.

905
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,847
Emily Jenkins.

906
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,683
LILITH: You shouldn't
leave me home alone,
Emily.

907
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,985
Wayne?

908
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,870
( chair squeaking )

909
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,432
( breathing heavily )

910
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,981
( exhaling )

911
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,747
There you are.
I made supper.

912
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:49,670
Don't ignore me.
My mother used to
ignore me.

913
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,130
( bolting door )

914
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,429
( thunder rumbling )

915
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:21,118
( knocking on door )
Emily? Can I come in?

916
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:23,787
I'm scared.

917
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,206
( knocking continues )

918
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,546
( thuder clapping )

919
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:37,510
Emily? Please?
I know you're in there.

920
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,471
( banging door )
Please, Emily?

921
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,062
( foosteps retreating )

922
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,580
( banging, gasping )

923
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:13,379
LILITH ( shrieking ):
Let me in, let me in.

924
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,839
Let me in, let me in,
let me in, let me in,

925
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:18,175
let me in,
let me in, let me in.

926
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,010
( screaming ):
Leave me alone.

927
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,314
( rattling )

928
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,021
( screeching )

929
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,606
( Emily screaming )

930
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,701
( yelps )

931
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:42,134
Please, help me.

932
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,972
( banging on door )
Please! No, please
open the door?

933
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,642
( screaming ):
Open the door,
she's coming!

934
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,311
Drive.

935
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,770
There's nobody out there.

936
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,191
Drive!

937
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:01,737
There is nobody
out there. Look.

938
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,453
There's
nobody out there.

939
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:16,669
( engine starting )

940
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,255
( door opening )

941
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,648
( panting )

942
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,172
( softly ): It's okay.

943
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:05,968
( screams ):
Leaving the child unattended
is a jailable offense.

944
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,182
You have to do
what I say.

945
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,811
If I say I want
to go to group,
you have to do it.

946
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:22,526
If I say I want
a new dress,
you have to do it.

947
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:27,030
If I say I want
ice cream every day,
after school,

948
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:31,994
( crying ):
you have to do it,
okay?

949
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:40,628
Don't be sad.
This is your
new beginning.

950
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,739
Emily.

951
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:19,583
I tried to call you.
Good news, we found
a home for Lily.

952
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:22,712
Family in Cloverfield.
Really good people.

953
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:25,881
They're picking
her up Friday,
after school.

954
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,344
What's the matter?
They're perfect.

955
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,016
EMILY: If they take her...

956
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:38,602
The whole thing
starts all over again.

957
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,230
You can't let her go,
you can't let her stay.

958
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,067
Leaves you one option.
I can't.

959
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,485
You have to.
You don't understand.

960
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:47,820
Don't tell me I
don't understand.

961
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,196
You've had her,
what, two months?

962
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,490
I had her 10 years.
We had her 10 years.

963
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,908
Think of it as
a test of faith.

964
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,284
I don't wanna
have any faith.

965
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:57,037
How about anger?
You got some of that?

966
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:10,175
How? How do I...

967
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:11,844
Kill her?

968
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,889
In her sleep.

969
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:16,557
That's the only time
you got the upper hand,

970
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,893
is when she's sleeping,
but she almost never does.

971
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:21,228
We checked on her room,
every night
for three months.

972
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:25,232
First night she slept
was the night that you
busted in our front door.

973
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:27,568
And I'll tell you
what I'd do different,

974
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,737
count yourself
dead at the outset.

975
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:33,240
Accept that going in,
use it to your advantage.

976
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,620
If you're not afraid,
she can't hurt you.

977
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,584
( sighs )

978
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,592
( sighs )

979
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:05,314
EDWARD ON TV: No money,
no way to contact her.

980
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,901
Must have went 80
on the way back,
straight through,

981
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,612
didn't stop for nothing.

982
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:15,825
When we got home,
she was waiting for
us on the doorstep.

983
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:20,329
Where is she now?
Some family, somewhere?

984
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,874
MARGARET ON TV: Eddie said,
"We're gonna burn her,"
and I said, "Okay."

985
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:29,296
They did what I
said for a while,
but then they stopped

986
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,342
and started
with the secrets.

987
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,679
But they weren't
really secrets,
I guess,

988
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,807
because I always knew
what they were thinking.

989
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,566
Don't leave me.

990
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,152
It's okay, Maggie.
I'll check on you later.

991
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,242
( door clicking )

992
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:05,081
( Lilith screaming )

993
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,504
( gasping )

994
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,173
( crying )

995
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,718
( screaming )

996
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,434
( screaming )

997
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,901
( men chattering )

998
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,433
( in Lilith's voice ):
I'm glad you're getting
the help you need, Daddy.

999
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,561
( screams )

1000
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,317
( screaming )

1001
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:15,652
( grunting )

1002
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,372
MAN: Get somebody
down here now.

1003
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,332
Somebody call it in.
Base, this is Sanchez.

1004
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:32,544
We're gonna need
medical personnel right
away to the cafeteria...

1005
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,141
Edward Sullivan...
I know.

1006
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,520
Something
I want you to hear.

1007
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,733
This came in this morning,
right about 2:00 a.m.

1008
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,610
You might wanna sit.

1009
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,280
( beeps )

1010
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,617
LILITH: ( in deep voice ):
...decide what to do with
you and your family, Michael.

1011
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,577
( static buzzing )

1012
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:10,874
Every time I think
about it, a voice in my
head says, "Kill them."

1013
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,919
DOUG: Who is this?

1014
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,879
LILITH: ( in deep voice )
Just a little girl.

1015
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,842
Up past her bedtime.

1016
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,217
Lilith?

1017
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,552
( Lilith giggling )

1018
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:30,185
You were right.
She did call Doug.
She used your cell phone.

1019
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,439
Took me a couple of
extra days to check
your cell phone records,

1020
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,817
but that's what
she's been using.

1021
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,778
She's tearing
me apart.

1022
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,072
You're not crazy,
Emily. This is real.

1023
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,491
Edward said
I have to kill her.

1024
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:53,583
I'll help you.

1025
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:01,257
Keep her at the house.

1026
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:03,886
DOCTOR:
Physically you're fine.
How's the stress?

1027
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,971
I'm not sleeping.

1028
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,974
I was hoping
you could give
me something.

1029
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,103
Take one of these,
you'll sleep.

1030
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:30,829
Lily?

1031
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,900
( dog growling )

1032
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,012
What?

1033
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,267
Oh, my God.

1034
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:38,939
( growling continues )

1035
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,234
( growling )

1036
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:50,784
( loud buzzing )

1037
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,582
( gun cocking )

1038
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,472
( growling )

1039
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,937
( gunshot )

1040
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:23,525
( loud buzzing )

1041
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,663
( cell phone buzzing )

1042
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:43,628
( static over phone )

1043
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,718
Who is this?

1044
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,428
Emily, it's Wayne,

1045
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:55,307
I just got a call,
Mike's dead.

1046
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,433
No, he's...
Listen, Em.

1047
01:29:57,433 --> 01:30:00,270
They think
he shot himself.

1048
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,731
Emily? Em?

1049
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,607
( crying ): No...

1050
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:11,907
Emily?
Emily, are you okay?

1051
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,950
( hip-hop song playing on TV )

1052
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:23,585
( crashing )

1053
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:30,675
Get out of my house!

1054
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,895
Get out of my house!

1055
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,864
( in deep voice ):
Don't yell at me!

1056
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,121
( panting )

1057
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:24,646
LILITH: Emily,
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

1058
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:28,024
Can I come in
so we can talk
and work it out?

1059
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:34,530
Emily?

1060
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,617
Stay away from me!

1061
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:42,456
Don't be mad. I said
I was sorry. I'll brush
your hair for you.

1062
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:44,207
Stay away from me!

1063
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:45,541
( banging )

1064
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:08,398
( screaming ):
No! No. No.

1065
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,243
( gasps )

1066
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,501
( screams )

1067
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:39,888
LILITH: ( in deep voice ):
Emily. Emily.

1068
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:44,184
We need to learn
healthier ways of
resolving conflict, Emily.

1069
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:51,900
Most families
don't even know
they have a problem

1070
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:55,987
until it's too late.

1071
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:05,621
( grunts in male voice )

1072
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,044
( chuckling )

1073
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:14,214
What are you doing,
you silly pumpkinhead?

1074
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,049
( chuckling nervously )

1075
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,676
You don't want me
to come under there
and get you, do you?

1076
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:19,928
( crying ): No.

1077
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,595
I'm going to count to three.

1078
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:26,684
One, two...

1079
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:27,977
No.

1080
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:31,356
Two and a half,
two and three quarters,

1081
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:36,445
three. Here I come.

1082
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,697
No! What do you want?

1083
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,824
What you wanted
from your mother.

1084
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:47,080
I want you to love me.

1085
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,335
Okay. I will.

1086
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,715
Come tuck me in.

1087
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:04,013
( crying ): Oh, my God.

1088
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:06,933
( kettle whistling )

1089
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,772
LILITH: Emily.

1090
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:59,528
Chamomile.

1091
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:08,537
Maybe you should have it,
you look stressed.

1092
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:11,914
I'll have one later.

1093
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:20,714
I'm really sorry
that I let things
get like this.

1094
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:22,676
We'll do better
from now on.

1095
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:24,219
We have to.

1096
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:27,681
Someone could get hurt.

1097
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,101
What should
we do tomorrow?

1098
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,564
Surprise me.

1099
01:35:35,564 --> 01:35:38,149
I'm not so good
at surprises.

1100
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,485
You're getting better.

1101
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,085
( glass shattering )

1102
01:37:39,853 --> 01:37:41,897
( sirens wailing )

1103
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:01,083
( distorted ):
Everybody get out okay?

1104
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,838
( Lilith chuckling )

1105
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:09,175
Ma'am, anyone
else inside?
Yes or no?

1106
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:19,101
That was mean.

1107
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:37,078
You follow us downtown,
we'll find someplace
for you to stay.

1108
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,247
Miss?
You okay?

1109
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,503
I'm fine.

1110
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:55,638
Maybe we can
find a hotel with
a swimming pool.

1111
01:38:59,975 --> 01:39:01,394
( tires screeching )

1112
01:39:06,775 --> 01:39:08,735
Where are we going?

1113
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:11,320
You said
I should surprise you.

1114
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,994
She hated herself.

1115
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:22,373
And she hated you.

1116
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:26,669
They said it was
an accident, but
you knew it wasn't.

1117
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,379
Your mother.

1118
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,715
That's why
you never had any
kids of your own.

1119
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:33,384
That's what you're
afraid of, isn't it?

1120
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:36,679
The part of you
that's her.

1121
01:39:37,971 --> 01:39:39,682
What are you?

1122
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:50,735
Slow down!
What the hell are you?

1123
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:54,906
You're upset,
you shouldn't
be driving.

1124
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,168
( horns honking )

1125
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,174
YOUNG EMILY: Mom.

1126
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,641
( gasping )
Mom, slow down.

1127
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,476
You're scaring me.

1128
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:32,777
Mom!
Slow down, please!

1129
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:38,783
Look out!

1130
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,538
It's not real.
Yes, it is!

1131
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,417
It's not real!

1132
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,635
( laughing )

1133
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,016
( panting )

1134
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:11,983
Are you scared?

1135
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:19,741
I'm not.

1136
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,034
( gasps )

1137
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:38,133
( grunts )

1138
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,313
( gasps )

1139
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,151
( distorted ):
I'm not afraid.

1140
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:08,205
( screaming )

1141
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:11,751
( Lilith screaming )

1142
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,671
Just die!

1143
01:42:55,711 --> 01:43:00,133
( screaming ): No! No!

1144
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:04,929
No!

1145
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,665
( gasping )

1146
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:14,123
( panting )

1147
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,476
( sirens wailing )

1148
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:38,207
( "Army of Angels" playing )
