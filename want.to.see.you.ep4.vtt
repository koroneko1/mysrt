00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.890
[Episode 4]

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
You're fired.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.380
The one who hired me is Thach.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.320
You're not in the position to fire me.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.060
My position is the mother of Thach's child.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.700
Do you know why men are so adulterous?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.900
First,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.420
mistress is always a good listener to understand them. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
Second,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.740
men like new sensations.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.620
Enough of talking?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.060
Third,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.440
being with a floozy, men enjoy the honeyed words.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.380
He is worshipped, and his ego is boosted.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.740
I'm not a floozy.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.820
You are exactly like that!

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.720
Stop saying silly things like "you're gonna be fine",

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.800
or "the bright future is ahead."

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.460
to make Thach believe and be with you forever.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.460
You'll meet the most important person to Thach.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.700
Sweetie.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.960
Sit down.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.200
Just hear me out for a second.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.420
Sit down!

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.580
You needn't give me much. A restaurant is enough.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.300
That's outsmarted.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.780
Sit down!

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.500
Think of our little child, if not me.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.920
Why are you so ballsy?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.860
It hurts me.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.780
Don't think that I have no idea of what you did.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.940
It's just that I want to say it or not.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.580
I'm hurt. Our child is hurt.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.900
Let go off me.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.060
You're pregnant?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.020
B*tch, you wanna fool me around?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.900
Slut, I'll surely kill you.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.420
Thach!

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.480
Dirty ass!

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.840
- Leave me.
- Leave her!

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.180
Get the f*ck out of me.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.580
Brother!

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.640
You're gonna kill her!

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.500
- Brother!
- Thach!

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.400
I must kill that b*tch.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920
Calm down!

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.900
Calm it down!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.900
It's fine.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.240
Calm down!

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.640
What are you doing?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.960
Let's play blind-man's-buff.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.640
My eyes can see nothing.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.100
We are both blindfolded.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.380
Play it with me!

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.820
You stand up.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.760
OK.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.060
I'll count to three, and we both step back.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.260
OK?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.120
Uhm.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.440
One...

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.680
Two...

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.440
Three.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.600
Phuc.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.520
I caught you! 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.840
I lose so fast.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.760
That didn't count.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.200
If you're this excellent, forget the whole thing and play again!

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.880
It can't!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.340
I've caught you and even called your name.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.520
You wouldn't have if I hadn't fallen.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.800
I can always catch you.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.900
Sure. I dare you.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.100
Let's play again.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.940
Are you blindfolding yourself?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.380
Yes, I'm covering my eyes.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.060
OK. Let's begin.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.500
I'm searching.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.980
Again, I lose the game.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.520
Don't you know that your scent is unique?

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.220
Let's play again, now!

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.820
So the last one is still not counted.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.660
OK.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.300
It starts now.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You finished?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.580
Not yet. Wait.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.100
OK. Let's start!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.980
Are you sure?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.020
Or...

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.220
you should cover your nose.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.800
I think you'd better take shower.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.420
Is my scent that strong?

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.300
Yes.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.560
Whatever.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.660
Phuc!

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.320
Don't let me catch you.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.520
Hello? Sure. I'll be there in a minute.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.860
You shouldn't play tricks.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.460
Phuc?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
Where are you?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.180
Phuc?

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.400
Are you still here?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.520
Phuc?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.740
Phuc?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.960
Where are you?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.080
You're still here?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.860
Phuc!

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.140
Phuc!

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.780
Phuc!

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.800
Phuc!

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.580
Phuc!

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.060
Where are you?

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.020
Sweetie, what's wrong?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.300
Thach?

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.820
Thach?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.860
Where have you been?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.820
Let's talk it out inside. It's cold out here. 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.760
Where did you hide?

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.720
I was just hiding in this house.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.280
I heard someone opening the door.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.040
You went out to buy something

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.180
or what?

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.520
Next time, please tell me if you go out.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.100
You understand?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.760
I totally get it.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.680
Earlier, my friend stopped by to give me some stuff.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.240
I wanted to play you a bit,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.020
but I talked to my friend for so long that I forgot.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.840
Ouch! It hurts me.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.040
You think my face is a toy?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.000
Your cheek is soft.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.480
You have chubby cheeks?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.180
It's hubby.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.300
You look like a psycho guy.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.720
Yeah, I feel that I gradually become better.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.700
Earlier, I heard the sound of the ambulance.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.960
Someone might have had a traffic accident,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.360
and you were nowhere to be found.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.120
I tried my best to see.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.540
I tried to open up my eyes,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.760
but I couldn't see you.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.780
I called you, but nothing answered me.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.560
I'm very scared of darkness,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.620
because in the darkness, I see nothing

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.940
but my beloved people leaving me.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.040
That's why at that time, I wished you were with me.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.100
And at this moment, I wish to protect you.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.320
I'm home, honey.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.180
When were you back from your foreign schooling?

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.360
Just last week.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.960
But you're just visiting me now?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.600
If you want to be a vedette, you are the one who must come at last.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.240
I thought that you must have left here.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.720
Why should I leave when my house is here?

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.680
Brother,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.640
can I stay here with you?

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.380
Our parents' house is so farther away.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.300
Please allow me to stay here.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.360
Uhm.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.360
Just stay here.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.760
Do we have a spare room for her, honey?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.220
Your job is sitting still.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.440
There is a spare room next to mine.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.340
You tidy it up for Nu to stay, Phuc.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.860
Sure.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.780
Thank you.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.340
That's right.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.160
Phuc and Nu keep looking at each other with that happy smile.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.740
What do you mean?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.720
I'm just making idle conversation.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.080
I say you shut up your mouth.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.000
Hm, so comfortable!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.500
We stayed in the same neighborhood

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.860
so we're very close.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.700
When we were in grade 11, I studied abroad

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.900
and my parents change their lodgings.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.380
It has been six years.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.040
I often come back here when I have a chance.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.200
Thach always come and pick me up.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.860
Thank you.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.040
I met my most trusted junior only by chance.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.200
Excuse me?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.120
You take great care of Thach.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.480
I do it for money, sis.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.440
Back then, Linh asked me to find a home helper for Thach.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.160
I searched everywhere.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
Meeting you is really my luck.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.340
Why didn't you come back here at that time?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.200
I had some family affairs...

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.700
and I was busy with the admission procedures.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.200
Thach.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.160
You two have a talk. I'll prepare for dinner.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.860
Go on.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.740
Where did you keep my luggage?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.960
Let me take it for you.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.740
What's about beefsteak for dinner?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.620
Sure.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.780
My brother!

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.920
My place is colder than here these days.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.260
Uhm... Remember to wear more coat.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.860
It's not certain whether she'll go back there or not.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.240
You haven't changed much. You always want to tease me! 

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.220
You're still very naive and lovely, aren't you?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.840
That's because I'm still Thach's beloved sister.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.660
The meat is not well-absorbed, right?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.660
I've marinated it for so long.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.580
Your focus is not on your work, it's on someone.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.080
Why are you talking too much?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.160
I'm just telling the truth.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.940
Playing the phone while working,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.720
but still getting full salary,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.200
he must be the God.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.400
Don't make up false stories with badmouthing!

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.500
My false story tells a true story!

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.100
You...

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.780
Please don't listen to her.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.500
- I marinated the meat for so long.
- You can try it.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.400
I find this beef is still tasty.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.000
But...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.380
I also think that the beef is not well-absorbed.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.600
He is not a master chef.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.940
The beef is still raw, right?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.340
Yes, it's my bad.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.080
I was not careful, I'm sorry.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.360
In any profession, carelessness is always immoral.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.020
Have you heard this saying?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.880
I'm sorry. This will never happen again.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.780
What if this happens again?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.340
Can I fire you?

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.740
Hey, everyone!

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.560
Raw beefsteak is delicious, too.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.180
Oh God! I forgot about your stomach problem.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.100
Phuc! I'm sorry.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.480
I forgot to tell you that.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.620
It was my false not to ask you about that.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.360
Thach.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.820
Let me talk to him. I'm so sorry, Phuc!

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.960
Yes, please.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.720
I'm not the most dangerous one.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.740
What do you mean?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.800
All I need is money,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.620
but there is someone who doesn't.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.540
He doesn't know it, bro.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.660
You should go inside.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.540
Yes?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.800
I need to be with myself.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.020
Let me stay here to talk with you.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.900
Leave me alone.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.600
Call me if anything happens.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.340
The beef is a bit bland. Why did he make a big deal?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.180
He's being irritated for no reason.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.680
Such a jerk!

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.720
Who is the jerk you mentioned about?

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.240
Try not speaking to me for life.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.820
God knows among us who will die first.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.800
You should pray for me to live longer, then.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.160
If I die first, no one will pay you.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.760
Hey,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.620
don't think that by paying me, you can say whatever you want. 

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.060
So?
