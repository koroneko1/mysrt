1
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.039
I'll be you.

2
00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.560
I'll be you.

3
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.639
You hate me so much, huh?

4
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.199
So I'll be you.

5
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.439
No, Dan.

6
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.160
Let's go together.

7
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.519
I won't let you go in there alone.

8
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.160
It's too dangerous, Lin.

9
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.759
We don't know what Praewa is up to.

10
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.120
Just in case.

11
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.439
Ya!

12
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.000
-Ya!
-Ya!

13
00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.759
Ya!

14
00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:14.800
Aya!

15
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.519
Ya!

16
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.759
Aya!

17
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.040
Aya!

18
00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.360
Aya!

19
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.920
Lilin!

20
00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.759
Lilin!

21
00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:24.959
Aya!

22
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.920
Are you all right?

23
00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:40.639
Why did you hug me, Lilin?

24
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.519
Didn't you want me dead?

25
00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:47.039
So you can have my boyfriend.

26
00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.399
Hey! What the hell?

27
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.039
Hey! What the hell?

28
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.799
Do you really think

29
00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.559
that a lousy shaman

30
00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.000
can do me harm?

31
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.039
He must be dead by now.

32
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.799
-Lilin!
-Dan!

33
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.320
Dan!

34
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.039
Dan!

35
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.720
Praewa's taken over Aya's body.

36
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.240
Stop it.

37
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.399
You might have Aya's body,

38
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.440
but you will never be her.

39
00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:23.960
Get the fuck out of my business.

40
00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:25.960
And you…

41
00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:28.360
you are still a fucking idiot, Dan.

42
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.200
The woman you love so much

43
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.159
is not as innocent as you think.

44
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.480
What's wrong with you?

45
00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:42.000
You know it's not me in that clip.

46
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:44.279
Why are you doing this to me?

47
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.000
You have to tell everyone the truth!

48
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.639
What are you talking about?

49
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.279
Brave!

50
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.559
Hey.

51
00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.320
Praewa, are you okay?

52
00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.519
Hello, Mook.

53
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.919
Can I ask you a favor?

54
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.480
I'm working on a notice board
to introduce the members of our club.

55
00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.080
But I don't have Praewa's photo.

56
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.600
Do you have a photo of her?

57
00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.720
I want her dead.

58
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.559
Are you sure?

59
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.080
I have come too far.

60
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.200
I'll hurt you

61
00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:48.799
like you did to me!

62
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.440
Dan!

63
00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.679
Dan!

64
00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:54.799
Dan!

65
00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:56.440
Praewa.

66
00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:00.039
Praewa, I beg you.

67
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.639
Gosh,

68
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.360
poor Lilin.

69
00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:05.639
Please stop, Praewa.

70
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.360
You are about to lose everybody.

71
00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:14.080
Praewa.

72
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.960
Praewa.

73
00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.879
Do whatever you want with me.

74
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.360
But let Lilin go.

75
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.240
Open your eyes, Dan.

76
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.519
Do you really think

77
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.879
that anything you do

78
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.200
would make this bitch love you?

79
00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:41.559
What should I do

80
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.639
if everybody finds out
that it's me in that clip?

81
00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:51.320
Although the clip doesn't show my face,

82
00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:53.399
I'm still scared, Dan.

83
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.000
I'm embarrassed. I can't face people.

84
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.440
I'm afraid everyone will hate me.

85
00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:02.720
And if Aya finds out,

86
00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.840
she will be mad at me.

87
00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:14.240
Dan, you seem like a smart guy.

88
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.919
But you're so damn stupid.

89
00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:18.399
Oh, my.

90
00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:21.600
Maybe stupid isn't quite right.

91
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.120
You just love a pathological lying bitch.

92
00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.320
I pity you, Dan.

93
00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:32.120
You love her and protect her

94
00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:35.480
even though she doesn't love you.

95
00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:37.320
She loves Brave.

96
00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:44.240
I have no idea

97
00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:48.600
why Lilin would keep
texting Brave all day.

98
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.879
"Brave, what are you doing?"

99
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.559
"Brave, when do you finish classes?"

100
00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.200
"Brave, can you come and pick me up?"

101
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.399
She's so extra.

102
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.399
Stop accusing me.

103
00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:07.240
There was nothing between us.

104
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.759
I talk like that to all of my friends.

105
00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.759
The evidence is all there!

106
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.200
So it's normal?

107
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.639
Talking to a friend's boyfriend like that?

108
00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:40.200
BRAVE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HAVE YOU EATEN?

109
00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:42.840
BRAVE, WHEN WILL YOU FINISH CLASSES?
DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

110
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.840
Speechless, huh?

111
00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:46.799
You can't think of any more excuses?

112
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.480
Poor Dan,

113
00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.600
who never looks at other women,

114
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.240
who only loves this sweet angel.

115
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.879
Do you really think

116
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.720
that this bitch is so innocent?

117
00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.240
Do you think what happened that night

118
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.519
was because she was drunk?

119
00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.480
Really?

120
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.759
Don't worry, Dad.

121
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.440
I'm sleeping over at Ya's tonight.

122
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.559
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

123
00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.400
Good night.

124
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.200
Hey, I'll take Lin upstairs.

125
00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.200
She's wasted.

126
00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:23.599
Okay.

127
00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:26.119
Hey, tough girl.

128
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.880
Always a lightweight.

129
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.640
Take care of her, Aya.

130
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.559
Sure.

131
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.440
Be right back.

132
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.000
Don't listen to her.

133
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.000
She is messing with our heads.

134
00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:52.359
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU AFTER THE PARTY,
BRAVE, IF I'M NOT TOO DRUNK.

135
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.559
OKAY, SURE.

136
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:47.839
I'm sorry.

137
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.680
I didn't mean it.

138
00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.400
Believe me, Dan.

139
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.039
Believe me.

140
00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:08.640
Dan, can I have a moment with Brave?

141
00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:37.759
Can you break up with Aya?

142
00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.440
What?

143
00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:44.400
I'm serious about my first.

144
00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.680
Be with me.

145
00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:50.799
Hey, Lin.

146
00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:52.640
It's just sex.

147
00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:55.799
Don't read too much into it.

148
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.920
Besides…

149
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.960
we were both drunk.

150
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.000
But…

151
00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.119
But I love…

152
00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:26.279
Dan...

153
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.039
I'm sorry.

154
00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:36.079
Things are like this…

155
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.640
because of me. I'm sorry.

156
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.960
Now that your secret is out,

157
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.000
you're taking the blame.

158
00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:18.920
Dan!

159
00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:36.359
Stop!

160
00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:34.720
Stop it, Prae.

161
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.559
Lin.

162
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.319
Lin.

163
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.359
Let's go.

164
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.319
Are you okay?

165
00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:21.960
I can't get up, Dan.

166
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.240
Go and call for help.

167
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.640
I won't leave you here with Praewa.

168
00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:33.960
Praewa can't do anything to me now.

169
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.839
Just go.

170
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.519
Be careful.

171
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.000
On the dark moon,

172
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.480
people who practice black magic
will be the strongest.

173
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.680
At the same time,

174
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.680
it also causes them the greatest pain.

175
00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:19.359
Why are you like me?

176
00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:21.640
Who are you, Lilin?

177
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.240
Prae…

178
00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:33.559
It's me.

179
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.440
It's pizza today.

180
00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:54.880
That's more like it.

181
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.319
Prae,

182
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.359
do you remember last time,

183
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.079
this old lady brought us soup?

184
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.400
It was so bad.

185
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.359
Keep it down.
Or Mother Parn will hear you.

186
00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:09.119
But it's true.

187
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.720
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

188
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.279
Thank you.

189
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.359
Say thank you.

190
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.559
Thank you.

191
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.440
That's beautiful.

192
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.799
No, I just draw random stuff.

193
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.680
Is that you?

194
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.599
Yes, it's me.

195
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.000
This is my dad, my mom, and my house.

196
00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:52.680
That's nice.

197
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.839
Not really.

198
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.319
I'm still not good at it.

199
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.720
I want to draw as good as that one.

200
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.240
I didn't mean the drawing.

201
00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:06.920
Lin.

202
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.960
Are you having fun?

203
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Then we'll come back next week.

204
00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.039
Let's say goodbye to Mother Parn.

205
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.079
Sai, Prae, come here.

206
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.640
Is it nice?

207
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.079
-Yes, it is.
-Yes, it is.

208
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.160
Omelet again.

209
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.720
Omelet yesterday.

210
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.240
Omelet the day before.

211
00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:54.680
I eat so much omelet
that my face looks like one.

212
00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:56.440
Come on, just eat it.

213
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.200
Auntie Fon said
she would take us out to eat today.

214
00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.240
She's been saying that since yesterday.

215
00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:03.000
She hasn't taken us anywhere.

216
00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:05.519
You see how busy she is.

217
00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:07.400
She'll take us out when she has time.

218
00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:13.599
Why couldn't we find a better family?

219
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.440
Sai, don't say that.

220
00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:16.640
That's not nice.

221
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.640
I really meant it.

222
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.279
Do you think what we have now

223
00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:24.559
is better than before?

224
00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:27.160
But it's not worse than before either.

225
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.519
"To possess strong powers,
you have to steal them

226
00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:44.119
from someone who has them

227
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.519
by eating the flesh
and blood of that person."

228
00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:55.960
"Power Transferring Spell.

229
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.359
Ohm Sappa Dheva.

230
00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:02.880
I will drain your knowledge and powers

231
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.559
into my body."

232
00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:32.799
The door is open.

233
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.559
Why are you so careless?

234
00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:39.720
I thought I shut it.

235
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.480
Just be more careful next time.

236
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.119
Yes.

237
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.559
Sai is about to turn 15.

238
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.039
In only four more days,

239
00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:54.319
Praewa will turn 15.

240
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.920
When it's time,

241
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.319
make sure there are no mistakes.

242
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:00.039
Yes, Miss Fon.

243
00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:02.599
Find the rest of the items.

244
00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:04.680
If we don't have them all,

245
00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:07.759
it won't be
just the two of them who will die.

246
00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.559
I got it, Miss Fon.

247
00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.680
What are you doing here?

248
00:30:34.839 --> 00:30:36.160
Don't come closer!

249
00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:38.400
Where are you going?

250
00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:43.000
Don't be afraid.

251
00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:46.160
You will fulfill the great duty

252
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.559
of serving the Three-Eyed God!

253
00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:52.880
You will have the good life you hoped for.

254
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.759
Come here.

255
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.680
"To possess strong powers,

256
00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:08.240
you have to eat the flesh and blood

257
00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:10.880
of those who possess strong powers

258
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.880
to get their powers into your body."

259
00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:19.200
No!

260
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.599
-"Ohm Sappa Dheva."
-No!

261
00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.200
No!

262
00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.440
"I will drain your knowledge and powers

263
00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:33.559
into my body."

264
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.920
How was your day?

265
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.559
I'm sorry for being late to pick you up.

266
00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:05.039
How about

267
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.599
I take you out for ice cream
to make up for it?

268
00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:11.000
What do you say?

269
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.839
Come on.

270
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.799
Let's get ice cream.

271
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.839
Come on.

272
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.079
Help!

273
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.880
Who are you?

274
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.800
Please.

275
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.840
Please don't hurt me.

276
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.039
Please.

277
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.320
Your body...

278
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840
let me have it.

279
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.559
No!

280
00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:31.440
Sai.

281
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.519
Why did you drink her blood?

282
00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:54.800
I didn't mean it.

283
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.320
Prae.

284
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.559
I tried.

285
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.639
I tried to go back for you,

286
00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:07.000
but I couldn't find you.

287
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:09.079
I tried, Prae.

288
00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:12.000
I'm sorry.

289
00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.719
I'm sorry, Prae.

290
00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:45.639
I'm sorry, Prae.

291
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880
Prae.

292
00:37:58.559 --> 00:37:59.800
Sai…

293
00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:34.800
So we can be together forever.

294
00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:49.079
Yes, Prae.

295
00:38:52.719 --> 00:38:55.719
We'll be together forever from now on.

296
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.239
Sweet dreams, Prae.

297
00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:05.960
Do you still love me, Dan?

298
00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:31.719
Hey.

299
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.159
Look over there.

300
00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:35.440
Over there.

301
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.039
UNIVERSITY SPORTS COMPLEX

302
00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:52.440
Lin,

303
00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:54.280
I'm sorry.

304
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.679
Let's go.

305
00:47:32.519 --> 00:47:37.519
