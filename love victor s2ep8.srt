00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,436
‐ Fine? Usually you're talking
my ear off about church gossip.

317
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,815
‐ Is Victor going to Hell?

318
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,985
‐ What? Who told you that?

319
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,403
‐ Father Lawrence.

320
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,573
I told him about Victor's boyfriend,
and he said it was a sin.

321
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,204
‐ Adrian, look at me, okay?

322
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,831
Victor's not going to Hell.

323
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,126
Your brother is one of the most

324
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,505
generous and loving people I know.

325
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,341
‐ But Father Lawrence‐‐
‐ Father Lawrence...

326
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,512
...is wrong.

327
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,722
‐ But he said it's in the Bible.

328
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:40,644
‐ Well, the... the Bible

329
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,814
can be interpreted
in many different ways.

330
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,776
But in this family,

331
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,280
we believe that Jesus knows
who has love in their hearts.

332
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,532
And he would never
punish people for that.

333
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,992
Okay?
‐ Okay.

334
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:55,826
‐ Come on.

335
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,290
‐ Where are we going?
‐ I forgot something inside.

336
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,423
‐ It takes eight hundred and thirty hours
to fly from Atlanta to San Francisco?

337
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,676
Oh, wait. I'm on walking.
It's only five hours by plane.

338
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,344
‐ It's still very bad.

339
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,890
‐ Okay, guys, enough talking
about me moving.

340
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,892
I'm gonna go make us some mac and cheese.

341
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,061
All right, and we're gonna eat it
in silence.

342
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,318
‐ [sighs] We can't
let this happen, Andrew.

343
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,029
‐ I don't really think it's up to us.

344
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,656
‐ Or is it?

345
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,748
BENJI: Oh, hey, thanks for, uh,
coming over so last minute.

346
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,875
‐ Of course. Of course.
‐ I appreciate it.

347
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,001
‐ Yeah, man.

348
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,261
‐ Victor. What are you doing here?

349
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,597
‐ Uh, I was making sure you're okay

350
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,767
'cause you never showed up
at school today.

351
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,394
‐ Right. Got it. Um... [sighs]

352
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,104
Well, Hank was just leaving.

353
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,857
Uh, Hank, this is my boyfriend, Victor.

354
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:12,361
Hank's my, uh... my sponsor.

355
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,073
‐ It's nice to finally meet you, Victor.
‐ It's, uh, it's nice to meet you, too.

356
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,741
‐ See you later?
‐ Yeah.

357
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,831
‐ I didn't know you had a sponsor.

358
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,293
‐ Well, I do. [exhales]

359
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,382
You want to come in?
‐ Yeah.

360
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,428
[sighs]

361
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,560
‐ Oh, my God. No password?

362
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,854
Old people are so bad at cyber security.

363
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,397
‐ Whatcha doin' here, Lake?

364
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,483
‐ I am going to post an offensive tweet
to Harold's account.

365
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,152
Something just bad enough
to get him lightly canceled.

366
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,822
Now, does Harold strike you
as more of a flat‐Earther,

367
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,825
or Holocaust‐denier?
‐ Uh, Lake,

368
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:03,620
I have always found your crazy
kind of endearing.

369
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,248
Right now, I'm just finding it
a bit unnerving.

370
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,505
‐ I can't lose Mia, Andrew.

371
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,049
It was bad enough that seeing Felix
in the lunch room today

372
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,926
almost gave me a panic attack.

373
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,596
A week ago we were happy and in love,

374
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,599
and now I don't even know
how to say hi to him.

375
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,603
I can't lose the other most
important person in my life too.

376
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,104
‐ I hear you.

377
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,565
Okay? I really do.

378
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,655
‐ No, just‐‐ give that back!
‐ No.

379
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,742
‐ Andrew...
‐ I'm sorry. You're in a very
dark place right now.

380
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,203
‐ What the hell is wrong with you?

381
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,079
Do you even care that she's leaving?

382
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,456
‐ Of course I do.

383
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,666
Okay, look, the girl I love is getting
ripped away from me.

384
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,711
There is nothing I can do about it,
and it is killing me.

385
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,922
‐ You love her?

386
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,342
‐ You love me?

387
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,721
‐ Of course I do.

388
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,225
‐ I love you, too.

389
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,062
‐ So why don't you fight for us?

390
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,985
PILAR: Hi.
‐ Hey.

391
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,321
‐ I got you a coffee.
‐ Oh, thanks.

392
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,076
‐ How was seeing your mom?

393
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,538
‐ It was okay. Yeah, um,

394
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,957
they, uh, got her on new mood stabilizers.

395
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,209
So, that seems to be helping.

396
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,670
And she really likes her new therapist.

397
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,089
‐ That's great. Right?

398
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,008
‐ Yeah. Yeah, no, it's just, um...

399
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,928
It's so sterile.

400
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,139
White walls, white floor.

401
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,433
And everything she loves is off limits.

402
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:53,647
No Millionaire, no weird knick‐knacks...

403
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,942
Swedish Fish...
Why is Swedish Fish contraband?

404
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:01,280
It's like they're taking away
everything that makes her who she is.

405
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,366
‐ Felix, it sounds like
she's getting better.

406
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,827
And your mom is fierce.

407
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:10,956
It would take way more than an inhumane
Swedish Fish ban to dull her sparkle.

408
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,293
‐ [chuckles]
She's getting discharged next week.

409
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,965
Yeah. She's really put in the work
this time. I'm proud of her.

410
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,677
You should be.
You should be proud of yourself, too.

411
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,680
How strong you've been
through all this?

412
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,600
It's pretty inspiring. Or whatever.

413
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,064
‐ You always know what to say.

414
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,900
‐ I know. I'm really smart.

415
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,109
‐ No, seriously.

416
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,612
I mean, you act like you don't care
about anything,

417
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,239
but you might be one of the most
thoughtful people I've ever met.

418
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,999
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ Pilar.

419
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,543
‐ I'm sorry. I‐‐
‐ No. No, no, no. Don't be.

420
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,212
I, uh, you know, our, our friendship

421
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,214
means the world‐‐
‐ I have to go.

422
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,548
‐ Pilar, wait.

423
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,265
MIA:
Um, Dad?

424
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,772
Can we, can we talk?
‐ Of course, baby.

425
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,607
[keyboard keys clicking]

426
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,945
‐ Mom emailed me.

427
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,199
‐ When?

428
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,118
‐ Mmm, a few days ago.

429
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,579
Totally out of the blue.

430
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,915
[groans]

431
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,751
‐ [scoffs] What'd she say?

432
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:43,382
‐ Not much. Hi. How are you?

433
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,342
Something about how the last few years

434
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,928
have been really complicated for her...

435
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,015
And that she'd love to hear from me.

436
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,228
‐ Wow. Um...

437
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,230
Did you respond?

438
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,606
‐ No.

439
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,776
I think about answering her every morning.

440
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,905
But I just can't bring myself
to write her back.

441
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:10,200
Even though I have,
like, a million questions...
‐ Yeah.

442
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,452
‐ Because I feel like...

443
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:17,708
writing her back
would be, like, a betrayal to you.

444
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,837
You know. She left. You stayed.

445
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,674
You're my family. Not her.

446
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,012
I choose you.

447
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,436
So how come you never choose me?

448
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:42,649
My whole life,
you've put your work first.

449
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,361
Which I understand. Um...

450
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,781
Because I know how much
it means to you,

451
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,700
and I don't want to hold you back.

452
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,954
[sighs] I never ask you for anything.

453
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:01,585
But this is me asking now...

454
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,171
This is me saying...

455
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,548
just please, don't move us.

456
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,759
Okay? Just this once...

457
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,135
choose me.

458
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,476
‐ Um...

459
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:22,105
I'll, uh... tell Stanford

460
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:26,568
that my family is happy
right here in Atlanta.

461
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,906
‐ Really?

462
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,116
‐ Yeah.

463
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,121
[chuckles]

464
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,043
‐ Thank you.
‐ Of course, baby.

465
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,254
[groans]

466
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,428
Hey, Mia. Um...

467
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:58,183
You know, you should answer
your mom, if you want.

468
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,110
[sighs]

469
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,517
‐ Isabel. Did we have an appointment?

470
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,811
‐ No, we did not.

471
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,692
You told Adrian that Victor,

472
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,905
who he loves more than anyone
in the whole world,

473
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,656
is going to Hell?

474

‐ I did not use those exact words.

I was just trying to explain that Victor
needs his family's help

476
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,460
to find his way back to Jesus‐‐
‐ What Victor needs

477
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,338
is for his family to love and accept him
for who he is.

478
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:12,508
‐ Isabel, you and I both know
it is not that simple.

479
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,885
‐ Actually, I think it is.

480
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,680
Today, I saw Adrian accept his
brother without a second thought.

481
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,976
I have been raised to believe

482
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,021
a lot of ugly things, Father.

483
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,024
Things that will probably take me
the rest of my life to unlearn.

484
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,776
But I will unlearn them.

485
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,570
And I won't pass them on to my kids.

486
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,489
And no matter what you or the church say,

487
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:39,243
I know in my heart that God
loves my son.

488
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:44,957
My beautiful, perfect, gay son.

You're gonna have to find a new

not to give up on God.

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,180
‐ I'm not giving up on God.

493
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,140
I'm giving up on you.

I, I have given it a lot of thought.

And I, I really appreciate the
opportunity, I do...

And, uh...

I can't wait to get to work.

[laughs] Right...

500
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,545
Yeah, California, here we come.

00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,382
Sure.

‐ I wasn't. I, I trust you.

You can't just fall off
the face of the Earth.

I was really worried today.

or I don't respond to a text,

you're gonna think I'm off
getting hammered.

wasn't I?

We had that picnic at Kennedy Park,

and then after, we chased
the Mister Softee truck for 15 blocks

so we could get soft serve.
