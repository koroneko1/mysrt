00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,880
2 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,000
2U TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL MATCH 16 SPECIAL GUEST: SCRUBB

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,280
After I saw you at the Scrubb concert,

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,160
I looked for you at every concert that Scrubb played,

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,280
and I saw one guy that looked exactly like you.

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes?

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,200
Hey. Did you find that smiley guy of yours?

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
I didn't.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
I looked for him everywhere.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
I guess I failed again.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
I started questioning myself about what I was doing.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Why do I bring myself disappointment over and over?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
It's time for me to get over you.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,480
2U TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL MATCH 16

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,360
PRESENT DAY

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,720
The coming traditional football match, as well as the music day, is called 2U.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,960
Our university will compete against the other participating universities.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
The event is held once every two years.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a chance for us to make friends through football matches,

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,760
music shows, and cheerleading activities.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,920
Winning or losing is not the point.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,480
We can let our sucky football team lose, but our cheerleading team…

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,880
must win!

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,480
Don't take it as a serious competition.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
Just compete with yourselves and beat them up.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
This is just one

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,480
of the most important events for our club.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,040
Don't worry about the prize. It's only a few hundred thousand.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,880
Though we can use it to better our club.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm not pressuring you guys,

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
but don't let many years of the great reputation of our club

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,560
-end with you. -End with you.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,560
-Ready? -Ready. Three, four!

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
-Louder. -Come on.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,120
Stop.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,680
The guitar and the bass weren't synchronized. Start over.

37
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,400
Ready. Three, four!

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Faster.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Louder, please.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Ready. Three, four!

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,760
Bass and guitar, turn the volume up.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
Louder.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,600
Ready?

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,160
Ready. Three.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Four!

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
Louder!

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
Ready. Three, four.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,800
-Stop! -Screw it!

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Goodness.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Green.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
It's our turn to be noisy today.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,720
But we need to rehearse for the 2U event too.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,360
And we don't even use microphones.

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,320
What are the rules for if you come up with an excuse?

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Wat, you tell them.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,520
Tine, sort it out.

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,280
Wat.

58
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
-Yes? -I have something to talk to you about.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
There. I knew it.

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,320
You're so easy to read.

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,440
You've been glancing at me.

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
Right. I feel so uncomfortable here.

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,760
My club is behind schedule,

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
so I'd like to ask for more time to be loud.

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,640
Can we change from "every other day" to "two days for me and one day for you"?

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,840
Dim was thinking about "three for us and one for you."

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,280
What? Are you serious?

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,200
I just told you earlier that we're so behind.

69
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,600
That's why I didn't tell you.

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,520
But you just did, Wat.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
-You… -Look.

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
It's the card of truce.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,560
You said that we wouldn't talk about work at home.

74
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,920
I…

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,840
Fine. We can talk later.

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400
Where is my facial foam?

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
-Hmm? -I forgot.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
-It's in my bag. -Go get it.

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay.

80
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,680
I know you like it.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
Someone once said,

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,800
"If you want to use my stuff, you need to ask first."

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,120
So much for keeping to the rules.

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,680
I see. Are you picking on me because of the club?

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,280
That's right. We already passed the honeymoon period.

86
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
It's not that.

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
Good, then.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,080
Because I see that my body lotion always gets stolen too.

89
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
That thief must have nice skin.

90
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,920
You haven't washed your face yet. Let me help.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Very clean.

92
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,840
It's clean now?

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,320
You haven't brushed your teeth either.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
Not my neck!

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Wat.

96
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
Stop it. I'm not talking about work.

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
I know.

98
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
I just can't sleep.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,120
How about we play the guitar?

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,280
I want to hear that song.

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
"Everything."

102
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,600
No. I'll play Desktop Error's song.

103
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
That's right.

104
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,840
Our relationship has passed the honeymoon period.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Back then, you played me any song I wanted to hear.

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,440
Quit whining. How about you play it yourself?

107
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,320
Fine.

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,040
-I'm kidding. -Challenge accepted.

109
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,520
It's a joke.

110
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Back then,

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
the most serious argument we had

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
was about what we're going to eat.

113
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,920
Look at us now.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,160
Work,

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,680
the club, and the juniors…

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,560
Everything is just so messed up.

117
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Even choosing a song to play can be an issue now.

118
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Being a grownup is not easy.

119
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,800
Wat.

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,720
I'll have my Cheerleading Club practice on the field tomorrow.

121
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,520
Your Music Club can be as loud as you want.

122
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,400
No need.

123
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,360
I've thought about it.

124
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
My club can practice anywhere.

125
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
No, you can't.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,960
They've been in a room with AC.

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,440
If you drag them down to practice outdoors, how will they think of you?

128
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,800
It's okay. I'll talk to them.

129
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm sure they'll understand.

130
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't worry. I can handle them.

131
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,680
Phukong.

132
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
How is it going?

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,200
The competition is near. I still can't remember the moves.

134
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,400
Not that.

135
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
We're wondering about you and Mil.

136
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh.

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,480
I haven't seen him since the day we had the profile photoshoot.

138
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,280
He didn't bring you snacks or makeup remover?

139
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Did he follow your IG or want to grab your boobs?

140
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,360
Not at all.

141
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,920
If he's Wat,

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,800
you'd be testing the bedsheets together by now.

143
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Come on.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
Don't be sad.

145
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
If you want love, you need to fight for it.

146
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
-Hang in there. -Hello. How are you?

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
-Hello. -Keep it up, guys.

148
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
A little bit.

149
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,840
-Boss, what brings you here? -Holy…

150
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
Hello.

151
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,280
Keep it together, man.

152
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
What nice weather.

153
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
But you're sweating so much.

154
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Am I?

155
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,440
Boss, you just told him to fight for love, but you're crappier than him.

156
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,480
Can I see these moves first?

157
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,320
Practicing outdoors is not so bad.

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,680
-The weather today is perfect. -I'll teach you.

159
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
Phukong has improved a lot.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,680
Seeing them like this makes me feel relieved.

161
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,240
They're all fast learners.

162
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,000
How about we call it a day?

163
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
-I think so. -Again.

164
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
Can I see these moves? Three, four, and one.

165
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,400
-Two, three… -All right, guys.

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Let's call it a day.

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't forget to practice at home.

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,360
We might need to practice outdoors for a while

169
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
because it would be difficult for the Music Club to move somewhere.

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,520
Let's say we are doing this for our university.

171
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,160
But when I walked past their room, they were strangely quiet.

172
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
Welcome to call back service.

173
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
When did you get home?

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,360
I feel really sticky.

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,040
Where have you been?

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I couldn't reach you.

177
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,840
My phone died.

178
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
Well…

179
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,480
We rented a studio off-campus to practice.

180
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,400
What?

181
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,960
Wat, I know you want to practice off-campus,

182
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
but look at this place.

183
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't think it'd work.

184
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,960
This is the best we've got around here.

185
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,920
I don't want to practice at the club.

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,280
You don't want to fight with him.

187
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I can tell.

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,040
That's why I want you guys to practice in a nice place.

189
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,520
If you win the contest,

190
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,680
you can spend the prize money on a soundproof room. Problem solved.

191
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,200
What are you suggesting?

192
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400
So we all agreed…

193
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
to practice at Dim's house for two weeks.

194
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Two weeks?

195
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
That's right.

196
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,560
It's not like I want to go,

197
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,720
but it's a good idea.

198
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,920
We can both focus on our club activities.

199
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,040
Don't be upset. Come here.

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
Miss me already?

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,960
-It's two damn weeks. -It's just two weeks.

202
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,080
It's not like I'm dying next month.

203
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll come back to you.

204
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,680
You do your job,

205
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,280
and I'll do mine.

206
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,960
When we win, we'll be together again.

207
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,560
But it's two weeks.

208
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,120
There, there. Someone is pouting.

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
-See you. -Bye.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,360
-Take care. -Okay.

211
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,480
Make time to play football with me too. Don't forget me.

212
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
See you.

213
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
Hey.

214
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,400
When you're done, keep it in my workshop room. Here's the sandpaper.

215
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Do you think my makeup is too thick?

216
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
No.

217
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,600
Your shampoo?

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll use Temp's.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,640
What about a toothbrush?

220
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,280
I'll just…

221
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
buy a new one.

222
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,080
Does Dim have a spare towel for you?

223
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,720
I have my own. I'm not borrowing his.

224
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,680
Give it here. I'll pack the bag for you.

225
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,360
You're helping me pack?

226
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,640
Yes.

227
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,720
Here. I'm taking this with me.

228
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,760
-Are you serious? -Yes.

229
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,520
It's a rare item.

230
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,760
You can't just buy it anywhere.

231
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,640
Come to think of it…

232
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,840
We've never been apart for this long…

233
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,080
except when we fought.

234
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Dim has already graduated. Why is he still here messing with things?

235
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,760
I think…

236
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,840
it's not a coincidence I decided to join this contest.

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
What do you mean?

238
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,680
Well…

239
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,040
It's…

240
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,920
I'll tell you.

241
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,960
Well…

242
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
I saw you at the Scrubb concert.

243
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
Remember?

244
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,960
I went looking for you

245
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,200
at every concert that Scrubb played.

246
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,520
University concerts,

247
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,960
temple fairs, bar concerts, and high school events.

248
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,840
I went literally everywhere,

249
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,960
but I never found you.

250
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,440
Until this last one.

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,680
I saw one guy.

252
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
He looked exactly like you.

253
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,080
He was wearing a white shirt and jeans.

254
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,280
Yes?

255
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,760
Hey. Did you find that smiley guy of yours?

256
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,800
I didn't.

257
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
I looked for him everywhere.

258
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
I guess I failed again.

259
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,280
I started questioning myself about what I was doing.

260
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,840
Why do I bring myself disappointment over and over?

261
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
It's time for me to get over you.

262
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,960
That's when I heard Dim's voice.

263
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,120
To those who are discouraged and have given up.

264
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,680
You might have just a one percent chance.

265
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
So what?

266
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,240
If your heart still wants to keep going,

267
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,520
that chance will never be reduced to zero.

268
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,560
This song is for those who are fighting for that one percent.

269
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
One day, your fight will pay off.

270
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,600
TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL, MUSIC CONTEST

271
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,880
I've been so tired, I can hardly breathe

272
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
I've come a long way, weary

273
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,640
But found no finish line

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
Where my dream lies

275
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,760
Should I go back since the path gets…

276
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,240
You know what?

277
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
What Dim said that day

278
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,280
encouraged me to go on.

279
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
I applied to this university

280
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,040
because it's the place I met you.

281
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,080
And I got to see you again at last.

282
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Wait.

283
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,520
So the event you were talking about is 2U, right?

284
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,680
Right.

285
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,880
Dim signed up for the music contest that year.

286
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,440
His band lost.

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,560
That's why I'm doing this for him this year.

288
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,480
More importantly, he wants us to win,

289
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
so we can get a soundproof studio.

290
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,800
That way, we don't have to fight.

291
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
Damn.

292
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,280
I feel bad now.

293
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,160
I just talked shit about him.

294
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,320
Hey.

295
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes?

296
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,240
That's very touching.

297
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,160
Come on. Don't worry.

298
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Dim has good reasons.

299
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,840
By the way,

300
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,320
the guy I saw at the last concert,

301
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
was it you?

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,560
I can't remember.

303
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
I went to many Scrubb shows as well.

304
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,480
Well, don't think about it.

305
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
Right now,

306
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320
we are together after all.

307
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
I don't want to go to bed.

308
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,800
Would you like to take a walk with me?

309
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,520
Sure.

310
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,120
Wait.

311
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
What are you filming?

312
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,040
I'll watch it when you're not around.

313
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,240
No way.

314
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,760
-Come on. Say something. -Something?

315
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
Say anything. Do it.

316
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,120
Come on.

317
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,560
-Give it to me. I'll film it myself. -Hey.

318
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
Give it back.

319
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,040
Wait there. Just a sec. Do you want it or not?

320
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,840
Here.

321
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,520
-Wow. Thank you. -Sure.

322
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,320
Does it look yummy?

323
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,760
Yes, it does.

324
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,280
I was going to cook green curry for you this Saturday.

325
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,160
Too bad you'll leave before that.

326
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Let's do it when I get back.

327
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
Let me taste it.

328
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
Wow.

329
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,240
Have I told you your instant noodles are the best?

330
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Perhaps it's a new flavor.

331
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I didn't add anything.

332
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
It's not about the flavor.

333
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,720
It's because you added your love to it.

334
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,920
That's why it's better than any restaurant.

335
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
Good.

336
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,240
Did you forget anything?

337
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,680
I did.

338
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
I forgot to grab your boobs.

339
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,280
You leave bruises all over them.

340
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
What's the problem?

341
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,720
Do you want me to grab your boobs

342
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,280
or knock you out with a kiss?

343
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
Knock me out with a kiss?

344
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,000
I've heard that countless times, and I haven't been knocked out once.

345
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
-Is that a challenge? -Yes.

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,040
Since you ask for it…

347
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
I shall grant it to you.

348
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,280
Wat, I'm here to pick you up.

349
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,120
I have to go.

350
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,640
Just call me when you have time.

351
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
Even if I don't have time, I will.

352
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,560
If you miss him,

353
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
call him.

354
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,160
"With great power comes great responsibility."

355
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,960
Ohm, you asshole.

356
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,960
He's sad. Stop teasing him.

357
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,560
I didn't tease him.

358
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm reading movie quotes.

359
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,800
It's from Spider-Man, you know.

360
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
Why did I get kicked?

361
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,120
We talked.

362
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
If he has time, he will call me.

363
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,520
If he doesn't, that means he's busy.

364
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,080
I've got so much work these days too.

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,720
We don't have partners just to be with them all the time.

366
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,720
"We have partners,

367
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,160
partners to remind ourselves that someone loves us."

368
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,680
Now you know how to comfort your friend.

369
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,000
What are you talking about?

370
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,920
It's a quote from a movie.

371
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,640
Bangkok Traffic Love Story.

372
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,960
It's the female lead's line.

373
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,200
You guys don't have to worry about me.

374
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,560
We talked it through.

375
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,720
Both of us will focus on our work so we don't think of anything else.

376
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,080
Eat up.

377
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm full.

378
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm heading out first.

379
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,960
-See you. -Aren't you going to eat this?

380
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
No. I'm already full.

381
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
-Can I have it, then? -Go ahead.

382
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,800
-What are you doing? -Shit.

383
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,880
You scared me.

384
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Here. When I'm not here, make sure you drink something healthy.

385
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,720
Wow.

386
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,560
Fruit juice from an organic farm.

387
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,760
High in vitamin C.

388
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,400
It's healthy just like you said.

389
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,760
Of course.

390
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,320
Look.

391
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,560
My surprise is ruined again.

392
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,280
Damn you.

393
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
What are you laughing at?

394
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,800
Wat.

395
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
Wat, wake up.

396
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,960
As of lately, the bed is just too big.

397
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,160
Tine.

398
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,640
Hey.

399
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,960
Come on.

400
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,840
I bet you're lonely.

401
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,600
We started a war every day,

402
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
and now you're gone.

403
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,800
SARAWOW

404
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,480
I told you to turn your clothes inside out before washing.

405
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,080
It's my shirt. Why bother?

406
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
Stop talking.

407
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,920
Hey.

408
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,200
Someone forgot to turn his shirt inside out.

409
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Three, four.

410
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,200
Phukong, you're far behind.

411
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,040
-I'm sorry. -If you can't do it, just leave the team.

412
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,440
Tine, he's doing his best.

413
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,600
Don't put pressure on him.

414
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,840
We've given him so much time. Why…

415
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,920
-Pear, you're in charge. -Tine!

416
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,080
I hate myself today.

417
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
I miss someone with fat fingers.

418
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,560
Let's go!

419
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,280
Damn you.

420
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Come on.

421
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,480
Phukong.

422
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,160
What's up?

423
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,000
Why are you guys practicing on the football field?

424
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,640
It's Tine's idea. He wants us to be familiar with the place.

425
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,120
Did you know Mil will play a warm-up match here today?

426
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,760
His team against mine.

427
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,760
And?

428
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,680
Well, You can just…

429
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,400
pretend to faint and see what he'll do.

430
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
Imagine you're running and passing out…

431
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,560
And then Mil comes in, asking if you're all right.

432
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
-Mil. Like this. -Like this.

433
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,800
No.

434
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,600
If he liked me a bit, we'd be together by now.

435
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,160
Don't back off now.

436
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,360
Look at your big brother.

437
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,280
He spent a year trying.

438
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
I appreciate your help.

439
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
I don't think I'll be as lucky as Wat.

440
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Bye now.

441
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,040
-Hey, kid. -What's wrong with you?

442
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,240
Don't give up.

443
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,000
I'll take care of the team. You can handle the costumes, Tine.

444
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,440
Don't worry. Talk to you later. Bye.

445
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,200
Guys, the break is over. Get to your positions.

446
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,880
Let me see your pose. Now.

447
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Smile.

448
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,440
Give me a smile.

449
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,880
Smile like we're about to win.

450
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Good.

451
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,360
Hey.

452
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,320
Phukong, are you okay? You seem kind of pale there.

453
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm okay.

454
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,960
Are you sure?

455
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
Hands down.

456
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,360
Your face is really pale. Are you all right?

457
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,480
Just a bit tired. I stayed up late working last night.

458
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,400
Do you want to take a break? You can.

459
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,600
It's okay. I'm good.

460
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,600
Fine. Let me know if there's anything at all.

461
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,520
Boss.

462
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,280
Sorry I tackled you last year.

463
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,400
It's all right. It's in the past.

464
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,560
Warriors and wounds always come in the same package.

465
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,440
-Damn. -But this year, just be nice.

466
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,240
Sure. Don't worry. It's just a warm-up match.

467
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,560
Okay.

468
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,600
I want to see "Who Are We?" Put all your effort in this time, okay?

469
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,560
"Who Are We?" Ready?

470
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,280
Ready. Three, four.

471
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,480
One, two, three.

472
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,040
Shit.

473
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,560
Boss, damn it. This is just like a flashback.

474
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,040
-It hurts. -Are you okay?

475
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
Ouch.

476
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,680
A warm-up match, my ass!

477
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,760
Phukong!

479
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,000
-Phukong? -Phukong!

480
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,800
-Phukong? -Are you okay?

481
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,840
Hold him.

482
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,200
Phukong!

483
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,600
What's wrong?

484
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,360
Phukong!

485
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
Step back.

486
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,640
Phukong.

487
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,280
What's wrong with him?

488
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,800
I don't know. He looks pale. I think he might have a fever.

489
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,480
One second he was dancing, and then he fell to the ground.

490
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,480
Let's go to the hospital.

491
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,840
Phukong, come here.

492
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,440
Let me help.

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,080
It's okay. You guys go on. I'll take care of him.

494
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,880
-Are you sure? -I am.

495
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,280
Please take care of him.

496
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,520
Hey.

497
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,520
Come.

498
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,680
Mil.

499
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Green said you stayed up so late working.

500
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,000
Welcome to the Faculty of Architecture.

501
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,440
I warned you before.

502
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,680
I'll let him know you woke up.

503
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,120
-Did you bring me here? -Yes.

504
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,280
I'm sorry for the trouble.

505
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,680
Phukong.

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,760
What's wrong with you lately?

507
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,960
Nothing. Nothing is wrong.

508
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,080
Ever since you became a cheerleader, you've been acting weird.

509
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,760
Isn't it good for you?

510
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,080
You can play football all you want

511
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,760
without a kid like me bothering you.

512
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,920
When did I ever say you were bothering me?

513
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,760
Hey. I'll be right back. Phukong!

514
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,960
I played football every night waiting for you to show up,

515
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,880
but you never did.

516
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,680
You wore too much makeup so I got you a remover.

517
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,600
But you were gone.

518
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,200
Now tell me what's wrong.

519
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Please don't do anything like this to me.

520
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,560
If you don't like me,

521
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,760
just stay away from me.

522
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,160
One-sided love is painful, you know.

523
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,400
What do you like about me?

524
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
I don't know.

525
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,120
You're like my big brother, I guess.

526
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,040
Are you saying I'm crappy?

527
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,160
Yes. I kind of like crappy people.

528
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
When will you like me back?

529
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,600
It's tiring to chase after you all the time.

530
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,560
If you don't like me, let me move on.

531
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,960
What do you want me to do?

532
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,200
We've always been like this since the beginning.

533
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,600
Do you want me to kiss you and act lovey-dovey?

534
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,160
Wouldn't that be weird?

535
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Well…

536
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,520
What do you mean, exactly?

537
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,800
After all the things I just said,

538
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,200
don't you get it?

539
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,840
Well, I'm not sure about that.

540
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,000
At this moment, am I still a little brother to you?

541
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,960
You haven't…

542
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,880
just been a brother for quite some time now.

543
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,520
All right.

544
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,120
Not there. It's the brother zone. You should pat here.

545
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
Thank you for looking after Phukong.

546
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,720
Green will be there soon. You can go home and rest. Thanks.

547
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,600
Damn it.

548
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,920
Does it have to update now?

549
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,640
HBD TO NUISANCE

550
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,920
-Give it to me. I'll film it myself. -Hey.

551
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
What are you doing?

552
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,240
Just stay right there.

553
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
Wait there.

554
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,480
What are you doing?

555
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,520
Wat, are you done? You're wasting my phone battery.

556
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
Wat.

557
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,120
Why do you keep calling me?

558
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,360
-What are you doing? -Take it back.

559
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
Did you just snoop around my phone?

560
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,760
What's there to see? Your gallery is full of my pictures.

561
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,200
Wait.

562
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Watch it later.

563
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,320
Save it until…

564
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,320
until you miss me really badly. You can watch it then.

565
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,120
I doubt that day will come.

566
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,040
We'll see about that.

567
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,160
No way.

568
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,240
What should I say?

569
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,320
Should I sing a song?

570
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,000
You'll make me sing Scrubb songs for sure.

571
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm sick of your list already.

572
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,560
Let's hear a secret I've never told you.

573
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,440
You know what, Tine?

574
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
The day I saw you again,

575
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
I freaking cried.

576
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,680
How could I not? I lost 1,000 baht to Man.

577
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
I told him

578
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,960
that if I saw you again,

579
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,840
I'd pay him the amount.

580
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,320
I'm glad I did, though.

581
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,720
What else?

582
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
You and I…

583
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
We never really talked about our feelings.

584
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
That's right.

585
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,240
Never.

586
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,440
I said I liked you once in the "Your Smile" video

587
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,680
that I recorded for you.

588
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,200
You too.

589
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,720
You said you liked me once, and you've never said it again.

590
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,320
All you do is bug me over and over these days.

591
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
Hey.

592
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,200
You think I'm going to confess, don't you?

593
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,880
Listen carefully.

594
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,000
I will say it only once.

595
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,120
I bet you're listening so carefully now.

596
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
Okay.

597
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,680
Though you like to nag me,

598
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,920
steal my food,

599
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,640
always demand what you want,

600
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,560
and like to think it all in your head,

601
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,600
I still…

602
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Wat.

603
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,080
Are you done? You're wasting my phone battery.

604
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,360
Look at yourself.

605
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
This is just how you are.

606
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Fine.

607
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
-Wat. -Just a moment.

608
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,840
I won't say it.

609
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
I'll say it when I get back.

610
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,360
What a crappy guy.

611
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,080
Why is it so hard to say?

612
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,760
You have dragged me to this point…

613
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,240
where I'm talking to your doll all alone.

614
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,400
When you were around,

615
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,960
all I did was nag,

616
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,840
but you always did something that bugged me.

617
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,640
You didn't turn your clothes inside out,

618
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,560
you liked to steal my stuff,

619
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,360
and you wanted to grab my boobs all the time.

620
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,920
Now that you're not here,

621
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,240
you know, I'd let you do anything to me…

622
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,680
in exchange for you coming back.

623
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,520
Just like you said…

624
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,760
I must be patient.

625
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,600
I must be strong.

626
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
I'll wait until this event is over.

627
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,800
I'll wait until we meet again.

628
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,400
But there's something I want to tell you.

629
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,720
I miss you so bad, Wat.

630
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,080
I miss you so much too, Tine.

631
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,680
Type.

632
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,080
I didn't know you could take days off.

633
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,320
I came back to get my documents.

634
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,960
Man told me you're alone.

635
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,880
I knew right away you'd be upset.

636
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,000
I thought I wouldn't be.

637
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,640
But after being alone for a while,

638
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,160
I started to feel kind of empty.

639
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,960
How can you even do it?

640
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,560
Only a few days without him makes me suffer this bad.

641
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,040
You don't get to see Man for months.

642
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,560
How can you not go crazy?

643
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,320
This is real life.

644
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,680
You'll need to go through such tests.

645
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,760
My test is the distance.

646
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,240
For some other couples, it's the people around them.

647
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,040
And yours…

648
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,680
It's your duty.

649
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,760
No matter how much you love each other,

650
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,120
it'll find a way to come between you two.

651
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
It's worse than the yellow tape I once used with you.

652
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,880
Right.

653
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,680
When he was here, I wanted to do many things for him,

654
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,680
but never had time.

655
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,320
Same here.

656
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,840
When he comes back,

657
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,800
I'll make him green curry every day until he's sick of it.

658
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,320
You only say that when he's not around.

659
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,880
I bet you'll become lazy again when he gets back.

660
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,520
Is this the truth of life too?

661
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
Yes.

662
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,360
Thank you for staying with me,

663
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,240
but you should stay with Man tomorrow. I'll be fine.

664
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,800
It's good you're okay. Besides…

665
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,160
I never intended to stay with you for two nights.

666
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,280
You fell real hard, huh?

667
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,560
Don't tease me.

668
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm your brother. I never got to taste your green curry.

669
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,560
-You can cook it yourself. -What?

670
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,800
I didn't know you could cook green curry.

671
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,480
I learned it from an online video.

672
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,440
I'm about to practice. How about you?

673
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,240
I'm about to get to guitar practice.

674
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
They're calling me now.

675
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,560
Hold on.

676
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,000
Before you hang up,

677
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,160
what should you say?

678
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,200
What? No.

679
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,680
Come on. I want to hear it.

680
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,760
What's with him?

681
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,920
I miss you.

682
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,800
Come again? I couldn't hear you.

683
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,440
I miss you.

684
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,280
I miss you too.

685
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,440
Okay. See you.

686
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
See you later.

687
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,760
Well, well.

688
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,000
-You're like a teenager in love. -What are you talking about?

689
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,000
I'm envious.

690
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,600
I'm so in love. That's why.

691
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,960
Why are you envious?

692
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,760
Though your boyfriend is far away, you still have a friend here.

693
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,080
Don't worry. I'll treat you to a pork BBQ buffet today.

694
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,760
-You give your word? -Of course.

695
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,760
That's awesome. Thanks, my friend.

696
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,040
-Do you want to join us? My treat. -I can't.

697
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,960
I have practice.

698
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,240
Come on.

699
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,000
Since he's a cheerleader with a boyfriend, our pork BBQ is abandoned completely.

700
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,240
Is he really busy practicing?

701
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,480
-Of course it's a practice. -Okay.

702
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,200
Fine. You just saved me money. See you later, kid.

703
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,640
-See you later. Next time. -See you.

704
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,760
-Are you all right? -I am.

705
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,240
-Totally fine. -Hey, Boss.

706
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,680
What happened to your leg?

707
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,000
I played football with Mil, and I got tackled.

708
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,440
Let me see.

709
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,800
Aren't you going to clean it? It might swell if you leave it be.

710
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,640
Do you want to go to my faculty's infirmary?

711
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,240
Are you sure about that?

712
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,640
Should we go now?

713
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,720
How about our pork BBQ buffet?

714
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,760
It's not good for my wound.

715
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,240
I can't eat it. It might worsen my condition.

716
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,840
-It's not good. -All right.

717
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,880
It hurts!

718
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,440
It hurts.

719
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,760
-Does it really hurt? -Yes, it does.

720
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,960
Are you really in pain?

721
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,280
Ouch!

722
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,840
-It hurts. -You seemed fine just now.

723
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,360
It hurts so much.

724
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,280
-Come here. -I'm sorry. It hurts.

725
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,400
-Ouch! -Does it hurt that much?

726
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,200
-It hurts. -Take it easy.

727
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,520
Ouch!

728
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,440
-Please be gentle with me. -Good for you.

729
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,600
Did you bring anyone here while I was away?

730
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,440
When did you come?

731
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,560
The familiar scent of you…

732
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,040
This is the familiar scent of you too.

733
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,760
-Really? -Yes.

734
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,400
You stink as always.

735
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,640
Go take a shower before having dinner.

736
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,800
I don't want to have dinner.

737
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,720
I want to have you.

738
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,120
Did you miss me?

739
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,040
No, I guess.

740
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,920
See? You never said sweet words to me.

741
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,120
Answer me nicely, and I'll let you go.

742
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,200
I miss you.

743
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,240
What?

744
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,440
I miss you.

745
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,240
What?

746
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,240
I miss you.

747
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,200
I miss you too.

748
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,640
You said you'd let me go.

749
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,360
No. I miss you so much.

750
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,040
Let's eat.

751
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,600
-You said you'd let go. -No. Let's eat first. Here.

752
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,120
One, two, one, two, three! One, two, one, two, one!

753
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,800
Okay, guys. Good job.

754
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,320
Let's gather around.

755
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
Tomorrow is the big day we've been waiting for.

756
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,360
I know it's been exhausting for all of you.

757
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,360
Some of you even had a fight with your loved ones.

758
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,320
Some of you missed nice trips with your friends.

759
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,960
Some of you were on a strict diet to look perfect.

760
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,280
And, Phukong,

761
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,360
you overworked

762
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,840
and practiced so hard that you collapsed.

763
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,920
Thank you all for your dedication.

764
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,480
Thank you so much.

765
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,200
Tomorrow is the day, guys.

766
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,000
It's time to show them

767
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,560
how great our team is.

768
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Are you ready?

769
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,880
-Yes! -Yes!

770
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,000
Are you ready?

771
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,920
-Yes! -Yes!

772
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,880
-Are you ready? -Yes!

773
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,320
Okay. Great.

774
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,480
See you tomorrow. Get home safe.

775
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,480
-Thanks. -Bye.

776
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,680
-See you. -Thanks for your work.

777
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,120
-Let's go home. -Take care.

778
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,120
-Good luck. -Get home safe.

779
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,640
-Go to bed early and sleep tight. -I will. See you tomorrow.

780
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,680
-Bye! -Bye!

781
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,600
-Bye. -Bye. See you.

782
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,280
-I'm heading out. -Bye.

783
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,160
See you. Take care.

784
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,640
-Sure. -Bye. Good luck.

785
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,600
Bye.

786
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,920
Hello.

787
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,560
It's the final rehearsal today, and they need an audience.

788
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,360
So I just called randomly.

789
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,680
I can't help it.

790
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,680
You happened to be the lucky one. So please spare your time for them.

791
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,480
Do your best. Don't let your audience down.

792
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,360
One, two, go.

793
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,400
I'll do everything

794
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,160
I'll do anything

795
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,720
I know where

796
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,280
All this is leading to

797
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,880
It doesn't matter who is in your heart

798
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,960
As long as you look my way

799
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,760
My heart is filled

800
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,960
With joy when you do

801
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,200
I don't care who you love

802
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,720
I don't care about reality

803
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,840
All I know is you're the one

804
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,000
In my heart

805
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,240
I don't care who you love

806
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:07,320
I don't care about reality

807
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,720
All I know is you're the one

808
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,200
In my heart

809
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,960
