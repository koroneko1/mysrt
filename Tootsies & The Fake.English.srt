1
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,500
-Nak is a ghost!
-Nak is a ghost!

2
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,833
Pee Mak.

3
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,833
Help!

4
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,625
Pee Mak.

5
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,458
Pee Mak.

6
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,875
My fellows, what should we doeth?

7
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,875
We must flee by river.

8
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,083
I concur with thee.

9
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,208
Bitches.

10
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,333
Why the hell are you talking like that?

11
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,583
We're queer. Why talk like Shakespeare?

12
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,750
True!

13
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,958
You're the ringleader.

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,666
The others stuck to only Pee Mak.

15
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,375
You dragged them into Love Destiny.

16
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
Yes! Peppermint Natty.

17
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,791
Peppermint pain in the ass.

18
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,708
Pain in the ass.

19
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,333
Pee Mak.

20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,083
Here she comes.

21
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,583
Hurry and paddle the boat
to see Monk Wisit.

22
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,291
Go! Just go!

23
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,416
Keep paddling!

24
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,416
Don't stop!

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,875
Why is the boat moving so slow?

26
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,166
Natty, stop dragging your feet.

27
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,708
Lazy lezzie!

28
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,750
Water is getting in the boat!

29
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,208
What should we do?

30
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,625
Throw out anything useless first.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,458
-Golf!
-Golf!

32
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,125
Natty is the most useless.

33
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,291
-Good job.
-Good job.

34
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,666
Let's go.

35
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,958
What is the boat stuck on?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,666
Don't tell me that...

37
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,333
You jerks left me.

38
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,791
-Natty, Pee!
-Natty, Pee!

39
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,125
-What?
-Pee!

40
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,875
-Pussy?
-Pee!

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,166
I'm wearing panties,
you can't see my pussy.

42
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,708
-Gosh! Pee Nak's ghost!
-Gosh! Pee Nak's ghost!

43
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,416
Gus.

44
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,375
Help me raise our kid.

45
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,500
No! I hate kids!

46
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,166
Bad dreams, Gus?

47
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,416
Did you dream of any numbers?

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll tell my mom
to buy some lotto tickets.

49
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,041
Well...

50
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,333
Gus, are you okay?

51
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,083
Why are you making that face?

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,416
I'm...

53
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,125
scared of your new nose.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,083
The Elf look in fashion?

55
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,791
I will cast a spell on you.

56
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,875
Give props to my Lady Gaga nose.

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,500
Okay. It's fierce.

58
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,458
Tell him to stop acting
like he's in a music video and eat.

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,958
Dumbo, eat first.

60
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,208
Stop crying. Enough already.

61
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,208
Blockhead.

62
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,375
Don't put on an emo show.

63
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,583
We didn't bring you back from Surat Thani,

64
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,250
just so you can act this way.

65
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,375
-Dear passengers,
-Fasten your seat belt!

66
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,166
-we are experiencing turbulence.
-Please put your seat belts on.

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,000
Please return to your seats,
fasten your seat belts,

68
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,958
and refrain from using the lavatories
at this time.

69
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,375
Oh, no.

70
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,583
Do you have cramps, Natty?

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,333
No, I need to take a dump.

72
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,000
Natty.

73
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,208
Hold it in.

74
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,416
I've been traumatized too much already.

75
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,833
You can't lose your shit
inside a vehicle ever again.

76
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,416
I beg you.

77
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,958
Are you feeling better?

78
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,958
You've got to be kidding!

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,875
I really need to drop my load.

80
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,041
Natty, stop focusing on that.

81
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,708
Think of "My Heart Will Go On"
by Celine Dion.

82
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,666
Girl, look.

83
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,958
You're all ready for the finale, right?

84
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,208
If I don't use the toilet now,

85
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,375
it's curtains for everyone!

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,708
Excuse me, you can't.

87
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,208
Stay in your seat.

88
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,291
I must take a dump!

89
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,458
-No!
-You can't!

90
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,291
You can't. We're hitting an air pocket.
You'll break your neck.

91
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,208
Don't you know?

92
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,166
Fasten your seat belt!

93
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,166
Marvelous, Natty.

94
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,625
Experience has made
your butthole stronger.

95
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,250
What are you doing?

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,583
I have to shit.

97
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,916
It's at the rim of my butthole!

98
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,625
Don't violate our motherland's airspace.

99
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,916
I can't deal with your shit.
I just had my heart broken.

100
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,541
Stop, you bitch!

101
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,500
Natty!

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,291
Kim, do something.

103
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,500
You can't shit on this plane!

104
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,458
I can't hold it anymore!

105
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,166
-Oh, no!
-Kim!

106
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,333
My nose!

107
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:12,041
POOPY AND THE FAKE

108
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,750
The shit incident on the plane was nothing

109
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,791
compared to what's going to happen
to us three tootsies and one lesbian

110
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,500
who has been friends for ten years.

111
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,791
Suddenly, our lives hit an air pocket.

112
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
We held on together,
falling into the abyss.

113
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,833
Starting with Golf,
a Dumbo who took human form,

114
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,125
who didn't shave his head

115
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,541
to be ordained for his parents.

116
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,666
I'm not going back!

117
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,750
If Monk Wisit doesn't leave,

118
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,541
I'll take care of him forever.

119
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,458
Let's go home.

120
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,666
You've disappeared for a month.

121
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,541
You're blacklisted in the makeup industry.

122
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,875
Monk Wisit, I'm right here.

123
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,166
Let him go, Dumbo.

124
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,583
He's a monk now.
You guys can't be in love.

125
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,166
We can't be in love?

126
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,208
Fine!

127
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,041
Then I'll become a monk!

128
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,000
Dumbo, calm down!

129
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,666
Is the hot weather making you crazy?

130
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,791
-Dumbo!
-Dumbo!

131
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,083
Dumbo, you can't become a monk.

132
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,750
Everyone knows you're a tootsie.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,291
-You're a tootsie!
-You're a tootsie!

134
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,666
-You're a tootsie!
-You're a tootsie!

135
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,291
-You're a tootsie!
-You're a tootsie!

136
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,291
You're a tootsie!

137
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,208
I don't care.

138
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,333
Gross. Sweat.

139
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,583
Let me go!

140
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,250
Let go.

141
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,625
-Shit.
-Shit.

142
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,416
Dumbo.

143
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,916
It's all right. It will grow back.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,125
It's still okay.

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,291
Because his love will never change,

146
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,541
Golf must go back to Bangkok

147
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,416
with his bald buzz cut.

148
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,333
I'll take you to get hair extensions.

149
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,750
As for Natty,

150
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,375
the lesbian of our group

151
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,958
whom we call our Nasty Natty...

152
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,958
Please fill out the name
of the beneficiary.

153
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,041
Twenty-two million baht!

154
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,625
Her life was about to change.

155
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Her mom won the first lottery prize.

156
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,708
I have something to give
to someone special to me.

157
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,083
But ironically,

158
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,750
her luck was blocked by karma.

159
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,875
And it's...

160
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,958
Richy.

161
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,125
RICHY

162
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,541
The stray cat I adopted.

163
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,208
Mom!

164
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,250
Just like Game of Thrones.

165
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,750
Richy cares, never leaves my side,

166
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,041
and brings me luck,

167
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,708
by pointing out the first prize numbers.

168
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,125
Today, I want everyone
to celebrate with me.

169
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,500
So you all know

170
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,333
who is most important to me.

171
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,291
Richy!

172
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,583
-You're dead!
-Slow down.

173
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,166
This is a very important document.

174
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,541
LIFE INSURANCE

175
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,541
SUM ASSURED
22,000,000 BAHT

176
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,041
SUWIMOL NOPSIRI

177
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,375
No problem.

178
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,208
At least my mom wrote my name
as the beneficiary,

179
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,541
being that I'm her only living heiress.

180
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,541
I'm giving it to Richy.

181
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,458
Mom!

182
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,375
Why do you care more
about the cat than me?

183
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,583
Mommy!

184
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,583
Quiet, Natty.

185
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,000
If you want the inheritance,
then go have a baby,

186
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,375
so someone will care for me when I'm old.

187
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,000
But that's going to be hard

188
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,958
because you like to hook up with tomboys.

189
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,625
It's an evil cat and a sassy lesbian.

190
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,625
Natty must find a man to get
her inheritance from her mom.

191
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,791
As for Kim,

192
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,250
a flight attendant so queer
they call him a stewardess,

193
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,333
he's in danger of finding a new job

194
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,791
due to the incident on the plane.

195
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,333
The bleeding stopped.

196
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,791
His nose was hit hard.

197
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,041
Luckily, it's entirely silicone.

198
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,833
Gosh! That's too much information!

199
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,625
Kim, who loves and adores his career
with all his heart,

200
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,833
needs to fight or fold.

201
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,458
It was a real emergency.

202
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,000
I tried to the best of my ability

203
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
to resolve the situation.

204
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,708
The love and loyalty that I have
for this profession

205
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,416
is more than anyone can imagine.

206
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,166
If the sky could feel my passion,

207
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,666
the heavens would shed tears of joy

208
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,916
-for my--
-Kim.

209
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,750
I made a decision

210
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,000
-to let you go--
-Go?

211
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,708
You are letting me go?

212
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,333
This is a small matter.

213
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,333
It doesn't even compare

214
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,750
to me doing it with the Captain
in the cockpit.

215
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,708
Actually, I'm not letting you go.

216
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,458
I want you to go on vacation,
to fix your nose.

217
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,000
The silicone is leaking
and turning into a stalactite.

218
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,208
But being that
a more shameful incident took place...

219
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,916
Kim was so angry and lost it,

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,250
he lost his job and became a fallen angel.

221
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,958
Like a sanitary pad with no wings.

222
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,875
How am I supposed to make a living?

223
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,000
As for Gus, or who the blog fans call

224
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,916
Sha, Diary of Tootsies.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,916
Yours truly, the star of this movie.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,291
My most difficult role yet.

227
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,666
It happened all at once.
From all directions.

228
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's start with my guy problems.

229
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,833
This is mine.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sorry.

231
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,166
I've got to run.

232
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,708
Meeting Top, my ex,

233
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,250
while looking like I swam
through nuclear waste,

234
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,833
right before Win, my current boyfriend,

235
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,625
welcomed me with heart-wrenching words...

236
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,166
Did you fall into a septic tank?

237
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,125
...didn't even compare to our kid issues.

238
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,333
Of course, the kid wasn't mine.

239
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,750
But the kid of a...

240
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,708
Chicky chick

241
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,625
Chicky chick

242
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,666
You guys aren't dancing with me.

243
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,458
-Chicky chick
-Let's dance. Tootsies, dance.

244
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,875
-Let's dance.
-Go.

245
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,791
Jingjai is half Thai-Isan.

246
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,833
She's so crazy about the song,

247
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,083
she has to sing it three times
after every meal.

248
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,041
Gosh, sweetie,

249
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,166
when you're feeling it,

250
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,833
you sound like an Isan serpent.

251
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,166
Your dancing isn't fun.

252
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,958
She is the daughter of Win's relative.

253
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,250
Her parents died in a car accident,

254
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,041
so Win's family had to adopt her.

255
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,208
Why is she living here?

256
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,333
Because I love kids.

257
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,625
Such a faker.

258
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,666
-Phony.
-You're the one to talk.

259
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,500
You dare to call yourself Lisa
from Blackpink.

260
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,583
You're RuPaul.

261
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, my.

262
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,250
Is our Lisa sick?

263
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,666
Stop it! Just dance.

264
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,833
I'm back.

265
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,041
Jingjai.

266
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,208
I bought some toys to play doctor.

267
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,125
Do you want to play?

268
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,208
Jingjai won't play doctor.

269
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,333
She wants to dance.

270
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,541
Doctor?

271
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,291
I want to play doctor!

272
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,250
Let's go play doctor.

273
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,458
-Let's go!
-And that's when she became

274
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,958
Win's new sweetheart.

275
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,708
That Jingjai.

276
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,791
The girl is being sincere.

277
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,166
You're the phony one.

278
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,375
You fake.

279
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,625
That's not all.

280
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,125
The story of our tootsie gang of four

281
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,666
wasn't a drag enough.

282
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,375
Because the gods sent us an industry queen

283
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,166
to feature our mayhem in 4DX.

284
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,166
Marvelous girl.

285
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,708
Fantastic.

286
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,875
A crowning achievement.

287
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
Pee-fection!

288
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,625
Piss-perfect!

289
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,666
God have mercy!

290
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,333
She's so flawless,
she deserves to be an Empress.

291
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,250
I think the real her looks so-so.

292
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,041
Her picture on the red carpet
at Cannes-chanaburi was prettier.

293
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,083
I'll slap your mouth so hard,
it will rip apart!

294
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,916
Don't lay a finger
on my Queen of Cannes-chanaburi.

295
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,333
Queen Cathy is forever number one
in my heart.

296
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,583
You aren't overreacting, right?

297
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,125
I'll do anything to have Cathy tag me
in her photos

298
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,333
or say my name on a talk show.

299
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,833
Great.

300
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,333
But right now,

301
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,083
come back to the real world

302
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,791
and finish Claudia's makeup first.

303
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,166
The moisture has been absorbed
into my fat already.

304
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll peel it off. Sorry, dear.

305
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,166
Sunscreen, please.

306
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,416
This is a primer.

307
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,291
The white bottle.

308
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,750
Put your heart into it.

309
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,125
Don't you want money?

310
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,500
Go easy. I'm your friend.

311
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,958
I can't. I've got to be professional.

312
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,791
I hired you to help me work today,

313
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,916
so we look like a qualified team.

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,791
Hopefully, Cathy will notice

315
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,541
and hire me to do her makeup.

316
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,500
Right?

317
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,000
That's gross, Golf.

318
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,625
So professional!

319
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,041
Good stuff! I don't want to waste it.

320
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:39,875
Hi.

321
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,708
How is our star's makeup

322
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,458
-coming along?
-Almost done.

323
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:44,916
Oh, look.

324
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,666
You've got a professional makeup artist
from HollyHood.

325
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,125
This is holy shit, madam.

326
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,916
Even if it's holy crap, I don't mind.

327
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,583
Just do her makeup so her eyes stand out.

328
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:03,500
This year, our Star Avenue calendar
must sell so well,

329
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
it totally crushes Nadao completely.

330
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,416
Just let Cathy pose in yoga positions.

331
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,166
SALUTE TO OUR YOGA QUEEN!

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
Just do that and her fans will buy it all.

333
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,083
-It's Kath-ee.
-"Cathy"?

334
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,583
Kath-ee. You must say it correctly.

335
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,500
Kath-ee.

336
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,958
-Kath-ee.
-"Cathy."

337
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,416
-Kath-ee.
-"Kath-ee." All right.

338
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,583
It's "Kath-ee."

339
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,541
Kath-ee.

340
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,416
Catriona Kannika Wang.

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,833
Okay.

342
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,333
Cathy, go change your outfit first.

343
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,500
I'll go smoke a fag.

344
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,125
See you.

345
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:00,833
You have good technique.

346
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,833
You poked my eye.

347
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,333
So professional.

348
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,000
You flattered me, so I got tensed.

349
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

350
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,416
No. You didn't disturb me.

351
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm just a no-name artist.

352
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,000
You complimented me.

353
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,500
I've never thought I'd be this lucky.

354
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,208
I judge people on their work.

355
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,500
It's just the way I am.

356
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,083
You're for real!

357
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,041
You are an Empress both on and off screen.

358
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,500
Can I hug you?

359
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,708
Of course.

360
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,000
You smell so nice.

361
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,083
You're really sweaty.

362
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,583
I'm chubby and nervous too.

363
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,208
I liked you since you were
in The Orange Blonde Flower.

364
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,083
I can remember all your lines.

365
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,208
"I love you, Dad."

366
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,583
I watched every episode
of The Golden Sand.

367
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,208
"I will take back everything that's mine."

368
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,458
And one more.

369
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,208
"Saraburi take a right.
Your path is true. Go forward."

370
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,416
The Autumn-Winter Isan Folk Song,
I liked it a lot.

371
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
All of it was so fabulous.

372
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,916
Thank you.

373
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,458
Excuse me, I must go change.

374
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,666
Please.

375
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,416
Cathy!

376
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,875
Oh, my!

377
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,000
My nose!

378
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,416
Goryah, we have a problem!

379
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,583
Goryah!

380
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,791
As the manager of Cathy,

381
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,458
Catriona Kannika Wang,

382
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,541
I must really apologize one more time.

383
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,416
But I must insist

384
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,958
that the agency talks to the client.

385
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,916
Can we postpone the shoot for two weeks?

386
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,541
The client won't agree.

387
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,541
You already rescheduled once.

388
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,333
They had to pay
a lot of cancellation fees.

389
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,125
I understand. I really do.

390
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,000
But I'm asking just in case.

391
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,000
If she can't make it to the shoot
that day, then what?

392
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,250
The worst case is

393
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,833
we would need to tell the client
to change the presenter.

394
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,125
What's worse is

395
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,916
if the client sues the agency,

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,916
we'll have to sue you and Cathy
for damages.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,083
Goodbye.

398
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,458
This is all your fault, you fuckups!

399
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,416
You fucked up my life and Cathy's.

400
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,125
-It's Kath-ee--
-How dare you?

401
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,541
Kim.

402
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,125
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,125
If we could lay down in Cathy's...

404
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,791
I mean Kath-ee's place,

405
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,583
I would have taken her place already.

406
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,041
Cathy was so nice to me

407
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,083
and this happened to her.

408
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,791
It's my damn sweat!

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,875
You're fat. I understand.

410
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,125
Go get tested for diabetes
and fatty liver disease.

411
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,125
But you. Seriously.

412
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,375
Who did your nose?

413
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,500
Why is it so hard,
it can break a person's neck?

414
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,500
I need to know.

415
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,583
It's Dr. Kamala.

416
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,791
The same doctor as Cathy.

417
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,416
Did she get her nose done?

418
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,666
It was for her foot corns.

419
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,583
What a letdown.

420
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,000
It's me who was let down!

421
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,791
Mark my words.

422
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,125
If the agency sues me for damages,

423
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,541
I will sue your asses off!

424
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:11,208
You're all liable for Cathy
ending up this way!

425
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,541
Can you give us a guesstimate
how much it is?

426
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,208
At least 50 million.

427
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,000
Fifty million... Your mother!

428
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,958
Fifty million!

429
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,500
How many makeovers must I do
to pay off that debt?

430
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,791
This is the third time
that I had to redo my nose.

431
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,166
I've had it fixed so much,
I look like the terminator.

432
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,625
Kim.

433
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,125
If Kim Kardashian can pull through,

434
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,416
so can you.

435
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,625
We've changed doctors
and hospitals already.

436
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,958
It won't be a drag like before.

437
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,625
I'm afraid it will be.

438
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,291
Mr. Pipat Saekim.

439
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,541
They called you.

440
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,166
Your next follow-up is on the eighth.

441
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,583
Okay.

442
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,875
You look familiar.

443
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,791
Lyla, Luca, Louella.

444
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,000
LOUELLA, LUCA, LYLA

445
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,666
-Paula!
-Paula!

446
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,166
-Are you a new patient?
-Yes.

447
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,333
You probably don't know
about the Superstar package.

448
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,500
"Want to look like a star?
Let the Superstar package help you."

449
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,416
Open it.

450
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,333
Superstar package.

451
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,500
You will look alike, down to your teeth.

452
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,625
And of course, I chose,

453
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,708
"Paula chews collagen."

454
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,875
Like her twin!

455
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,750
Has anyone done

456
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,333
Cathy, Catriona Kannika Wang?

457
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,916
-Cathy?
-Yes.

458
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,291
She's very popular now.

459
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,916
There was one surgery this morning.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,041
I'll check.

461
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,666
Kim, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

462
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,500
Three people had the complete surgery.

463
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,666
-Three?
-Three?

464
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,166
Can we have their names?

465
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,125
DRIVE THRU FOR TAX

466
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,583
Documents, please.

467
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,625
She looks just like her.

468
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,041
We got it.

469
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,333
She's the one.

470
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,708
Documents, please.

471
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:43,083
Miss Aye is guaranteed
to get you lost on your way home.

472
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,166
Aren't her brows too thick?

473
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,166
They remind me of buffalo leeches.

474
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,250
We can shape them.

475
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,625
I think she will do.

476
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,375
Trust me.

477
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,458
What number do you want?

478
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,375
I want triple eight.

479
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,333
Triple eight, you have customers.

480
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,416
Perfect.

This is the last one.

484
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,916
I have a clip of her old face.

485
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,833
Are you cooking
with your hands or your feet?

486
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,750
All of you stray dogs
should learn the difference

487
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,083
between what tastes like food
and what tastes like my feet.

488

If you can eat it, great.
If not, just toss it.

What's taking so long?
We want to eat tonight.

You ordered so slow
and you want me to freaking hurry?

491
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,958
Why didn't you come yesterday, asshole?

492
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,833
Just eat my attitude for now.

493
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,416
Are you in a hurry to find your dad?

494

Asshole!

495
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,291
Her doctor did a great job.

496
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,000
Too bad he could only fix her face,
not her inner self.

497
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,416

00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,125
Hey, darling.

502
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,000
You want to have a taste first?

503
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,375
A fly guy like you

504
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,541
is a curry street hawker's wet dream.

505
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,083
Gosh.

506
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,250
Where are you going? Come here.

507
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,208
Even though the sign says Ho'some Curry,

508
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,583
if you can heat up my oven,

509
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,125
you can eat for free.

510
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,875
She's a true streetwalker
of the street food industry.

511
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:55,833
Slutty bitch.

512
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,625
Let's go.

513
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,666
What the hell?

514
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,583
May you rest in peace.

515
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,375
Cathy, don't stare at me.

516
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,583
Stop staring!

517
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,416
I only pocketed your money from one job.

518
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,750
Maybe two.

519
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:24,791
Five.

520
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:25,708
That's all.

521
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:26,833
Seven.

522
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,083
Goryah.

523
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:38,666
This is our offer to help you and Cathy.

524
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,500
What is this?

525
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,166
This is Nam.

526
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,625
She's a curry fried rice street hawker.

527
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:49,208
She had cosmetic surgery
to look like Cathy.

528
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,416
Heavens me.

529
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,291
Cathy doesn't have a fang.

530
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,416
This isn't so bad.

531
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,083
My Lord!

532
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,500
Dumbo.

533
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,375
But styling techniques
can help cover things up.

534
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,666
Really? Are you sure?

535
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,416
Stitches are better than a subpoena.

536
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,166
Think of when they serve you a summons.

537
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,416
You guys, too!

538
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,333
Geez.

539
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,541
That's why we're doing this.

540
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,500
What do you want in return?

541
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,041
Do you want a sports car?

542
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,416
A fancy home in the middle of downtown?

543
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,083
How about twins of your own?

544
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,916
Or a seat in the new government?

545
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,375
Whatever you want, just say it!

546
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,541
This is the greatest dream of my life.

547
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,583
If I tell you, don't be shocked.

548
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,833
I want to be on Chef Pom's show.

549
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,458
What?

550
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,291
-I want to be on Chef Pom's show.
-What?

551
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,791
I want to be on Chef Pom's show.

552
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:57,833
Why is it...

553
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:58,875
Is that it?

554
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,458
As you wish.

555
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,500
Tune in to Heaven's Kitchen show

556
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,125
every Saturday at noon on Channel 4.

557
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,041
You've been warned!

558
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,791
The first contestant to answer questions
from our judges is

559
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,375
contestant number three,
Ms. Gus Teetawit Setthongchai.

560
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,875
Please pick a question envelope.

561
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,041
She will get a question from Mr. Win.

562
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,791
If you become the new Prime Minister,

563
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,958
what would you do
for the children and youth?

564
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,458
For the children and youth,

565
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,958
I think...

566
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,333
we must get rid of them!

567
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,500
I would build a jail on an island

568
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,333
and throw all the kids in there

569
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,041
until they turn 18

570
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,208
and then set them free.

571
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,916
This is because?

572
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,458
I hate kids.

573
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:55,666
I hate kids!

574
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,375
Bitch! Stop! That's enough!

575
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,541
That chicken shit!

576
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:28,916
Gosh!

577
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,458
Goh Gai.

578
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,083
Goh Gai.

579
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,583
Look. Do it like this.

580
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,083
-Goh Gai.
-Goh Gai.

581
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,291
Goh Gai is like Gus' name, right?

582
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,333
Right?

583
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,333
One more time?

584
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,250
One more time.

585
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,041
-Goh...
-Goh...

586
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:47,625
Chicky chick

587
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,083
Chicky chick

588
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:54,291
Chicky chick

589
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,166
Keep practicing, Jingjai.

590
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,416
Also, try singing some other songs.

591
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,125
No.

592
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,833
I'm going to sing...

593
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:05,166
Chicky chick

594
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,916
Chicky chick

595
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,125
Chicky chick

596
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,833
GOUT ATTACK

597
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:15,875
Chicky chick

598
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:16,958
Chick

599
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,833
Gus.

600
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,125
I hope you get caught.

601
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,750
Be happy and healthy.

602
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:32,083
Bye, Gus.

603
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,416
Bye.

604
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,166
We tried all the positions, Doctor.

605
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,083
But she still isn't knocked up.

606
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,333
Yes, Doctor.

607
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,833
Even the helicopter position failed.

608
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,583
It's all right. It's okay.

609
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,333
We booked an alternative school.

610
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,958
-English classes.
-Special tutoring classes.

611
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,500
-Chinese.
-Rock climbing. Hunting.

612
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,458
We'll be new-gen parents
with trilingual kids.

613
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,916
If there's nothing else to discuss,

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,750
can we do a GIFT procedure?

615
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,625
You've got makeup on your collar.

616
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:12,958
Thanks.

617
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,000
Having kids isn't a joke.

618
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,041
-Okay.
-It's no joke.

619
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,500
Think of your kids' future.

620
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,875
I'm sorry.

621
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,333
Your acting wasn't good enough.

622
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,708
I'll lose all the inheritance for sure.

623
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:25,916
Why don't you adopt Jingjai?

624
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then this will all be over.

625
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:27,916
No way.

626
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,208
My mom will only accept
what comes out of my Cam-mary.

627
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:32,625
How demanding.

628
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,458
Ms. Nopsiri, please pay at window three.

629
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,333
Two thousand baht.

630
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,291
Okay.

631
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:42,791
Mr. Sawangreungpaisarn,
pick up your prescription at window nine.

632
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,083
Sawangreungpaisarn...

633
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,250
-Thank you.
-Top!

634
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,041
What the hell?

635
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,333
What day is it today?

636
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,458
Do you think he saw me?

637
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,500
No.

638
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,333
I saw you.

639
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,125
Hey, Top. Are you sick?

640
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,166
I brought my pregnant wife in
for a check-up.

641
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,166
-Wait.
-What?

642
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:09,791
I'm kidding.

643
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,291
I'm here to pick up my prescription.

644
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,750
I can't sleep.

645
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,875
It's my mom.

646
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,291
Is she okay?

647
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,458
My mom is dead.

648
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,958
-What?
-What the fuck?

649
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,375
Hello.

650
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,583
I found a piece of land
by the ocean in Surat Thani.

651
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,625
It's very beautiful.

652
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, that land is my property already?

653
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,625
I forgot.

654
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,916
Gosh! Fly like a G6.

655
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,208
He's handsome and rich.

656
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,166
He looks more mature now.

657
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,708
His mom, who was in your way,
died already.

658
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,666
A stud falling from the sky like this

659
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,291
is destiny for sure.

660
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,333
Destiny?

661
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,416
I'm with Win now.

662
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,666
My destiny.

663
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,125
I'll ask Top for some man milk
and make my baby.

664
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,416
You bimbo!

665
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,833
You think he will give it to you?

666
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,875
Goodness.

667
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,291
Thai education is meaningless

668
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,250
because people like you
bring down the curve.

669
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,458
Let's go!

670
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,500
Why did you roast me like that?

671
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,041
Get used to it.

672
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,333
All right. Before we start coaching today,

673
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:14,416
in order to improve our class,

674
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,875
I want to invite the best acting coach

675
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,916
to possess my body.

676
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,708
Hello, everyone.

677
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,083
-I am...
-Stop it, Dumbo.

678
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,750
You? An acting coach?

679
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,291
A casting couch meme, maybe.

680
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,875
All right.

681
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:39,333
Let me welcome Kath-ee

682
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,041
to start her training.

683
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,125
Hello, everyone.

684
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,833
I'm the real Cathy in the flesh.

685
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:57,291
Wow. Your impersonation was great.

686
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,250
Even if the audience were miles away,
they could tell you're a fake!

687
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,541
Phony!

688
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,666
Try again.

689
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,166
Hello, everyone.

690
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,500
Are you tired?

691
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,416
I bought snacks for you.

692
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,000
Two kilos of Manila Tamarind.

693
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,166
Your aura is trashy.

694
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,791
You don't care
about the bag you're holding.

695
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,708
Do it again.

696
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:36,791
What's up?

697
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,458
This is me, Nam from Khlong Lod.

698
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,666
I'm tired, I give up,
and I can eat a buffalo.

699
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,458
Let's take five, bitches!

700
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,375
It's expensive.

701
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,125
Goryah let us borrow it.

702
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,083
We can't let her talk.

703
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,166
Let her talk only when has to.

704
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,125
When I look at her form,

705
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,000
I still can't see a superstar.

706
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,791
It's like turning a mudskipper
into a swan.

707
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,333
What now? Should we dump her?

708
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:12,416
Dump her, Natty?

709
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,791
If they sue us, we'll owe them 50 million.

710
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,208
Being sued isn't that bad,

711
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,791
but my integrity as a groupie...

712
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,083
If I leave Cathy right here,

713
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,958
for the rest of my life,

714
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:27,000
how can I watch any of Cathy's dramas

715
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,333
without a knot in my heart?

716
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,250
We have no time to give up.

717
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,875
There is a lot of work to do.

718
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:43,000
Today, Cathy's spirit must live
inside Nam!

719
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,416
Change her clothes. Do her makeup.
Build her inner self!

720
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,500
This is the real me.

721
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:56,458
Lesson one, smile like Cathy.

722
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,375
Nam, begin!

723
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,375
How can you smile that sadly?

724
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,375
I told you to smile like Cathy,

725
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,333
not Chucky.

726
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,875
Smile like a lady.

727
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:21,666
Hey!

728
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,583
Damn you!

729
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,208
We want the feel of a superstar,

730
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:26,041
not a street peddler on meth.

731
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,708
When you show your fang,

732
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,333
everyone will know you are a fake.

733
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,416
Your smile should make men want
to divorce their wives.

734
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,291
Excuse me.

735
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,375
Too much Botox?

736
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,458
I think it's cute.

737
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,541
I'll let her pass.

738
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,833
Natty, no!

739
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,166
From this point, no giving your opinion.

740
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,708
You can only teach yoga.

741
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,750
This lesson is the most important.

742
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,583
It's about acting.

743
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:56,000
This is Cathy's drama
that had skyrocketing ratings.

744
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,500
Prisoner of Love.

745
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,541
Let me go.

746
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,625
What's the matter?

747
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,583
Are you still going to be stubborn, Araya?

748
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,375
Let go of me, Visarut.

749
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,125
No! Come here!

750
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,916
Come here.

751
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,166
I'm giving you one last chance.

752
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,666
Apologize to me right now.

753
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,333
Good, Kim! That's good!

754
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,500
I'm not sorry.

755
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,166
I didn't do anything wrong.

756
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,541
I spoke my mind.

757
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,208
Why did you help me?

758
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,875
Why didn't you just let me die?

759
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,041
Nam.

760
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:29,333
Are you playing a rock?

761
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,541
You're stiffer than Kim's nose.

762
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,000
I told you already, right?

763
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,333
Dying...

764
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,291
is too easy for you.

765
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:36,916
You...

766
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,833
must stay and suffer with me

767
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,333
forever and ever!

768
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:41,916
Nam, fight back.

769
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,958
Fight back.

770
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,125
Play off each other.

771
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,375
Let your emotions out.

772
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,166
Your inner. Don't forget your inner!

773
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,083
That's not true.

774
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,208
You helped me
because you weren't brave enough

775
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,625
to watch me die before your eyes.

776
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:54,916
You're inhuman.

777
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,041
You're all talk!
But you won't dare do me for real!

778
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,000
Fine!

779
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,583
Don't push me, Araya.

780
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:07,416
Stop, you sinner!

781
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:11,375
You asked for this.

782
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,750
I'm going to insert my manhood in you!

783
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,541
No.

784
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,416
Don't. You savage. Let me go.

785
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,916
The legendary one-eyed tear.

786
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,333
That was amazing.

787
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,500
Swish, bang, boom.

788
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,333
You really got into character.

789
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,291
A little more
and I was going to unhook my bra.

790
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,541
Me too.

791
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,125
What's wrong with you, Natty?

792
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,875
Trying on a dress is the easiest.

793
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,000
Just don't speak.

794
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,375
No matter what, don't talk.

795
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,666
Don't make any noise.

796
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,458
Sit properly.

797
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,791
Sit up straight.

798
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,791
Like that.

799
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,708
Goryah said you have a sore throat.

800
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:27,833
Is it really bad?

801
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:29,875
Yes.

802
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,541
Take some meds and get lots of rest.

803
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,458
Let's try on the dress
the client picked out.

804
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,500
Sa, dear.

805
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,541
Go try on your dress.

806
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,833
You don't need to go with her.

807
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,500
Cathy has worn
this kind of dress many times.

808
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,583
She can change herself.

809
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,208
Are they your new assistants, Goryah?

810
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,416
Yes, I'm quite busy.

811
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,333
I can't handle it all.

812
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,375
They look over the details,
so we don't miss anything.

813
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,291
Got it.

814
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,291
But no worries.

815
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,625
A backless dress is easy to wear.

816
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,166
-Yes.
-She's confident with wearing

817
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,250
this kind of dress.

818
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,250
Just wait and see.

819
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:25,041
DANGER TO NATIONAL SECURITY

820
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:33,166
A backless dress is for showing your back.

821
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,875
As for your breasts, they must be covered.
They are not for show.

822
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,000
You like to joke around, don't you?

823
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,083
I'll pin in the waist of your dress a bit.

824
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,500
I'm sorry. That was clumsy.

825
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,125
Gosh, darling.

826
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,583
Not even a whimper.

827
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,208
You deserve to be the Empress
of the industry.

828
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,625
All done.

829
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,625
Can I check your underarms a bit?

830
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,583
Hey!

831
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,208
Perfect.

832
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,208
It's only the camera and lighting crew.

833
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,083
Good, we came before the client.

834
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,541
So we can sneak in first.

835
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,458
Yes.

836
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,083
I want something sour

837
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,791
or I'm going to puke.

838
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,375
-Are you nervous?
-Are you?

839
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,458
That's one reason,

840
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,125
but the main reason is

841
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,166
your damn cleavage!

842
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,125
Come on.

843
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,916
This is Pok Love Me London's
fashion style.

844
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,958
She is a celebrity makeup artist.

845
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,041
Hello, I'm Golf,

846
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,958
Love Me Temple of Dawn.

847
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,583
-Kim, what about Nam's voice?
-What?

848
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,500
No worries.

849
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,458
I came up with a plan for Gus
to help already.

850
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,958
I'm trying to go there now.

851
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,583
I prepared the balloons last night.

852
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,833
When I woke up, Jingjai had tied
the balloons to her salon.

853
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,875
When I tried to get them back,
she screamed.

854
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,250
A little bit more.

855
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,250
Okay.

856
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,416
Kim, I've got to go. I have an idea.

857
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,541
Gosh.

858
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,291
What is this?

859
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,875
Why don't I have a fabulous hairdo
like Win?

860
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,750
What's the fuss?

861
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,625
Calm down, ma'am.

862
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:01,250
I'll handle it.

863
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,250
Goodness.

864
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,708
Why is this happening?

865
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,083
Damn!

866
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,375
Damn zit.

867
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,625
Jingjai, you brat.

868
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,166
What did you use on my face?

869
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,041
DRESSING ROOM

870
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,416
In 30 minutes, be ready to shoot.

871
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:35,750
The set is ready.

872
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,291
Check on Cathy if she is all ready.

873
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,875
My gosh!

874
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:41,666
Is Gus going to make it in time?

875
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,708
Shit!

876
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,458
This is more stressful
than being in an operating room

877
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,041
to get my face done. Damn it!

878
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,791
Can I have a shot of some liqueur?

879
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,166
Even one cigarette will do.

880
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,208
Shit. I'm going to lose it.

881
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,666
I'm so triggered!

882
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,083
Nam, you can't!

883
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,125
Today, you are Cathy.

884
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,541
Cathy, Catriona Kannika Wang.

885
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,458
Remember that!

886
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,291
Take a deep breath.

887
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,166
We must get through today.

888
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,208
That's right!

889
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,791
By the power of Thai Tootsies,

890
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,083
there is no obstacle
that can make us freak out.

891
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,875
What?

892
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:31,250
It's my phone.

893
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,708
Golf, I can't make it. Something came up.

894
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,666
Goryah.

895
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,208
Untie me right now.
I need to go to the set.

896
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,000
How can you do this to me?

897
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,000
This is my profession.

898
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,666
I really need to handle this.

899
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,083
Cathy woke up and won't stop wailing.

900
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,625
I must stay and look after her.

901
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,083
Take care of things on the set.

902
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,333
What's going on? I've got to go.

903
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,916
You prissy. Stop flopping around.

904
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,666
Cathy, stop!

905
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,833
Goryah, let me go.

906
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,166
We can't do this to them.

907
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,000
Are we being cut loose?

908
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,000
What if we get caught?

909
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,166
Kim, can you think of something?

910
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,291
You must have faith
in the power of tootsies--

911
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,000
Fuck the damn power!

912
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,208
I'm booking a ticket to see my man.

913
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,458
-Surat Thani.
-Right.

914
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,375
Shit. I've got to go.

915
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:20,208
I've got to run. I won't make it.

916
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:22,000
The police are going to take me away.

917
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,208
-My clothes.
-I'll skip town.

918
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,541
-My makeup.
-I'll flee to Cambodia.

919
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,750
-My food.
-Cambodia.

920
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,625
-My mangoes.
-They will arrest me.

921
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,375
-Stop!
-I'll go to block eight.

922
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,416
My makeup.

923
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,666
Stop it, now!

924
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,958
Stop it, now!

925
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,083
Stop, both of you!

926
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,000
Golf.

927
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:40,250
Pull yourself together for Cathy's sake.

928
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:41,458
Right now!

929
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,458
Okay. I'm fine now.

930
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,625
We're just too excited.

931
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,916
So we must relax.

932
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,875
Come on.

933
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,125
Come here.

934
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,875
Shake it off.

935
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,875
Let all the stress go.

936
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,625
Shake it off.

937
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:05,541
Kim, come on.

938
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,000
We must relieve our stress.

939
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,791
Three and four.

940
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,541
You brought some coffee for us, dear?

941
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,541
Put them on the table there.

942
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,291
Hey. Wait a second.

943
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,500
-You are Ice Paris.
-You are Ice Paris.

944
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,375
I just wanted to say hi to Cathy.

945
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,416
So I offered to bring her some coffee too.

946
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:08,875
Thank you.

947
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:09,791
So...

948
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,333
What's going on here?

949
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,875
Well...

950
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,083
-We were going to do--
-Something is wrong.

951
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,375
It's not what you think.

952
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,958
-I can explain--
-You're a fake.

953
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:40,125
Because if Cathy
was a real fan of that singer,

954
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,375
you would know that she dances like this.

955
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,166
It isn't hard. Try it.

956
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,541
Then you will get it down exactly.

957
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,291
I've got to go do my makeup.

958
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,125
I'll see you on the set, Cathy.

959
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,541
Nice hips.

960
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,166
I wonder if he is nine by nine too?

961
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,666
Excuse me, where is Cathy's dressing room?

962
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,500
I'm Goryah's assistant.

963
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,125
It's a superstar thing.

964
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,708
Without the balloons in her room,
she won't feel good.

965
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,666
It's that door.

966
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,708
Thank you.

967
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,625
What the hell?

968
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,583
Mr. Top, welcome.

969
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,208
Hello.

970
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,416
It's great having you oversee the process.

971
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:51,875
Namsawang.

972
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,333
Shit.

973
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,625
I wasn't sure about something
so I wanted to check it out myself.

974
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:01,791
Yes.

975
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,000
Okay. Agreed.

976
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,208
Bye.

977
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,833
Do you have problems with your prostate?

978
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:19,750
You pee for a long time.

979
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,916
Hi, Top! What a coincidence.

980
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,791
Holding balloons while peeing?
So fashionista.

981
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,041
Sha, are you setting a new trend?

982
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:31,958
Not funny!

983
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,583
And so

984
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,958
what are you doing
at my company's project?

985
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:44,916
Hold on!

986
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,708
Let's start with you.

987
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,166
Goodness.

988
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,791
You changed your look
and you look like a boss.

989
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,166
Well...

990
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,333
I have to take over from my mom.

991
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,416
This job is important
so I must oversee it myself.

992
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,541
Sorry about your mom.

993
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,083
But...

994
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,083
how did she pass away?

995
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,208
I put poison in her congee.

996
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,625
Shit!

997
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,166
I wanted to get back with you.

998
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:28,708
Shit!

999
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,083
You believed it.

1000
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,000
Top! It's not funny.

1001
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,541
Be serious.

1002
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,791
She died of cancer.

1003
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,083
She was getting treatment.

1004
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,875
But in the end, we couldn't save her.

1005
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:04,625
Well...

1006
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,208
What a coincidence
running into you three times.

1007
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,250
How crazy.

1008
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,666
I miss you.

1009
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,208
I really miss you.

1010
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:34,625
-Cathy is in the house!
-Cathy is in the house!

1011
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:51,708
I'm Chewbacca.

1012
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:52,666
I'm Kimmy.

1013
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,625
We are...

1014
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,166
-Team Goryah.
-Team Goryah.

1015
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,083
And now what?

1016
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,791
Kim, the balloons?

1017
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,958
Win and I are still happy together.

1018
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:16,958
I'm glad to see you.

1019
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,250
I've got to go.

1020
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,666
I called Gus many times.

1021
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,083
Shit!

1022
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,041
Kim, I'm here.

1023
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,875
Nam, suck it all in.

1024
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,083
Go on.

1025
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,041
What is he doing?

1026
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,291
-What are they doing?
-I have no idea.

1027
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,083
More.

1028
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,416
Deep breath.

1029
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,708
So fabulous.

1030
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,125
Bitch! What a pro.

1031
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,250
-Call me queen.
-Queen.

1032
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,166
Fantastic!

1033
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,625
Let's walk!

1034
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,666
What an Empress.

1035
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,458
Keep going.

1036
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,500
They are from the agency.

1037
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:26,958
Get ready to smile like we practiced.

1038
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,291
Hello, Cathy.

1039
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,583
-Hello.
-Hello.

1040
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:37,875
Wow, your smile is so cute.

1041
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:41,833
Keep walking.

1042
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,416
In front of the monitor is the director.

1043
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,083
Hi. This is Director Thong.

1044
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:25,791
Hello.

1045
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,000
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Thong.

1046
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,958
Hello.

1047
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,458
I'm Thong.

1048
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:30,500
I'm the director.

1049
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,666
I'm happy to work with you,

1050
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,625
Miss Kath-ee.

1051
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,083
Me too, Mr. Thong.

1052
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,375
Cathy isn't feeling well today.

1053
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:54,500
You lost your voice?

1054
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,041
That's right.

1055
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:00,583
Cathy is sick with a squirrel voice.

1056
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,833
It's Chip and Dale syndrome.

1057
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:05,500
Doctors say that

1058
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:08,208
it's a rare disease.

1059
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,125
That's okay. I can redub when editing.

1060
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,333
No problem.

1061
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,375
Thank you.

1062
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:14,500
Mr. Thong.

1063
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,333
We can adjust her voice
on the computer, right?

1064
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:17,666
Adjust fucking what?

1065
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,500
Did you hear her?

1066
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,791
She sounds like she swallowed
seven to eight squirrels.

1067
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,041
It won't work.

1068
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,375
Understand?

1069
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,291
It's no problem.

1070
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,833
It is very easy.

1071
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:30,041
Are we ready yet? Damn it!

1072
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:34,041
I've been waiting,
my balls are all sticky.

1073
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,541
Get ready to shoot.

1074
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:36,875
We are ready. Go!

1075
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,250
If you're ready, please get on the set.

1076
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,541
We'll take it easy today.

1077
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,166
Take it easy...

1078
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,416
Let's go, Cathy.

1079
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:46,916
Golf.

1080
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,375
That yoga posture is so beautiful.

1081
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,708
She is meditating before her performance.

1082
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,250
This is Cathy,

1083
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,166
Catriona Kannika Wang.

1084
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,458
Nam, get up.

1085
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,166
Yoga is a good way
to show off Cathy's skills,

1086
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,583
but timing is important.

1087
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:13,041
She's ready.

1088
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,208
Please fix Cathy's hair, Gus.

1089
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,125
It looks messy.

1090
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,708
Jeez.

1091
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:29,791
Such a tiny matter. Why say it himself?

1092
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,000
He's fishing for attention!

1093
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:34,541
-I understand Top is the client.
-Let's see.

1094
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,375
But I saw the way he looks at you.

1095
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,000
Like he misses you.

1096
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,000
He's longing for you.

1097
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:44,958
He's like...

1098
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,416
It's reflecting out of his eyes.

1099
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,833
Stop it.
My heart isn't in the right place.

1100
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:52,875
My eyelid is twitching.

1101
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:55,875
-Twitch--
-Stop!

1102
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,500
Everyone on the set, quiet please.

1103
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,583
Let the actors get into character.

1104
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:02,708
Ready?

1105
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,291
Ready to shoot.

1106
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,333
Natty, why are you sending me a clip now?

1107
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:10,458
Stop!

1108
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,500
Oh, my!

1109
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:17,666
What the fuck? Who is that?

1110
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:18,958
Turn it off.

1111
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,083
Kim, turn it off.

1112
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,208
Mute it.

1113
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,375
What's up with her?

1114
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,416
I don't know.

1115
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,708
It's probably meant
for one of her tomboy lovers.

1116
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:31,958
That bitch!

1117
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,666
How can she be horny right now?

1118
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:40,083
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SENDING ME? GROSS!

1119
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,208
Kim, I can't stop.

1120
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:45,166
I have no choice.

1121
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,291
I'm sorry.

1122
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:55,791
Today, you can't come home with me.

1123
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,208
In nine months, we will meet again.

1124
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:00,250
Ready?

1125
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,666
Do you see Nam's eyes?

1126
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,500
Why do I have a bad feeling?

1127
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,458
Is he moaning?

1128
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,708
Cut, please. Cut now.

1129
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,708
Go and handle this. Hurry!

1130
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,208
You're calling cut yourself?

1131
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,291
Cut it is, then.

1132
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,416
Cathy!

1133
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:16,750
I apologize for Miss Cathy.

1134
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,958
Let me see.

1135
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,083
The character is supposed to be
prim and proper.

1136
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,833
Do it again...

1137
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,375
I swear you'll never see

1138
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:30,583
the end of Chef Pom's grey hair.

1139
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:31,791
Understand?

1140
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,416
Good.

1141
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,958
Okay, keep filming.

1142
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,208
Ready?

1143
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:44,125
Camera.

1144
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:49,750
Namsawang.

1145
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:04,166
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

1146
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:05,583
Good.

1147
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,583
That was excellent, Cathy.

1148
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,833
Is he serious?

1149
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,291
If Mr. Ice played along more,
it would be perfect.

1150
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:15,791
Okay.

1151
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,208
I have goosebumps.

1152
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:21,458
She deserves to be
the Empress of the industry.

1153
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:24,250
Cry on cue.
Call the wind and rain. Anything.

1154
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,708
Wind.

1155
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,625
What?

1156
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,458
I want to shoot another take.

1157
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,291
After they say the slogan,

1158
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,541
point the fan at her face.

1159
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,291
Blow her hair away from her ears.

1160
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,875
Ears?

1161
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,333
Bring the hurricane fan in.

1162
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,458
The fan is here.

1163
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,416
Shit. What are we going to do?

1164
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,708
Dumbo, you gave him that idea.

1165
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,458
Next take, Ice and Cathy,
after you hear "action,"

1166
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,041
show the product, then speak.

1167
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,041
What to do?

1168
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,083
I don't know.

1169
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:56,625
Namsawang.

1170
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,208
Wind!

1171
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,208
I'll turn off the fan!

1172
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,458
Oh, no!

1173
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,583
Golf!

1174
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:54,166
Kim.

1175
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:57,875
He tripped!

1176
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,791
He tripped over the cord!

1177
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:01,500
Cathy.

1178
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,708
Cathy.

1179
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:06,041
Please excuse us.

1180
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,791
Bye.

1181
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,333
Poor you.

1182
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:13,166
He tripped over the electric cord.
Oh, Lord!

1183
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,583
What a pity.

1184
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,291
That's it.

1185
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,750
That's a wrap. Go home.

1186
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,583
I'm so tired.

1187
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,833
Bitch, perfect timing.

1188
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:32,291
Did anyone see her ears?

1189
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:34,916
Who the hell cares? We've got no time
to rethink the game plan.

1190
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,250
Gus, take Kim to the doctor.

1191
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,916
No! His blood will stain my car.
Win will be upset. I'll call a taxi.

1192
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,375
Silly bitch!

1193
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,041
Nam, what are you standing around for?

1194
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:43,375
Wipe off the blood and go change.

1195
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,333
You cruel tootsie!

1196
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:45,875
I am. Go! Don't waste my time!

1197
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:48,125
Why isn't my driver answering my calls?

1198
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:51,250
When you're done changing,
meet me outside.

1199
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,291
Okay.

1200
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,250
When you get to the hospital, call me.

1201
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,333
Don't act like you give a damn!

1202
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,875
Just go before you bleed out.

1203
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,625
What do you want?

1204
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,833
I just wanted to ask

1205
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,083
if you have anything to confess to me

1206
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,083
about Miss Cathy?

1207
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,250
No.

1208
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:26,625
Nothing at all.

1209
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,083
I know the truth.

1210
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,791
What you guys are doing here.

1211
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,000
What are you talking about?

1212
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:34,291
I don't know what you mean.

1213
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,833
Hop in if you don't want any trouble.

1214
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,250
Hey, Pao.

1215
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,166
Is your studio done shooting?

1216
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,583
In a bit.

1217
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:56,500
Chef Pom's show is so detailed.

1218
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,333
I'm biking to get some kaffir.

1219
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,208
They ran out of it and can't keep filming.

1220
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,458
Chef Pom!

1221
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,500
Three, two, one.

1222
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,208
You've been warned!

1223
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,208
If you don't shave off
the skin of the kaffir,

1224
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:15,791
the marinated pork sauce
from your high-class recipe

1225
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,666
will turn into a low-class side dish.

1226
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,250
HEAVEN'S KITCHEN

1227
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:23,500
Chef Pom, please say your last line again.

1228
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:28,458
Will turn into a low-class side dish.

1229
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:30,958
Fiercer.

1230
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:35,250
Will turn into a low-class side dish.

1231
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,666
We'll take a 30-minute break
to wait for the sauce to soak in.

1232
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,916
Chef Pom!

1233
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,166
Cathy, right?

1234
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:55,833
I'm so happy to meet you in person.

1235
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:58,500
I really like your work.

1236
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:02,500
In the latest one,
you showed off all your flavors.

1237
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:04,583
The way you mixed emotions

1238
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,208
wasn't too little or too much.

1239
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,791
It was very well rounded.

1240
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:12,500
I'm so happy to meet you in person.

1241
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,166
I love your show a lot.

1242
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,958
Are you not feeling well?

1243
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,625
You don't sound like yourself.

1244
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,291
It is my greatest dream

1245
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,083
to be a guest on Chef Pom's show.

1246
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,416
You want the truth?

1247
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,208
The reason I don't sound like Cathy...

1248
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,875
is not because I'm sick.

1249
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:46,083
But actually...

1250
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,250
I'm...

1251
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:49,750
not Cathy.

1252
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,625
My name is Nam.

1253
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,708
Nam, I'm a curry cook from Khlong Lod.

1254
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,250
NAM

1255
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,250
Look.

1256
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,250
Miss Cathy.

1257
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,458
Here you are.

1258
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,583
I've been looking all over for you.

1259
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,250
Hello, Chef Pom.

1260
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,666
Sorry for interrupting.

1261
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,708
Cathy is stressed about playing twins

1262
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:13,125
in a new drama she's in.

1263
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:16,125
She likes to test out her acting skills.

1264
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,375
Oh, I see.

1265
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,125
I'm Nam from Khlong Lod.

1266
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:20,875
Great acting.

1267
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,083
THIS IS THE REAL ME

1268
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,416
I want to file a report.

1269
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,458
I've been cheated by con artists.

1270
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:38,750
Top!

1271
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,666
Let's talk this out.

1272
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,083
Don't let the police get involved.

1273
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,083
Gosh.

1274
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,208
What is it?

1275
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,958
In a nutshell, you gave yourself away.

1276
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,541
At first, I wasn't sure.

1277
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,041
But now I know...

1278
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,625
there is something going on.

1279
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,333
Hey.

1280
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,166
Are you playing me?

1281
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,500
If I didn't do this,

1282
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:08,875
would we be out here together?

1283
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,833
Hurry.

1284
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:19,125
Come on.

1285
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,666
We haven't been here for a long time.

1286
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,958
It's like nothing has changed.

1287
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That's a stretch.

1288
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,500
Everything changes.

1289
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:46,708
But for me,

1290
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,500
when I met you at the airport again,

1291
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,750
I felt like nothing had changed.

1292
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,375
It was just a coincidence.

1293
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,291
Don't think too much.

1294
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,333
It was a coincidence at the airport.

1295
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,333
But after that...

1296
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:11,041
I planned everything.

1297
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:18,083
DIARY OF TOOTSIES IS TRAVELING
TO TRIKASEM HOSPITAL

1298
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:19,125
GOUT ATTACK

1299
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,291
DIARY OF TOOTSIES IS TRAVELING
TO SUNSKY STUDIO

1300
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,458
I'M SO EXCITED. WISH ME LUCK.

1301
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:47,708
What's up, Natty?

1302
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,333
I just got in.

1303
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:52,458
I'm not going out anymore.

1304
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:53,791
I'm going to the sauna and sleep.

1305
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,125
I'm tired!

1306
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,333
Bye!

1307
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:10,041
SUWIMOL NOPSIRI IS AT MONGKOK, HONG KONG

1308
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:12,083
TRAVELING TO HK WITH MY DEAREST DAUGHTER

1309
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,291
Damn cat!

1310
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,208
End game. Today, for sure.

1311
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,041
-Let me go.
-No!

1312
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,000
Let me go, Golf.

1313
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,208
I can't let you tell Chef Pom the truth.

1314
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,333
Why can't I tell her?

1315
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,750
You already promised that

1316
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:29,208
you'll let me be on Chef Pom's show.

1317
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,333
Did you bullshit me?

1318
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,583
I look like a bullshitter, but I'm not.

1319
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,791
If you go to the show

1320
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,666
and tell them you're a Cathy look-alike,

1321
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,083
the client will be suspicious of us.

1322
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,291
He will just be suspicious.

1323
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,333
But if you don't let me go on the show,

1324
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,416
I will tell the client now!

1325
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,250
Wait for the commercial to air!

1326
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,791
Is that going to kill you, Nam?

1327
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,541
What is it with you and this show?

1328
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,458
It's just like how you're crazy for Cathy!

1329
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,958
Let me go!

1330
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,250
Golf, let me go right now.

1331
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,750
No, I won't.

1332
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:01,958
Last time, I didn't have a chance
to fight for you.

1333
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:06,041
But this time,

1334
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,541
I will do anything

1335
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,833
to get you back.

1336
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,625
That was a long time ago.

1337
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,333
I forgot everything already.

1338
01:12:24,791 --> 01:12:26,333
If you really have forgotten me,

1339
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:30,708
then why were you using
the same luggage we both have?

1340
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:43,250
The lighting is nice.

1341
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,750
It's been five years since that day.

1342
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,208
I want the last memory in this camera

1343
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,333
to be only you.

1344
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,083
It's you.

1345
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:27,416
Did your tomboy stand you up?
Is that why you're here?

1346
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,625
When we needed you, you weren't free.

1347
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,541
Well, I was worried about you.

1348
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,416
So how are you?

1349
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,375
Did the mission fall apart?

1350
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:43,875
We almost got caught.

1351
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,416
We were lucky to get away.

1352
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,958
I got this cut as a memento.

1353
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,833
What the hell?

1354
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:58,750
Natty!

1355
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,250
What's gotten into you?

1356
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,625
You!

1357
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,166
You lost lots of blood
and still came to the sauna.

1358
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:10,291
Drink some water,
so you won't be dehydrated.

1359
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:13,083
For real?

1360
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,208
Thanks. I've never heard of that.

1361
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:48,041
What the hell is happening?

1362
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:59,375
Fuck!

1363
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:02,208
Is there anything I can help you with?

1364
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,291
No!

1365
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,000
What the hell?

1366
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:08,583
Natty, did you see that?

1367
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,833
The medicine is so damn strong.

1368
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,625
You drink it and there it blows.

1369
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:17,708
Does it help if I dress like this?

1370
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,666
Do you feel it more?

1371
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:21,916
Natty.

1372
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,416
It should help turn you on

1373
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,833
more than the clip I sent you, right?

1374
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:27,708
Natty, what are you doing?

1375
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:30,416
That cat dares to stand in my way.

1376
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,625
Today is the last day I'm ovulating.

1377
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,666
I must finish you off,

1378
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,666
so I can have a child of my own.

1379
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,125
Natty, what do you want from me?

1380
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,083
I'm gay!

1381
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,625
Let me go!

1382
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,083
No! I won't let you go.

1383
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:49,416
Hey.

1384
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:53,041
What's Cathy doing, standing there?

1385
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,625
Cathy?

1386
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,500
She just looks like Cathy.

1387
01:15:57,583 --> 01:15:59,416
Shit! Nam!

1388
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,500
Come back!

1389
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:03,791
No way!

1390
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,583
Gus.

1391
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,500
Can we get back together?

1392
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,625
Natty.

1393
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:40,958
Stop. Let me go.

1394
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:43,500
Don't!

1395
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,083
Natty.

1396
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,625
Golfzilla, stop following me!

1397
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,625
Nam!

1398
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,333
Let me go, Natty.

1399
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:57,708
Natty.

1400
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:18,166
Is this good, Kim?

1401
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:20,291
Hell no!

1402
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:21,250
I'm hot!

1403
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:22,791
Nam, stop!

1404
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,291
Out of the way!

1405
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,375
Watch this!

1406
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,916
Shit.

1407
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,041
Darling, I'm sorry.

1408
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,583
I didn't mean to.

1409
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,208
Nam!

1410
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,375
Kim.

1411
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:48,708
Is this better?

1412
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:50,500
Hell no.

1413
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,833
I can't breathe.

1414
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:06,958
Let's get back.

1415
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:39,291
W

1416
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,291
Did Jingjai do that?

1417
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,250
Yes.

1418
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,958
She tried to write my name.

1419
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,083
How cute.

1420
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:57,583
Are you tired?

1421
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,375
Yes.

1422
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:01,291
I've been busy all day.

1423
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,250
Jingjai staying with your parents is good.

1424
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:26,416
We haven't been together like this
in a long time.

1425
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:28,375
Yes.

1426
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:38,333
Fuck!

1427
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:41,125
G

1428
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,125
How could she?

1429
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,083
Calm down. It's not a big deal.

1430
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,041
Not a big deal?

1431
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,375
It won't come off.

1432
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,708
That Jingjai! You brat!

1433
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,625
Hey, Gus!

1434
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,916
Calm down. It's just a bag.

1435
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,125
Just a bag?

1436
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,333
Do you know how much it is?

1437
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,750
There are lots of places to write on.

1438
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:58,875
Why my bag?

1439
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,500
Any house that has kids
is always like this.

1440
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,125
Look at you.

1441
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,625
You're angry like a bull just for this.

1442
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:08,375
If we have kids together,
what will you do?

1443
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,000
Who said I wanted kids?

1444
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:14,958
Then...

1445
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,791
When you said you like kids...

1446
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:18,500
You like Jingjai?

1447
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,500
I was faking it.

1448
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:22,833
Then all this time...

1449
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,708
-I thought it all myself?
-You thought what?

1450
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,208
I thought you liked kids.

1451
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:30,916
I thought one day we would have a kid.

1452
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,500
Kim, are you okay?

1453
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,583
I'm okay.

1454
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,833
Kim, don't tell my mom.

1455
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:56,875
Where is my devil?

1456
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:57,791
Mom!

1457
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:02,000
How can you do such a shameful thing?

1458
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,500
What's wrong with you?

1459
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,875
Are you that horny,
you tried to hook up with your friend?

1460
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,250
It's your fault.

1461
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:08,958
You said you wanted a grandkid.

1462
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:11,000
Are you that desperate
for the inheritance?

1463
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,708
You act like I'm not your kid.

1464
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:14,666
You love Richy more than me.

1465
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:19,458
You can be clueless,
but don't be foolish about this.

1466
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:21,708
RELATION, DAUGHTER

1467
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,250
BENEFICIARY, FAHLADA NOPSIRI

1468
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,500
I said that
because I want you to have a kid!

1469
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,708
So someone will look after you
when you're old.

1470
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:37,375
Unlike me.

1471
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,708
I'm alone.

1472
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,041
I only have my cat.

1473
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,416
You think like that?

1474
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,375
Who would love a cat more than their kid?

1475
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:46,583
Mom.

1476
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:53,666
Ma'am.

1477
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:57,125
Don't be upset at Natty.

1478
01:21:57,791 --> 01:22:01,041
I watched Dr. Phil's show about behavior.

1479
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,250
According to psychology,

1480
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:06,791
everything Natty did is because
she's afraid you won't love her.

1481
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,708
Too bad, she is a bimbo!

1482
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,750
That's why it got out of hand.

1483
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:17,291
Mom, I'm scared.

1484
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,166
So fake!

1485
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,250
Who asked you?

1486
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,500
-Scared I won't love you?
-Scared I'd have no inheritance.

1487
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:26,791
Do you love me or my money?

1488
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,541
I love my mom who has money.

1489
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,375
And I love my daughter
who will give me a grandkid.

1490
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,166
Whatever. I'll stop dreaming.

1491
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:37,666
The way you are is good already.

1492
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
If you are happy,

1493
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,500
then I am happy.

1494
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,083
Understand?

1495
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,500
And you, Kim,

1496
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,416
stop trying to prove your point already!

1497
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,333
What?

1498
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,041
What did you take?

1499
01:22:58,125 --> 01:22:59,291
I wasn't trying to be rude.

1500
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:02,916
Kim!

1501
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,375
I'm at the Namsawang office now.

1502
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,541
Don't ask me anything now, Goryah.

1503
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,666
Hurry here.

1504
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,583
Everything must be settled today.

1505
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:36,875
Keep the change.

1506
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:37,958
Go and buy cool wipes.

1507
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,250
Do you have an appointment?

1508
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,458
I'm here to see Mr. Top.

1509
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:48,083
I've been waiting for you.

1510
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:53,375
You dress and sound just like her,
you snake.

1511
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,291
I can't let you meet Top.

1512
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:56,291
Help!

1513
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,625
-You...
-Help!

1514
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,083
...think...

1515
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,208
Help!

1516
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,750
...you can

1517
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,541
run away?

1518
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,083
I won't allow this secret to get out

1519
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,000
and tarnish Empress Cathy's name.

1520
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,416
Do you want to fight me?

1521
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,750
Come here.

1522
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,625
Are you Nam?

1523
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,250
No, I'm Taylor Swift.

1524
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:58,541
You're screwed!

1525
01:24:58,625 --> 01:24:59,541
Is she dead?

1526
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,125
I didn't mean to.

1527
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,250
I never thought

1528
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,333
that my hunch would be true.

1529
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,333
Top, I'm sorry.

1530
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,416
For me, it wasn't so bad.

1531
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,541
Miss Cathy...

1532
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,500
She went through worse.

1533
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,833
Gosh, now you forget to bring the shades.

1534
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:47,875
After decades in the industry,

1535
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,666
the one principle I've held dearly to

1536
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:55,250
is not lying to my fans.

1537
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,750
Because I believe I'm blessed
to be in this profession.

1538
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,583
I can't allow this deception to continue.

1539
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,291
Being Catriona Kannika Wang

1540
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:20,708
didn't just take luck.

1541
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,208
It took my soul

1542
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:32,666
and my whole life

1543
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,791
to get to this point.

1544
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:47,791
Oh, my god!

1545
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,333
There's her legendary one-eyed tear.

1546
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,250
How lucky for me to see it.

1547
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,416
A moment worth cherishing.

1548
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:01,083
I've got to confess.

1549
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,333
The reason I had my face done
to look like yours wasn't my wish.

1550
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,166
My ex likes you.

1551
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,458
I've never watched any of your dramas.

1552
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,916
But after what I saw,

1553
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:19,833
I know you're not just a beautiful face,

1554
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,916
but you also have a damn beautiful heart.

1555
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,041
Maleficent all the way!

1556
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:28,541
Well...

1557
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,291
Was she raving or ranting?

1558
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,041
What you said,

1559
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:33,958
it's good, right?

1560
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,458
So damn good!

1561
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,291
So good that I'm so ashamed

1562
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:43,125
that I took your body and face

1563
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:45,791
and tainted your image.

1564
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:47,833
Thank you, Nam.

1565
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:51,125
Try starting by not swearing, okay?

1566
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:52,708
Fuck, yes.

1567
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:56,625
Of course.

1568
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,875
The Olsen twins.

1569
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:16,875
Mary-Kate and Ashley in the flesh.

1570
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,541
I talked to Goryah already.

1571
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,750
Cathy has cleared her bookings
to reshoot the commercial.

1572
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,625
She's also attending the grand opening

1573
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:31,125
and promoting my new products
on every channel.

1574
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,125
It's my pleasure.

1575
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,500
Thank you.

1576
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:37,125
As for you, Golf,

1577
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:43,166
I won't press charges
if you and Nam help me

1578
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,041
do what you are good at again.

1579
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:48,375
What do you want from me again?

1580
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:56,500
SEE YOU AT THE OPENING EVENT TOMORROW.

1581
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:59,375
I'M WAITING FOR YOUR ANSWER ABOUT US.

1582
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,708
I'm going to see Jingjai sing at school

1583
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,416
and I'll eat with my parents later.

1584
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:16,958
I'll be home late.

1585
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:22,625
The rice with barbecue pork
is in the microwave.

1586
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
G

1587
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:36,583
Gus.

1588
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:38,791
Can we get back together?

1589
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:02,625
Thanks to our guests

1590
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:06,041
and especially
to all the Namsawang customers

1591
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:07,916
who have supported us all this time.

1592
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:09,708
This New Year,

1593
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:11,791
we have a present to give everyone.

1594
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,250
It is our new product,

1595
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:14,750
the Dual Moods light bulb.

1596
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:17,708
Let's see how special it is.
Enjoy the show.

1597
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:32,958
How beautiful.

1598
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:42,833
The whole country is fooled.

1599
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,833
Operation fake it until you make it.

1600
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:45,750
Marvelous.

1601
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,583
Dual Moods.

1602
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:00,000
Light squared.

1603
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:01,000
Dual Moods.

1604
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,208
Light squared.

1605
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,875
The one and only.

1606
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,708
So David Copperfield. Bitches!

1607
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,708
Is that Nam or Cathy?

1608
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:25,958
This is the brand ambassador
that we proudly present.

1609
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,166
Cathy, Catriona Kannika Wang.

1610
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,458
Thank you.

1611
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:57,041
And this is Mungkorn.

1612
01:31:57,125 --> 01:32:00,750
And up next is Jingjai

1613
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,166
from our singing class,

1614
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,541
singing the song "Chicky Chick."

1615
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:05,208
Let's give her a round of applause.

1616
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:10,500
Go, girl!

1617
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:18,208
Chicky...

1618
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,708
Chicky chick

1619
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:35,750
Chicky...

1620
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:46,375
Chicky chick

1621
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:50,000
Chicky chick

1622
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:53,458
Chicky chick

1623
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:56,583
Chicky chick

1624
01:32:56,666 --> 01:33:00,000
You're all dancing like in a music video!

1625
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,291
G is for gai and K is for kai

1626
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:30,166
About Jingjai...

1627
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:33,000
I'm sorry.

1628
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:36,208
Never mind.

1629
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:37,625
I was wrong.

1630
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:39,041
No.

1631
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,916
It was all my fault.

1632
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:44,916
I assumed you wanted a kid.

1633
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:47,375
I didn't even ask you if you wanted one.

1634
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
So if you knew I wasn't okay...

1635
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,625
I would be okay not having a kid.

1636
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:55,041
It's better than not having you.

1637
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,458
I never thought

1638
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:07,166
you would give Jingjai
such a sweet farewell gift.

1639
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,041
Who said that was a farewell gift?

1640
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,583
It's a welcome gift
for a new member of our home.

1641
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,083
Hold on.

1642
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:22,916
If it is just us in the house,
without a kid,

1643
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:25,625
you won't be happy.

1644
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,500
How can I be happy, then?

1645
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,458
You're letting me adopt Jingjai?

1646
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,375
Gosh.

1647
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,416
I tried to sound cool like in a movie.

1648
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:39,125
You really mean it?

1649
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,291
I mean it.

1650
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:47,916
At first, I thought you weren't coming.

1651
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,625
Well, I finished up some old matters.

1652
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,375
That night was nice.

1653
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,541
I could imagine

1654
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:01,333
if we got back together,

1655
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:04,000
how fancy my life would be.

1656
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:05,333
But?

1657
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,500
But that kind of life

1658
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:09,500
isn't real for me anymore.

1659
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:13,708
If this was five years ago

1660
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,458
and I was here with you like this,

1661
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,416
it would be damn great.

1662
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:20,208
I would be number one in the gayniverse.

1663
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:24,625
But right now,

1664
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:25,958
it's not what I want.

1665
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,708
I know now

1666
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,333
what I want in my life.

1667
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,833
And why do you think

1668
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:40,375
I can't give you more than what he can?

1669
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:44,458
The rice with barbecue pork
is in the microwave.

1670
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:53,250
It's like when I stay at a hotel.

1671
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:56,833
Even though, it is more comfortable,

1672
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,125
it can't beat the feeling
of being at home, right?

1673
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,666
But one day, if you're bored at home,

1674
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:11,208
you can sleep at the hotel.

1675
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:15,375
Oh, well.

1676
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:17,708
At least this hotel

1677
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:20,458
did its best to promote itself.

1678
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,333
I have no regrets.

1679
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:25,375
Let's move on.

1680
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,250
Enough!

1681
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,375
Stop!

1682
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:34,958
No contacting each other.

1683
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,166
I'm so afraid Win will catch me.

1684
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:39,916
So...

1685
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:41,916
You cleared up everything?

1686
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:43,125
Yes.

1687
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:44,416
It's all done.

1688
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:47,666
That's good.

1689
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,125
Jingjai.

1690
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:23,666
Go and give Mom and Dad a hug.

1691
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:26,083
Wait. Is it Dad and Dad?

1692
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,333
The kid will get confused.

1693
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:31,333
But you can call me Aunty Golf.

1694
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,875
-Come on.
-Daddy and Mommy.

1695
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:37,541
You can call her Aunty Dumbo.

1696
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,041
-Aunty Dumbo.
-Goodness.

1697
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:41,250
-Don't teach her like that.
-That's right.

1698
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,958
Fairy cautionary tale of the day.

1699
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:47,791
One thing we should avoid
in our lives is lying.

1700
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:49,625
In gayspeak, it's called

1701
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:50,833
being fake.

1702
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:55,416
Because outside of making us
live peacefully,

1703
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:59,041
good things happen to people who are real.

1704
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,500
Natty doesn't have to be fake

1705
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:06,583
to repress her inner self

1706
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:08,708
just to have a baby for her mom anymore.

1707
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:11,666
Now she can balance her life quite well...

1708
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:14,166
Sometimes.

1709
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,125
Aom, what would you like to eat?

1710
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:17,333
I'll get it for you.

1711
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,750
Want to eat a sacred marker sphere?

1712
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,375
The abbot is waiting for you too!

1713
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,458
Mom!

1714
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:22,833
I don't know why you talk so much.

1715
01:38:22,916 --> 01:38:24,375
You talked all night.

1716
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:26,333
You two still can't stop talking.

1717
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:28,416
I'm Golf, Scary Pie.

1718
01:38:28,625 --> 01:38:32,333
Golf's love for Cathy as a devoted fan

1719
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:34,666
has made his dream come true

1720
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:38,000
when Cathy spoke his name in a show.

1721
01:38:38,333 --> 01:38:39,250
Yes.

1722
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,375
He is a makeup artist.

1723
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,250
He's also my fan.

1724
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,791
He's a fan, everyone.

1725
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:49,708
So you must be very upset.

1726
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:52,833
Can I say his name here?

1727
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,166
Golf.

1728
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:58,083
If you are listening...

1729
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:01,583
You mad cow.

1730
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:06,083
I hope I never see you in this life again.

1731
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:15,250
I can die in peace now.

1732
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:18,166
Kim, of course, still has a fake nose.

1733
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:20,166
But what he has for real is

1734
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,416
his instinct to be a steward.

1735
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,541
Though the job caused him
a lot of pain many times,

1736
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:26,666
in the end,

1737
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:29,791
the job came back
to reward him beautifully.

1738
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:30,708
Nat!

1739
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:32,166
The heavens are still on his side

1740
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,500
because no netizen knew

1741
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:38,041
about the incident in the sauna
between Kim and Natty.

1742
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,916
-This time, Kim's heroism
-Wake up!

1743
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,458
caught the eye of the CEO
of a well-known airline.

1744
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:47,458
And was invited to get his wings
to fly again.

1745
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:52,333
As for me,
I stopped faking that I like kids.

1746
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:54,291
And I let my heart go free.

1747
01:39:54,458 --> 01:39:56,000
On days when I can stand it, I do.

1748
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,916
On the days I can't, I admit I can't.

1749
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,166
Who would have thought that one day

1750
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,583
I could enjoy it?

1751
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,875
Are you tossing it out?
You've been using it for ages.

1752
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,208
-Now I'm certain that true love means
-Yes.

1753
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,375
you should only have one love.

1754
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:17,916
Same goes for the only Chanel
with a "G" for Gus in the world.

1755
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,083
G...

1756
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:21,375
-Gay.
-Jingjai.

1757
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,500
No, sweetie. Don't write that.

1758
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,250
-Okay?
-Okay.

1759
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:29,375
Who's being naughty?

1760
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,083
-Are you a bad girl?
-No, she's not.

1761
01:40:55,708 --> 01:40:58,291
As for Nam or Cathy the fake,

1762
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,958
many people wondered how she ended up.

1763
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,875
Nobody knew that

1764
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:05,958
at the moment both of them met
behind the light bulb,

1765
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:08,416
a tragic accident happened to Nam.

1766
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:22,166
But we have to thank
the Superstar package,

1767
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:23,666
Goryah, and Cathy

1768
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:26,541
for giving Nam a new face and life.

1769
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:31,083
By letting Nam be the cook on Cathy's set.

1770
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:32,958
-I'm hungry.
-One second!

1771
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,416
-How about mine?
-One second!

1772
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,916
-Mine too.
-One second!

1773
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,791
Can I have basil with long beans?

1774
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:41,166
With long beans?

1775
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:42,958
-Long beans, mother--
-Nam!

1776
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,583
Is that your mother's recipe?

1777
01:41:48,375 --> 01:41:50,750
Sure. Coming up.

1778
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:54,333
I'm sorry.

1779
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,500
I'm prim, proper,

1780
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:57,625
and polite.

1781
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:59,416
You're Aff Taksaorn.

1782
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:00,833
I'm an airhead.

1783
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:04,000
Ho'some heavenly curry!

1784
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,875
