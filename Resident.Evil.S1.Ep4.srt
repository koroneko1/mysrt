00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,407
Hello, Papa.

2
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:33,159
Did you find work?

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,912
Rent's late again.

4
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,664
I'll take care of it.

5
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,833
How? With your work?

6
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:46,756
I have work.

7
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,511
You know, I've lived here my whole life.

8
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,388
I've watched these corporations come in,

9
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,643
and build their factories
as if we don't exist.

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,813
They say they're giving us opportunities
by creating jobs.

11
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:04,982
And when things go bad,

12
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,611
when people get hurt,

13
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,781
our "saviors" disappear.

14
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,742
They don't care about us,

15
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,370
unless we do something.

16
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,748
Yes?

17
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,716
Tell me about your husband.

18
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:32,844
What was he like?

19
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,099
He was funny.

20
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,518
He loved baseball.

21
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,231
He loved his job.

22
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,903
Was that where…

23
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,657
it happened?

24
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:58,828
He was…

25
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,664
running a test,

26
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,543
and the cage was left open…

27
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,129
and the rat bit him.

28
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,298
He told me…

29
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,134
that it was so fast.

30
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,344
You mentioned…

31
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,680
a rash.

32
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,559
Were there any other symptoms?

33
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,852
Yes.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,689
He complained about flashing lights,

35
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,567
loud noises,

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,152
even the baby would bother him,

37
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,237
and then…

38
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,491
he would get angry all the time.

39
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,620
He became very aggressive.

40
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,623
And these symptoms,

41
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,543
they lasted for three days?

42
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,219
They said he killed people.

43
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,561
You don't believe me, do you?

44
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,609
Of course I believe you.

45
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,291
I found this.

46
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,960
In his things.

47
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,380
People need to know the truth,

48
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,383
because them,

49
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,010
they lie.

50
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,080
Heretics.

51
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,696
Why?

52
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,324
To rid the apple of the worm,
it takes the knife.

53
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,447
Another.
