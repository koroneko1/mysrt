&lrm;you're not jinxed.

&lrm;This time it'll work out.

&lrm;You're wrong, Juleka, you'll see.

&lrm;Sure. We'll do all we can
&lrm;to make sure it goes right.

&lrm;in the centre, look,

&lrm;we're the same size.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660
&lrm;No, go stand in the back row
&lrm;behind the rest.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.300
&lrm;How dare you put me behind the rest?

&lrm;-Do you know who my father is?
&lrm;-Is he a photographer?

&lrm;I really need an assistant.

&lrm;Now hurry up or I'll put you
&lrm;up front with "the babies".

&lrm;[she groans]

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.940
&lrm;You boys, go stand in the middle.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.300
&lrm;It's no big deal, Chloe.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.180
&lrm;As long as
&lrm;we're all on the same photo.

&lrm;Now stop squirming
&lrm;and let's get this photo shot.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.620
&lrm;Excuse me, sir.
&lrm;You forgot Juleka.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.980
&lrm;Sorry, my bad.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.500
&lrm;Go stand in the middle,
&lrm;next to that blond boy.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.740
&lrm;You'll be right in the centre.
&lrm;All eyes will be on you.

&lrm;No more jinxed class photos.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.460
&lrm;This isn't right.
&lrm;Something's wrong.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.420
&lrm;Course it's not working.
&lrm;I'm in the wrong spot.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.900
&lrm;You... move over here, will ya?

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.940
&lrm;Let's see.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.780
&lrm;Excuse me, do we have a problem?

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140
&lrm;[he sighs]
&lrm;It doesn't matter where I put him,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.700
&lrm;it throws the picture out of whack.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.180
&lrm;My spot is unacceptable!

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.540
&lrm;That's right, Juleka.
&lrm;Don't let her push you out the way.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.580
&lrm;Miss Bourgeois, behave yourself.

&lrm;Nobody asked you, loudmouth.

&lrm;This isn't gym class, Chlo'.

&lrm;You, over here...
&lrm;You, here.. and you... here.

&lrm;There, perfect.

&lrm;No... it isn't.
&lrm;It's not perfect at all.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.060
&lrm;I'm totally not next to Adrien.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.940
&lrm;Chloe, we still have
&lrm;16 classes to photograph.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.060
&lrm;Go ahead, Vincent.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.140
&lrm;Say spaghetti.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.140

&lrm;Spaghetti.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.380
&lrm;[moaning]
&lrm;I don't believe it.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.060
&lrm;I'm sorry,
&lrm;I have to fetch another battery.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.900
&lrm;Nobody move!

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.220
&lrm;-Can I go to the bathroom?
&lrm;-Yes, Juleka, but hurry.

&lrm;Miss Bustier, he said nobody move.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.540
&lrm;It's an emergency, Sir.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.460
&lrm;Make sure she...

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.340
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;doesn't come back.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.380
&lrm;Miss Bustier,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.820
&lrm;I need to go too.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.500
&lrm;[she chuckles]

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.420

&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.860
&lrm;What are you doing?
&lrm;Where's Juleka?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.220
&lrm;How did you get here?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.860
&lrm;Who cares?
&lrm;At last I'm in the right spot.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.980
&lrm;Flash me your best smiles.
&lrm;It's the last time we're doing this.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.100
&lrm;[Chloe giggles]

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.180
&lrm;Wait!

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.180
&lrm;Thanks, kids.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.740
&lrm;Wait, please, sir,
&lrm;we have to re-do the photo.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.180
&lrm;-Why?
&lrm;-Because Juleka's not in it.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.060
&lrm;Jula who?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.140
&lrm;Juleka, the tall one
&lrm;with purple streaks.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.660
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Yeah. Where'd she go?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.180
&lrm;Didn't she go to the bathroom?

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.060
&lrm;Mr. Damocles,
&lrm;don't we need to be go to lunch?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.740
&lrm;And aren't you paying
&lrm;the photographer by the hour?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.620
&lrm;Yes, no time to re-take it.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.500
&lrm;Class, move along. Hurry up.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.820
&lrm;OK, lunch break.

&lrm;Juleka?

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.180
&lrm;Juleka? Jule...

&lrm;[sobbing]

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.980
&lrm;Poor, sweet Juleka.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.180
&lrm;I missed the photo, didn't I?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.740
&lrm;Yeah, one of Chloe's tricks.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.060
&lrm;Why should I expect it
&lrm;to be different?

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.620
&lrm;Nobody ever hears me or sees me.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.460
&lrm;I'm invisible... even in photos.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.660
&lrm;Don't say that, Juleka.
&lrm;It's not true.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.820
&lrm;Forget it.
&lrm;As long as Chloe's in the picture,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.700
&lrm;she'll find a way
&lrm;to keep me out of it.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.980
&lrm;No, wait, Juleka!

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.820
&lrm;Really, Rose, forget it.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.180
&lrm;Forget me.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.060
&lrm;Poor girl,
&lrm;feeling so lonely and ignored.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.300
&lrm;How terrible it must be
&lrm;to feel you don't even exist.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.860
&lrm;Come here, my little friend.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.540
&lrm;Fly away, my evil Akuma,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.780
&lrm;and give this transparent soul
&lrm;a voice and a vision!

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.740
&lrm;Juleka's been locked
&lrm;in the bathroom.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.420
&lrm;She really does have
&lrm;the "class photo jinx".

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.100
&lrm;Of course, I should have known
&lrm;Chloe was behind this.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.220
&lrm;We have to break the curse, Rose.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.100
&lrm;-We can ask the photographer.
&lrm;-He won't want to.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.740
&lrm;Unless... If the photo disappeared,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.580
&lrm;they'll have to shoot another one...
&lrm;with Juleka.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.340
&lrm;You're a genius.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.700
&lrm;But why would the photo disappear?

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.740
&lrm;You find Juleka,
&lrm;I'll take care of the rest.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.980
&lrm;She's not ruining
&lrm;my photo next to Adrien.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.460
&lrm;Think of something, fast.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.340
&lrm;Reflekta, I am Hawk Moth.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.540
&lrm;From now on,
&lrm;you will be the only one people see.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.060
&lrm;No-one will ever ignore you again.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.460
&lrm;However, you must do me a favour
&lrm;in return... when the time comes.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.780
&lrm;Yes, Hawk Moth.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.340
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;So...

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.020
&lrm;the camera stays
&lrm;in the principal's office

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
&lrm;during lunch break.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.980
&lrm;I refuse to be part of this.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.100
&lrm;There's no time.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.460
&lrm;We must break the "class photo jinx"
&lrm;before the photographer leaves.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.700
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;OK.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.460
&lrm;There must be
&lrm;another way, Marinette.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.580
&lrm;Where... where am I?

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.820
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Pound it!

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.660
&lrm;Could you take this girl
&lrm;back to school, please?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.700
&lrm;Yes, of course, Ladybug.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.460
&lrm;Thank you.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.860
&lrm;See you later, Cat Noir.
&lrm;Bug out.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.820
&lrm;You might have pulled
&lrm;it off today, Ladybug,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.260
&lrm;but everything isn't always
&lrm;as it seems.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.580
&lrm;Watch out Ladybug,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.020
&lrm;I'll destroy you
&lrm;when you least expect it.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.260
&lrm;You were right, Tikki.
&lrm;Stealing this was wrong.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.380
&lrm;You won't erase the photo?

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.180
&lrm;No, I've got another idea
&lrm;which I think you'll approve of.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.340
&lrm;That's my girl.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.820
&lrm;Here, you can have this back.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.380
&lrm;Ready?

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.180
&lrm;Hey, you dropped this.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.780
&lrm;[he sighs]
&lrm;Grazie.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.060
&lrm;I know you're busy

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.500
&lrm;but a girl wasn't
&lrm;in the photo you took.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.980
&lrm;Can we do it again?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.380
&lrm;Well... I'm already running late,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.060
&lrm;with everything
&lrm;that's been going on and...

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.380
&lrm;Mr. Damocles.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.740
&lrm;I understand but...
&lrm;could you do it after school?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.620
&lrm;We could do it in the park.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.260
&lrm;Well...

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.300
&lrm;We want an awesome photo
&lrm;by the best photographer.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.420
&lrm;Please.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.500
&lrm;Well, when you put it that way,

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.780
&lrm;OK!

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.940
&lrm;OK, we're all good here.
&lrm;Ready?

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.900
&lrm;This was a good idea, Marinette.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.900
&lrm;Thanks, Adrien.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.180
&lrm;Like I'd want to be part
&lrm;of their stupid photo anyway.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.980
&lrm;Ridiculous... utterly ridiculous.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.460
&lrm;The "class photo curse" is broken.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.100
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.
