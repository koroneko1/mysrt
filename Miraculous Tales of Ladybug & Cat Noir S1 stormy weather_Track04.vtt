&lrm;Come on. Let's go back.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.540
&lrm;I wanna go on the merry-go-round.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.460
&lrm;No, no, not right now.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.380
&lrm;I've gotta get back to Adrien.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.060
&lrm;You promised.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.020
&lrm;You aren't going to break
&lrm;your promise, are you?

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.620
&lrm;Oh please, not the baby-doll eyes.
&lrm;You know I can't say no to...

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.620
&lrm;[caring sigh]

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.740
&lrm;[Manon giggles]

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.820
&lrm;[angry groan]
&lrm;[child sobs]

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.940
&lrm;Here's a new one.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.380
&lrm;[camera clicks]

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.460
&lrm;No, no.
&lrm;Ze boy haz eaten too much spaghetti.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.580
&lrm;We needz more energy... more romance.

&lrm;We needz...

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.660
&lrm;a girl.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.220
&lrm;You, I need an extra.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.580
&lrm;Who? Me?

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.860
&lrm;Si, to pose wiz Mr. Adrien.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.180
&lrm;You don't want me. I...

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.740
&lrm;I'm having an allergic reaction
&lrm;to this apple.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.340
&lrm;[speaking with a lisp]
&lrm;I know jutht the perthon.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.100
&lrm;[puffing and panting]

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.340
&lrm;They need an extra
&lrm;to pose with Adrien.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.900
&lrm;What? Seriously?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.780
&lrm;Is that boy your boyfriend?

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.540
&lrm;What? No... I mean, yes... No.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.540
&lrm;Go on. What're you waiting for?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.660
&lrm;But what about Manon?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.900
&lrm;You take care of Prince Charming,
&lrm;I'll take care of Miss Unicorn.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.060
&lrm;You don't know how to control her anyway.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.860
&lrm;No way! Marinette's my babysitter.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.180
&lrm;Trust me.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.780
&lrm;Unicorns unite.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.900
&lrm;Let's go to Reespa
&lrm;and find some sad village kids

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.300
&lrm;and grant them those wishes. Yee-haw!

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.900
&lrm;Yee-haw!

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.060
&lrm;[Manon giggles]

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.740

&lrm;Run!

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.340
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.180
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.740
&lrm;[crowd screams]

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.740
&lrm;[explosions]

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.420

&lrm;Plagg? Plagg!

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.500
&lrm;I'm not here. I'm sleeping.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.660
&lrm;[excited cry]

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.220
&lrm;[he sighs]

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.740
&lrm;For your information,
&lrm;I can smell camembert in my sleep.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.580
&lrm;It's one of my many talents.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.020
&lrm;Great, but there's no time
&lrm;to talk cheese.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.900
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.460
&lrm;Why did I leave Manon?
&lrm;I should have never done that.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.380
&lrm;No, Alya's right.
&lrm;She's in good hands. I must trust her.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.220
&lrm;I'll get you out of here!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.660
&lrm;Let's wire-cut this icy cake.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.020
&lrm;[she groans]

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.980
&lrm;Or not... On to plan B.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.100
&lrm;Don't worry. It will be OK.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.940
&lrm;Where's Marinette?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.660
&lrm;She hasn't forgotten you, Manon.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.660
&lrm;How did you know my name?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.020
&lrm;I... I... Marinette told me.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.580
&lrm;She's coming right back, OK?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.500
&lrm;[Ladybug chuckles]

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.540
&lrm;[explosions]

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.980
&lrm;Hey, Ice Queen.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.620
&lrm;What's with all the terrorizing?

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.580
&lrm;Why don't you pick on someone
&lrm;your own temperature?

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.180
&lrm;My name is not Ice Queen,
&lrm;it's Stormy Weather!

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.780
&lrm;Listen, I'm feline
&lrm;more generous than usual, today.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.340
&lrm;So cool down, and we'll call it quits. 'K?

&lrm;[groaning]

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.020
&lrm;I thought cats
&lrm;always landed on their feet.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.740
&lrm;Why thanks, M'Ladybug,
&lrm;but I had it covered.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.020
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.620
&lrm;No time for your childish charm,
&lrm;Cat Noir, but you're welcome.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.580
&lrm;We should be expecting lightning storms,
&lrm;like, right now!

&lrm;Hey, no fair. You always win...

&lrm;[ice cracks]

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.580
&lrm;What was that?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.740
&lrm;It's...

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.980
&lrm;It's the big Goblin King.
&lrm;He ate too much and split his shirt.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.820
&lrm;[she roars]

&lrm;[rumbling]

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.580
&lrm;Wanna hear a story?

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.820
&lrm;You've shown them all
&lrm;who the real winner is, my Weathergirl,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.180
&lrm;but now is the time for you
&lrm;to fulfil your part of the agreement,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.020
&lrm;and here's my plan.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.100
&lrm;Maybe she's got anger issues.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.820
&lrm;Or she failed her driving test.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.780

<i>&lrm;Summer vacation is officially over.</i>

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.820
&lrm;Already?
&lrm;But I look so good in a swimsuit.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.940
&lrm;The cat suit will do, thanks.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.340
&lrm;At least now we know where to find her.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.060
<i>&lrm;Prepare for the worst weather ever</i>
<i>&lrm;with 10 ft. snowdrifts.</i>

&lrm;Hey. That girl reminds me of someone.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.620
&lrm;It's her.
&lrm;The Akuma must be in her parasol.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.180
<i>&lrm;In Stormy Weather's world,</i>

&lrm;[they roar]

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.780
&lrm;It's a recording.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.620

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.860
&lrm;[they gasp]

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.740
&lrm;This is all going
&lrm;wonderfully according to plan.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.500
&lrm;Soon their Miraculous will be mine.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.460
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Bring them to me!

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.580
&lrm;[cackling]

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.980
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Frosty the Snowgirl's getting away.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.140
&lrm;Do I hear a damsel in distress?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.220
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;Some of us don't have night vision.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380
&lrm;No need to bug out. Just trust me.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.180
&lrm;Then the cyclops monster picked
&lrm;the princess up and said,

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.980
&lrm;"Look into my eye."

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.380
&lrm;[Manon giggles]

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.340
&lrm;Then she stuck a finger right in it.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.300
&lrm;As soon as she took a bite
&lrm;of the cursed potato,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.020
&lrm;the poor princess
&lrm;fell into a deep, deep sleep.

&lrm;[creaking]
&lrm;[they gasp]

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.380
&lrm;[fearfully] Hurry up, Ladybug.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.940
&lrm;[Ladybug] OK, I think I can manage to...

&lrm;[Cat Noir] Duck!

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.860
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;I'll follow your lead on this one

&lrm;[cackling]

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.340
&lrm;You airheads, you fell right into my trap.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.580
&lrm;The time is now. Bring me the Miraculous!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.460
&lrm;There's no way out! Party's over, fools.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.740
&lrm;We're just...

&lrm;[he chuckles]

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.780

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.580
&lrm;A bath towel? What do I do with this?

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.260
&lrm;Great. We're about to be obliterated
&lrm;but... at least we'll be dry.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.420
&lrm;Just hold your whiskers.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420
&lrm;Hey!

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.100
&lrm;So what's the plan?
&lrm;My arm's starting to get cramp.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.060
&lrm;See that sign? Check it out.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.500
&lrm;Alright!

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.540
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.300
&lrm;Hey, Coldilocks,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.060
&lrm;is that all you've got?

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.740
&lrm;[she squeals]

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.780
&lrm;Get out of here, you nasty bug.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.980
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.980
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.980
&lrm;Gotcha.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.020
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.380
&lrm;Miraculous, Ladybug!

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.940
&lrm;[sparkling]

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.060
&lrm;[whooshing]
&lrm;[sparkling]

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.540
&lrm;[hissing]

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.500
&lrm;And after defeating
&lrm;the three-headed dragon...

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.100
&lrm;with taekwondo...

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.580
&lrm;the princess kissed
&lrm;her Prince Charming and...

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.500
&lrm;They lived happily ever after?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.780
&lrm;[hesitantly] Sure...

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.420
&lrm;until they had little monkeys
&lrm;like you who drove them crazy.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.380
&lrm;[Manon chuckles]

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.740
&lrm;[she gasps] What am I doing up here?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.260
&lrm;[together] Pound it.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.940
&lrm;Someday, your Miraculous will be all mine.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.420
&lrm;I don't care how many enemies I need
&lrm;to throw at you to win,

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.180
&lrm;but I will be victorious!

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.380
&lrm;[panting]

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.940
&lrm;Hey, there's the photographer
&lrm;and Adrien waiting for you.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.820
&lrm;It's not too late?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.140
&lrm;Come on, Marinette,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.860
&lrm;you saved Manon
&lrm;and the whole world for that matter.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.060
&lrm;Have some fun.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.500
&lrm;[Manon] Marinette!

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.220
&lrm;[giggling]

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.620
&lrm;I know what your secret is.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.100
&lrm;Wh... What secret?

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.460
&lrm;Ladybug is your best friend.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.700
&lrm;That's how you always know
&lrm;what the other one's gonna do.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.180
&lrm;[relieved sigh]

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.580
&lrm;Can I have a lollipop? Can I?

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.540
&lrm;-Can I? Can I?
&lrm;-No, Manon. I've something to do.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.460
&lrm;Alya, you'll watch her, yeah?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.860
&lrm;I'm ready for the photo shoot.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.820
&lrm;Wait. Who iz zat... angel?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.780
&lrm;[photographer giggles] Angel... magnifico.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.500
&lrm;[Marinette sighs]

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.020
&lrm;[photographer giggles]
