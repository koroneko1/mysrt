1
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,417
Isn't the reunion this year so grand,
Moddum?

2
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:17,292
It's a big party,

3
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:22,207
and we are overdressed.
I'm so exhausted after all I had to do.

4
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:28,000
Alright. Just pull over here.

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,707
Welcome.

6
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:43,125
Why isn't so marvelous?
I'm envious.

7
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,582
Of course, Prisana. Pong is very rich.

8
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,082
-Welcome.
-Please come in.

9
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,007
-Let me help you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,250
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

11
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,292
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen

12
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:16,417
to our blue-grey,
Poraminwittayakom School Reunion Party.

13
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,917
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
to our Poraminwittayakom Reunion Party.

14
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,542
Please welcome everyone
to the party. Applause.

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,957
Applause, please.

16
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:29,417
Alright, before we continue,

17
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,125
we'd like to welcome our seniors,
who are our role models.

18
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,832
They will join us here
to give a short speech.

19
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,542
Before we start the party,
we have some seniors

20
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,457
who've been idolized by everyone.

21
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,167
We welcome them today.

22
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:47,375
Without further ado,
please welcome our three seniors.

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,667
Welcome.

24
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:52,457
Good evening.

25
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:58,542
Hi, everybody. My name is Taew.

26
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,792
In fact, our school is an all-boys school,

27
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,707
but they turn to ladies after graduating.

28
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,832
Moddum, say something.

29
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:13,542
-I'll just sing you a song.
-Don't sing. Who said you could sing?

30
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,457
-This is Kapoo.
-I'm Kapoo.

31
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:20,000
Over there is my son, Kouy.

32
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,750
Please clap your hands for Kouy.

33
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,792
So cute.

34
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,875
Moddum, stop singing.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,832
-Such a star crusher.
-Let's go and talk to them.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,125
Have some fun.

37
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:36,542
-This is a reunion party.
-Please clap your hands for our seniors.

38
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,167
Thank you for joining us.

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,625
-Kouy, bring me a glass of wine.
-Yes, Mom.

40
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,167
Are you Taew?

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,875
Yes.

42
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,417
Can you do me a favor?

43
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,667
-Who are you?
-My name is Pudsorn.

44
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,375
I'm from this school.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,582
-Excuse me. Cheers.
-Cheers.

46
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,375
Welcome.

47
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,042
Hello, Pancake.

48
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,707
Hi. Cheers.

49
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,375
Looks like she's met her rival.

50
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,625
Excuse me. Don't you toast me?
Do I know you?

51
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm Pookan.

52
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,000
Pookan!

53
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,541
What's your name?

54
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,583
Tangkaew.

55
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,250
Tangtong. I remember you.

56
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,458
Don't tell me that both of you are...

57
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,083
I'm her husband.

58
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,041
-No way.
-Okay.

59
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,583
-Taew! Moddum!
-What? I'm here.

60
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,500
-You better deal with this.
-I heard you. I'm on my way.

61
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,500
-Something disgraceful happened.
-We'll catch up later.

62
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,083
-Taew!
-Okay! Let's go.

63
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,458
-Where are you going?
-Pancake wants us there.

64
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,166
What's going on?

65
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:14,166
-Look who's here.
-Who are you, bitch?

66
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,291
-I'm Tangkaew.
-You look like Tangtong.

67
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,666
Are you Tangtong?

68
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right. The guy you jumped on
with G-string in Korea. Idiot!

69
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,458
How do you end up like this?

70
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,291
Who are these bitches?

71
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,250
-We are your juniors.
-Juniors?

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,375
-I'm Prisana.
-Prisana.

73
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,666
-Hi, sister.
-What's your name?

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,916
Ratanawadee.

75
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,083
-Juniors my ass, you look older than me.
-Older my ass!

76
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,750
-Whoa, bitches.
-We'll talk later.

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,000
Calm down, let's deal with this later.

78
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,208
Let me deal with Tangtong first.

79
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,083
-Come here.
-What, Pancake?

80
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,541
-And who is that?
-Don't you remember? It's Pookan.

81
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,500
-Pookan? Moddum, Pookan.
-Pookan, to paint what?

82
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,416
-Paint your mom's face, bitch. Pookan.
-Yes, sis.

83
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,625
You've turn my ex-husband

84
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,875
into your current wife.

85
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,166
-That's low! Low!
-Him?

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,833
-No, you!
-What a drama!

87
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,583
Do you want to know why? You wanted him
so bad back then, didn't you?

88
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,250
I didn't sleep with him, you did.

89
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,083
-You have a baby with him. I know.
-Pookan.

90
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,875
Let's go.
I don't want to argue with a retard.

91
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,458
-She's a bitch too.
-How about our baby?

92
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,833
Who cares?

93
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,625
Pancake.

94
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,083
-It breaks my heart.
-I'm devastated.

95
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,708
Pancake.

96
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,541
-What the fuck are you laughing at?
-At that shithead, that's all.

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,166
-Pancake, just calm down.
-Tangtong.

98
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,458
Pancake, let me take care of these two.

99
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,750
-Tangtong.
-While I was studying here,

100
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,916
nobody would defy me.

101
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,625
My friends are even worse.

102
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,875
Pancake, I'm in trouble.

103
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:10,166
-Let me cheer myself up.
-Whenever she drinks,

104
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,500
hell rises.

105
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,958
Look at her.

106
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,791
Hey, Pancake. Slap her!

107
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,000
-Bitch!
-You left me.

108
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,875
Pancake.

109
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,208
-Tangtong.
-Hurry up! Excuse me.

110
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,083
Where are you going?

111
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,791
Tangtong.

112
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,416
-Hello. Ladies and gentlemen...
-Take care of Pancake, please.

113
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm Usasawan,

114
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,416
the only sister
of this school's principal.

115
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,750
I'd like to end this celebration.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,875
What?

117
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,666
Don't ask me why.

118
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,458
Well, the thing is the principal...

119
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,375
doesn't feel very well,

120
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,333
and she cannot join the party.

121
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,750
So...

122
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,666
ladies and gentlemen,

123
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,958
don't waste your time here.

124
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,833
Let's find some appetizers to eat.

125
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,000
Please leave.

126
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,583
What is this?

127
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,375
-You want us to go home like this?
-Tangtong.

128
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,958
Explain to me!
How do you become his bitch?

129
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,916
Tangtong!

130
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:48,167
Here we are, at our school.

131
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,957
It's so beautiful.

132
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:57,250
What's that?

133
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:00,625
-I don't know. Will I be arrested?
-It's gone.

134
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,667
Pancake. Don't you have a sixth sense?

135
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:05,500
Don't you? Let's get inside.

136
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,332
I see a car.
Taew and her friends are here.

137
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,082
Miss Taew is arriving.

138
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:20,667
Orachorn, Hyena, come on.

139
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,125
Don't slack off.

140
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,292
Hyena, don't you think
you should spit it off?

141
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:32,250
Why are you still sitting there
with that corpse-like face?

142
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,125
Go open the gate.

143
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:37,625
You are not my superior
to start ordering us around.

144
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,917
There's no question that I am.
My height and beauty have no equal.

145
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,250
-Bitch!
-Look, they opened the gate for us.

146
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,417
Hey, who's arriving so late?

147
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,042
Well, I don't know.

148
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:04,542
Sis, this place is so cute.

149
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:07,875
So vintage. It's all you.

150
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,667
Pancake,
you can be cute when you talk nice.

151
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,207
-Isn't that right, bitch?
-There.

152
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,582
Welcome everyone
to Poraminwittayakom school.

153
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,125
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

154
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:25,000
Welcome you all
to Porminwittayakom school.

155
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,375
Sis, the four-eyed one,

156
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,625
his mom must have slept
with a westerner.

157
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,542
Pancake, don't talk shit.
He might hear you.

158
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,707
No, he won’t.
Otherwise, he would have fired back.

159
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,125
But that tall bitch looks sharp-tongued.

160
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,707
It's happening. We're fucked.

161
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,207
This place is really haunted.

162
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,707
Haunted my ass.
Don't you see? It's the wind.

163
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,042
-The wind?
-Did you see your dad do it?

164
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,457
Sis. Up there. Look up.

165
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,292
-Look up for the lotto?
-No, bitch!

166
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,167
Shouldn't we go inside?

167
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,917
If we are standing here talking,

168
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,125
why don't we just order rice noodles

169
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,542
with fish curry and eat here?

170
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:32,292
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Please come inside. Please.

171
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,707
-Taew.
-Yes?

172
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,707
-What?
-Your luggage.

173
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,667
Thank you. Bitch.

174
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,332
Let me open it for you.

175
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,167
-Miss Moddum, your bag.
-Please.

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Welcome, madam. Welcome, miss.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you here?

178
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,707
We'll see.

179
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:26,417
Ark, hurry up.

180
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,167
Thee, Krish, are you done?
The master is calling us.

181
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:37,917
-Let's go.
-I'm ready, Ark.

182
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,207
Pat, hurry up!

183
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,625
-Oh, David.
-Hey, Ark.

184
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,125
Something wrong? Why does the master
want us here with such urgency?

185
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:54,707
I have no idea.

186
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,832
We'll find out. Let's go.

187
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:00,832
Hello, boys.

188
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:04,167
I'm Taew. I'll be your teacher.

189
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:07,832
And this is my son.

190
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,667
His name is Kouy.

191
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,957
Hello.

192
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,082
Kouy, say hello to everyone.

193
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,625
Hello, everybody, I'm Kouy.

194
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,707
Kouy is your senior.

195
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,875
I'd like you to show him some respect.

196
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,250
Don't mess with Kouy. Don't pick on Kouy.

197
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,832
I can't speak clearly.

198
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:36,792
-And this is Pancake.
-Sis!

199
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:39,957
They can't see me.

200
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,542
Can you see her, boys?

201
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:44,875
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,167
Your spell is a bit rusty lately.

203
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,042
Hey, Giraffe. You can you see me, right?

204
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,582
I saw you since you came in.

205
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:01,375
But I didn't know you could talk.
I thought you were a lump of something.

206
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,332
Bitch!

207
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:06,125
I think you've met your soul mate.

208
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,207
-Sis.
-What?

209
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:12,250
-Didn't we see her last night?
-Yes.

210
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,332
I thought it was a ghost.
Scared the shit out of me.

211
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:20,207
-Who is this ostrich?
-Don't say that.

212
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,542
This is Principal
Panaraiprakaimas-wasanachalalai.

213
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,832
She looks too old.

214
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,417
What now?

215
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,292
-Everybody.
-Ready?

216
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,667
-Come.
-Touch my arm.

217
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,292
Come on.

218
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,417
Which temple do you keep her body?

219
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,042
I'm...

220
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,625
I am alive.

221
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,332
And this is the principal's daughter.
Miss...

222
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,750
-Nuanpong.
-Hello.

223
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,667
-Hello.
-Really? Her daughter?

224
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,125
-This is her daughter?
-Beautiful...

225
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:04,292
like... her mother.

226
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,167
Sis, with that kind of face
she must be an IVF baby.

227
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,750
Hey, you...

228
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,417
should...

229
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,582
study hard.

230
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,667
The new...

231
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,042
teacher...

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,082
is here. Don't...

233
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,000
-ruin our...
-She's not done yet?

234
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,457
...school's name.

235
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,792
Are you okay, Mom?

236
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,707
My medicine.

237
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:55,667
Yeah, good fetch.

238
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:03,125
Honey, take...

239
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,042
me...

240
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,000
-to rest.
-She's out. Go, go.

241
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,000
-Let's go, Mom.
-Take her to rest.

242
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,750
She looks like a dying old monk.

243
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,042
-Honey.
-Yes?

244
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,542
Are you okay, Mom? Mom!

245
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:23,832
The old monk is dead.

246
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,167
We'll take you to see the next room.

247
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,832
For now,
we're going to see the next room.

248
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,707
Kouy, translate.

249
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,957
Okay. Let's take a look
at the next room.

250
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,625
The next room
is still the student dormitory.

251
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,667
The next room
is still the student dormitory.

252
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,582
The next room
is still the student dormitory.

253
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:56,000
We only allow for students per room.

254
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,417
We only allow for students per room.
we only allow four students to live in.

255
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,792
Let him speak English first,
then you can translate.

256
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,583
Again.

257
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,250
We only allow for students per room.

258
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,541
We only allow for students per room.

259
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,875
Well?

260
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,208
Mom, Can he say again?

261
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,166
-I can't remember.
-Mom.

262
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,833
We only allow for students per room.

263
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,750
Only four people
can stay in each the room.

264
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,916
Oh, my God! Such good English.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,208
-You're welcome.
-Oxford.

266
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,625
-Massachusetts.
-Oxford. That's why.

267
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,916
Oxford, Massachusetts.

268
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,458
Okay. Let's have a look at the next area.
Follow me.

269
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,458
Don't let me down
and embarrassed.

270
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:55,250
-Don't "wally," Mom. Don't "wally."
-"Worry." Moron.

271
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,625
-Master Shawn.
-Yes?

272
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,083
-Are you meditating?
-Yes.

273
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,000
-They are here.
-I know.

274
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,500
I saw them last night.
Tonight,

275
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,500
I'll do them good.

276
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,958
When you are done with them,

277
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,333
don't forget to do me.

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,958
Master Shawn...

279
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,333
I think your hair is a bit too long.

280
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,166
You should get a haircut.

281
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to tuck it
behind my ear.

282
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,708
Master Shawn.

283
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,458
Oops, it got loosened.

284
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,000
What are we having
for lunch today?

285
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:08,958
Man.

286
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,541
Oh, Taechin? Close the door.

287
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,333
The bow got loosened.

288
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,291
What?

289
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
Sorry.

290
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,541
You are such a nuisance, bitch.

291
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,791
Those two look suspicious.

292
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,750
Hey, Kouy. Where are you going?

293
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,458
I'm going to the principal's office.
Miss Usasawan,

294
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,166
how come you can speak Esarn?

295
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,083
Just a little, little bit, a little more.

296
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,041
Little bit, little more
Little bit, little more

297
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,791
Well then,
please bring tea to the principal.

298
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,166
It's a good tea, from abroad.

299
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,666
-She'd better drink the whole pot.
-Alright.

300
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,416
It's not locked, come in.

301
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,500
Oh, Kouy.

302
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,541
-How can I help you?
-I met Usasawan.

303
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,458
She asked me
to bring this imported tea to you.

304
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,291
Thank you.

305
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,791
-Kouy, have a seat.
-Yes.

306
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,458
How old are you?

307
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,041
-I'm 22 turning 23, ma'am.
-Kouy.

308
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,958
You already look 35-40, Kouy.

309
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,416
Thanks to the cream
my mom bought from abroad.

310
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,333
Do you have a girlfriend?

311
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,750
I haven't really thought about that.

312
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,041
What type of girl do you like?

313
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,708
I don't really have a type.

314
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,833
Just someone I can talk to,
and can get along with my mom.

315
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,791
I'll take her.

316
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,291
-How long?
-Seven inches... Almost eight.

317
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,041
-I mean your fingers.
-Oh, just the regular ten fingers.

318
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,833
-And how big?
-Big enough.

319
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,291
-I mean your fingers.
-Oh.

320
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,833
Let me have a look.

321
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,166
They are extraordinary.
They are very big.

322
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,458
I think you should drink this tea.

323
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,208
Usasawan said
you should drink the whole pot

324
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,500
for your good health.

325
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,666
Thank you, thank you.

326
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,833
Drink it, Mom. It seems
Usasawan cares for you very much.

327
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,625
-Will you blow it for me?
-Let me blow it.

328
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,708
It's not too hot now.

329
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,791
Please excuse me,
if there is nothing else?

330
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,916
Of course.

331
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,666
Nuanpong. What do you think of Kouy?

332
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,125
-Do you like him?
-He is nice.

333
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,833
Polite and well-mannered.

334
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,625
-Do you want me to blow it?
-Yes, please.

335
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,958
Tea from abroad.

336
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,458
Pretty girl,
always pretty in whatever you do.

337
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,791
Hold hands,
close your eyes and stay focused.

338
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,291
Let's begin.

339
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,375
Who is it?

340
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,875
You are good,
spontaneous like an insurance agent.

341
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,375
Bitch! I haven't done anything yet.

342
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,333
-So who called her then?
-Stop complimenting me.

343
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,291
Enough! Whatever you said, we got it.
Come here and sit down.

344
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,500
Songkram, you're silly.
Palms up, hold together.

345
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,875
Close your eyes. Concentrate.

346
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,583
-What the hell?
-Oh, my God.

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,166
-Bitch! Damn it!
-What are you doing?

348
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,500
I almost have a heart attack.
I'm calling...

349
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,375
Sonklin to ask what trouble she is in.

350
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,416
You are calling Sonklin.
Do you think you are a psychic, bitch?

351
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,333
No.

352
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,708
Let me do this.

353
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,791
Sonklin.

354
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,166
-Sonklin.
-Pancake.

355
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,958
She'll come just by calling out her name?

356
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,708
-Yes. If you want to, then do it. Why?
-Sis.

357
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,958
Why are we sitting here holding hands?

358
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,250
I didn't know that shouting trick.
You call her.

359
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:44,000
Sonklin. Sonklin. Sonklin.

360
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,666
I know you are here.

361
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,625
Come out now, bitch.

362
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:57,000
You, why do you call me?
You, you, you.

363
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,833
Sis. Don't be such a liar.

364
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,750
-She is above your head.
-Where?

365
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,916
Big eyes.

366
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,541
Pull me, pull me. Come on!

367
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,750
Hello.

368
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,458
-Why are you here?
-Hey, bitch.

369
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,958
-Didn't you call her?
-Mom is over there.

370
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,666
I'm sorry. Do me a favor.

371
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,041
Why did you slap me, Kouy.

372
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,833
Pancake asked me to.

373
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,541
-Why did you call me?
-Well, we...

374
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,791
we are performing the ritual
to call you and ask if you need help.

375
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,125
The thing is...

376
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,166
I do need your help.

377
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:59,416
It's so loud.
Where has she gone?

378
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,791
Somebody summoned her back.

379
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,916
Girls, spread out and help her.

380
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,458
-Kouy.
-I'm here.

381
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,125
I have something...
Come here. Why don't you stand here?

382
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,750
Where are all the students?
Nobody is here, Kouy.

383
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,625
Do they see us, Kouy?

384
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,291
-Yes.
-Who?

385
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:31,041
-There are two of them?
-Two of them see us?

386
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,250
-Who?
-It's you and me.

387
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,666
-Apart from both of us.
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

388
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,041
Taew looks strange.

389
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,291
-Mom, somebody is in the room.
-Keep your voice down.

390
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,541
The other day,

391
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,666
she came around my room.

392
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:55,291
And when I had a meal,
she stood there and stared at me.

393
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,791
Yeah, I had that too.
When I went to the bathroom,

394
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,166
I saw Taew came in too.

395
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,208
Miss Taew!

396
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,041
She might just want to see your thing.

397
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
I won't let her.

398
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,416
If it was the principal's daughter or Ew,
the cook's daughter,

399
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:17,916
I would let them in a heartbeat.

400
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,791
Kouy, kneel down.

401
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,750
I'll step on you, Kouy.

402
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,083
What did I do wrong?

403
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:32,250
I mean climb over you, on your shoulders.
Not on your little Kouy.

404
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,041
-Got that?
-She is a ladyboy.

405
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,166
I don't think so.

406
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,083
When I was changing,
she was peeking at the door.

407
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,250
You step on my head.

408
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Miss, what are you doing?

409
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,875
Where has she gone?

410
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,708
Kouy, hurry up.

411
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:07,166
-I was so frightened, Pancake.
-Frightened?

412
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,958
So fearful, huh?

413
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,375
You have been peeking around.

414
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:15,166
-What are you looking for?
-I am here for a reason, Pancake.

415
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:19,708
I promised Pudsorn
that I would investigate her death.

416
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,041
-I have to help her.
-Is your dad detective Conan?

417
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:25,291
My dad is not detective Conan,

418
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:30,083
-but my son is Kouy.
-Your son?

419
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,208
-He sucks.
-Pancake.

420
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,583
One day I'll make you my husband.

421
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,708
How about cross-dressing?

422
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,291
Let me rephrase. Pancake,

423
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,375
one day I will force
the husband-hood into you.

424
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,375
Yeah?

425
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:46,875
Want to try me?

426
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,166
Look at your son, Taew.
Look at your son.

427
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,541
You don't need to be so ready.

428
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,500
Why are you horny now?

429
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,625
Can you keep it for another time?

430
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,000
You want to be her husband,
and it has to be now?

431
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,916
You son is useless, sis.

432
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,000
My daughter is better.

433
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Angel doll.

434
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,791
Hey. I thought it was a daughter.
Now it's an angel's doll?

435
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:16,875
What is it exactly?

436
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,583
No, this is my daughter.
But she's called angel doll, bitch!

437
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,000
You are so thick, aren't you?

438
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,500
What is it, honey?

439
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,625
-I'm talking to your aunt.
-Am I her aunt now?

440
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,750
I'm talking to your aunt. It's alright.
Quiet, don't cry.

441
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,333
-Listen, sis.
-What?

442
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:38,000
While I'm not around,
please take care of my baby.

443
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:42,625
And if you would like to see me,
you can talk to me through her, okay?

444
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,875
-Talk through her?
-You sure can.

445
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,291
-Come to stay with me.
-Stay with aunty, okay?

446
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:52,958
-Come here, stay with me.
-She loves you.

447
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,916
From now on, I will call you...

448
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:01,875
-Pancake.
-That's so cute.

449
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,625
Pancake, Pancake. Bitch!

450
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,541
Are you calling me bitch?

451
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,791
-No, her.
-I see.

452
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,750
Yes.

453
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:15,291
-She's just kidding.
-How are you, Pancake?

454
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:19,250
-You hoe!
-Are you calling me a hoe?

455
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,416
-No, her.
-I see.

456
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,083
-Your daughter.
-It's okay.

457
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,750
Slut!

458
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:29,083
-Are you calling her a slut?
-No, you. Slut!

459
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,250
Mom!

460
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,166
Bitch. Hoe. Slut.

461
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,666
Sis. You cursed me.

462
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,916
How dare you retort to me? Bitch!

463
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:12,958
Hello, sis.

464
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,208
Sis. You can walk.

465
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:23,208
Yes, I can... long time ago.

466
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,916
Not only I can walk,

467
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,958
I even disappear some nights.

468
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,458
You are always joking with me.

469
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,125
When will you stop wearing
a wedding dress?

470
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,583
How long has it been?

471
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,875
It's been over 60 years.
How could you not forget?

472
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,458
-Sis.
-Fifty-nine years.

473
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,208
Whatever. He won't come back.

474
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,791
Who will come back?

475
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,708
Look at the bride's face,
it's like a corpse.

476
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,791
I have to wait.

477
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:05,333
Trust me, sis. Don't wait.
He will never return.

478
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,916
How about I get you some tea?

479
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,083
I'll get it for you. Just take a seat.

480
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,083
Here is the principal's office.

481
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,583
Aunty, is there anyone inside?

482
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:23,041
Don't be scared.

483
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,875
If we can get inside...
Do you see Jeakjeak here?

484
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:31,833
He's going to help us hide from them.
Trust me. Right, Jeakjeak?

485
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,625
He is nodding.

486
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,625
Aoi, please take care of Jeakjeak.

487
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,833
You got that too?

488
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,333
Here it is.

489
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,625
I prepared it specially for you.

490
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,500
The tea from the best plant.

491
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,125
-A tea plant?
-No, an auto plant.

492
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:56,375
-Why didn't you get it from a tea plant?
-Actually,

493
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,708
I tried to find them at the market.

494
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:02,375
I walked around the market, but I got lost
and end up in the auto plant.

495
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:07,125
-I'm so lucky that I found the way back.
-You were looking for the tea plants,

496
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,791
-and ended up with the auto plants.
-Yes.

497
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,583
Drink it up.

498
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,333
Don't tell me you are dead.

499
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,625
Sleep.

500
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,458
Can you find it?

501
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,333
Deputy Usasawanjanrai.

502
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:45,958
I'm here.
But what are you doing in this room?

503
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,250
Well, I'm lost.

504
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,541
-Lost.
-Lost?

505
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,458
-Lost with your nephew?
-We are both lost.

506
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,875
-Lost.
-Lost with Kouy, ma'am.

507
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:01,750
Well then, which door did you get in?

508
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,458
-Which one?
-I can't remember, aunty.

509
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:12,458
-I'm lost.
-Go back wherever you came in then.

510
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,083
Sure. Let's go.

511
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,375
This is the principal.

512
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,625
Guys,

513
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,541
does anyone know about Sonklin?

514
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,416
How did she die?

515
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,041
Why are you guys so frightened?

516
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,208
Shut up! Why are you screaming?
Are your nuts?

517
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,708
-I'm scared.
-You are scarier.

518
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:14,583
-Come here.
-The black dog is sleeping...

519
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:21,208
under the green tree. The yellow
bananas are in the red bowl.

520
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:26,458
Teaw. We have a situation.

521
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,375
Kouy, you said your mom was sleeping.

522
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:34,500
Teaw, the principal's sister,
she must be bad.

523
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,791
-How do you know?
-Well, I have investigated it.

524
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:41,208
Don't forget that she's planning
to kill the principal.

525
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:46,833
No wonder! She looks bad.
She's short, has an ugly face...

526
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,625
and an ugly heart.
Even her boyfriend,

527
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,500
I can't tell
if that's a human or a bean sprout.

528
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,750
Taew, I have investigated it too.

529
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,916
When I asked the boys about Sonklin,

530
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,333
they were all scared and told me nothing.

531
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:06,291
There must be something
behind Sonklin's death.

532
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,458
Mom.

533
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:11,708
Somebody is coming

534
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,083
Shawn. I am worried.

535
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,666
I don't trust those four new teachers.

536
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:30,125
They have been peeking around.

537
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,458
Especially that southerner bitch.

538
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,791
Oh, dear!

539
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,958
Shawn. About the old building too.

540
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,500
-Shush what?
-Hey. Miss.

541
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,250
I think people know
about what we are talking here.

542
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,041
Don't tell me that people here
have a sixth sense.

543
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,625
No, just their normal five senses.

544
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,041
-What do you mean?
-Hey, seriously.

545
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,458
As you are walking around like this,
don't you really see them?

546
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,916
Where are they? Where? Where?
I don't see them.

547
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,333
Hey, bitches. Come out, now.

548
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,958
Do you think I can't see you?

549
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,166
I know when you all got in here.

550
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,083
And one more thing.

551
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,458
You, you, you and you,

552
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:46,166
are not allowed
to go into the old building.

553
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:47,166
Why?

554
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,625
You'll die.

555
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,708
Let's go, Shawn.

556
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:57,791
-When did they get here?
-They got here before us.

557
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,500
-I said everything.
-I saw them when we got in here.

558
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:03,875
Shorty! You and I will meet again.

559
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,333
-Teaw?
-What?

560
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,250
It's good to forgive,
but best to kick her in the face!

561
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,791
-Your voice hurts my ears.
-Oh.

562
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,875
Kouy, we are laughing. Why aren't you?

563
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,458
BEDROOM

564
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,666
Hurry up, it's getting late. Here.

565
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,833
It's small. Calm down.

566
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,666
Anyone can tell me
about what I asked you in the class?

567
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,791
Sonklin was a teacher in this school.

568
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:57,125
She got pregnant.
After she gave birth,

569
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,708
she hung herself
from a tree in the backyard.

570
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,791
But from what I heard,

571
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:08,208
she was murdered. And the murderer...

572
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,666
hung her body at the front gate.

573
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,083
Oh, no!

574
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,791
Why did the power go off?

575
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,583
The door...

576
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,250
The door opened by itself.

577
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:37,750
All the kids are in the canteen.
How come the door opened by itself?

578
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,625
I don't know. I'm with you.

579
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,041
Then you go have a look.

580
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,041
You come with me together. Come on.

581
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,416
-Damn! I get wet!
-Come on! Let's go!

582
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,666
Why do you like messing with me?

583
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,000
If you want to be here,
don't mess with me.

584
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:23,208
And tell this fat bitch not to mess
with me if she wants to be here.

585
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,333
Understand?

586
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,333
-Help!
-Miss.

587
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,583
-Miss.
-Miss. Are you alright?

588
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,416
-Miss.
-Chai! Get the head up first.

589
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,833
-Miss.
-Hey, massage her.

590
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,291
Miss Sonklin.

591
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,791
Stop now!

592
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,416
Give me a chance.

593
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,416
What are you doing?

594
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,625
-Who is it?
-Her name is Pancake.

595
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,541
Her spirit is powerful.

596
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,666
No psychic can overpower her.

597
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,500
How do you know?
Don't tell me you already slept with her.

598
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,916
Fat, short and ugly like that?

599
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,333
Look at the both of you,

600
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,916
you are not good people.
You have an evil plan, don't you?

601
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:48,583
Hey, Pancake. You are so out of date.
Do you know "Don't Judge Challenge"?

602
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:52,083
-No, I don't.
-Don't judge the book by its cover.

603
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,333
-I know Ice Bucket.
-Why don't you just do planking then?

604
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:59,125
You out-of-date spirit.

605
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,416
If you want to talk to me, turn around.

606
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:07,041
-How could you slap his head?
-I can slap you too.

607
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,666
-Shawn.
-Why?

608
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,708
Take her down.

609
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,750
-You deserve this.
-Pancake.

610
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:19,750
Pancake!

611
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,625
Pancake!

612
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,708
She is down, she is down.

613
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,416
I'm satisfied.
Shawn, put the spell on her spirit.

614
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:31,666
Do you want to try me, huh?

615
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:37,291
With the shield of protection,
may the spirit be under my command.

616
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:41,166
You are under my command.

617
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:52,958
Shawn, she is staying still.

618
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,250
I got you, Pancake.

619
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,125
Master.

620
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,291
Sweet talk.

621
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,166
Now you only listen to our orders.

622
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,708
-Yes, ma'am.
-Give me your hand.

623
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:11,666
Here.

624
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,000
-Two hands.
-Another one.

625
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,208
Jump after me.

626
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:20,833
Follow me.

627
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,666
-I got you, Pancake.
-Lay down.

628
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,541
-Get up.
-Okay.

629
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:30,791
Lay down.

630
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,000
Get up. Get up.

631
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,250
I think it's enough.
I have problems with my back.

632
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,166
-Pancake.
-Yes.

633
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,916
-Come here.
-Yes.

634
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,250
-Leave now.
-Yes.

635
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,583
-Come here.
-Yes.

636
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:47,958
-Leave now.
-Yes.

637
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,000
-Leave now.
-Yes.

638
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,083
Now you became disobedient.

639
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:55,791
-I don't understand.
-I told you to leave.

640
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,500
-Right now?
-Of course.

641
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:59,041
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,916
Very good, Pancake.

643
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,416
Obedient and polite.

644
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,333
Shawn.

645
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,416
-We have one more on our side.
-It's easy.

646
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:37,416
Here it is. The old building
Usasawan banned us from entering.

647
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:39,833
But we have to be here.

648
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,416
What if she'd allowed us to be here?

649
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,458
Then we wouldn't.

650
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,708
-Bitch!
-This is not a good idea, Mom.

651
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:51,083
-Don't be afraid.
-Should we go back?

652
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,916
What are you afraid of?
Follow me.

653
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:57,208
-Do I really have to?
-We have come this far.

654
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,458
Come on, don't be afraid.

655
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,500
Here, the entrance.

656
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,333
Everyone. Follow me.

657
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:15,625
-Get in.
-Don't you see me, sis?

658
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,416
-You don't see me at all?
-I do.

659
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:23,208
But I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want anything to do with you.

660
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,625
Yeah, nobody wants to be with you,
Pancake.

661
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,833
You were with us.
Now, you are with others.

662
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,625
You are such a two-faced bitch.

663
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,916
Sis, you should make...

664
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,791
-an enemy your friend.
-Friend my ass!

665
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,750
I don't need a friend like her.

666
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,416
You think I want to be friends with you?

667
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,416
Me neither.

668
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,083
Kouy.

669
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,708
-Kouy never calls me names.
-Slut!

670
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:46,666
There.

671
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,666
It doesn't hurt me as much as you do.

672
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,541
Don't be so sensitive. Bitch!

673
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,583
-That was so polite!
-That's great, Kouy.

674
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,708
-How's that?
-Pancake.

675
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,208
What goes around comes around.

676
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,541
Shut up and turn the flashlight away!
Bitch!

677
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,250
-Listen. I'm too posh...
-Wow!

678
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,666
...to care about harsh words
and shit-faces like you all.

679
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,291
I don't care either. Girl...

680
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,500
-charge!
-Yes

681
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,375
I told you not to go in, sis.

682
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,375
-Don't listen to her.
-Let's go, sis.

683
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,750
I told you not to go in!

684
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,250
Let's not go in. Don't.

685
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,916
-Please don't.
-Sis.

686
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,875
We should walk away with pride.

687
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:49,750
-It's better than go ahead for nothing.
-I think so.

688
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,708
-If you still want to live...
-I'm scared.

689
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:52,666
...go away.

690
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,208
Let's go! Run!

691
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,666
Bitch! You just showed up.

692
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:02,708
So...

693
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,291
do I have to be scared of you?

694
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,958
Now I'm scared of you.
You are respected, it's your home.

695
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,125
I'm scared. I'm scared of you. Sis.

696
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,541
Wait! Sis!

697
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,666
Ma'am.

698
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,500
-Sit down first.
-You get up, then.

699
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:29,708
-Why?
-So I can sit down first.

700
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,958
-After me.
-Yeah, after you.

701
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:42,125
-How can I help you?
-I have something to discuss.

702
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,083
I see.

703
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,666
You are nosy.

704
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,625
Come in.

705
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,291
Had you told me earlier,
I wouldn't have needed to peek around.

706
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,791
-Now that you are in, get out.
-You bluffed me again.

707
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,666
-So what is it?
-I want to know.

708
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,583
-What?
-Kouy.

709
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:10,666
-What is he to you?
-He is my son.

710
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:17,333
I was his father.
Then, I have become his mother.

711
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,500
-As time goes by.
-Haven't you slept with him?

712
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,791
Are you crazy?
He is my flesh and blood.

713
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,083
Then, I'm relieved.

714
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,583
I want to ask Kouy to get married.

715
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,958
No problem, I can talk to him.

716
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,125
But you'd have to talk to your daughter.

717
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,666
I want him to marry me.

718
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,083
Marry you?

719
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,666
Get married?

720
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,541
-No way!
-If Kouy knows...

721
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,750
he's getting married, he'll be glad.

722
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,125
I'd rather die.

723
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:08,500
Why does it have to be that ugly monster?

724
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,500
Kouy! Kouy!

725
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:17,875
Why are you doing this?
Don't do this! Get down!

726
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,875
Kouy. Kouy.

727
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,166
Sis. Sis. Sis.

728
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,541
Kouy, why are you trying to kill yourself?

729
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:34,083
It's because of you. I don't want
to get married, but you insisted.

730
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,291
It's because of you, sis.
You forced him

731
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:39,666
into this arranged marriage,
that's why he is doing this.

732
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:43,166
-I really can't take her.
-You can't take her.

733
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,125
It's okay if you can't.
Just cover her face with a bag.

734
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,750
-You bitch!
-We'll be rich.

735
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,166
We can be owners of this school.
Don't you want to be rich?

736
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,916
-No. You marry her yourself.
-We'll win both ways.

737
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,166
-Both ways how?
-After you are married, she'll die.

738
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,916
-You get a funeral after.
-You shithead!

739
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:07,166
-You marry her yourself. I won't.
-Kouy, get down.

740
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,708
-No.
-Kouy, will you marry her?

741
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,250
-No!
-Are you sure you won't?

742
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:17,500
-I won't.
-Kouy, calm down.

743
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:18,875
I don't want to get married.

744
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,291
-I don't want to.
-Kouy.

745
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:24,416
-Kouy! Will you?
-You can die, but I still won't.

746
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,208
Bastard!
Will you marry her?

747
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,041
-Will you?
-You can kill her, but I still won't.

748
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,708
Will you?

749
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,333
-Fine, I will.
-Done!

750
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:37,791
That's it.

751
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,333
The final exam is coming up soon.

752
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,916
There is a situation, Shawn.

753
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:49,375
I overheard that the principal
is getting married.

754
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
With who?

755
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:51,708
Kouy.

756
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,041
-Kouy who?
-Taew's son.

757
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,833
It can't happen.
We can't let it happen.

758
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:01,000
If they get married, everything
will belong to Taew and her son.

759
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:02,833
Shit!

760
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,750
Since when you guys are sitting here?

761
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:12,625
-You didn't hear what I said, right?
-We didn't.

762
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,833
We did not hear you.

763
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:16,666
To whom is she getting married?

764
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,208
Kouy!

765
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:20,916
I slipped.

766
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,375
That was not a slip of the tongue.
That was blabbing.

767
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,208
-Shawn, let's talk outside.
-Wait.

768
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:31,250
-Who's gonna get all the wealth?
-Taew and Kouy.

769
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,625
How do you know?

770
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:39,625
Shawn, we can't let them know.
I'll wait outside.

771
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,958
Look, everybody. Whatever you know,
just keep it under your hat.

772
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,625
-Married?
-Hey!

773
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,958
I brought you some food.

774
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,208
Where are you guys going?

775
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,750
We are hungry. We're going to the kitchen
to find something to eat.

776
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,750
-Wanna join us?
-Yeah, we'll come along.

777
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:26,708
Kouy, follow me.

778
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:31,541
Your Kouy hit me.

779
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,541
Yes.

780
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:40,458
This tree.
Someone hung herself here.

781
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:46,250
-Mom, what are you talking about?
-I'm serious.

782
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,166
Someone hung herself here.

783
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,791
-Let's find something to eat.
-There's nothing. Oh, here.

784
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,416
-Eggs.
-Let's make an omelet.

785
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,166
Ark!

786
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:05,833
-What?
-Look!

787
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,166
-What's that?
-Let's check it out.

788
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,250
Follow me.

789
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,083
What are you doing?

790
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:19,958
What the hell?

791
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,625
-Mom.
-Yes, dear?

792
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,875
You have to exercise every day
so you can walk again.

793
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:28,916
Yes.

794
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,875
Come here.

795
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:36,708
That's good, very good.

796
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,791
-I'll wait for you over there.
-Yes, dear.

797
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,500
Mom.

798
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,041
Hey! Run!

799
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,250
What is that?

800
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,041
Oh! There are two ghosts. Let's go.

801
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,875
Where are you going?

802
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,125
-Help me!
-Kouy! Let go of my son.

803
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,458
Eat this! Come on, follow me.

804
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,750
David! Help me!

805
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,125
Get off of my friend!

806
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,166
Mom. Are you okay?

807
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,125
Principal.

808
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:35,000
Just get back on the wheelchair.

809
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,750
Okay.

810
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:53,333
You bad girl! I better go.

811
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,750
Shit!

812
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:05,375
I'm not here for you.
I just want to ask...

813
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,958
where the reverse button is.

814
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:12,708
Go away!

815
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,833
Why is it coming back?

816
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:27,000
Don't mess with me!

817
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:35,458
-Where is it?
-In that room.

818
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,958
The light is on.

819
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,125
-The gate is locked.
-What should we do?

820
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:44,291
Usasawan, there are people here.

821
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,791
Come this way, Kouy.
Kouy, push me up.

822
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,958
Push me up, Kouy.

823
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,125
-Those four freaks are here. Pancake.
-Yes.

824
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:04,125
-Go get rid of them bitches.
-Yes, ma'am.

825
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,500
I got you.

826
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:11,416
Oh, the gate is not locked.

827
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,166
-The gate is not locked?
-Mom.

828
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,666
-Help me.
-You idiot!

829
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,416
The gate is not locked.
Why did you climb, Kouy.

830
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,666
He's so stupid.

831
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,291
Well, just climb over.

832
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,416
Don't you see? The gate is not locked.

833
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:27,916
Go, go, go, go.

834
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,583
What the hell are you doing here?

835
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,958
I will ask you first,
how could you still face us?

836
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,791
Why can't I face you all? Teaw!

837
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:47,083
Because you are ungrateful.
How would you be able to face anyone?

838
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,875
Ungrateful bitch!

839
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:53,625
Please stop fighting. I beg you.
United Thailand is strong.

840
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:57,208
Shut up! Stop with this optimistic crap.
I'll kick your ass.

841
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:59,166
-I'm sorry.
-Pancake, calm down.

842
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:05,083
We should stay united.
Our country needs unity now.

843
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,416
Pray...

844
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,291
-for Thailand.
-Shut up, Moddum.

845
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:13,625
Before you pray for me. Why don't you
pray for your homeland first?

846
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,958
-That's harsh.
-Way too harsh.

847
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,291
Mom. Mom.

848
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,916
Let's not waste our time.

849
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,708
We have four people. We can beat her.

850
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,125
Shut up, Kouy.

851
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:26,375
Step back, I don't understand you. Move!

852
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,833
Sis, didn't you see?
She slapped your son.

853
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:32,833
-A bitch like you...
-Why?

854
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,208
...is ungrateful.

855
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,708
-Ungrateful, huh?
-Yes.

856
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,750
-What did you do for me?
-Let me remind you.

857
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,125
I've always made merit for you.
Whatever you wanted to eat, to have,

858
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:47,875
the toys you wanted,

859
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:51,458
I went to Siam Square for you.
You wanted an iPhone,

860
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:55,666
I bought one for you.

861
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:59,000
You wanted to visit Korea,
I took you there.

862
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:05,416
Stop reminding me, bitch.
Thank you for everything you gave me.

863
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:10,041
But listen.
The favors you are talking about...

864
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:14,083
"I wanted this, I wanted that."
But what you offered me...

865
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,500
was one mackerel, Bitch!
A mackerel and a boiled egg.

866
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:18,791
Do you think I'd be full?

867
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,833
Do you think I'd be full? Idiot!

868
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,125
I wanted toys, I wanted a Blyth doll.

869
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,416
You said you bought one for me? My ass!

870
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,541
You won a cheap lucky draw
from the flea market. Idiot!

871
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:33,833
An iPhone? Yeah, I wanted an iPhone!
It's the counterfeit with two sim cards.

872
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,083
Idiot! iPhone my ass,
two sim cards and a TV app.

873
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,416
-Bastard!
-Oh, that's harsh.

874
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,333
-And the most important thing, Korea.
-Why?

875
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,375
-I went there before you, idiot!
-So what do you want from me?

876
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,333
-Tell me, what do you want?
-All of you should head back.

877
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,208
I'll take it from here.

878
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,166
-Did you hear?
-Yes.

879
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,666
She will take it from here.

880
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,625
-Did you hear?
-Yes.

881
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,375
She's slapping Pancake.

882
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:02,291
Idiot? Try this. How's that?

883
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,375
-Taew.
-What?

884
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,208
-I'll take it from here.
-Take it like this?

885
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,458
-Mom!
-Get her, sis!

886
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,291
-Fine.
-Come on!

887
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:20,375
As if I can't finish you.
Bring it on, Taew. Come on!

888
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,625
-Come on!
-Take it off.

889
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,291
-You...
-Wait!

890
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,416
I'm not ready yet.

891
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:38,416
Yeah, that's right.
Pancake, you are great.

892
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:41,250
Bastard!

893
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,416
Skank! Badass!

894
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,958
-I'll strangle you to death.
-Mom.

895
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,541
Pancake! Get up!

896
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:56,333
Take this! How's that?

897
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:59,666
-Where are you going?
-Bitch! Where are you?

898
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:03,166
-Oh, my God!
-Calm down.

899
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,791
-Calm down.
-Awesome.

900
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,958
-I don't handle knee kicks very well.
-Don't use your knee.

901
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,000
Don't!

902
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,083
You asshole!

903
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:22,458
-Don't. Sis.
-She's down.

904
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,083
-Don't, sis.
-Get off.

905
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,250
Now, she's down.
I am at an advantage

906
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:31,000
That's true, sis,
but you are almost dead.

907
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:36,500
-Help me to beat her.
-Sis.

908
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,750
-Pancake.
-Wait.

909
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,666
Sis.

910
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,333
Wait.

911
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,791
-What?
-You should go back.

912
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:49,000
-I'll take it from here.
-"Take it"? Here, bitch!

913
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,958
-Listen to me.
-What? You said you'll take it.

914
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:56,375
You should go back.
I know why you are here.

915
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:58,791
I'll take it from here, do you understand?

916
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:01,791
-Yes, I do.
-You do.

917
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,625
-Done.
-I'm done. Bitch!

918
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,666
-Sis, are you okay?
-Pancake. Just you wait!

919
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,791
She said she'd take it from here.

920
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:15,583
-You'll take it from me? Bitch!
-Moddum.

921
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:20,000
No! I get it.
If I say "take it from here," you slap me.

922
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,875
-Bitch!
-Sis!

923
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:26,500
Go back to wherever you are from. Go!

924
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:27,708
Great.

925
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,541
-Let's go. Come on!
-Close the gate.

926
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:32,666
Come on!

927
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,083
Very good, Pancake. Awesome.

928
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,250
Help me.

929
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:02,833
Help me.

930
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:13,291
Help me.

931
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,958
Help me.

932
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:36,666
Help me.

933
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,500
Help me.

934
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:48,291
Help me.

935
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,958
Help me!

936
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:57,791
What's wrong with you, Ark?

937
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,500
Hey, Ark.
What was wrong with you last night?

938
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:09,041
I had a dream,
I went into the old building.

939
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:14,833
The Arkarabadinporamindecha Building?

940
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,291
-What did you see?
-If you want to know,

941
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,583
let's go inside there tonight.

942
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,208
It's so scary.

943
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:41,458
Oh, my gosh.

944
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:46,708
I remember I followed
the sound of a woman from upstairs.

945
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,583
Will you go upstairs?

946
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,458
Yeah. I've made it this far.

947
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:57,166
-I'm scared.
-Come on. Don't chicken out now.

948
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,541
I heard you went to the old building
last night?

949
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,250
-Yes.
-And what did you see?

950
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:10,500
A ghost.

951
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,083
All these guys ran for their lives.

952
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,291
Are you going back there?

953
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,375
Yes.

954
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,125
I'll take you there.
I have been there before.

955
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,333
Aunt Yoad.

956
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:36,125
Aunt Yoad.

957
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,250
Aunt Yoad.

958
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,541
You like tuberose, right?

959
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,500
I will take some for you.

960
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,083
Thank you, Pudsorn.

961
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:37,583
Let's go.

962
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,708
MRS. SONKLIN NILKA
MARCH 15, 2498 - OCTOBER 28, 2525 B.E.

963
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,333
I think we should take the coffin down.

964
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:53,208
-Ark, are you serious?
-Yeah.

965
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,291
Alright then.

966
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:02,041
Wait.
Shouldn't we apologize to Sonklin first?

967
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,875
Yeah.

968
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah, good idea.

969
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:11,916
Sonklin.

970
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:14,916
We mean well.

971
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:19,000
If we do anything wrong,

972
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,625
or do anything that insults you,

973
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:27,375
-please accept our apologies.
-I'm sorry.

974
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:33,708
Chai.

975
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,583
You two help him.

976
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,541
Hey, be careful.

977
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,875
-Be careful.
-It's so heavy.

978
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,375
Careful.

979
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:22,667
Chai! Chai! Chai!

980
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,125
-Someone help him!
-It looks like he is possessed.

981
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,917
Give me your amulet.

982
01:08:29,957 --> 01:08:31,957
You two help him.

983
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:35,417
-Don't touch me.
-Chai.

984
01:08:35,957 --> 01:08:37,542
Leave me alone!

985
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,542
-Don't touch me.
-Chai, are you okay?

986
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:43,542
Are you okay?

987
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:45,957
Are you okay?

988
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:54,332
Hey, Bew!

989
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,292
I told you, didn't I?

990
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,750
To not come in here again.

991
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:29,832
All of you.

992
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:33,832
Don't you want to live happily?

993
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,957
You two, go get him. Hurry up!

994
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,207
-Bew!
-Pudsorn, take this.

995
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,000
Bew!

996
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:50,957
Come on, Ark.

997
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:55,417
Bew! Bew!

998
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,957
-Bew!
-Are you okay?

999
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,082
Bew.

1000
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,542
Bew.

1001
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:05,082
Bew.

1002
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,417
What's that?

1003
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:19,582
Hey, guys.

1004
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,125
Are you defying me?

1005
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:45,792
Where has it gone?

1006
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,000
I told you, didn't I?

1007
01:11:08,082 --> 01:11:10,542
You were not supposed to go
to the Arkarabadinporamindecha Building.

1008
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:11,750
And look what happened.

1009
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:15,625
-Just as you see.
-Don't talk back to me.

1010
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:18,250
Hey.

1011
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,042
Teaw.

1012
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:22,957
-What happened, Techin?
-These kids,

1013
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:26,042
they went to the
Arkarabadinporamindecha Building.

1014
01:11:27,332 --> 01:11:28,207
The old building.

1015
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:32,457
Not "old building."
It's Arkarabarinporarindecha.

1016
01:11:32,832 --> 01:11:35,500
-Yeah, that's the old building.
-Stop arguing and listen to him.

1017
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:36,917
The Arkarabadinporamindecha Building.

1018
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,750
-What building, Kouy?
-The Arkarabadinkabindecha Building.

1019
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,457
-The old building.
-No.

1020
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:43,250
The Arkarabadinkamindecha building.

1021
01:11:43,582 --> 01:11:45,792
-It's the old building, isn't it?
-Yes.

1022
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:49,167
-Yes, the old building.
-What building?

1023
01:11:50,082 --> 01:11:51,750
-The old building.
-No.

1024
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,707
-The Akarakabinkabindecha Building.
-Bitch!

1025
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:59,832
Ma'am, here's your son.
He's very sick.

1026
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:03,457
Why? How is this happened?

1027
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:05,957
-Is this her son?
-I don't know.

1028
01:12:06,457 --> 01:12:08,875
Why is my son like this?

1029
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,042
Because he went to the old building.

1030
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:14,250
-What old building?
-The Akaraklinparindecha Building.

1031
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,707
-The old building, Akarabordinbordindecha.
-You can't say it right,

1032
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:21,417
don't you dare arguing.
Your son went there on his own.

1033
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
And then he had a stroke, stroke, stroke.

1034
01:12:23,582 --> 01:12:25,292
-And then he ran--
-Stop! Bitch!

1035
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:29,875
She's trying to explain what happened.
Why are you cursing her?

1036
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:30,875
What for?

1037
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:32,875
-Shut up, bitch!
-Just leave her alone.

1038
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,457
-Take me to the principal now.
-Pardon?

1039
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,082
-Pardon my ass!
-That's my father.

1040
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:42,582
Yes, I want to see your... your master.

1041
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,792
-What is the master?
-Master, mother, your mom.

1042
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:47,082
But that's my mother.

1043
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,292
Yeah, mother. Your mother.
Go, go, go. You are talking nonsense.

1044
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,957
Let's go see your mother.

1045
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,457
-Panic.
-Agitated.

1046
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:57,457
Anxious.

1047
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:00,750
-What happened, Techin?
-These kids

1048
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,125
went into the
Arkarabadinporamindecha Building.

1049
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:04,917
The old building.

1050
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,332
Akarabajinporamintebencha.

1051
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,500
-The old building.
-Arkarabadinporamindecha.

1052
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:15,625
Alright. Let's go.

1053
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,417
The evils are here.

1054
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,167
-We shouldn't stick around, let's go.
-Where are we going?

1055
01:13:21,582 --> 01:13:23,917
-The old building.
-No, you can't go.

1056
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,042
I'm not asking you.
Don't impose yourself on our mission.

1057
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:30,082
Tell her where we are going.

1058
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:35,292
The Akarakabordinvitaminbordindecha
Building.

1059
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:37,832
You big mouth, bitch!

1060
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:41,375
-It's the old building, you know?
-I know.

1061
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,457
-What building?
-The old building, bitch!

1062
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:48,917
-Anxious, anxious.
-Agitated, agitated.

1063
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:53,042
-Mr. Techin, look after them.
-Of course.

1064
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,332
Shawn, that can't happen.

1065
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:57,875
-We have to stop them.
-Never.

1066
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,707
Take care of him.

1067
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,917
Ms. Principal,

1068
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:08,957
how did you take care of my son?
Why did you let him walk around at night?

1069
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:12,292
And not just walk around,

1070
01:14:12,707 --> 01:14:15,750
but get haunted by a ghost.
Look at him now.

1071
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:20,082
And what's going on with the people
these days?

1072
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:24,457
Out of ten, five are either gays
or ladyboys.

1073
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:29,292
I thought the other five would be good.
It turns out,

1074
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:33,082
they are the husbands of the first five.
Besides,

1075
01:14:33,332 --> 01:14:36,832
they consider men who get men
as supermen,

1076
01:14:36,957 --> 01:14:38,875
and men who get ladyboys as...

1077
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,042
the ultra-supermen.

1078
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:43,750
I can't take it
if my son becomes one of those.

1079
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,250
I can't take it! Why did you...

1080
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:50,250
If you were not my friend,

1081
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,125
I'd curse you.

1082
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:53,542
You hooker!

1083
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:59,000
You pug face! I lowered myself
to be your friend at school.

1084
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,457
I was in grade ten,
and you were in grade seven.

1085
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:03,750
I waited three years until you catch up.

1086
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,457
Look at yourself,
who would want to be your friend?

1087
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:10,292
It was only me, me, me,

1088
01:15:10,582 --> 01:15:11,625
who want to be...

1089
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,042
You gabbling bitch!

1090
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,917
-I can't catch up.
-You didn't listen!

1091
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,832
-Ouch! Tha--
-Don't thank me.

1092
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,582
That bag.

1093
01:15:23,957 --> 01:15:26,000
You should have listened to me.

1094
01:15:26,082 --> 01:15:27,792
I told you, my son

1095
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:30,250
is my everything.
And look what you have done!

1096
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:32,707
-I trusted you!
-Is this the master?

1097
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:36,082
You are the master?
I don't believe that you are the master.

1098
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:40,332
I don't believe that you are the master.
You look like a ghost. How could you be?

1099
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:42,292
Look how you take care of my son.

1100
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:45,582
Damn!
Get away, let me curse her.

1101
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,332
Do you even know who you are?
You are a horrible teacher.

1102
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:52,625
My child can speak neither Chinese
nor English. Be careful.

1103
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:55,917
Go, go, go! Step aside!
Let me scold her.

1104
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,042
You! Wait and see.

1105
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:59,125
I will find someone to beat you up.

1106
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:02,542
Listen carefully,
You better watch out.

1107
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,707
-Foul mouth!
-What? You say I have bad breath?

1108
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,042
I don't know what it means,

1109
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:08,917
but who are you?
I was talking first, and you interrupted.

1110
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,167
I'm here for the same reason.

1111
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:11,917
But this is my turn..

1112
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,707
I have things to discuss.

1113
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:15,707
Why didn't you schedule a meeting?
This is my turn.

1114
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,917
-Shut up. You didn't schedule either.
-Stop! Stop!

1115
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:23,332
-Take me to rest.
-Yes, sir.

1116
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:27,125
You'll see. Are you sure you can rest?

1117
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:29,832
Let's see if you can rest.

1118
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,457
Pong. Come back now,
we are not done yet.

1119
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,625
You curse too much.
She couldn't catch up.

1120
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:36,542
If you want to curse, a few words will do.

1121
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,417
You are babbling them out,

1122
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,125
nobody listens.

1123
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,082
You didn't curse her in Thai.

1124
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,207
You think she understands you?

1125
01:16:45,457 --> 01:16:46,542
You are a fool.

1126
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:48,792
-Make yourself at home.
-What?

1127
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,832
-You are crazy.
-I'm not crazy, you are crazy.

1128
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,832
How are you?

1129
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,542
I can talk like that. Umongtalegu,
ormongkaseboo, longmongkadongpoo, Bitch!

1130
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,832
Slut!

1131
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,625
Shawn,
those kids went to the old building.

1132
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,457
If they found Sonklin's body,

1133
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:07,875
we'd be busted.

1134
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,707
Especially those four freaks.

1135
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:15,082
Shit, shit, shit! What should we do?

1136
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:19,332
It's not difficult. Get rid of the body,
then they won't know.

1137
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,542
You can't figure this out already, idiot?

1138
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:24,042
-They are idiots?
-No, you.

1139
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:25,457
Thank you.

1140
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,125
-That was meant for you.
-Shit.

1141
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:30,042
Shawn, when should we do it?

1142
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,500
Tomorrow night. It will be full moon.

1143
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:37,625
You go to the Arkarabadinprajimdecha
Building

1144
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,667
to get rid of the body.

1145
01:17:40,207 --> 01:17:43,082
My psychic friend is as powerful
as myself.

1146
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:45,457
Well, well, well.

1147
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:47,957
Well, well, well. Jib.

1148
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:51,625
-Is she cursing us?
-I think it's an interjection.

1149
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:55,167
I guess it's well then,
well then, well then.

1150
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:58,457
Oh, so it's not a curse.
That's a relief.

1151
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:03,582
-Magic knife.
-Magic knife.

1152
01:18:18,582 --> 01:18:19,542
Enough.

1153
01:18:21,082 --> 01:18:22,207
Having too much fun.

1154
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,875
-Teacher, this way.
-Someone is coming.

1155
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,957
Hurry!

1156
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,082
-Over here, Taew.
-Sonklin's body is in here.

1157
01:18:42,207 --> 01:18:43,707
Where?

1158
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:45,667
Let me see.

1159
01:18:47,707 --> 01:18:48,582
Oh, dear.

1160
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:52,582
-What is that, an iguana?
-Are you listening to yourself?

1161
01:18:52,957 --> 01:18:55,750
-What kind of iguana has horns?
-Yeah.

1162
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,417
Is it dead? Moddum.

1163
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:02,125
Can you touch it and see?

1164
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,082
-That's insulting, sis.
-Why?

1165
01:19:05,332 --> 01:19:08,207
You expect me to touch
that rotten thing with my hand?

1166
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,500
I'll do it.

1167
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:14,707
You're insulting my hand.

1168
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:17,207
Here. See? Here.

1169
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:20,250
Massage with my heel.

1170
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:22,957
How do you feel, slut?

1171
01:19:23,832 --> 01:19:25,832
-I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?

1172
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,375
To wash my feet.

1173
01:19:28,042 --> 01:19:30,957
You are the queen of insulting people.

1174
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,000
It's not that dirty.

1175
01:19:34,082 --> 01:19:39,125
Let me do it. Anything wrong?
Nothing at all. It's okay.

1176
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:43,792
How about inside? Nothing.
Nothing in the nose. Get up.

1177
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,875
-Go, Moddum.
-Where to?

1178
01:19:45,957 --> 01:19:47,542
-To wash our feet.
-You bitch!

1179
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:51,500
Mom.

1180
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:52,707
Aunt Moddum.

1181
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:54,250
There are people peeking at us.

1182
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,542
Kouy, they are not peeking. Look.

1183
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:03,125
They are lined up just like whores
on the sidewalk.

1184
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,750
How does she see us?

1185
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,832
It's you two that didn't hide well.

1186
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:10,792
Mom.

1187
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:12,707
There is another one.

1188
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,500
Oh, there is also a pimp.

1189
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,042
With that James Bond case.

1190
01:20:21,957 --> 01:20:23,042
Stop the nonsense.

1191
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,582
Get up, Falabualoy.

1192
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:34,082
So they know what we are doing.

1193
01:20:34,582 --> 01:20:36,500
What "bualoy"?

1194
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,125
-Falabualoy.
-Oh.

1195
01:20:48,917 --> 01:20:50,332
Whoa, knife.

1196
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:53,667
Who stepped on my face?

1197
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,125
-Who?
-Her.

1198
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,417
You stepped on my face?

1199
01:20:58,832 --> 01:21:03,167
Me? I wouldn't do if I wasn't told to.

1200
01:21:03,332 --> 01:21:07,582
-Well, well, well. it's you.
-Yes.

1201
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:10,582
Do you know how much my face is worth?

1202
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,625
Your face has a price?

1203
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:15,042
-Right? Kouy?
-Right.

1204
01:21:16,707 --> 01:21:18,417
-Or you?
-I took you here, didn't I?

1205
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:25,207
Hey, Usasawan,

1206
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:28,832
let me say something.
Someone like you, you are good looking.

1207
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:31,957
-But your heart is ugly.
-Enough!

1208
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:35,542
My heart is ugly? That's not true.

1209
01:21:36,707 --> 01:21:38,542
But I'm good looking, yes.

1210
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:43,375
Have you ever looked at in the mirror?
You are short like a small potato,

1211
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,332
and you said you are good looking?

1212
01:21:45,457 --> 01:21:46,750
Enough!

1213
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,750
-I don't understand.
-I'm certain you wouldn't.

1214
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:54,707
Well, you talk from both sides.

1215
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:57,042
Of course, you have many people.

1216
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:58,582
If you are so good,

1217
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:01,332
-why don't you make the mute talk too?
-You bitch!

1218
01:22:02,957 --> 01:22:04,792
-Is that clear?
-Great.

1219
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,667
-Want some more?
-Bitch.

1220
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:08,292
-Mom.
-What?

1221
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,125
-She came.
-What?

1222
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,582
She came.

1223
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:16,457
She came.

1224
01:22:22,207 --> 01:22:24,667
She came.

1225
01:22:34,832 --> 01:22:36,250
She came!

1226
01:22:46,957 --> 01:22:49,250
Moddum. She's gone.

1227
01:22:51,332 --> 01:22:52,457
She's gone. It's empty.

1228
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,375
Moddum.

1229
01:23:00,707 --> 01:23:02,292
-She came back.
-What black?

1230
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:03,957
She came back.

1231
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:13,292
She came back!

1232
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:21,542
Follow me.

1233
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,332
Which way?

1234
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,582
This way.

1235
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:26,957
Where are you going? Come here!

1236
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,957
Hey, wait! I can't catch up.

1237
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,875
Hurry up! Go!

1238
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:38,792
Don't follow me.

1239
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:43,707
Sonklin, don't follow me.

1240
01:23:44,582 --> 01:23:46,167
I'm scared.

1241
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:48,457
That psychic doesn't help at all.

1242
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,250
Is it a cosplay party for her?

1243
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:10,750
What are you doing, Usasawan?

1244
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,875
What else can it be, Shawn?

1245
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:15,917
I'm practicing my sister's signature.
Almost there.

1246
01:24:17,082 --> 01:24:20,667
Hey, why are you
wasting your time with this?

1247
01:24:21,332 --> 01:24:22,582
We better get it over.

1248
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:25,707
After getting married,
Kouy and Taew will get everything.

1249
01:24:27,082 --> 01:24:30,582
That's right.
Wait, Shawn.

1250
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,667
Let me ask you something.
The poison you gave me to kill my sister,

1251
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,875
it doesn't work at all?

1252
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:38,250
I think so.

1253
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:41,250
I gathered all super strong poisons
from around the world,

1254
01:24:41,332 --> 01:24:42,375
but they couldn't kill her.

1255
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:46,542
Well then,
we have to do it ourselves this time.

1256
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:51,457
Pongpannarai...

1257
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:53,167
Still practicing signing.

1258
01:24:55,667 --> 01:24:58,250
Ponpannarai prakaimas wassanachalalai.

1259
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:00,292
Arkarabordinporamindecha.

1260
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,332
Sweet dreams, Mom.

1261
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:09,917
You'll be a bride tomorrow.

1262
01:25:10,582 --> 01:25:11,625
I love you.

1263
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,917
-Thank you, dear.
-See you tomorrow.

1264
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,250
You are sleeping well, huh?

1265
01:25:47,582 --> 01:25:49,667
Your time to breathe is up.

1266
01:25:51,332 --> 01:25:52,375
See...

1267
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:55,457
O2 is not good for you anymore.

1268
01:25:56,082 --> 01:25:57,707
Wait, what is O2?

1269
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,667
-Oxygen.
-So fancy.

1270
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:04,500
Shawn, do it.

1271
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:09,167
Why do you call my name?
They'll know who kill her.

1272
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:10,917
Shaew.

1273
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:18,457
Too cruel.
There'll be blood all over the place.

1274
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:25,957
One hit. Good bye, sister.

1275
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:30,292
What sin are you committing,
Usasawan and Shawn?

1276
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:34,125
Wait.
Don't tell me you remember both of us?

1277
01:26:34,707 --> 01:26:35,832
I remember even your toe nails.

1278
01:26:36,082 --> 01:26:39,167
-Listen to that.
-Well, since you are here...

1279
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:43,082
Seriously, are you still loyal to me?

1280
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,875
Of course.

1281
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:48,042
Very well. If so,

1282
01:26:48,707 --> 01:26:49,582
kill her!

1283
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,000
Let me handle this.

1284
01:27:01,292 --> 01:27:02,957
You don't need a gun, it's too loud.

1285
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,625
You don't need a knife, it's messy.

1286
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,375
Die!

1287
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:29,750
Hurry up, guys.

1288
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,207
Hurry, the party will start soon.

1289
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,375
Spray a lot over there,
it'll keep them fresh.

1290
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,625
On the right, Bew. Arrange the wine.

1291
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:48,250
That's good, keep them fresh.

1292
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:50,500
Okay, let's go.

1293
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,957
Why are you crying, Kouy?

1294
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:56,917
It's just a marriage,

1295
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:58,875
it's not that sad.

1296
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:00,957
It's not about getting married.

1297
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,792
Then what is it about?

1298
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:05,167
It's about the hairdo you made for me.

1299
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,957
I told you, he doesn't like it.

1300
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:11,417
You need a lot of energy for the wedding,
trust me.

1301
01:28:11,582 --> 01:28:14,875
Kouy, people look good
because of the makeup.

1302
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:17,457
The groom, please come in here.

1303
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:20,000
Hello, madam. Hello, miss.
Welcome the bride and the groom.

1304
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:21,707
Welcome.

1305
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:24,042
You always speak English.

1306
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,042
-Hey, girlfriend.
-What?

1307
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,542
Actually, I don't want to gossip.

1308
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:35,500
But it's always stuck on my lips.
Pong...

1309
01:28:35,582 --> 01:28:38,000
-everybody knows her as the principal.
-Oh, this bitch again.

1310
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:39,750
She is rich, and at the last reunion,

1311
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:42,207
she went for big.
The party was grand.

1312
01:28:42,292 --> 01:28:43,595
She got a big mouth, doesn't she?

1313
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,375
And this time, she has a young husband.
Look at the reception,

1314
01:28:47,582 --> 01:28:49,500
it's grand.

1315
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:52,125
-But not as grand as yours.
-Gossip in the party.

1316
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,167
Nah, that's nothing.

1317
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:58,542
-Hello.
-Hello.

1318
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,042
Rattawadee, Prisana and...

1319
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,082
Tangkaew and...

1320
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,082
Pookan. Please come inside.

1321
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,332
-Please, welcome inside.
-Thank you.

1322
01:29:08,707 --> 01:29:11,375
I'm so annoyed by that chandelier.

1323
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,957
Rattana fucking Wadee

1324
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:15,832
being invited or not, she comes anyway.

1325
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:17,750
You look like the devil!

1326
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,167
-I take pity on Tangkaew.
-Yeah.

1327
01:29:21,582 --> 01:29:22,457
Alas!

1328
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:25,375
How could you do this, Pookan?

1329
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,332
Why do you turn Pancake's boyfriend
to be your girlfriend?

1330
01:29:28,582 --> 01:29:30,417
Taew, stop it.

1331
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:32,250
It's personal choice

1332
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:34,875
and sexual orientation.

1333
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,082
-Wait, Taew.
-What?

1334
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:40,250
Do you remember? Korea?

1335
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,000
Do you? Korea.

1336
01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:43,667
-Kors?
-Korea!

1337
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:45,707
Stop it, Tangtong.

1338
01:29:46,457 --> 01:29:48,750
Don't ever talk about Korea.

1339
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,125
Remember when you...

1340
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,750
wore a G-string?

1341
01:29:53,082 --> 01:29:55,167
-Remember?
-Don't talk about G-string either.

1342
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:59,625
I didn't wear a G-string and humped you.
I didn't do it.

1343
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:02,625
Sis, if you don't say it,
nobody will know.

1344
01:30:02,957 --> 01:30:04,625
Why the hell are you laughing?

1345
01:30:04,707 --> 01:30:05,750
Don't you have a husband?

1346
01:30:06,082 --> 01:30:08,250
I guess they'll just take turns.

1347
01:30:09,082 --> 01:30:13,457
Stop yapping. Shut that hole on your face.
You wet wipe!

1348
01:30:14,082 --> 01:30:15,082
You wet wipe.

1349
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:17,250
-We are too good for this, Rattanawadee.
-Too good.

1350
01:30:17,332 --> 01:30:19,417
We are aristocrats.
Stop it, all of you.

1351
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:22,292
If you say one more bad word,
you all will be dead.

1352
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:23,542
Gracious!

1353
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:24,875
Girlfriend.

1354
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,250
-Girlfriend. We are aristocrats.
-Aristocrats.

1355
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:29,042
You can stop being happy now.

1356
01:30:30,582 --> 01:30:31,457
Who's that?

1357
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,582
Hey, who's that?

1358
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:37,207
There won't be a wedding here.

1359
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,250
The principal is dead.

1360
01:30:42,707 --> 01:30:44,625
The principal is dead.

1361
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:46,332
-The principal is dead.
-You see?

1362
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,042
What is this?

1363
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,542
A wreath!

1364
01:30:51,957 --> 01:30:54,500
In loving memory, Usasawan and Shawn.

1365
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,292
Are you two dead?
The flower shop sent it to you?

1366
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,250
Shut up, Taew.

1367
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,707
I have one more thing to tell you.

1368
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:08,957
This school will be mine soon.

1369
01:31:09,207 --> 01:31:10,500
-Gracious!
-Bitch!

1370
01:31:10,792 --> 01:31:13,707
Damn, Pong has lost it.

1371
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:15,832
Who said the principal is dead?

1372
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:17,292
Here's another one.

1373
01:31:17,832 --> 01:31:18,707
That's Pancake.

1374
01:31:23,207 --> 01:31:24,750
The principal is still alive.

1375
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:32,250
Back off!

1376
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:36,375
Hey. How do you know?

1377
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,875
Because I didn't kill her.

1378
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:42,957
How come? You suffocated her
with a pillow, I saw you doing it.

1379
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,457
When you left the room,

1380
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:50,750
do you know what happened?

1381
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:53,875
Ms. Principal.

1382
01:31:54,832 --> 01:31:56,832
Ms. Principal. Ms. Principal

1383
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:00,875
-Are you still alive?
-I felt it since the first slap.

1384
01:32:02,207 --> 01:32:03,332
-Traitor.
-Pancake.

1385
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,667
Traitor who? I never betrayed anyone.

1386
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,000
Because I was never loyal to you.

1387
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:13,207
-That hurts.
-Do you remember?

1388
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:16,582
The day you cast the spell on me?

1389
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:19,707
I screamed. I was hurt.

1390
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:23,707
And I was on your side.

1391
01:32:25,042 --> 01:32:26,750
She's so obedient.

1392
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,792
Idiots.

1393
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:40,582
That was the real acting skill.

1394
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:44,500
I acted. In English, they call it...

1395
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:46,832
-acting.
-You did a great job.

1396
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:50,332
So I did what you wanted.

1397
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,500
And that is to kill the principal.

1398
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:56,250
-Teaw.
-Traitor!

1399
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:59,500
You bitch! Stop calling me names.
Are you listening to me?

1400
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,207
Why am I not listening to you?

1401
01:33:01,292 --> 01:33:05,957
You told me you would take care of it.
And made your serious face.

1402
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:09,417
Right. I said I was going to handle it.

1403
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:12,207
Listen to me, Taew.
The reason I took their side,

1404
01:33:12,332 --> 01:33:14,917
is to let everyone know
that these two evils

1405
01:33:15,582 --> 01:33:17,542
want to kill the principal,
for her fortune.

1406
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:19,417
I didn't handle it, did I?

1407
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:22,667
-Idiot!
-Listen to her, listen!

1408
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:25,875
Stop cursing.
You don't understand anything.

1409
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,417
Idiot!

1410
01:33:27,957 --> 01:33:29,500
That's right. Idiot!

1411
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:33,875
-Kouy.
-Yes. Idiot.

1412
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,750
Thank you, Pancake.

1413
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:42,667
You made me realize I'm an idiot.

1414
01:33:42,957 --> 01:33:43,832
Nuanpong.

1415
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:47,667
-Take your mom out now.
-Yes.

1416
01:34:05,417 --> 01:34:07,250
-Ma'am.
-You are still alive.

1417
01:34:07,417 --> 01:34:08,332
Sister.

1418
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,792
You are still alive.

1419
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,292
Well then, now you have to die.

1420
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:18,707
Oh, gun!

1421
01:34:19,707 --> 01:34:22,292
-That's scary.
-If killing me

1422
01:34:23,167 --> 01:34:24,417
makes you happy...

1423
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:28,125
shoot me.

1424
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,500
Usasawan.

1425
01:34:33,332 --> 01:34:35,457
How could you
get through the x-ray machine?

1426
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:37,957
I even made it through
at Japan's airport.

1427
01:34:38,582 --> 01:34:40,707
Getting into this party
was a piece of cake.

1428
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:41,792
Thanks to the airport security.

1429
01:34:42,207 --> 01:34:43,082
You die!

1430
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:45,542
Go ahead, shoot her.

1431
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:52,042
Sonklin.

1432
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:56,375
Usasawan.

1433
01:34:57,832 --> 01:34:58,832
You only do evil things.

1434
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,750
You sent the psychic
to cast the spell on me.

1435
01:35:02,832 --> 01:35:04,500
That's true, isn't it?

1436
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:08,167
Do you all want to know who killed me?

1437
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:10,750
Yes, we do. Who killed you?

1438
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,250
It was you, Usasawan!

1439
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:17,250
-You evil!
-Evil!

1440
01:35:17,457 --> 01:35:19,042
You fucking bitch!

1441
01:35:20,207 --> 01:35:21,875
You two evils.

1442
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,957
I did not do it.

1443
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:24,917
You killed me.

1444
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:28,332
Hey, you lying ghost,
do you have a witness?

1445
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:30,707
-Yeah. Witness.
-I am.

1446
01:35:33,667 --> 01:35:34,707
Do you remember me?

1447
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,957
I'm that boy.

1448
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:40,000
-That boy.
-What boy?

1449
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:43,667
Surasakmontree.

1450
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:47,750
You are having an affair with Sonklin?

1451
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:54,375
I've given you everything. I love you.

1452
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,917
But you never loved me.

1453
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:01,332
You must die.

1454
01:36:01,457 --> 01:36:03,082
You can't kill Surasakmontree.

1455
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:12,500
Surasakmontree. What does this mean?

1456
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:17,792
Don't tell me
you have an affair with Sonklin.

1457
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:19,750
Great.

1458
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,250
So...

1459
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:26,957
you shouldn't live. Get lost.

1460
01:36:43,957 --> 01:36:46,417
Hey! Look where you are going!

1461
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,457
Get lost.

1462
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:59,042
You should admit that you are the killer.

1463
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:02,582
Don't tell me that you are that kid
that ran into me.

1464
01:37:02,707 --> 01:37:03,582
Yes, I am.

1465
01:37:04,082 --> 01:37:07,917
-Are you still around here?
-You should turn yourself in.

1466
01:37:10,582 --> 01:37:13,167
-There is a witness.
-I didn't do it.

1467
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:14,792
I didn't do it.

1468
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,667
-Oh, my God.
-Gun.

1469
01:37:41,832 --> 01:37:43,125
She killed her boyfriend.

1470
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:48,582
-Shawn.
-Look. She killed her boyfriend.

1471
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:50,500
She killed her boyfriend too.

1472
01:37:54,332 --> 01:37:55,917
-Shit!
-Again, huh?

1473
01:37:56,082 --> 01:38:00,667
No. Not me.
I have nothing to do with this.

1474
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,375
-I did not--
-Don't!

1475
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,792
I have nothing to do with this.

1476
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,625
Scary.

1477
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,125
Done.

1478
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:21,875
They were dead.

1479
01:38:23,582 --> 01:38:25,125
-It's okay.
-What should we do?

1480
01:38:25,207 --> 01:38:29,207
Don't worry. I'll handle this.
I'm calling the police.

1481
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:37,457
-I'm calling the police station. Hello.
-So fast.

1482
01:38:38,957 --> 01:38:42,000
Is that a police officer?
Please come over here.

1483
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,457
Somebody shot herself.

1484
01:38:45,417 --> 01:38:47,500
I promise, this time...

1485
01:38:47,917 --> 01:38:51,917
-there is no scapegoat.
-Are you Thai, huh?

1486
01:38:52,542 --> 01:38:53,457
Yes, I am.

1487
01:38:54,917 --> 01:38:59,542
Sis, you should check if these two
have transferred their stocks to anyone.

1488
01:38:59,792 --> 01:39:01,332
It's a different case, bitch!

1489
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:05,000
I want to thank everyone

1490
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:09,875
for saving me from Usasawan

1491
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,457
so she could not take my wealth.

1492
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:17,500
Kouy, I know you must regret

1493
01:39:17,707 --> 01:39:20,417
that you didn't marry me.

1494
01:39:22,417 --> 01:39:24,582
But I have to say...

1495
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:28,457
that I only have...

1496
01:39:29,082 --> 01:39:34,667
you in my life. I love you.
And Taew too.

1497
01:39:35,707 --> 01:39:37,582
-Don't be sad.
-Sad about what?

1498
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:41,000
That you can't have me
be your daughter-in-law.

1499
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:45,167
Yeah, whatever you said.

1500
01:39:46,707 --> 01:39:49,667
You all can leave now.
It's all over.

1501
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:51,917
-Good luck.
-Wait.

1502
01:39:59,707 --> 01:40:03,125
Thank you very much for bringing back
happiness to my school.

1503
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:07,292
You are welcome. It's our duty.

1504
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:10,292
If you need anything in the future,
please call us.

1505
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:11,582
-Taew!
-Taew!

1506
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:12,542
Taew!

1507
01:40:13,917 --> 01:40:15,875
-Mom.
-You said so clearly.

1508
01:40:17,457 --> 01:40:19,250
It's okay, but...

1509
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,292
please don't call
because we don't want to come.

1510
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:24,500
We get so tired and dizzy
when we are here.

1511
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:29,332
We'll have to leave now.

1512
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:32,417
Bye-bye, boys.

1513
01:40:32,917 --> 01:40:35,792
Don't forget.
Living in hipster land,

1514
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:37,832
you got to be pop!

1515
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,542
That's right.
Slow life. Slow life. Slow life.

1516
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:46,500
Ladies, please.

1517
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,250
-Who's driving?
-You.

1518
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:53,707
-Only you have the manliest body.
-That's so annoying.

1519
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:58,625
Travel safe, Kapoo.

1520
01:41:02,542 --> 01:41:03,750
Songkram, over here.

1521
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:07,875
Bye-bye. See you later, guys.

1522
01:41:09,792 --> 01:41:10,875
Oh, no!

1523
01:41:13,332 --> 01:41:16,750
Go. Bye-bye.

1524
01:41:25,707 --> 01:41:27,667
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

1525
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,500
-So beautiful.
-Such a sweet smile.

1526
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:40,667
Don't you see I'm... What?

1527
01:41:42,457 --> 01:41:44,500
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

1528
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,957
Sure.

1529
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,125
Since that incident,
nobody has ever seen

1530
01:42:14,457 --> 01:42:18,207
Sonklin's spirit again.
But someone saw aunt Yoad

1531
01:42:18,707 --> 01:42:22,207
carry Sonklin's body and ran away.

1532
01:42:22,707 --> 01:42:27,332
Sometimes, things are not
what you thought they are.

1533
01:42:28,207 --> 01:42:30,917
Do you remember the day
I ran into Usasawan?

1534
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,832
Do you want to know

1535
01:42:33,457 --> 01:42:36,625
what happened afterwards?

1536
01:42:39,082 --> 01:42:42,125
Surasakmontree. Surasak.

1537
01:42:42,917 --> 01:42:44,667
-Surasak!
-Sonklin!

1538
01:42:45,917 --> 01:42:48,250
Why are you being difficult?

1539
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:54,792
You stole my man.

1540
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,750
I reject every man
that throws himself at me.

1541
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:00,457
I want only him.
And you stole him from me!

1542
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:12,500
Good people may not be as good
as they appear to be.

1543
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:15,332
Don't be afraid of people
with harsh words.

1544
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:18,332
Be afraid of those who talk sweet.

1545
01:43:20,707 --> 01:43:24,417
Eventually, the principal was killed
by Sonklin's spirit.

1546
01:43:24,832 --> 01:43:28,250
What goes around comes around.

1547
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:46,792
LIVE LIKE A DICK
IT CAN GET UP EVERY TIME IT FALLS

1548
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,792
Good! What are you laughing at?

1549
01:43:58,332 --> 01:44:01,667
Oh... watch me.

1550
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:04,125
When you were born, I did often...

1551
01:44:04,332 --> 01:44:07,542
I was your mom... your dad.

1552
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:11,500
The first period, masturbation.

1553
01:44:22,292 --> 01:44:23,167
Cut.

1554
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:28,332
Go to the principle's room.

1555
01:44:29,707 --> 01:44:31,750
Bitch! That's my duck.

1556
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:41,667
I am sorry, I couldn't bear it.

1557
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:43,457
Thank you.

1558
01:44:45,042 --> 01:44:45,917
Ake.

1559
01:44:49,542 --> 01:44:50,417
Oh, shit!

1560
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:56,167
Is the principle dead?

1561
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:00,500
Panic.

1562
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:01,750
Agitated.

1563
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,375
Agitated.

1564
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:05,292
Okay. Say it together.

1565
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,707
I want to see the master.

1566
01:45:09,707 --> 01:45:10,582
Again.

1567
01:45:11,417 --> 01:45:12,832
The master is your father.

1568
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,542
Your mother is also your father.

1569
01:45:19,542 --> 01:45:21,082
Why don't you ask?

1570
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,125
You don't ask...

1571
01:45:23,207 --> 01:45:25,417
Ye-ta-se-suu, ye-ta-se-suu.

1572
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:28,042
Go, go...

1573
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:34,125
I forgot.

1574
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:38,917
The poison you gave me
to kill my sister.

1575
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:41,750
It didn't do anything to bla bla bla...

1576
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,125
What's wrong with your arms?
Why are they so big?

1577
01:45:49,207 --> 01:45:51,332
Did you inject them
with baking powder?

1578
01:45:54,957 --> 01:45:55,832
Bitch!

1579
01:45:55,917 --> 01:45:56,832
You are too loud.

1580
01:46:00,542 --> 01:46:01,417
Cut.

1581
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,167
