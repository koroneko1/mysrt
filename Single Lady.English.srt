[Bright] Why do all we modern girls
have to rely on ourselves more?

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,958
Good men are not easy to find.

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,500
The female population is three times 
higher than the male one.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,458
Besides, some of them 
tend to like each other.

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,250
But we don't really care
if nobody hits on us.

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,916
These days, women are smarter

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,250
and become more successful.

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,375
Many of us must be sick and tired

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,125
of letting men take the lead.

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,666
LET'S BREAK UP

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,791
Those who have had enough of being in love

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,125
set many rules for a new relationship,

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,708
become choosy, 
or set their expectations too high.

15
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,625
If that's you, prepare yourself 
to join the single ladies club.

16
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,750
Well, whether you're single 
intentionally or not,

17
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,166

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,583

single and feisty, or whatever,

20
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,958
the fact is, we are on our own.

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,208
How many times have we wrestled
with this depressing label?

22
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:23,458
Stop caring about this word.

23
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,833
If having a boyfriend is bad, 
then why bother?

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,625
We rather invest our time in making money

25
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,958
and stop being obsessed
and wasting time with this nonsense.

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,375
Actually,

30
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,958
being single is good in many ways.

31
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,708
There are always moments 
we can find happiness

32
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,666
because our life is ours.

33
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,083
Why would we live it in depression?

34
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,000
When we are single,

35
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,458
we have lots of time to do many things.

36
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,333
It's a reward in our life.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,208
BE SINGLE AND FABULOUS

[message notifications beeping]

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,958
All single girls have to be determined

to be independent.

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,291
If we haven't found the right one yet,

just stay fabulous.

43
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,708
Better we spend our precious time

44
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,375

that makes you the idol of single ladies?

48
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,291
The answer is in this book.

49
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,416
We can still be happy,

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541

The greatest gift in a woman's life is

00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,333
the love that God has given us

75

to get rid of loneliness 
on a lonely night.

that we weren't created to be alone

00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
Then you should keep laughing

It's hard to talk to an old lady.

Please don't.

Don't call a lady "Aunty," okay?

181
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,916
It's not polite.

182

You should call her "Granny."

00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,083
-Thank you. 
-All right.

338
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
It's a small world.

339
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,583
What are you doing here?

340
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,416
Waiting for you, maybe?

341
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,791
This is a public place.

342
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,333
Why can't I come?

343
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,583
I get a headache talking to you.

344
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,375
Why are you so frustrated?

345
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,583
Are you worried about
fixing your fortune with you ex?

346
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,000
How do you know?

347
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,666
I was there when 
Win's grandfather talked to you.

348
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,083
I don't care about fixing my fortune.

349
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,875
And I don't think I'll do it.

350
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,625
Isn't it a risk?

351
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,041
Not having a boyfriend is fine,

352
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,625
but the part 
about never being happy again,

353
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,125
doesn't that scare you?

354
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,250
What's your nickname?

355
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,250
Oh, the single ladies' idol.

356
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,500
So are you afraid 
of going back to your ex?

357
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,416
Come on.

358
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,250
Just think of it
as revisiting the good old days.

359
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,083
[plane landing]

360
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,333
[Bright] Mom, I'm here.

361
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,875
What's the name 
of that place where we used to live?

362
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,250
Come on. It's been a while.

363
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:16,958
[camera shutter clicking]

364
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,250
[child] Bright!

Bright!

366
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,583
Aunt Nong! Aunt Nong!

367
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,833
[Bright] Aunt Nong.

368
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,000
Aunt Nong.

369
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,708
Bright, is it you?

370
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,083
[Bright] Things don't change much here.

371
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,791
I don't know 
what my old friends will be like.

372
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,208
Aunty.

373
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:58,291
My friend, the tan, chubby one.

374
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,625
What's his name? I can't remember.

375
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,666
Your boyfriend, Jack?

376
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,041
He is not my boyfriend.

377
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,416
If you want to meet him,

378
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,625
just wait in front of the school 
in the evening.

379
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,333
Jackass.

380
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,708
Jack.

381
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,708
Take your pick.

382
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,916
Five baht.

383
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,458
Five baht.

384
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,375
Five baht.

385
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,458
[school bell ringing]

386
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,166
[woman] Are you looking for Jack?

387
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,291
Not that meatballs guy.

388
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,666
You want Stingy Jack. He'll come around.

389
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,916
There he is, speak of the devil.

390
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,791
Hello! You're busy today.

391
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,041
Aunty.

392
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,041
You can get your underling to collect it.

393
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,291
This small amount isn't worth your petrol.

394
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,750
Oh, with money stuff, I trust no one.

395
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,166
One black coffee. I'll be back.

396
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,250
Okay.

397
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,125
Oi...

It's mine.

What?

402
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,208
That lady is looking for you.

403
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,333
-Who is it?
-Back there.

You are thirsty, aren't you?

[bullies exclaiming]

408
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,666
I'll make you pay for this.

409
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,833
[boy 1] I'll see you next time.

410
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,250
I'll return.

411
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,666
[young Bright] Stop giving up.

412
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,416
You should fight.

413
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,291
Come here.

414
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,500
If you want to join the gang,

415
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,416
you have to accompany me home.

416
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,666
Very good.

417
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,125
It takes patience to be my sidekick.

418
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,458
Hurry!

419
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,791
I have something to tell you.

420
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:26,666
I'm very rich now.

421
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,666
I received an inheritance 
from my grandmother.

422
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,458
Money, gold, properties...

423
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,416
You see those buildings?
They pay the rent to me.

424
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,500
They can't see rich people.
They're jealous.

425
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,375
You're wealthy.

426
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,083
You must be married then?

427
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,166
What a pity for me.

Not yet.

429

Oh...

430
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,125
It's difficult to find real people.

431
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:56,208
Girls only look for money.

432
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,958
Who could love us

433
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,833
like we loved each other
when we were kids?

434
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,375
I've never forgotten you.

435
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,875
Really?

436
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,708
I better go collect the rent.

437
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll come back to pick you up for dinner.

438
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,875
I'll show you around.

439
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,916
Sure.

440
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,791
Your room number?

441
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,708
It's six... No. It's nine.

442
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,583
Number six... Nine.

-[Nok] All right.
-Can't you see? Bad service.

They don't hate that you're rich.

446

They just hate your guts.

Now that she knows I've become rich,

she rushes back to me.

458

At least she's pretty,

00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,833
even though she's a bit too old.

460

But it's okay.

garlands tonight.

Not now. Don't you see I have a guest?

Go. Get lost.

I wouldn't even look at him.

He is so ugly, 
and what's with that haircut?

Don't you have friends here?

481
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:07,000
People here are divided, 
the rich and the poor.

482

But it's okay.

483

I'm rich anyway.

We used to come and play around here.

Hmm. You played Mommy.

Are you out of your mind?

How could you do this, Jack?

This, too.

We broke up long time ago.

You know,

677
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,291
I'm divorced.

678
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,416
It must be because she's my daughter.

679
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,291
That's why I can't understand her.

680
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,958
It's like we talk in different keys.

I'm really his friend.

We became friends in college.

713

You must be very protective of him.

714
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:27,000
That's why you are mean towards your dad.

Not at all.

716
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,000
I really want him 
to have a real girlfriend.

But I'm not sure 
if he can really love someone.

718

Sometimes,

719
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,500
I also feel

720
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,875
like he doesn't love me.

00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,166
Why do you say that?

722
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,541
Who wouldn't love their own kid?

723
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,708
He might just be...

724
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,375
not so good at expressing it.

725
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,416
No way.

726
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,958
My mom left when I was born.

727
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,208
He was forced to raise me.

728
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,000
Every time I think about this,

729
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,791
it makes me not want 
to live with him anymore.

I'm getting there.

731
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,333
If he pressures me too much,

I'll run away from home.

When that girl got pregnant,

he had to be responsible.

And when you saw him singing for her,

737
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,125
he wanted you to forget him,

738

even though he was still in love with you.

If it's that easy, 
why don't you do it yourself?

Sure, if it was my problem,

It's Ken, the one Bright hates to bits.

When she left to study abroad,

she dated Ken while she was there.

780

Ken graduated first, so he came back.

And there he went.

He was flirtatious.

-How did you get here?
-You dragged me along.

844
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,791
No, I didn't.

845
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,083
You really did.
And all so you can talk to yourself.

846
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,708
You know, messing with other people's 
lives doesn't fix problems.

847
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,000
It creates more trouble.

848
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:22,083
I'm not asking for your advice,
so shut up.

You want me to go after him and help?

850

I'd rather ruin his life.

Let's go!

852
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:36,791
Oil, what did Ken do to Bright?

853
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:38,416
Why is she so furious?

854
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,666
Ken proposed to her.

855
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,208
She was very glad.

856
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,291
But everything turned out 
to be a prank by Ken

857
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:48,166
so he could win the game.

858
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,375
Bright was furious and depressed.

859
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:54,833
It seems she'll hold that rage 
for the rest of her life.

Are you two getting back together?

No, Grandma.

866
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,750
Not at all.

867
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I just came by to visit.

868
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,541
[woman] That's good.

869
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:43,500
I just want Tee to have 
a real Chinese wife.

870
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:57,166
This room was almost our home.

871
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,958
Why don't you sell it?

872
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,750
I keep it as a safe house
to escape from my family.

873
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:06,041
Don't worry.
I'll sell it when I get a good offer.

874
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:41,916
I don't know if it was right 
to break up with you.

875
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,166
You are so good, reasonable, and real.

876
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,291
You always listened to all my problems.

877
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,458
You were perfect.

878
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,833
How can I find someone like you again?

879
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,708
But you were bored eventually.

880
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,875
You lost all intimacy.

881
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,125
Living with me is boring.

882
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:06,250
And with my family on top of that...

883
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,291
That's why I decided to live alone.

884
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,500
Do you think

885
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,583
about what would happen between us?

886
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,583
We won't make it.

887
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,458
I really tried.

888
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,250
We can still be friends.

889
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:24,916
Right?

890
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm sorry.

[Tee] I met her on Facebook.

894
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,541
Then we chatted.

895

Just like that.

896
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,500
She is more than 20 years younger.

897
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,916
That's why you're much smoother now.

Really?

Yes.

and you like it?

907

You say it yourself.

You don't realize you're being used.

Have you brought Mint to your family?

When I was with you,

913

Grandma messed with me everyday, remember?

914
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,000
It would be the same with Mint.

Get them connected like this?

1010
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,500
And then blow the bubble.

1011
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,583
So you play with bubbles?

1012
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,666
Didn't you have one?

1013
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,291
No, I grew up in the city.

1014
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,458
Lame.

1015
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,458
[inaudible]

1016
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:52,000
NO PARKING

1017
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:56,333
[shouting]
Take care of your house, will you?

1018
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,500
They're getting old and decayed.

1019
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,291
Take good care of it.

1020
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,000
What the hell are you looking at, fatty?

1021
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,458
What's up, brother? Any problem?

1022
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:13,875
Don't you look at me.
I will mess with you.

1023
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,166
Everyday.

1024
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,000
Until you leave!

1025
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,166
Sorry I'm late.

1026
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,750
Sorry I'm late.

1027
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,083
Come on. Hop on.

1028
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,666
I'll take you around.

1029
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,125
You are a grown woman

1030
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,125
still playing like a kid, huh?

1031
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,541
What's the trick today?

1032
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,666
As you wish.

1033
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:29,583
Wait. I'm coming.

1034
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,416
Jack.

1035
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,250
I think...

1036
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:47,166
You got to be patient to be my sidekick.

1037
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,000
Move it! Hurry!

1038
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:51,916
Get on!

1039
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,500
Go!

1040
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,041
[inaudible]

1041
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,583
[woman] Jack, you haven't come by.

1042
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,458
Come on. Get your favorite snack.

1043
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,125
Bring it to him.

1044
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,916
Here.

1045
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:33,250
Jack, I'd like you to keep this place.

1046
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,166
It's not just for our memories.

1047
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,208
But for all of the people that live here.

1048
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:40,625
They have been living here 
since we were kids.

1049
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,791
Bright, I'll make this place prosperous

1050
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,250
so you can stay and get a job here.

1051
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,833
No need to go away.

1052
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,541
And why haven't you come back here at all?

1053
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,791
If not to see her first love,
she wouldn't be back.

1054
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,166
Keep building it up.

1055
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,500
[laughs awkwardly]

1056
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,208
Do you really think I'm your first love?

1057
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,000
Of course. [laughs nervously]

1058
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,791
-Jack. 
-Yes?

1059
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,666
Please don't sell this place.

1060
01:10:35,916 --> 01:10:36,916
Please.

1061
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,000
Let me think about it.

1062
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,666
Jack, the good memories...

1063
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,250
I hadn't thought of them,

1064
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,250
but I never forgot.

1065
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,625
[sighs]

1066
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:05,791
Let's go. Four more of your exes to see.

1067
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:09,708
Jack.

1068
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,291
Bright knocked on every door this morning

1069
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:21,083
and apologized on your behalf.

1070
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:24,708
She also said that 
everything that happened is her fault.

1071
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:30,041
She begged everyone 
to understand and forgive you.

1072
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,083
[inaudible]

1073
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,041
And Paul...ie,

1074
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,083
your second boyfriend, 
how will you help him?

1075
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,375
I'm thinking about it.

1076
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,291
What's your idea?

1077
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,041
I kind of have an idea, but...

1078
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,041
What's your idea?

1079
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,833
Why should I tell you?

1080
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,041
You have to tell me first.

1081
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,166
[Pauly] Why did you bring me here?

1082
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,750
You should have told me.

1083
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:26,750
Hey.

1084
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,166
Hello.

1085
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,500
-Please come in.
-Take a seat.

1086
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:40,625
Being gay is not a disease.
You can't cure it.

1087
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,916
Don't tell me you want 
this bitch to cure me!

1088
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,166
Shouldn't she cure herself first?

1089
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,875
She looks more confused than me.

1090
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,833
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

1091
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,000
Bitch.

1092
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,000
[mouthing] Look, she is mean to me.

1093
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,666
I bring you here to reboot,

1094
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:58,041
upgrade yourself to become 
the happiest gay man on Earth.

1095
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,250
Trance.

1096
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,583
What we are doing today is called 
a trance.

1097
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,083
Trance?

1098
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:04,916
Trance?

1099
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,291
What's a trance?

1100
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:09,708
Opening the door
back to your childhood complex

1101
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,958
that causes you unhappiness.

1102
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:14,583
Hey, my door is already opened.

1103
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:17,416
And it's wide opened already, Bright.

1104
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,166
Pauly, your door is rusty now.

1105
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:21,666
You should open it again.

1106
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,916
Try to open it.

1107
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,833
Re-open?

1108
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,500
Don't worry. I'll do it for you.

1109
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:27,458
Do it with you?

1110
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,500
Yes, I'm really good at it.

1111
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:31,666
Lie down.

1112
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,125
Be calm and relax.

1113
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:38,041
Close your eyes.

1114
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,750
Pauly,

1115
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,125
relax your body.

1116
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:47,041
Relax. Take it easy.

1117
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:49,791
Now look into the dark.

1118
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:52,166
In the dark,

1119
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,041
you won't see anything.

1120
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,250
Try to look at the end of the tunnel.

1121
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,375
There is a bright light.

1122
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:00,833
Do you see that, Pauly?

1123
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,708
-Yes.
-Do you see it?

1124
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,833
-I see it.
-That's great.

1125
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,208
Now you look inside.

1126
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,500
Let's get back to find something together.

1127
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,333
Take a step.

1128
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,333
Focus on the light.

1129
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,000
Easy, easy.

1130
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:22,541
Your lesbian lover is quite pretty.

1131
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:26,791
I just hope this works.

1132
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,500
[therapist] All right,

1133
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:32,625
let's get back to the situation

1134
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:36,125
that makes you unhappy.

1135
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,916
The perpetual unhappiness in your life.

1136
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,416
What is it?

1137
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,541
[screams]

1138
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:46,083
I know you used me.

1139
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,791
But I have money. Do you want it?

1140
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Please, don't leave me.

1141
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,708
I won't be bitchy. I'll be nice.

1142
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:55,791
I am bitchy because...

1143
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,750
I haven't taken the hormone pills.

1144
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:01,208
[laughs] Bitches, you are jealous of me.

1145
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:03,166
I'm pretty and fabulous!

1146
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,250
All the guys that you fancy,

1147
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:08,083
I do them all. [laughs]

1148
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:10,666
Although I'm gay, I'm a queen.

1149
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,625
But I can do all of your boys.

1150
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,375
[laughs]

1151
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,333
[moans]

1152
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,541
Ouch!

1153
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,750
The first time, it hurts.

1154
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,250
Ouch!

1155
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,333
Don't stop. Don't.

1156
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:27,833
Harder!

1157
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:31,750
Harder.

1158
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,208
Is this a hypnosis therapist

1159
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,916
or a shaman?

1160
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:43,666
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1161
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,791
[Khem] Yeah, I agree.

1162
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,291
So haunting, isn't it?

1163
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,166
[crying]

1164
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,291
He left me again.

1165
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,541
He left me again.

1166
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,416
Men are all deceiving.

1167
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,541
Why?

1168
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:01,250
We are almost there.

1169
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:04,208
[school bell dinging]

1170
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,666
It was because of that bitch.

1171
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:11,916
When I was in high school,

1172
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:13,958
she used me.

1173
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:16,666
No way.

1174
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:19,250
That can't be.

1175
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:21,875
That day, in the evening,

1176
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,541
after school,

1177
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,625
she kissed me.

1178
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:31,208
My first kiss, it should be meaningful.

1179
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:35,166
I realized later that she used me.

1180
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:37,791
She never loved me, not one bit.

1181
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,541
Busted.

1182
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,458
After that,

1183
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,208
I have always met deceiving people.

1184
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,333
I'm afraid to love anyone

1185
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,083
because I'm afraid I'll be used again.

1186
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,166
And it's true.

1187
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:58,250
I have only met deceiving people 
since that day.

1188
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,375
If not for that kiss,

1189
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,666
my life wouldn't be like this.

1190
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,375
Come on. At least
we know what the problem is.

1191
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:15,375
The therapist can find the solution.

1192
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,750
You should stay away.

1193
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,916
Let's see how it goes.

1194
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:22,458
Afraid I'll find out 
more secrets about you?

1195
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:24,875
[whispers] Okay, I'm going.

1196
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
All the problems have been solved, Pauly.

1197
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:34,500
All the bad experiences and memories
will fade away.

1198
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,458
You have to tell yourself

1199
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:39,000
that you will change 
your life and move on.

1200
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,041
You won't let those memories

1201
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:44,500
bring you more sorrow again, ever.

1202
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:45,833
Say it.

1203
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:48,750
[cell phone ringing]

1204
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,083
What do you want?

1205
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,750
You ran out of money? 
Is that why you call?

1206
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:01,666
Oh.

1207
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,791
I'm kidding.

1208
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:05,583
Where are you now? I'll bring you money.

1209
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,333
Okay, wait for me.

1210
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,291
It's all done, Pauly.

1211
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:19,750
[laughs]

1212
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,125
It was really good.

1213
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,791
-I'm glad you've come.
-I came?

1214
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,291
-Yes, you did.
-Thank you so much.

1215
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,541
Thank you, Pauly. I'm so happy for you.

1216
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,083
Thank you, Bright.

1217
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:30,041
I can't quite explain how good I feel.

1218
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,666
But now, can you keep me company?

1219
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,625
Let's go!

1220
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,375
[cell phone ringing]

1221
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,208
One moment.

1222
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:47,000
Hello, are you here?

1223
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:48,958
Okay. I'll get there.

1224
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,458
Yes, I'm here.

1225
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:51,708
Come here.

1226
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,541
You have been using me all along.

1227
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,541
[man grunts]

1228
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:58,541
Don't tell me that you take my money

1229
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,166
to give it to this ugly bitch?

1230
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:06,250
Bitch, did he tell you
that he is of royal blood?

1231
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:08,125
Actually, his name is Somchai,

1232
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:11,750
and he works at the BBQ restaurant, 
you dumbass.

1233
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,416
[woman whimpers]

1234
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,875
Why did you do this to me?

1235
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:18,916
Bright.

1236
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,583
Nida.

1237
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,208
Bright.

1238
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:25,000
Thank you so much.

1239
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:27,125
You made me realize...

1240
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,708
It's true what you said.

1241
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,916
Romance is not real.

1242
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,125
It's all deception.

1243
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,333
[crying]

1244
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,166
Wait, Nida.

1245
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:44,375
[Pauly exclaiming]

1246
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,125
That feels good!

1247
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:49,375
Pauly.

1248
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,666
Is that a gay guy or a boxer?

1249
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,625
You look more like yourself

1250
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,458
since you've met Mint.

1251
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,583
[Tee] Really?

1252
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,041
Isn't that like when we were dating?

1253
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,916
How could that be?

1254
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,958
Mint is much younger than me.

1255
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,166
[whispers] Old lady.

1256
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,916
Bright, anything you'd like to talk about?

1257
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,500
Since the other day.

1258
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,750
You can just tell me.

1259
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,666
Hello.

1260
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,375
What a coincidence.

1261
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:55,291
Tee, that guy over there is

1262
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:57,083
my friend with benefits I told you about.

1263
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,708
We met last week.

1264
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,833
Is he cute?

1265
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,625
[Tee] He looks dumb.

1266
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,708
But not as cool as those last two guys.

1267
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,791
You do as you please. Don't worry.

1268
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,916
But not too often, okay?

1269
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:16,250
Tee, I'm not mad at you

1270
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:19,250
that you go out with Bright.

1271
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,375
But you can't forget 
my birthday next week.

1272
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,833
See you later. 

1273
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:27,875
Bye.

1274
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:28,791
Bye.

1275
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:29,708
See you.

1276
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:38,625
Tee, you are a saint.

1277
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,250
Aren't you jealous?

1278
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:41,916
Why would I be?

1279
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,875
She can hang out with anyone she wants.

1280
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,625
Life is full of uncertainties.

1281
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,958
Look at us.

1282
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:50,791
I bought the wedding ring,

1283
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,291
but yet haven't used it.

1284
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,041
[sighs] What is ours

1285
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:00,583
will always be ours.

1286
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:01,791
Right?

1287
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,083
Sounds like you let it all go.

1288
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,833
Let me tell you something.

1289
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,541
I have an arrangement 
to meet the bride next week.

1290
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:15,875
The elders have set it up.

1291
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:19,625
Grandma expects me to get married.

1292
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:21,208
I'm growing old.

1293
01:22:21,666 --> 01:22:24,833
Here, the daughter 
of a canned fish factory owner.

1294
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,416
The arranged date is Mint's birthday.

1295
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,000
Does she know?

1296
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,416
I'm breaking up with Mint

1297
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,875
after we celebrate her birthday.

1298
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,041
Then I'll go meet the bride
and talk about marriage that evening.

1299
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:48,708
Break up?

1300
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:52,958
She should meet someone real.

1301
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,333
So she doesn't have 
to waste her time with me.

1302
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,208
Don't you love her at all?

1303
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,750
I do.

1304
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,541
But what can I do?

1305
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,458
So I guess I'll see you later.

1306
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,916
Sure, see you later.

1307
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,541
[Mint] Bright.

1308
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,333
I just want him to be jealous.

1309
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:38,250
[sighs] But it doesn't seem to work.

1310
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:42,000
You want him to be jealous, 
so you love him.

1311
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,250
[Mint sighs]

1312
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,375
If this relationship is going nowhere,

1313
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:57,875
I can't do it.

1314
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:01,375
He'll see.

1315
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:04,875
Someday, I'll really leave him.

1316
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:18,541
This looks like a complicated case.

1317
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:21,291
Well, we know now they are both in love.

1318
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:24,666
But how will 
we make his family accept this?

1319
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,541
I think the most important is,

1320
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,000
he has to stand up and fight for this.

1321
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,583
That's right.

1322
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,458
Okay.

1323
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:37,708
Let's go to Pauly.

1324
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,291
Wait.

1325
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,208
What's the secret plan?

1326
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,250
You look suspicious.

1327
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:46,125
No.

1328
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,583
-Huh?
-Hmm?

1329
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:49,916
What are you going to do?

1330
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,083
There will be little touches
here and there.

1331
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,375
No way.

1332
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,916
Why do I have to do this?

1333
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:58,708
You will.

1334
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,291
You really like me?

1335
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,291
Don't fool me.

1336
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:11,833
Don't pretend that you like me, okay?

1337
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:16,333
Things like this, 
you have to prove yourself.

1338
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:17,833
[Khem] Hey! Hey!

1339
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:28,250
I think we should take it slow.

1340
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,375
Why should we?

1341

01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:48,416
I know, Dad.

1510
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,083
Yes, I will be there.

1511
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:51,916
Yes.

[cell phone chimes]

1514
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:08,500
Tee,

1515
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,500
we had to break up

1516
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,250
because we didn't get along.

1517
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,750
It was not a match,

1518
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,333
no matter how hard we tried.

1519
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:21,000
But today, Mint really makes you happy.

1520
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:24,333
You should really keep this relationship.

1521
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,750
What made me love you

1522
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:28,208
when we dated

1523
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,958
is your determination.

1524
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:33,250
Now I ask you to do that again

1525
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:36,666
for your happiness and the one you love.

1526
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:42,750
This ring
is the one you bought for the wedding.

1527
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:46,375
You should give it 
to the one you really love.

1528
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:56,583
Mint.

1529
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:59,000
It's so beautiful.

1530
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,791
Mint, I have something to tell you.

1531
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:05,375
Mmm?

1532
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:16,833
Tee is not usually late.

1533
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:19,541
Maybe he's busy getting ready.

1534
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,208
Let's eat.

1535
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:23,166
I don't want to eat.

[man] There he comes. Tee.

1538

Tee is here.

1539
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:38,833
Take a seat.

1540
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:55,375
I'm sorry.

1541
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:58,958
I can't marry someone I don't love.

1542

[speaking Mandarin] You're a bastard!
Who do you think you are? Go to hell!

Oh dear, calm down.

You are bullshit! Go to hell!

Wait, wait, wait.

1550
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:26,333
They're gone.

1551
01:38:30,041 --> 01:38:31,458
Why won't you get married, Tee?

1552
01:38:31,541 --> 01:38:33,916
Are you gay?

1553
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,875
Just tell me. I can try to understand.

1554
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Mint.

1555
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,000
Who is that?

1556
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,916
Uh...

1557
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,041
This is Mint, my girlfriend.

1558
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:51,291
[women] What?

1559
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:52,625
Girlfriend?

1560
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:54,583
Look at her makeup and dress.

1561
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:56,125
I can't take this. No way.

1562
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:59,125
Look, Grandma. She's not Chinese.

1563
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:00,500
She looks so Thai.

1564
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:05,000
Grandma won't let her marry him.

1565
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:09,708
Anyway, I insist
that I will only marry the one I love.

1566
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:12,458
Even though you don't like it,

1567
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:14,541
I will continue living with her

1568
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:17,541
and will never marry anybody.

1569

This is the one Tee loves.

1578
01:39:57,333 --> 01:40:00,833
Tee is very happy when he is with her.

1579
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:03,875
I think it would be great

1580
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:06,250
if Tee were happy like this every day.

1581
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:15,125
[grandma] I've never seen Tee

smile so happily like this before.

1583
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:32,625
Good posture. She'll have many children.

1584

Thank you, Bright.

01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:22,083
You thought about proposing,

01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:25,458
don't you want to ask me at all?

1590
01:41:34,833 --> 01:41:36,291
Will you marry me?

1591
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:59,208
You can make me wait,

1592
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:02,375
but I will marry you for sure.

When will you two get married?

Grandma, no, it's not like that.

He is not my boyfriend.

1601
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:38,541
I haven't thought 
about marriage for a long time.

1602

Even though it's destiny.

1603
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:43,541
But if we don't fight for it,

1604
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:47,208
there is no way we get what we want.

Stop making that silly face.

If you help me, we are even.

If you call it even,

1610
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:16,375
I'll do anything you want.

1611
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:18,125
Let's discuss the plan.

1612
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,916
So you just walk your sexy self in,

1613
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:22,458
lure him into the trap.

1614
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:30,625
Flirt with him!

1615
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:34,583
Seduce him so he shows his true colors.

1616
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:43,708
And do I have to get laid?

1617
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:45,125
I'm scared.

1618
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:56,750
Not a big deal.

1619
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:58,208
You'll remain intact.

1620
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:01,750
I'll use my connection in marketing

1621
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:04,000
to get Mild here to discuss work.

1622
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,458
Wait.

1623
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:13,500
What's happening?

1624
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:15,541
Someone you know?

1625
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:18,666
Should we go say hello? I'll go with you.

1626
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,708
Where is your friend?

1627
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:25,833
Where has he gone?

1628
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,083
Do you see him anywhere?

1629
01:44:27,166 --> 01:44:30,083
Is it him over there?

1630
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:33,500
You're doing much more 
than you were paid to do.

1631
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,250
Isn't that your fiancé?

1632
01:44:36,416 --> 01:44:39,208
This is too much. Don't let him.

1633
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:41,083
Take a video for evidence.

1634
01:44:41,333 --> 01:44:42,208
Here.

1635
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:43,708
Hold it. Press the button.

1636
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:49,541
[Bright] Oh!

1637
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:50,458
Mild.

1638
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:51,541
Mild.

1639
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:55,625
Well, when you make an evil plan,

1640
01:44:55,708 --> 01:44:57,500
you seem to enjoy it so much.

1641
01:44:58,083 --> 01:45:02,458
[Bright] Then I will turn
her good-girl attitude

1642
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:05,166
into a feisty one
so she never gets used by a bad guy.

1643
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,916
Double shot.

1644
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:08,708
I think that's enough.

1645
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:14,500
If it was you, what would you do?

1646
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:15,833
First of all,

1647
01:45:15,916 --> 01:45:18,250
I wouldn't go home to cry alone, ever.

1648
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:20,583
We have to go through this,

1649
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,208
or we will always lose.

1650
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:24,541
But it's not me at all.

1651
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,083
Then change.

1652
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:28,625
Everybody can change.

1653
01:45:28,916 --> 01:45:30,750
Then you can, Mild.

1654
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:33,833
It's men's nature.

1655
01:45:34,041 --> 01:45:36,750
What's difficult to get is,
they want even more.

1656
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:40,208
What's easy to get is,
they think it's worthless.

1657
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:44,333
The advantage bitches have
over a good girl like you,

1658
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:45,541
you know what it is?

1659
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:51,708
They are never submissive to men.

1660
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,875
This is what men like

1661
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,750
because it's exciting.

1662
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,416
But the most important thing is,

1663
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:01,125
no matter what kind of victim they are,

1664
01:46:01,333 --> 01:46:03,291
girls have to wait for men to choose.

1665
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,500
Why is that?

1666
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:08,541
Why don't we start 
hunting them down ourselves?

1667
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:16,708
You have build it up this way.

1668
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:18,583
Don't you think you can fix your fortune?

1669
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:20,500
You'll get more bad karma this way.

1670
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:23,416
Mild, take a look over there.

1671
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:26,083
I think he's been looking at you a while.

1672
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,750
Take a chance.

1673
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:36,708
And you will find excitement.

1674
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,875
I got it now.

1675
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:55,625
I'll call off the engagement tomorrow.

1676
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:02,000
Thank you.

1677
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,125
Now I'm all pumped.

1678
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,583
I'm more ready for excitement than ever.

1679
01:47:11,083 --> 01:47:12,041
Good.

1680
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:13,375
Hello.

1681
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:14,458
Hello.

1682
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:16,875
You come with your older sister?

1683
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:23,416
Mild, I will see you later.

1684
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:26,041
Excuse me.

1685
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:34,166
Do you want my number?

1686
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:37,416
Really?

1687
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:50,041
Hey, Bright.

1688
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:54,291
Get away!

1689
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:55,666
Why?

1690
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,458
Get away now!

1691
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:00,583
It's Mild, isn't it?

1692
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:05,291
Bright, can't we just talk like normal?

1693
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:07,666
No, go back to wherever you crawled from!

1694
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,000
[screams] Get away!

1695

Get away!

1697
01:48:13,916 --> 01:48:15,125
Get away from what?

1698
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:18,666
What?

1699
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:24,041
Don't.

1700
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:25,125
Yes, thank you.

1701
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:27,166
I'll call you later. Bye.

1702
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:36,375
[Ken] Mild.

1703
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:39,166
Mild.

1704
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:40,250

1705
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:42,000
Mild.

1706
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:44,458
Mild.

1707
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,875
You got what you deserve.

1708
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:00,875
I don't agree with what you did.

1709
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,500
Hmm?

1710
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:03,708
What did you say?

1711
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:04,958
I can't hear you!

1712
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:08,583
Where is Gee?

1713
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:13,333
Well, well, dreamy, isn't it?

1714
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:14,833
You're shimmering.

1715
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:16,583
Just almost.

1716
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,833
He stopped all of a sudden,

1717
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:20,208
said he couldn't, and then he left.

1718
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:23,750
No way! Someone like him? No.

1719
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:28,000
Gee, one moment.

1720
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:30,541
Hey, seriously,

1721
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,833
do you resent him this much

1722
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,416
because he was bad to you

1723
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:37,125
or because he didn't choose you?

1724
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:39,750
[cell phone ringing]

1725
01:49:44,375 --> 01:49:45,833
Hey,

1726
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:47,791
Ken is calling.

1727
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:50,166
Did I get busted?

1728
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:51,583
If you want to know, answer it.

1729
01:49:57,291 --> 01:49:59,458
[Bright] Why do you
bring back old history?

1730
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:00,916
[Ken] I'm not bringing it back.

1731
01:50:03,166 --> 01:50:04,416
But if we've ever done anything wrong,

1732
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:05,916
we don't want to repeat it, do we?

1733
01:50:09,166 --> 01:50:10,916
Have you ever thought,

1734
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,500
when we were dating,

1735
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:15,291
what were we doing?

1736
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,833
Of course, you never even said
the word "love."

1737
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,666
Isn't it better than someone 
who says it all the time?

1738
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,750
If that day,

1739
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,541
I hadn't pushed you too much,

1740
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,625
you might have heard it from me.

1741
01:50:32,791 --> 01:50:35,500
Oh, the prank when you proposed to me?

1742
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:41,416
I really wanted to propose you.

1743
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:48,083
Ken. [exclaims]

1744
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:51,333
It's time.

1745
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,375
I love you, Ken.

1746
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:57,291
[laughs]

1747
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:01,208
You love me?

1748
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:05,291
You lost.

1749
01:51:06,916 --> 01:51:08,416
Go to hell!

1750
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,291
Bright.

1751
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:13,916
Bright, wait.

1752
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:15,625
I truly loved you.

1753
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:18,833
But I didn't know 
how to tell you that I loved you,

1754
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:20,375
that I was sorry.

1755
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:21,625
I love you, Bright.

1756
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:25,208
But if I had been calmer

1757
01:51:25,583 --> 01:51:27,500
and stayed a bit longer,

1758
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:30,000
we could have got married.

1759
01:51:31,166 --> 01:51:32,541
[chuckles]

1760
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:38,500
After that,

1761
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:41,083
I never got serious with anyone.

1762
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:45,125
It's not that Mild can control me.
[laughs]

1763
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,458
But who would want

1764
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:51,125
to win over someone 
who always lets you win?

1765
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,333
And now, I realize

1766
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:02,625
that I will never wrong anyone

1767
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:05,333
like I did you.

1768
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:09,875
Will you forgive me?

1769
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,625
All right.

1770
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:21,625
I forgive you.

1771
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:23,750
Thank you so much.

1772
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:31,208
Well, I'll propose to Mild tomorrow.

1773
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:49,500
I'm sorry that I got you wrong.

1774
01:52:49,583 --> 01:52:51,291
Ken will propose.

1775
01:52:51,583 --> 01:52:53,250
She will break up with him!

1776
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,041
What should we do?

1777
01:53:01,666 --> 01:53:03,333
[indistinct conversation]

1778
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:17,791
How do we fix this?

1779
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,541
Do you want to tell him the truth?

1780
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,458
Everybody.

1781
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:32,750
Mild and I, we have both been engaged
for a while now.

1782
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,250
I think this is the right time 
for us both--

1783
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:37,333
No!

1784
01:53:42,583 --> 01:53:46,041
I can't marry this selfish man.

1785
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:48,500
Mild.

1786
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:57,250
Here, Ken.

1787
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:02,250
What should we do?

1788
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:04,125
Dad.

1789
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:06,375
Mild, Mild.

1790
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,958
I can explain it.

1791
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:09,541
It's not what it looks like.

1792
01:54:10,166 --> 01:54:11,166
I don't want to listen.

1793
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:12,250
-Mild. 
-No!

1794
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:13,833
I don't want to listen.

1795
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:16,250
I've had enough with selfish guys.

1796
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,125
So I can take him now.

1797
01:54:30,125 --> 01:54:32,875
Ken, we can finally make it.

1798
01:54:34,375 --> 01:54:35,875
What do you mean?

1799
01:54:37,416 --> 01:54:38,916
Do you really want to know?

1800
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:44,333
Actually, I can't forget him.

1801
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:48,208
So I came up with a plan
to take him back from you.

1802

-[exclaims]

You guys are in this together?

Was it all your plan?

1806

You manipulated me to be bad like you?

Ken, back off.

1810

I will take care of the one who'd ruin us.

There is no certainty in my life,

That's exaggerating.

You didn't tell me.

Is it fate that had us meet?

Had us meet for a while

It's about me and this girl.

I met her a long time ago. Many times too.

But it's strange.

No matter how often I met her,

2064
02:13:08,958 --> 02:13:10,875
I never got to know her at all.

2065

Will you be my girlfriend?

2067

I only got the opportunity

2068
02:13:25,708 --> 02:13:27,625
to just keep looking at her from afar.

there is only her.

And this person is you, Bright.

Actually, we have met many times,

but we never had a chance to talk.

2085

Can I not laugh at my own thought?

I never want to believe in fate.

is love.

But a perfect love is

one where you have your loved one
right next to you.

2176

I'm sorry.

So let me wrap this up.

Men are not important.

But love, you can't live without.

If you want love, 
men are part of the package.
