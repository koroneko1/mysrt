&lrm;-Ready, dad?
&lrm;-As much as I'll ever be.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.500
&lrm;Happy career day, my darlings.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.660
&lrm;[Dad] My day begins

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.700
&lrm;at 4 am every morning
&lrm;because the bakery opens at 7.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.180
<i>&lrm;You'd think it's a routine life,</i>

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.580
<i>&lrm;making the same pastries, rolls, cakes...</i>

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.900
&lrm;but every day's different.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.980
&lrm;One day someone might order
&lrm;an Eiffel Tower cake and the next...

&lrm;Hi, father, it's me.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.620
&lrm;It's parents' career day, remember?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.220
&lrm;I was hoping you'd show up.
&lrm;Call me back.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.060
&lrm;-You OK?
&lrm;-Yeah, whatever. Nothing new.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.340
&lrm;[he sighs sadly]

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.340
&lrm;[Dad] Marinette will come round

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300
&lrm;to pass out some fresh croissants.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.900
&lrm;Thank you, Mr. Dupain.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.540
&lrm;Now, let's meet Alya's mom.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.260
&lrm;She's head-chef at Le Grand Paris hotel

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.860
&lrm;owned by Mayor Bourgeois.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.380
&lrm;It's beautiful.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.780
&lrm;Look, don't touch.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.900
&lrm;[Mayor] Put it away, Chloe.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.460
&lrm;It could get in the wrong hands.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.700
&lrm;How many croissants would your dad
&lrm;have to sell to buy one of these?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.700
&lrm;What am I saying?
&lrm;He'd have to sell the whole store.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.700
&lrm;If you're so rich,
&lrm;you don't need free croissants.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.260
&lrm;[she groans] Jealous.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.460
&lrm;Is that camembert?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.620
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.460
&lrm;That's not camembert,
&lrm;but it is very shiny.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.100
&lrm;I like shiny.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
&lrm;I have no dishes to share

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.220
&lrm;but maybe Mr. Bourgeois will invite you all
&lrm;to the hotel for lunch.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020
&lrm;[policeman chuckles]

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.660

&lrm;[Plagg giggles]

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.940
&lrm;[she squeals]

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.460
&lrm;[giggling]

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.180
&lrm;Do you ever not trip up?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.340
&lrm;[Marinette groans]

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.940
&lrm;[Plagg struggles]

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.180
&lrm;Next is Sabrina's father, a policeman,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.220
&lrm;Officer Roger.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.500
&lrm;I've been a police officer for 15 years,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.420
&lrm;and I believe that everyone
&lrm;is innocent until proven guilty.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.860
&lrm;My bracelet, it's gone!

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.060
&lrm;I had it a second ago.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.940
&lrm;You, you stole it!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.060
&lrm;What are you talking about?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780
&lrm;You tripped on my bag
&lrm;so you could steal it.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.740
&lrm;You're a policeman, arrest her.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.740
&lrm;[angrily] My daughter is not a thief.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.300
&lrm;Hold on, Miss Bourgeois.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.300
&lrm;We don't accuse without proof.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.100
&lrm;Everyone calm down.
&lrm;Maybe you simply misplaced it.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.180
&lrm;You're calling me a liar?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.340
&lrm;Daddy!

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.460
&lrm;Roger, I demand you search this girl.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.700
&lrm;[Chloe chuckles]

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.100
&lrm;[teacher] Please, everybody.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.700
&lrm;Need I remind you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.020
&lrm;that as mayor, I am your superior?

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.500
&lrm;But it's against the law.
&lrm;I can't just go...

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.100
&lrm;OK, then you're fired.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.940
&lrm;Mayor, you can't be serious.
&lrm;Over a missing bracelet?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340
&lrm;This is my daughter's bracelet.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.260
&lrm;You're incompetent, and you're fired.
&lrm;Get out!

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.180
&lrm;[he sighs sadly]

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.940
&lrm;[Chloe] Let's call Ladybug.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.740
&lrm;She'll actually do something.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.020
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.780
&lrm;Parent-child relationships
&lrm;can be so complicated...

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.100
&lrm;and a perfect breeding-ground for stress.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.460
&lrm;When there's no more law and order,
&lrm;there's only chaos left.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.420
&lrm;Fly away, my evil little Akuma,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.700
&lrm;and take control of this policeman.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.420
&lrm;[flapping]

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.500
&lrm;He expects me to break the law?
&lrm;That's just... criminal.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.460
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.820
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Rogercop,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.780
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.180
&lrm;This city needs a true, ruthless,
&lrm;righter of wrongs

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.220
&lrm;and that is where you come in.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.300
&lrm;Yes, sir.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.660
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;must be destroyed if you want retribution.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.860
&lrm;You will seize their Miraculouses for me.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.660
&lrm;Do we have an agreement?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.780
&lrm;[robotic voice] <i>&lrm;Affirmative!</i>

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.580
<i>&lrm;Cat Noir and Ladybug</i>
<i>&lrm;will be powerless against me.</i>

<i>&lrm;Justice will prevail in Paris.</i>

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.140
&lrm;Don't even think of going
&lrm;near my daughter's bag!

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.380
&lrm;Do you know who I am?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.660
&lrm;Gentlemen, this is a school.
&lrm;Think of the children.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.540
&lrm;I'm sure the bracelet is

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.820
&lrm;around here somewhere.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.820
&lrm;It probably just rolled out of her bag.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.820
&lrm;I'd try and get as far away
&lrm;as possible from that brat too.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.220
&lrm;[giggling]

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.500
&lrm;Hey, Nino's been filming everything.
&lrm;We can see what really happened.

&lrm;[Marinette] There you have it.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.980
&lrm;Sabrina was holding it.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.460
&lrm;Yes, but I gave it back straight after.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.220
&lrm;Chloe, take a look in your BFF's bag.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.500
&lrm;Are you saying I'm a thief?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.220
&lrm;No.
&lrm;Chloe's the one calling people thieves.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.180
&lrm;I'm going by what's on the video.

&lrm;Fine, since you're a suspect,
&lrm;you'll let me search your bag.

&lrm;Why would he steal a bracelet?

&lrm;If anyone's guilty, it's one of us.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.020
&lrm;Something about Paris
&lrm;just makes you wanna dance.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.820
<i>&lrm;You won't be dancing</i>
<i>&lrm;after I'm done with you.</i>

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.180
<i>&lrm;Arrest him.</i>

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.260
&lrm;So you won't be joining me?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.740
&lrm;[thumping]
&lrm;[groaning]

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.380
&lrm;[door creaks]
&lrm;[tiptoeing]

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.900
&lrm;[hushing]

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.340
&lrm;[whispering loudly]
&lrm;Go, Ladybug, go!

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.380
&lrm;[she groans]

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.300
<i>&lrm;Ladybug, it's time for justice to prevail.</i>

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.940
&lrm;You've got justice and revenge
&lrm;all mixed up, Rogercop.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.420
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.820
&lrm;Oven mitts?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with these?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.180
&lrm;[she whimpers]

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.380
&lrm;Fabulous, so wretchedly fabulous!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.420
&lrm;[groaning]

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.540
&lrm;OK, show's over.
&lrm;Sorry, no encore tonight.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.660
&lrm;[policemen groan]

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.980
&lrm;[Ladybug groans]

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.100
&lrm;[panting]

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.540
<i>&lrm;Get Ladybug</i>

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.140
<i>&lrm;and Cat Noir.</i>

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.540
&lrm;[squealing]

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.980
&lrm;[angrily] Hey, my hair!

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.220
&lrm;Stop shooting like an idiot.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.900
&lrm;You're supposed to seize
&lrm;their Miraculouses!

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.380
&lrm;The Akuma must be in his whistle.
&lrm;We've got to get to it.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.420
&lrm;How?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.340
&lrm;[they gasp]

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.220
&lrm;[zapping]
&lrm;[panting]

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.860
&lrm;[zapping]

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.780
&lrm;Whenever you're ready milady.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.700
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.340
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.980
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.180
&lrm;I have an idea,
&lrm;but I need something like... a ring.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.820
&lrm;[panting]
&lrm;[zapping]

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.300
&lrm;[zapping]
&lrm;Where am I gonna get a ring?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.460
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.660
&lrm;Ladybug, over there.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.100
&lrm;That's Chloe's bracelet.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.860
&lrm;Exactly what I need.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.140
&lrm;Fend off Rogercop as long as you can.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.620
&lrm;Whenever you're ready.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.860
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.980
&lrm;[he groans]

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.100
&lrm;[he chuckles]

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.060
<i>&lrm;Gotcha.</i>

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.180
&lrm;[fading cry] <i>&lrm;No!</i>

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.540
&lrm;Do more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.620
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.100
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.020
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.540
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.620
&lrm;[she cheers]

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.620
&lrm;[he gasps and laughs]

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.620
&lrm;[gasping] What am I doing up here?

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.300
&lrm;[together] Pount it!

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.780
&lrm;As Rogercop would say,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.420
&lrm;[Robotically]
&lrm;Justice has prevailed in Paris.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.780
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.380
&lrm;I'd stick around
&lrm;but you'd see me without my mask

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.420
&lrm;and you wouldn't be able to resist me.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.220
&lrm;I doubt it,
&lrm;but I'll take your word for it.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.100
&lrm;[she chuckles]

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.140
&lrm;You may have eluded me this time,
&lrm;Ladybug,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.580
&lrm;but one of these days,
&lrm;I'll be ruling the world,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.940
&lrm;and you and Cat Noir
&lrm;won't be a part of it!

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.300
&lrm;[Roger] I think this belongs to you.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.540
&lrm;My bag... my...my bracelet.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.860
&lrm;But... how?

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.540
&lrm;Roger... you found the bracelet?

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.140
&lrm;It was in Chloe's bag all along.
&lrm;It must have fallen

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.340
&lrm;into a side-pocket
&lrm;when that girl tripped.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.860
&lrm;Roger, I apologize for being accusatory

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.260
&lrm;and for firing you for no good reason.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.180
&lrm;I think Officer Roger
&lrm;has proven his worth.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.780
&lrm;You'd be wrong not to keep him.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.260
&lrm;Of course, Ladybug,
&lrm;you're absolutely right.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.780
&lrm;And it's actually Lieutenant Roger now.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.460
&lrm;Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.060
&lrm;I'm proud to be on the force

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.820
&lrm;and I vow to uphold my belief

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.620
&lrm;that everyone is innocent
&lrm;until proven guilty.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.260
&lrm;[earing bleeps]

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.580
&lrm;Very good, a valuable lesson learnt,
&lrm;right Chloe?

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.500
&lrm;[she groans] Yes, daddy.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.660
&lrm;Lesson learnt.
