00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,313
-All right, you ready to hear this?
-No, but go on.

3
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,026
So, I'm walkin' along the High Line
on my way to dinner

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,569
just to get a little hit of nature.

5
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,696
Plus, it's my secret shortcut
in that part of town.

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,741
I don't need a tour guide.
You're on the High Line, and then?

7
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:37,245
And I'm passing all these expensive
new condos, thinking, "You know what?"

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,706
"You really must be a exhibitionist
to live in one of these."

9
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,751
It's like a storefront window in Amsterdam
where prostitutes advertise.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,212
Not that I'm judgin' prostitutes.
A girl gotta do what a girl gotta do.

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,131
-Suzanne!
-Right.

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,550
So just as I had that thought,

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,803
I see Colin in one of these apartments

14
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,347
carryin' a bunch of movin' boxes

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,932
with Tyler.

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,525
[sighs]

17
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,195
Colin left me for Tyler?

18
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,823
Oh God, I wish I didn't see it. I'm always
seein' shit I shouldn't be seein'.

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,576
I can't even get on a subway
without a penis in my face.

20
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,246
Do you have any idea
what a cliché move this is?

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,623
He is half Colin's age.

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,584
Yeah, it's the same thing
men have been doin' to women forever.

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,420
Who knew gay guys
were just as awful as straight guys?

24
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,963
Yeah, just with better haircuts.

25
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,591
Wait, how does Colin even know Tyler?

26
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,926
I have no id--

27
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,846
-Oh my God.
-What?

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,349
They met at our company Christmas party
this past year.

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,060
-I fucking introduced them.
-[scoffs]

30
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,565
And later that night, we were looking
at Tyler's Instagram account together

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,361
and laughing
at his ridiculously thirsty selfies.

32
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,404
You know what? It sounds like you two

33
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,740
have a lot to discuss
at your next therapy session.

34
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,784
Oh, no, no, we are done with therapy.

35
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,080
Colin texted me
that there is "nothing more to work on,"

36
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,456
and now I know why.

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,251
-Oh, baby, I am so sorry.
-Huh.

38
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,754
-Ugh.
-[laughs] Ooh…

39
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,091
What are you doing? Wait, what--

40
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,052
-I have to let him know that I know.
-Oh, no, no, no. No. Give me that.

41
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
-Are you kidding?
-Give me this!

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,265
No angry texts, no drunk texts,
no communication at all.

43
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,433
It makes you look weak.
Plus, it doesn't work.

44
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,811
If it did, I'd be married
eight times by now.

-[sighs]
-Look.

46
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,107
I'm putting together
the presentation for Claire Lewis.

47
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,694
Are you still gonna be okay
to show Chrystie Street tomorrow?

48
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,737
If not, you know I got you, right?

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,906
Thanks, but I need
to be working right now.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,284
Work is what's going to keep me sane.

51
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,745
All right, well, this may sound crazy
right about now, but…

-I really do believe in you and Colin.

Yeah, why?

their mind. You watch. He'll be back.

You know why I keep getting his magazines?

-Why?
-Because you boys don't check your box.

And he's got an issue of The Economist
just sittin' there on the ledge.

which is the best layout in the building.

It also has newly upgraded windows,

93
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,292
per a recent building assessment
that you are not responsible for.

94
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,293
Why are they moving?

95
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,671
They have one child
and another on the way,

96
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,632
so they are moving into something bigger
in New Jersey.

That is so major.

It really is the best feeling in the world

104
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,781
to both find something that you love
together and then call it your home.

and scrape together the down payment,

00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:46,562
He's not cute. He's diabolical.
And that blond hair looks like a dye job.

161
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,940
I wonder how I'd look with blond hair.
It would really pop on screen.

162
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,943
So how did you find out?

163
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,197
Suzanne. She saw them together
moving into Colin's new apartment.

164
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,157
What kind of friend
tells you these things?

165
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,368
What, was she gonna not tell me?
She saw them.

166
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,370
Is that the hot guy you hate from work?

167
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,538
-I think I follow him.
-Unfollow him.

168
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,083
This is from our company's
Christmas party. I introduced them.

169
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,292
-[sighs]
-[Billy] That's cold.

170
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,711
-Having an affair with someone from work.
-Not an affair.

171
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,381
He left me for Tyler,
then didn't have the balls to admit it.

172
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,466
But it's good Colin's with a young guy.

173
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,010
Let him have his middle-aged fling.

174
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,554
He will quickly realize
that having a twink boyfriend

175
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,641
is a shallow, empty life
that leads nowhere.

176
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,600
No offense.

177
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,687
Actually, it leads to a life
of mind-blowing sex.

178
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,523
-You remember sex, don't you?
-Vaguely.

179
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,608
And you're really not helping.

180
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,776
Our company has a table

181
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,112
at the Central Park
Conservancy dinner tomorrow.

182
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,446
Tyler is gonna be there.

183
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,658
I'm afraid I might
stick a steak knife in his neck.

184
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,493
That's a nice butch fantasy.

185
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,539
But what you should do
is just play it cool until it fizzles out.

186
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,456
Really?

187
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,751
You really don't think it's over?

188
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,629
No. I do not think it's over.

189
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,799
I agree. Couples break up
and get back together all the time.

190
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
-Look at the Jonathans.
-That's right.

191
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,554
They broke up
for a couple months a few years ago

192
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,472
when Jonathan had that thing with Jorge,

193
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,475
the Mexican travel agent
who he thought looked like Ricky Martin.

194
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,561
He almost moved to Puerto Vallarta.

195
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,187
I thought he just loved it there.

196
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,814
You can like it for two weeks.

197
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,066
Then it's like being trapped
at a gay quinceañera.

198
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,153
The point is it was a fling.

199
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,363
He got it out of his system,
and they're back together.

200
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,948
Thanks. That does give me some hope.

201
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,492
Okay, this is starting to sound
like a cautionary tale.

202
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,828
Please, do not have a baby with Colin.

203
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,663
I'll have nobody left
to go to dinner with.

204
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,375
Exactly. And we're too old
to find a new friend.

205
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,295
[jazzy music playing]

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,557
-Hey, Jack. Hey, Millie.
-[Millie whines]

207
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,392
[panting]

208
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,606
I really am sorry about you and Colin.

209
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,732
What do you mean?

210
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,942
Didn't you split up?

211
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,946
-What makes you think that?
-The boxes, the suitcases.

212
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,573
The U-Haul parked out front.

213
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,494
Some hot little number was helping him.

214
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,122
It looked like the beginning
of one of my favorite poems,

215
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,665
Pack My Box. [chuckles]

216
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,293
I still have the VHS somewhere.

217
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,046
-If you want to check it out.
-Oh, thanks.

218
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,800
My VCR was stolen in 1992.

219
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,259
Anyway,

220
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,929
I don't care what people say.

221
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,848
I always thought
you were the good-looking one.

222
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,518
Thank you?

223
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,647
Did he say anything to you?

224
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,564
Yes.

225
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,982
"Goodbye." Hah!

226
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,985
-Don't you just hate men?
-[bell dings]

227

[pensive music playing]

228
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,416
Is Colin ever going to pick up
his Wall Street Journal,

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,252
or is he just gonna let them pile up?

230
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,586
I'll take care of it.

231
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,714
[upbeat music playing]

232
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,224
Happy Central Park Conservancy.

233
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,853
Well, whatever you are selling tonight,
I am buying.

234
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,689
-[laughs]You're not exactly my customer.
-Ha-ha!

235
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,066
-Uh, thought you might need this.
-Why?

236
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,651
Good news, bad news.

237
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,987
-Bad news first.
-Tyler's sitting next to you.

238
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,155
Ugh. And did he bring his new boyfriend?

239
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,700
No. He doesn't have a plus-one.
None of us do.

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,578
But now for some better news.
Claire Lewis is here.

241
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,745
Did you talk to her?

242
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,915
I started to, but then she just
handed me her empty champagne glass

243
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,458
and said, "I'll take another, dear."

244
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,710
[chuckles] Where is she?

245
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,920
Inside, bidding on the silent auction.

246
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,423
I'm gonna go say hi
and tell her how excited we are

247
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,842
-about selling her apartment.
-Mm! Nice.

248
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,552
[chuckles]

249
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,469
Thank you.

250
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,847
No, no. That's for Claire.

251
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,435
Claire! Michael Lawson.

252
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,936
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

253
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,980
Michael Lawson, Stanley's friend?

254
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,525
Uh, broker who came to see
your beautiful home.

255
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,238
Oh! Yes. I'm sorry, the broker.
There have been so many of those.

256
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,158
And you're wearing a tux.

257
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,619
You know, all men look the same in a tux.

258
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,872
Every time I see a fat ass
in a monkey suit, I think it's my husband.

259
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,832
[laughs]

260
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,668
-You bidding on something?
-Ah!

261
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,046
A week at the Amanyara
in Turks and Caicos.

262
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,882
-Ah.
-I thought I could bring my daughter.

263
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,011
Although she doesn't want me to call her
my daughter since she's nonbinary now.

264
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,014
Actually, the idea
of sharing a room with her,

265
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,391
I mean them, excuse me,

266
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
would be the opposite of a vacation.

267
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:42,942
But maybe I'll have a new love in my life
by the "one-year expiration date."

268
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,235
"Breakfast and airfare not included."

269
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,738
-I'm sure you will.
-Right.

270
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,616
And maybe I'll also have a unicorn
that shits money.

271
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495
My partner and I are excited

272
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,207
to be showing you the presentation
we put together for your apartment.

273
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,794
Um, your timing of the market
is just top-notch.

274
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, I've always been known
for my perfect timing.

275
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,965
[chuckles]

276
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,424
Right as he left,

277
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,095
I asked my husband why he started
shaving his balls all of a sudden.

278
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,639
Did he want them
to match his hairless head?

279
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,140
Do you know what he said to me?

280
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,519
"I'm so glad you asked, Claire."

281
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,188
"Perfect timing. I did it for Layla."

282
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,442
-This is where you say, "Who's Layla?"
-Oh.

283
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,944
Who's Layla?

284
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,405
His 25-year-old Pilates instructor

285
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,409
with whom he's decided to spend
the second half of his life.

286
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,952
The second half!

287
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,914
Because clinically obese men
often live to 130.

288
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,796
-Where are you sitting?
-Oh, over there with some friends.

289
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,966
My shrink told me
it's important for me to start going out,

290
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,262
even when I don't feel like it,
which is what I am doing here.

291
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,472
Well, I'm glad that you are,

292
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,474
-because you look amazing.
-[scoffs]

293
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:03,605
And you should not be denying the world
the pleasure of you.

294
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,441
You've already got the meeting.

295
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,737
-I'm gonna go find my table.
-All right. Have a great evening.

296
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,864
Don't outbid me now.

297
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
I promise not to. [chuckles]

298
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,214
[woman] Adopt a bench,

299
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,260
dedicate a paving stone,
donate flowers, endow a tree.

300
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,720
There are so many ways

301
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,723
to support this glorious park
that belongs to all New Yorkers.

302
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,184
Now, please, enjoy your meal.

303
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,189
-Looks like Tyler is a no-show.
-Yeah, no surprise.

304
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,649
-[upbeat music playing]
-He doesn't wanna face me.

305
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,985
But he can't keep running forever.

306
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,239
You'd be amazed the lengths
people will go to avoid confrontation.

307
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,617
-Textbook narcissistic behavior.
-Yeah!

308
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,079
Some will even secretly
move their things out of your apartment

309
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,289
before breaking up with you. [chuckles]

310
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,542
Ugh.

311
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,127
There he is.

312
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,296
[groans]

313
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,092
I'm sure that he saw me
and now he's afraid to come to our table.

314

Hello, Michael.

I'd really like to know
exactly when this started.

324

When what started?

325

Please. You know you're avoiding me.

You're too much of a coward

I'm sitting with my mother.

She's a co-host of this event,
and we have our own table.

The only reason Empire Realty
bought a table is thanks to me.

That's why you're here.

331
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,888
I know what's going on with you and Colin.

332
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,433
My neighbor saw you
helping him move out of my building.

[chuckles] I thought Colin not telling you
about me might make things awkward.

"Awkward"? Are you fucking kidding me?

335
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,570
You break up my relationship,
and you think it might be awkward?

I'm sorry Colin left you,

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,535
but the only thing going on between us
is that I found an apartment for him.

Suzanne saw you with him in his apartment
on the High Line, dude.

341
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,002
I helped him move a few things in.

342
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,172
I provide that level of service
to all of my clients.

343

It's called going the extra mile.

Not that old. A few years older than me.

Really? You're the younger one?

Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I've seen no evidence of another guy.

I really don't think
he left you for anybody.

I've gotta get to my table. Sorry.

Oh, uh, one more thing.

Would you stop
bugging Claire Lewis about her apartment?

00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,911
It's really embarrassing.

355
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,997
I've told you before,
she's my mother's friend.

Colin's not having a fling.

363
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,743
He didn't leave me for Tyler.
He didn't leave me for anyone.

364
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,997
He just wanted to leave me.

365
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,043
Which somehow feels even worse.

366
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,262
[sighs] It felt so satisfying

367
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,390
to tell myself this story
that Colin left me for Tyler

368
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,141
because it made him look so shallow,

369
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
but really Tyler was just helping him
plot his escape

she is to his mother.

her apartment to that millennial fraud.
