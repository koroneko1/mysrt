1
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,607
You should move to leave with your mom.

2
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:29,501
She has moved to the South for years. It's quite near my parents' house. 

3
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,666
I and mom can take care of you when you're there.

4
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:37,156
I really can't know how to live if that case really happens to you.  

5
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:40,435
You're still in contact with my mom?

6
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,828
Because... I adore her.

7
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,295
Then you mean...

8
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,546
That thing can happen to Phuc?

9
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,546
No. Itâ€™s not what I mean.

10
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:55,402
I mean if you move home, we can take care of you and make sure nothing will happen.

11
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,402
And... Phuc will be safe. 

12
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,133
Actually, this is also because of me.

13
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:21,003
Let me do it. 

14
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:22,524
Where's Duy?

15
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:24,752
He's at the restaurant. He's coming home at late night.

16
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:26,478
And Nu?

17
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,216
She went back to her parents' home. 

18
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,216
She'll be back the day after tomorrow.

19
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,215
You can take rest early today. 

20
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:39,216
Me... How about...

21
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:24,373
D*mn it! Even you want to laugh at me?

22
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,552
Why are you still here? I told you to leave early.

23
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:45,135
Or do you want to stay and see how miserable I can be?

24
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,088
You told me to move in here.

25
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:49,088
I've ended my rental contract with the landlord.

26
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,112
Where else could I go when you say that?

27
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,387
Pick up those books.

28
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,097
Yes.

29
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,336
What time is it?

30
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,146
It's 5 P.M.

31
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,485
Let me hold it for you.

32
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,263
Are you laughing at me?

33
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,263
I'm not!

34
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,537
What clothes did I just take?

35
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:07,250
You took a shirt and a pair of pants.

36
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:09,298
You're lying.

37
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,298
I'm not lying!

38
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,845
Here.

39
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,398
The weather's cool now, so I changed other pants for you.

40
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,621
Is that your phone?

41
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,601
Yes. I put it on the table in the living room. I'll go get it.

42
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,601
Let me get it. You should eat.

43
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,420
I think the caller has canceled it.

44
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,465
Give me the phone.

45
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,191
Give me the phone.

46
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:07,191
They're calling again. 

47
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,869
I've tapped "Answer".

48
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:12,942
Hello?

49
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,821
Why are you calling me?

50
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,357
Leave.

51
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,824
We have no...

52
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,626
I'll go out and talk to Linh for a while.

53
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,078
Let me lead you.

54
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,078
No need. I can go on my own.

55
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,265
Hello, bae!

56
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,927
Let me open the gate for you.

57
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,275
Phuc forgot to lock it again!

58
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,328
My darling!

59
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,122
Let go!

60
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:24,341
Leaving you made me realized that your embrace is my safest place.

61
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,341
Linh!

62
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,615
You don't love me anymore?

63
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,615
What do you want?

64
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,007
I want us to be together again.

65
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:34,255
This is your last chance.

66
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,534
If you want this to be the last, you wouldn't be out here to see me.

67
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,247
Drop your act!

68
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,865
Delete all of our photos.

69
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,157
You came out here just to want me to delete them?

70
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,271
Yeah.

71
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,592
You really don't love me anymore?

72
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,243
I want us to get back together.

73
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,886
I and you have no love for each other anymore.

74
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:03,886
Thach.

75
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,435
Delete the photos.

76
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,862
Linh!

77
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,237
Why are you here?

78
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,328
Get back inside.

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,971
How long do you think you can bear him?

80
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,909
A normal person spends his life taking care of a blind man.

81
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,777
He even needs help when he urinates or takes a bath!

82
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,452
Human all wants a normal love life.

83
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,452
We want to kiss, hug and hold hands.

84
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,812
Do you intend to do everything by your own?

85
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:38,237
Look at him!

86
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,594
He can't even tell where you're standing!

87
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:42,594
How could he find you lips to kiss you?

88
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:45,759
About what you feel, whether you're happy or sad,

89
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,106
even God can't help him to see it!

90
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,106
Just shut up! That's enough!

91
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:50,794
I don't lie

92
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,794
I just wanted to give you an advice

93
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,571
and to torment this selfish man, also. 

94
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:58,437
I heard it enough. You should leave now.

95
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,623
Can I ask you this, Phuc?

96
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,623
Have you ever wondered that

97
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,906
one would love you more or less if he sees who you truly are?

98
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,779
Are you done causing troubles?

99
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,667
We used to love each other so much.

100
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,667
You chased me away whenever you liked.

101
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,653
You could scold or hit me. You didn't respect me!

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,343
How could I feel safe when I was around you?

103
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,988
Don't think that I didn't know about your affairs.

104
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,541
Don't you ever show up in front of me again!

105
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Leave me alone!

106
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,841
Where are you two goi ng? Stop!

107
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,493
You... Stop!

108
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:36,494
You're a blind and broken man!

109
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,677
You will never be happy!

110
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,677
Phuc will leave you soon!

111
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,057
No one can love you like I do! Thach!

112
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,162
I'll wait and see how long can you and Phuc be happy together!

113
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,169
Don't keep her words in mind.

114
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:57,935
I don't think much about it.

115
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,232
Eat your food.

116
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:28,254
Thach.

117
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:31,556
Do you have feelings for Nu?

118
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:37,746
But... You said she was very important to you.

119
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
You grew up together.

120
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,374
How can't you have feelings for each other?

121
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:47,430
I told you that I had a close sister.

122
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,165
Sleep more. It's still early.

123
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,942
Can I ask you this?

124
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,718
I know what you are going to ask.

125
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:09,718
My answer is "Go back to sleep".

126
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:13,857
I've thought so much about it.

127
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,746
Nu came to you first.

128
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,746
And I'm... just someone who came latter.

129
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:22,782
Me, you haven't even seen my face yet.

130
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:27,102
Can just feelings make you love me enough?

131
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,021
Have you ever loved a boy?

132
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,049
Have you ever loved someone without seeing their face?

133
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:54,842
After all, maybe, sexuality and appearance are two most important things.

134
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,322
It feels so vague to me.

135
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:07,422
Like, there are people who were in love for years still broke up.

136
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:13,409
Let alone that you have never seen my face.

137
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:19,552
But, when you called me to come your place,

138
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:23,238
all my questions just disappeared.

139
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,666
Dear.

140
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,265
Do you really have feelings for me?

141
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,678
You said you used to  really love Linh, too.

142
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,654
How's it going between you and Thach?

143
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,761
It's been okay.

144
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,713
Hey. Yours is really big!

145
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:26,731
Yes?

146
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,211
It's so much bigger than mine!

147
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,625
Yours is big, too.

148
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,179
Should we use a ruler to measure them?

149
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,837
It's faster to measure by our hands.

150
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,905
Measure what?

151
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,835
What are you doing in front of me?

152
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,857
Nothing

153
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,857
I'm blind, not deaf.

154
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,857
Why are you angry?

155
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:49,388
The person I like is doing something shady with someone else.

156
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:51,091
Can you like that?

157
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,091
We we talking about our calves, mister!

158
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:56,782
Your calves?

159
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:00,936
What did you think we were doing?

160
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,558
I didn't think about anything.

161
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,000
Do we have any fruits?

162
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,223
I want to eat.

163
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,223
We do.

164
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:15,812
Duy.

165
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,492
Yes?

166
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,492
Help me delete the photos.

167
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,195
Put it there. I'll do it later.

168
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,195
Right now, please.

169
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,149
Okay.

170
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:33,378
Thank you.

171
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,134
How long did you study abroad?

172
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,609
I started since my second year.

173
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:51,609
It's been 4 years til now.

174
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,489
Three-second rule! It's safe!

175
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:03,261
Yeah, it is!

176
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,261
When I was a kid, I dropped a whole rice pot!

177
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,261
But my dad didn't scold me.

178
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,387
Where's Duy? 

179
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:37,387
He has a business at the restaurant.

180
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,730
Come sit next to me. Let's watch a movie together.

181
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Yes.

182
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,522
Sit here to watch and tell me.

183
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:52,682
Okay.

184
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,789
Let's watch movies on my phone.

185
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,918
What movie do you want to watch?

186
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:05,842
"It".

187
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,664
"It"?

188
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,149
Sounds strange to me.

189
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,885
Let me search.

190
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,151
A horror movie?

191
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,719
Yes. It's horror.

192
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,221
You should watch it alone. I still have homework to do.

193
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,526
Who will tell me the plot if you leave?

194
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,721
I'm afraid of ghosts!

195
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:34,680
Try it! I haven't watched a movie for so long. 

196
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,701
Okay...

197
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,278
Oof! He jumped off the building!

198
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:46,603
Who jumped off?

199
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:47,854
The zombie!

200
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,854
But he's alive!

201
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:54,000
How... What is jumping off a building then alive?

202
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:56,244
Uh... This guy is immune!

203
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,386
You said we'd watch a romance.

204
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,881
But, I love watching zombies!

205
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Can we watch something lighter?

206
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,276
The characters just stand still and talk.

207
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:09,571
Just keep quiet so I can watch the movie.

208
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,272
Today we had chicken livers, not tiger livers. 
How dare you raise your voice at me?

209
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:19,168
Keep silent and let me watch this movie.

210
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,297
Don't you care about me?

211
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,832
Nah!
