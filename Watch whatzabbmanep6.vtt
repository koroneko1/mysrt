WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
- I'd like to relinguish. - What?

00:01.920 --> 00:04.492
I won't make you feel disappointed for choosing me.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.090
Thank you. I will take good care of it.

00:07.334 --> 00:08.664
Please give me another chance.

00:24.203 --> 00:25.225
Amy.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.190
Today, I come to bid you a farewell.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.246
I think,

00:37.242 --> 00:39.718
I will go and stay at my home in Chiang Mai for a while.

00:43.106 --> 00:47.742
Thank you so much, for always bearing with me.

00:50.465 --> 00:52.109
It's nothing at all to me.

00:53.518 --> 00:54.804
I wish you the best of luck.

00:57.852 --> 01:01.343
Please remember I am always your friend.

01:08.516 --> 01:10.125
Yeah, friend.

01:13.230 --> 01:16.687
I'm sure you will find someone better than me.

01:21.305 --> 01:24.426
Don't regret later, though.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.159
- Thank you very much. - Good luck, Amy.

01:42.558 --> 01:45.421
I hope we will meet again somehow.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.291
You too, Tay.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.872
Love you.

01:57.839 --> 02:00.917
Well, I'll get going now.

02:01.503 --> 02:04.550
Uh, Amy, before you leave,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.753
I think there is another thing you need to do.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.910
You are here in time, chef Poon.

02:21.238 --> 02:22.628
What are you planning, Tay?

02:23.286 --> 02:24.286
Well,

02:25.981 --> 02:29.675
since you have decided to be friends with Tian,

02:31.700 --> 02:34.229
​​I think you owe Poon an apology.

02:44.034 --> 02:47.340
Fine, I'm sorry for not being nice to you earlier.

02:48.910 --> 02:49.910
Well,

02:50.760 --> 02:52.089
I'm sorry too.

03:03.470 --> 03:05.970
What is that pleasant smell?

03:06.390 --> 03:09.383
Oh, it comes from Deep Fried chicken with Honey Sauce,

03:09.909 --> 03:13.151
Spicy Curry Soup with Fish and Termite Mushroom,

03:13.620 --> 03:16.995
and Stir-Fried Beef with chilli.

03:17.050 --> 03:19.442
- What about this one? - Sweet corn fritters.

03:21.191 --> 03:22.691
Steamed Seafood in Curry Paste.

03:24.351 --> 03:27.198
You haven't actually tried chef Poon's food, have you?

03:28.073 --> 03:29.373
No, I haven't.

03:29.864 --> 03:31.410
- Well then, let's eat. - Please.

03:32.220 --> 03:35.080
- Have a seat, Amy. - Thank you.

03:39.244 --> 03:40.846
Amy, I must say

03:41.729 --> 03:45.584
Chef Poon's Deep Fried Chicken is very delicious.

03:46.258 --> 03:48.858
- Here, try it, - Thank you.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.199
Oh, yeah, this one too.

03:51.891 --> 03:53.573
The Stir-Fried Beef with Chilli.

03:55.962 --> 03:58.521
Our restaurant's been packed with customers from the first week.

03:59.111 --> 04:00.295
That's superb, Teng.

04:01.111 --> 04:02.814
You should tell Mayom so

04:03.432 --> 04:05.881
because they come back for his Star Gooseberry Chilli Paste.

04:11.615 --> 04:15.365
Thank you very much, Mayom. If it weren't for you,

04:17.627 --> 04:19.998
Teng and I probably wouldn't have come this far.

04:22.070 --> 04:23.310
My pleasure.

04:24.461 --> 04:27.287
Since I have decided to help out, I have to do my best.

04:28.276 --> 04:29.276
Hey, Tan!

04:30.857 --> 04:31.951
We come to support you,

04:32.706 --> 04:33.706
and congratulations.

04:34.002 --> 04:37.045
You should have told me that you would be in

04:37.440 --> 04:40.270
- so I could reserve a table for you. - It's a suprise.

04:41.127 --> 04:44.967
Hello, Teng Nueng. I'm a big fan of your show, Eat With Teng,

04:45.266 --> 04:46.803
and I'm delighted to meet you here.

04:47.891 --> 04:48.891
Thank you very much.

04:49.152 --> 04:51.928
Hey, how come you didn't mention

04:52.129 --> 04:54.676
- that your partnership is Teng Nueng? - Yeah.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.490
- You should have introduced him to us. - Right.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.599
He is pretty busy, and I don't want to bother him.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.662
You can stay and talk to your friends while I'm preparing things back there.

05:25.935 --> 05:28.630
- Bill, please. - Sure.

05:28.641 --> 05:31.697
Oh, right now, we offer a 10% discount

05:31.708 --> 05:35.655
for customers who take photos and tag our restaurant too.

05:36.218 --> 05:37.418
Sound good, eh?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.050
- Thank you. - Thank you too.

07:10.152 --> 07:12.784
Chef Mayom, my friend wants to work here on Saturdays.

07:12.856 --> 07:15.274
- Is it possible? - Sure, I'll talk to Teng Nueng.

07:23.329 --> 07:24.923
Won't Teng Nueng be in today?

07:26.570 --> 07:27.570
No.

07:28.950 --> 07:29.950
Well,

07:30.161 --> 07:34.176
it just so happen that he has meetings with the sponsors of his show.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.200
Why do you ask anyway?

07:37.633 --> 07:41.650
One of the kitchen staff just told me her friend wants to work on Saturdays.

07:42.390 --> 07:44.070
And I'm looking for more staff,

07:45.725 --> 07:47.562
as we have more customers coming in.

07:49.662 --> 07:50.844
I'll tell Teng for you.

08:07.374 --> 08:08.727
This way, mom.

08:13.872 --> 08:14.872
Alright.

08:21.671 --> 08:24.971
One Fried Mackerel with Shrimp Paste Sauce.

08:26.292 --> 08:28.481
Make it less spicy, and add extra side dishes.

08:29.190 --> 08:31.690
Okay, I'll make it for you.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.554
By the way,

08:34.115 --> 08:37.246
why don't you invite your parents in when Teng Nueng is around?

08:39.327 --> 08:41.267
It isn't your business anyway.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.364
He gave you another chance in the hope that you would make it better.

08:45.059 --> 08:46.815
Yet, you remain unchanged.

08:48.038 --> 08:52.450
Look, You better not stick your nose into our business.

08:53.215 --> 08:55.895
An outsider like you will never understand.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.106
He only wants you to take him as he is.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.207
If you can't do so, you should back off.

09:04.890 --> 09:07.095
And let the person who is ready

09:07.376 --> 09:09.267
and able to do take him.

09:15.704 --> 09:16.704
Mayom.

09:18.336 --> 09:20.706
Don't forget that you are just a chef here,

09:22.225 --> 09:24.420
and you have to focus only on your job.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.462
Taking care of Teng Nueng

09:28.638 --> 09:30.038
is my job, not yours.

09:31.036 --> 09:32.536
Do not cross the line.

09:33.861 --> 09:37.006
Is it ready, the Mackerel with Shrimp Paste I ordered?

10:15.049 --> 10:17.710
I have never understood what I am to you.

10:26.649 --> 10:29.659
Finally, you are back.
I have been waiting for you.

10:30.465 --> 10:32.238
Is there anything urgent?

10:35.660 --> 10:38.850
Today's sale is excellent and
is better than every day,

10:39.667 --> 10:43.157
especially the menu you have set up.

10:50.251 --> 10:52.815
Are you tired? Sit down first.

10:53.853 --> 10:57.020
I know you work very hard.

10:58.284 --> 11:02.612
Thank you for dedicating yourself
to our future.

11:07.174 --> 11:08.174
Come, sit down.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.670
One of our customers forgot it,
so I kept it for now.

11:24.278 --> 11:29.206
Have you ever heard of the phrase
about a book's ending

11:31.049 --> 11:32.892
that will never change,

11:35.426 --> 11:37.163
no matter how many times you read it?

11:39.402 --> 11:40.902
It sounds like our relationship.

11:44.925 --> 11:47.498
We have talked this through,
haven't we?

11:50.064 --> 11:51.855
We can always reconcile

11:54.783 --> 11:56.316
because I have been trying
to live with it,

11:59.462 --> 12:02.058
but I have never understood
what I am to you.

12:05.484 --> 12:07.494
I don't know any of your friends

12:08.972 --> 12:11.058
and never get to meet your parents.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.742
I already told you

12:19.854 --> 12:24.261
that making people understand
our relationship isn't easy,

12:26.811 --> 12:28.311
and I need more time.

12:33.665 --> 12:37.027
Isn't five years long enough?

12:44.726 --> 12:46.715
What did your parents say today?

12:49.924 --> 12:51.678
Did they like the food?

12:53.320 --> 12:54.765
Did they like our restaurant?

12:56.594 --> 12:57.940
How did you know?

13:02.071 --> 13:05.201
It isn't wrong to invite them
to our restaurant.

13:16.119 --> 13:18.501
But can you not pretend I don't exist?

13:20.820 --> 13:24.309
We have been together for five years,

13:26.443 --> 13:28.501
yet I don't get to be beside you.

13:37.259 --> 13:38.278
I'm sorry.

13:39.726 --> 13:41.256
Let's start it over again.

13:43.418 --> 13:46.968
No, Tan. I can't take it anymore.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.088
I'm tired.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.373
Don't you love me anymore?

14:10.258 --> 14:11.968
Is it because of that Mayom guy?

14:15.826 --> 14:17.463
There is nothing to do with him.

14:18.812 --> 14:20.785
We have to break up eventually.

14:23.009 --> 14:26.929
Admit it, things aren't working out
between us,

14:27.988 --> 14:29.196
and it isn't because of anyone else.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.035
Didn't you say to give me a chance?

14:59.088 --> 15:01.248
I have given you many chances,

15:03.156 --> 15:04.806
but you screwed them up every time.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.915
Thank you for everything.

15:15.378 --> 15:16.378
But I think...

15:18.373 --> 15:19.719
it's time to call it quits.

16:20.968 --> 16:24.403
Hey, we almost run out of vegetables.
Has anyone ordered them yet?

16:24.974 --> 16:27.610
It was Mayom's job,
but I don't know who's in charge now.

16:31.763 --> 16:34.382
Why is the floor still sticky?
Who cleaned it?

16:34.471 --> 16:38.071
Whoever did it a sloppy job like this
would be in trouble

16:38.206 --> 16:39.706
if Mayom were here.

16:41.354 --> 16:43.709
And why is it so dirty?

16:43.876 --> 16:46.571
What will we do if customers
get diarrhea from food?

16:46.913 --> 16:49.903
The cleaning is always perfunctory
when there is no one in charge.

16:49.950 --> 16:52.336
I have to report about this.

16:54.404 --> 16:57.079
Hey, we almost run out of meats too.

16:57.090 --> 16:59.100
Go check the inventory first!

16:59.231 --> 17:02.495
So can you tell me now who's in charge
of ordering ingredients?

17:02.506 --> 17:06.351
That's right.
Who is the responsible person anyway?

17:08.484 --> 17:09.484
It's you, Ping.

17:10.201 --> 17:11.201
It's you, Pong.

17:11.325 --> 17:12.325
No, it's Pan.

17:12.822 --> 17:14.018
It's you alone.

17:14.029 --> 17:17.363
This isn't good.
Someone has to take charge,

17:17.374 --> 17:18.992
or everything remains messy.

17:21.215 --> 17:22.215
We aew in trouble!

17:22.946 --> 17:25.288
A customer is suffering from
food poisoning now.

17:26.728 --> 17:29.364
- I knew it!
- I'm doomed.

17:29.375 --> 17:30.875
- Let's go check out!
- Let's go.

17:33.605 --> 17:36.992
What if it gets worse?
How are you going to be responsible?

17:38.214 --> 17:43.032
I do apologize for what happened
to your wife.

17:43.486 --> 17:46.736
- I will look into it personally.
- Doomed. We are doomed.

17:46.916 --> 17:50.509
If Mr. Athip handles the case himself,
we are canned for sure.

17:50.543 --> 17:52.373
Are we really going to be fired?

17:52.884 --> 17:56.035
And we probably have to pay
for compensation too.

17:56.046 --> 17:59.034
Where will we get that much money from?

18:00.056 --> 18:02.495
Now, how can I get rid of the bad luck?

18:04.927 --> 18:08.741
Don't worry, everyone,
I know what to do.

18:19.844 --> 18:21.904
According to the hotel's policies,

18:22.869 --> 18:25.524
I have to record the investigation
as evidence.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.573
First of all,

18:28.432 --> 18:30.565
five consecutive food poisoning cases
occurred

18:32.049 --> 18:35.005
in Thai restaurant
within just half a month.

18:36.265 --> 18:37.854
After I looked into it,

18:38.213 --> 18:40.513
I found that kitchen hygiene
is substandard.

18:40.857 --> 18:45.166
the delay in purchasing is due to
mismanagement of remaining stocks

18:45.352 --> 18:48.003
even though the Thai restaurant
has increased sales.

18:48.855 --> 18:49.855
Regarding the matters,

18:50.656 --> 18:52.656
what is your explanation?

18:58.082 --> 19:01.182
It's all because I neglected my duties.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.608
- Poon.
- Poon, you didn't...

19:06.855 --> 19:11.066
Are you admitting it was your fault,
chef Poon?

19:12.197 --> 19:13.197
Yes, I am.

19:13.501 --> 19:15.238
It's all my fault.

19:16.838 --> 19:21.125
I couldn't fulfil my obligations,
and there's nothing to do with others.

19:25.161 --> 19:29.006
So you are going to be responsible
for all the mistakes?

19:29.873 --> 19:31.073
Yes, sir.

19:35.646 --> 19:40.230
So I'll take it as a first-time fault
for which the punishment is

19:44.197 --> 19:47.515
a month of suspension without pay.

19:48.632 --> 19:50.411
Do you have any objection?

19:52.611 --> 19:53.611
No, I don't.

19:56.964 --> 19:58.549
During the suspension,

19:58.748 --> 20:02.751
chef Ping will be responsible for
kitchen hygiene,

20:03.503 --> 20:06.955
and chef Pan will be responsible for
stock checking.

20:07.276 --> 20:10.311
As for chef Pong, you are to
coordinate with the procurement team.

20:11.130 --> 20:15.602
These are your responsibilities
until I can find the new head chef.

20:18.682 --> 20:20.202
Now, the investigation is over.

20:21.949 --> 20:22.949
Everyone can leave

20:28.734 --> 20:29.934
but chef Poon.

20:46.694 --> 20:48.111
Why the hell did you do that?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.393
I should be the one asking,
what more do you want from me?

20:52.923 --> 20:56.323
You ordered a suspension,
and now I'm leaving.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.427
Why did you take all the blame?

20:59.346 --> 21:00.546
You think I didn't know?

21:02.328 --> 21:03.576
What I detest most

21:05.126 --> 21:07.086
is deception.

21:08.064 --> 21:11.344
Okay, I already did it.
Do you have any problems now?

21:11.537 --> 21:14.936
Of course, I have.
You conspired with everyone, right?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.717
Taking all the blame, thinking that
I would diminish the punishment.

21:21.344 --> 21:22.984
Do not accuse me like this.

21:24.248 --> 21:25.248
The reason you risk it

21:26.277 --> 21:28.841
is you know I have feelings for you.

21:32.422 --> 21:34.522
Poon, you really disappointed me.

21:40.478 --> 21:43.592
Don't disdain me for taking advantage
of your feelings

21:44.430 --> 21:46.012
because I didn't.

21:46.510 --> 21:47.560
Are you sure?

21:48.271 --> 21:50.386
Because your actions indicated so.

21:51.405 --> 21:55.470
If it were someone else who confessed,
they would be fired.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.054
Fired?

21:59.748 --> 22:00.748
Go ahead!

22:02.136 --> 22:03.136
Fire me!

22:14.737 --> 22:17.484
Where are you going?
I'm not done talking to you.

22:22.619 --> 22:24.038
But I'm done with you.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.644
Poon!  Poon!

22:41.002 --> 22:43.132
Hey, Ping. Poon is back.

22:50.718 --> 22:53.899
You didn't have to take the blame
for all of us.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.117
We could share the punishment.

22:56.384 --> 22:59.959
That's right, Poon. And now
you are the only one getting punished.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.267
I'm going to tell him the truth.

23:06.278 --> 23:09.168
Pong, don't do that.

23:15.055 --> 23:16.334
Come on, everyone.

23:17.321 --> 23:20.360
It's just one month,
and I'll be returning.

23:21.217 --> 23:23.975
How are you going to make a living
for this month?

23:25.185 --> 23:28.408
Don't worry.
I still have my Papaya Salad stall.

23:29.147 --> 23:30.447
I can make money from it.

24:12.861 --> 24:13.861
Mr. Athip,

24:14.557 --> 24:17.885
chef poon is leaving now.

24:20.123 --> 24:22.980
So what? Do I have to see him off too?

24:24.122 --> 24:26.412
Are you sure to let him go like this?

24:29.925 --> 24:32.025
- You can leave now.
- Alright.

24:51.893 --> 24:55.754
I'm sorry I didn't delegate jobs
to you guys before leaving.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.857
Nah, it's okay. Forget it.

25:00.652 --> 25:01.772
Speaking of which,

25:03.601 --> 25:05.201
you are suffering too, aren't you?

25:06.493 --> 25:08.417
You have to see them together
every day.

25:10.818 --> 25:12.809
Can you really endure that?

25:15.621 --> 25:19.338
I don't know if I can endure it.

25:20.391 --> 25:21.695
Well, you don't have to.

25:23.361 --> 25:25.252
Just come back and be a chef
at the hotel.

25:25.681 --> 25:26.681
I can't.

25:28.131 --> 25:29.131
Because...

25:30.216 --> 25:31.603
I'm still worried about him.

25:34.510 --> 25:35.910
I feel you, man.

25:38.615 --> 25:40.015
You understand it, right?

25:40.953 --> 25:44.533
Sometimes I really want to get over him
and leave,

25:46.675 --> 25:48.265
but I just can't do so.

25:50.697 --> 25:51.697
Poon!

25:55.021 --> 25:56.320
Do you feel better now?

25:57.085 --> 26:01.884
Relax. You will be with Athip again
before you even know it.

26:05.807 --> 26:09.994
Listen to your brother.
He sounds like a relationship expert.

26:11.536 --> 26:16.345
Oh, please don't tell me
you have started hitting on Baifern.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.920
Have you?

26:19.862 --> 26:24.412
I can't even take care of myself
these days.

26:25.434 --> 26:27.574
How can I take care of others?

26:47.724 --> 26:51.111
He got a job offer as a chef
elsewhere already.

26:58.948 --> 27:02.421
Kao, leave now, or you will be late.

27:02.896 --> 27:04.762
There is only one exam left,

27:04.793 --> 27:07.885
and the professor will announce
internship places for everyone.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.132
I hope it will be in Bangkok.

27:11.916 --> 27:12.916
Well,

27:13.151 --> 27:16.307
I can go upcountry.
It sounds fun anyway.

27:19.217 --> 27:21.917
- I'll be leaving then. See you.
- Okay, see you.

27:22.084 --> 27:23.484
Have a good day.

27:26.971 --> 27:28.871
Eh, you are...

27:30.450 --> 27:31.450
I'm Pipob.

27:31.980 --> 27:35.364
We met at What Zabb Man
cooking competition.

27:35.861 --> 27:36.861
I remember you.

27:38.311 --> 27:41.805
I heard that you have reopened
your Papaya Salad stall.

27:42.970 --> 27:45.551
- It was just a few days ago.
- Word of mouth

27:45.863 --> 27:47.582
always helps promote delicious food.

27:48.849 --> 27:51.539
I'm really sorry that I disdained
your food earlier.

27:53.663 --> 27:55.391
I'll cut to the chase.

27:56.220 --> 27:59.726
You mentioned selling Papaya Salad
in my restaurant.

28:00.581 --> 28:02.851
- Are you still interested in doing so?
- Of course.

28:08.736 --> 28:10.036
Uh...

28:11.725 --> 28:13.579
Shall we refer to the original offers?

28:13.645 --> 28:17.545
Our wage can be deducted from the rent,
or calculated from total sales volume.

28:17.651 --> 28:19.481
I don't mind the daily flat fee too,

28:19.492 --> 28:23.402
- or maybe...
- Kao, off you go.

28:23.746 --> 28:26.706
- No, Poon. I have to...
- Go. I'll handle it myself.

28:27.107 --> 28:28.407
Go, now.

28:29.752 --> 28:31.458
- Go.
- Alright, see you then.

28:34.164 --> 28:37.354
What makes you come out of nowhere
and ask me to join you?

28:37.963 --> 28:40.695
Let's think about this,

28:41.449 --> 28:43.261
we are selling food in the same area

28:43.610 --> 28:47.212
so instead of competing,
wouldn't it be better to join forces?

28:48.609 --> 28:50.103
What do you say if we are to try

28:52.376 --> 28:53.251
for a month, maybe?

29:02.846 --> 29:04.946
- I'm in.
- Great.

29:05.373 --> 29:07.399
I hope our cooperation

29:08.288 --> 29:10.458
- is going well.
- I hope so too.

29:22.905 --> 29:25.830
Mr. Athip, the chefs want to
make a confession, no,

29:25.909 --> 29:27.965
they want to see you.

29:37.191 --> 29:40.387
So what actually happened?
Be honest with me.

29:48.051 --> 29:49.570
Here's the thing, boss.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.624
- And that's about it.
- That's right.

30:07.929 --> 30:11.604
So you guys didn't plan
to make Poon take all the blame.

30:12.258 --> 30:14.878
- Pong will suffer from diarrhea
- Eh?

30:14.889 --> 30:15.889
if I lie to you.

30:17.847 --> 30:21.733
On the honour of the boy scouts,
if I lie to you,

30:21.881 --> 30:24.273
- Pan will die from constipation.
- Hey!

30:24.321 --> 30:26.391
It means we are telling you the truth.

30:26.561 --> 30:30.351
Poon only wanted to help us,
but we think it's better this way.

30:33.061 --> 30:34.061
I thought that...

30:43.427 --> 30:44.627
- Kao.
- Jesus!

30:46.761 --> 30:49.573
Mr. Athip! You frightened me!

30:50.084 --> 30:51.448
I thought you were a thief.

30:52.845 --> 30:54.145
I'm here to see Poon.

30:57.744 --> 30:59.272
He isn't here, though.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.100
So where is he?

31:04.607 --> 31:05.607
Poon!

31:06.279 --> 31:07.919
- Poon!
- Uh, Mr. Athip.

31:08.179 --> 31:09.579
Please relax uh,

31:09.894 --> 31:11.739
you probably know that

31:12.511 --> 31:15.919
he already got a job offer as a chef.

31:44.423 --> 31:45.860
Are you looking for a toilet?

31:46.180 --> 31:48.317
Well, you have to take the left turn
back there.

31:48.890 --> 31:50.584
Hey, what are you doing here?

31:51.129 --> 31:54.020
- Come with me now.
- Let go off me.

31:54.586 --> 31:55.586
Hey.

31:55.967 --> 31:58.952
I don't know who you are
and what problems you have with Poon,

31:59.699 --> 32:01.745
but you can't do this to him.

32:04.484 --> 32:06.412
Tell him about us,

32:06.970 --> 32:08.270
or I'll do it myself.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.739
Go ahead because I don't even know
what we are.

32:16.777 --> 32:20.839
- He is my boyfriend. Now, step aside.
- Eh? What?

32:25.118 --> 32:28.165
- Hey!
- Uh, I'm sorry, chef.

32:28.885 --> 32:31.453
I will explain everything later.

32:31.664 --> 32:32.864
I'm really sorry.

32:34.362 --> 32:35.362
Hey!

32:44.939 --> 32:46.239
What's wrong with you?

32:46.920 --> 32:49.118
You chased me away,
and now you want me back?

32:50.340 --> 32:52.013
You did this every time we fight.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.172
Can I ask why?

32:54.847 --> 32:57.407
- What did I do?
- Looking for and new job,

32:58.387 --> 33:00.007
and running away from me.

33:00.931 --> 33:03.746
Last time, you alomost left me
to work for Teng Nueng.

33:05.641 --> 33:07.361
I didn't. It's all in your head.

33:08.725 --> 33:11.673
Have you ever thought of asking me
the reason?

33:12.501 --> 33:15.591
What I saw back there was clear enough.

33:16.934 --> 33:18.227
You are just afraid

33:19.911 --> 33:21.766
I will actually get
a job offer elsewhere.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.839
No,

33:33.139 --> 33:34.439
I'm possessive about you.

33:48.538 --> 33:50.313
I want all of your love and attention.

33:57.495 --> 33:58.795
You asked me

34:00.300 --> 34:01.729
to believe in you.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.643
But you just never believe in me.

34:09.357 --> 34:12.596
You know I have to make a living,
yet you have suspended me from work.

34:14.207 --> 34:17.729
So I have no choice for my own life
but to obey you?

34:19.793 --> 34:21.159
What am I to you, actually?

34:25.511 --> 34:26.711
Poon.

34:28.621 --> 34:29.823
It's my bad.

34:35.711 --> 34:37.384
Please let me live my life.

34:45.069 --> 34:47.334
I can't be with you anymore

34:50.610 --> 34:52.668
if you think I'm meddling
with your life.

35:39.504 --> 35:40.804
Chef Pipob.

35:43.332 --> 35:46.837
I'm really sorry
for what happened yesterday.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.964
So I come here to resign.

35:54.617 --> 35:55.617
Why, Poon?

35:56.349 --> 35:58.376
I sincerely regret
that you will resign,

35:59.313 --> 36:00.903
we just have been working together.

36:02.238 --> 36:04.137
Even though it was a few days,

36:04.897 --> 36:07.692
I have learned a lot from you.

36:08.360 --> 36:12.622
I decided to resign
because I don't want to cause you

36:13.348 --> 36:14.764
any more trouble.

36:18.459 --> 36:19.709
Since you have decided,

36:21.291 --> 36:23.058
I don't think I can hold you back.

36:26.557 --> 36:28.312
What are you going to do next?

36:29.935 --> 36:33.116
Maybe selling Papaya Salad as before.

36:34.273 --> 36:35.273
Okay.

36:40.268 --> 36:41.268
This way please.

36:42.317 --> 36:45.048
- All right.
- Walk carefully.

36:45.261 --> 36:46.461
Okay.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.926
- Umm
- Uh, Poon.

36:51.483 --> 36:54.633
Juang wants to eat Papaya Salad,
but we haven't set up the stall.

36:54.716 --> 36:57.272
So I invite her to wait here.

36:58.161 --> 37:02.072
I really want to eat your Papaya Salad.

37:02.153 --> 37:06.237
Can you make me one with salted crab,
fermented fish, and vermicelli?

37:06.360 --> 37:09.146
Sure, I'll make it super spicy

37:09.287 --> 37:10.707
- as you prefer.
- Excellent!

37:10.718 --> 37:14.048
By the way, can you deduct
the papaya salad cost from the rent?

37:14.059 --> 37:16.059
Eh, what are you talking about?

37:16.488 --> 37:17.788
Nonsense.

37:18.162 --> 37:21.157
See? This place is in a golden location

37:21.168 --> 37:23.700
and bustling with people.

37:23.927 --> 37:26.476
Of course, they come here for
Poon's Papaya Salad.

37:26.839 --> 37:29.499
The area would be like a ghost town
if it weren't for him.

37:30.205 --> 37:33.345
His Papaya Salad has nothing to do
with it.

37:33.549 --> 37:34.909
You always talk nonsense.

37:35.619 --> 37:38.049
Let's have a look on the second floor.

37:38.229 --> 37:40.172
- Yeah, feel free to.
- I must say,

37:40.296 --> 37:42.339
the structure is still
in good condition.

37:42.519 --> 37:47.125
It's very spacious.
You can even use it as a warehouse.

37:47.149 --> 37:49.837
Come on, I'll show you.

37:56.397 --> 38:00.181
Poon, it doesn't feel right seeing her

38:01.317 --> 38:02.982
show the guy around like this.

38:04.419 --> 38:05.419
I'm sure,

38:06.239 --> 38:07.739
you are overthinking.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.476
There is nothing to worry about.

38:10.815 --> 38:14.825
Besides, we have been renting the house
for a long time.

38:14.957 --> 38:17.517
But we also didn't pay her
the total rent on time.

38:17.953 --> 38:22.166
I'm sure a stingy like her
wouldn't want tenants like us.

38:22.606 --> 38:25.426
Come on, don't worry too much.

38:40.047 --> 38:42.367
Your partner hasn't shown up again?

38:42.687 --> 38:45.967
If he doesn't care for the restaurant,
at least he should care about you.

38:47.876 --> 38:51.500
You may get sick from overworking
every day.

38:56.379 --> 38:57.951
Tankhun, he...

38:58.863 --> 39:02.063
- probably won't be in anymore.
- Again?

39:03.060 --> 39:04.687
He hurted you again, right?

39:05.427 --> 39:07.493
- No.
- I'll teach him a lesson.

39:07.596 --> 39:10.536
How dare he play with
people's feelings?

39:10.605 --> 39:13.655
Mayom, calm down.

39:13.911 --> 39:15.411
Can you please listen to me?

39:16.716 --> 39:19.906
Quit putting up with him, I beg you.

39:24.307 --> 39:26.567
- I quit.
- Good.

39:26.677 --> 39:29.150
Eh? What?

39:31.175 --> 39:32.655
I broke up with him.

39:34.953 --> 39:36.353
I really did.

39:39.161 --> 39:40.281
Teng.

39:41.742 --> 39:43.452
I won't break up with you.

39:44.524 --> 39:48.531
I will do anything
to bring us back together.

39:50.994 --> 39:55.624
And I will make sure
you never be able to do that.

40:10.899 --> 40:13.359
I intend to stop renting out the house.

40:20.763 --> 40:22.630
Jesus, Juan!

40:23.017 --> 40:24.772
You frightened me coming in like this.

40:25.712 --> 40:28.905
Well, I want to talk to you.

40:29.184 --> 40:32.634
What is it? The rent isn't due, is it?

40:32.827 --> 40:36.376
Here's the thing, someone wants to open a minimart,

40:36.494 --> 40:38.247
And after I checked the entire area,

40:38.402 --> 40:43.085
there is no other suitable place than this house.

40:43.865 --> 40:46.485
- What do you mean? - Hey, Poon.

40:47.205 --> 40:49.622
Have you got what you need? Customers are waiting.

40:50.701 --> 40:53.499
Okay, I will get straight to the point.

40:54.164 --> 40:56.220
I intend to stop renting out the house,

40:56.984 --> 40:59.384
so I will give you, uh,

40:59.940 --> 41:02.863
ten days to move out.

41:03.020 --> 41:06.620
I will offer a 30 per cent discount on this month's rent too.

41:07.031 --> 41:10.893
Wait, you can't just kick us out like this.

41:11.046 --> 41:15.425
We don't have any place to stay, not to mention the Papaya Salad stall.

41:17.526 --> 41:21.379
You know what? That's your problem.

41:21.593 --> 41:26.843
I have already sold the house and received the payment.

41:26.876 --> 41:31.332
Most importantly, you have never paid the rent on time.

41:32.071 --> 41:33.896
And that annoys me, so goodbye.

41:34.035 --> 41:37.189
Wait, where are you going? Don't leave just yet.

41:37.214 --> 41:39.801
Tell me what's going on?

41:40.028 --> 41:41.508
Juan!

41:43.052 --> 41:45.781
This is bad. She really did it.

41:46.875 --> 41:50.125
What should we do? We only have ten days

41:50.511 --> 41:52.451
before becoming homeless.

41:53.965 --> 41:55.165
I can't think of anything.

41:59.670 --> 42:02.940
Hey, Poon. Poon. Hey, hey, hey, give it to me.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
I'll hold it for you.

42:05.630 --> 42:07.609
Are you alright? Have a seat first.

42:08.368 --> 42:10.236
Slowly, brother. Now, sit down.

42:12.315 --> 42:14.315
I believe there must be a way out.

42:15.569 --> 42:19.729
Or we should find a new rental house.

42:20.513 --> 42:24.217
But we need a lot of money to pay for both the rent and deposit

42:24.885 --> 42:26.505
of the new rental house.

42:27.074 --> 42:30.096
I will soon have to leave for an internship upcountry

42:30.241 --> 42:31.991
so there is no one around to help you.

42:32.890 --> 42:34.787
You don't have to worry about that.

42:35.918 --> 42:37.561
I can stay at my friend's place.

42:38.526 --> 42:42.196
How about asking chef Pipob to see

42:42.307 --> 42:43.256
if he can help you?

42:46.054 --> 42:50.247
Maybe you can ask Athip to shorten your suspension period.

42:53.067 --> 42:54.067
Kao,

42:54.977 --> 42:57.877
I don't like to depend on anyone.

42:58.470 --> 43:01.852
Come on, Poon. According to our situation right now,

43:03.419 --> 43:05.009
we don't have much choice.

44:04.854 --> 44:06.643
Chef Poon is here asking to see you.

44:15.313 --> 44:19.553
Make him wait and tell him I'm in the meeting.

44:20.427 --> 44:21.627
Are you sure?

44:22.740 --> 44:26.950
The session will last until evening, how about a quick break of 15 minutes?

44:28.458 --> 44:30.228
Do I look irresponsible?

44:31.961 --> 44:34.563
If he can't wait, tell him to come back another day.

44:40.688 --> 44:42.397
Please let me live my life.

44:44.278 --> 44:46.388
I can't be with you anymore

44:49.213 --> 44:51.069
if you think I'm meddling with your life.

44:54.232 --> 44:57.645
Would you like to compare prices from other suppliers first?

44:59.653 --> 45:00.853
Mr. Athip?

45:02.063 --> 45:03.920
Oh, sorry.

45:04.855 --> 45:07.583
Can you say it again? I can't catch that.

45:33.102 --> 45:35.587
I will inform him that you are still waiting.

45:36.119 --> 45:37.319
Oh, don't bother.

45:37.923 --> 45:42.253
Can you pass this to him for me?

45:42.463 --> 45:43.863
Sure.

46:11.706 --> 46:13.006
Thank you.

46:13.836 --> 46:16.091
I hope we can meet again.

46:16.281 --> 46:20.341
Eh? Why does it sounds like a goodbye?

46:20.670 --> 46:23.850
Don't you want to say hi to the other chefs?

46:25.165 --> 46:27.045
Maybe next time.

46:28.338 --> 46:31.247
- I will pay you guys a visit later. - Alright.

47:08.210 --> 47:11.021
- Where is Poon? - He has left a moment ago.

47:11.189 --> 47:12.899
He had been waiting for four hours.

47:13.123 --> 47:15.937
Right, he left something for you too.

47:26.664 --> 47:29.597
(Resignation Letter)

47:30.561 --> 47:31.861
How long since he had left?

47:32.138 --> 47:35.215
Just only 10 minutes. Maybe you can catch him up.

48:59.644 --> 49:01.894
I'm looking for Poon. Is he here?

49:02.176 --> 49:04.726
How can you be sure that he wants to see you?

49:05.723 --> 49:07.676
He isn't ready for what you have to say.

49:07.687 --> 49:11.545
He won't listen to you even if you want to talk things through with him.

49:11.766 --> 49:15.069
So what should I do to make him open up to me?

49:15.723 --> 49:19.740
Tell me the truth. Since when that you cheat on me?

49:20.363 --> 49:22.127
I didn't have feelings for him.
